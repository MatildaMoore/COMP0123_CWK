TI Z2 Topological Order and Topological Protection of
   Majorana Fermion Qubits
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB The Kitaev chain model exhibits topological order that manifests as topological degeneracy, Majorana edge modes and Z(2) topological invariant of the bulk spectrum. This model can be obtained from a transverse field Ising model(TFIM) using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. TFIM has neither topological degeneracy nor any edge modes. Topological degeneracy associated with topological order is central to topological quantum computation. In this paper, we explore topological protection of the ground state manifold in the case of Majorana fermion models which exhibit Z(2) topological order. We show that there are at least two different ways to understand this topological protection of Majorana fermion qubits: one way is based on fermionic mode operators and the other is based on anti-commuting symmetry operators. We also show how these two different ways are related to each other. We provide a very general approach to understanding the topological protection of Majorana fermion qubits in the case of lattice Hamiltonians. We then show how in topological phases in Majorana fermion models gives rise to new braid group representations. So, we give a unifying and broad perspective of topological phases in Majorana fermion models based on anti-commuting symmetry operators and braid group representations of Majorana fermions as anyons.

TI Superselection-resolved entanglement in lattice gauge theories: a tensor
   network approach
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Lattice gauge theories (LGT) play a central role in modern physics, providing insights into high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum computation. Due to the nontrivial structure of the Hilbert space of LGT systems, entanglement in such systems is tricky to define. However, when one limits themselves to superselection-resolved entanglement, that is, entanglement corresponding to specific gauge symmetry sectors (commonly denoted as superselection sectors), this problem disappears, and the entanglement becomes well-defined. The study of superselection-resolved entanglement is interesting in LGT for an additional reason: when the gauge symmetry is strictly obeyed, superselection-resolved entanglement becomes the only distillable contribution to the entanglement. In our work, we study the behavior of superselection-resolved entanglement in LGT systems. We employ a tensor network construction for gauge-invariant systems as defined by Zohar and Burrello [1] and find that, in a vast range of cases, the leading term in superselection-resolved entanglement depends on the number of corners in the partition - corner-law entanglement. To our knowledge, this is the first case of such a corner-law being observed in any lattice system.

TI Quantum color image encryption using a novel 4D hyperchaotic Lorenz
   system and Fibonacci transform
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Satellite images are critical for ecological monitoring and national security; thus, protecting its integrity is imperative. Nonetheless, existing encryption methods struggle to balance robustness and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel quantum chaos-based image encryption scheme (QCIES) combining a 4D hyperchaotic Lorenz system (4D-HLS) and quantum Fibonacci transform (QFT) addressing these limitations. During the encryption process, we first used The Generalized Quantum Image Representation (GQIR) technique to transform a conventional color image into quantum data. Then, 4D-HLS generates complex, unpredictable keys through bifurcation and sensitivity to initial conditions. 4D-HLS complex dynamics coupled with quantum pixel reorganization provide unprecedented resistance against statistical and brute-force attacks. Additionally, QFT with a quantum adder randomly encrypts pixel locations, producing the final encrypted image. Performance evaluation was conducted using Python to analyze key metrics including histogram distribution, information entropy, and adjacent pixel correlation. Extensive security testing revealed QCIES robust performance, achieving near-ideal correlation coefficients (< 0.004), information entropy (> 7.999), NPCR (99.64%), UACI (33.56%) and massive key space 10(140) >> 2(128). The achieved 10(140) key space notably exceeds the 2(128) NIST standard, while maintaining computational efficiency through optimized quantum circuit design. These innovations establish a new benchmark for satellite image transmission in critical infrastructure applications.

TI State-Dependent Mobility Edge in Kinetically Constrained Models
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario the state-dependent mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and nonthermal eigenstates, the abundance of nonthermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for many initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor networks for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows polynomially in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows exponentially, making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many nonthermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor networks. The outreach of our findings encompasses quantum sampling problems and the efficient simulation of quantum circuits beyond Clifford families.

TI Dissipative phase transition: From qubits to qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the fate of dissipative phase transitions in quantum many-body systems when the individual constituents are qudits (d-level systems) instead of qubits. As an example system, we employ a permutation- invariant XY model of N infinite-range interacting d-level spins undergoing individual and collective dissipation. In the mean-field limit, we identify a dissipative phase transition, whose critical point is independent of d after a suitable rescaling of parameters. When the decay rates between all adjacent levels are identical and d 4, the critical point expands, in terms of the ratio between dissipation and interaction strengths, to a critical region in which two phases coexist and which increases as d grows. In addition, a larger d leads to a more pronounced change in spin expectation values at the critical point. Numerical investigations for finite N reveal symmetry-breaking signatures in the Liouvillian spectrum at the phase transition. The phase transition is furthermore marked by maximum entanglement negativity and a significant purity change of the steady state, which become more pronounced as d increases. Considering qudits instead of qubits thus opens new perspectives on accessing rich phase diagrams in open many-body systems.

TI Novel Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata-Based Gate Designs for Efficient
   Reversible Computing
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Reversible logic enables ultra-low power circuit design and quantum computation. Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is the most promising technology considered to implement reversible circuits, mainly due to the correspondence between features of reversible and QCA circuits. This work aims to push forward the state-of-the-art of the QCA-based reversible circuits implementation by proposing a novel QCA design of a reversible full adder\full subtractor (FA\FS). At first, we consider an efficient XOR-gate, and based on this, new QCA circuit layouts of Feynman, Toffoli, Peres, PQR, TR, RUG, URG, RQCA, and RQG are proposed. The efficient XOR gate significantly reduces the required clock phases and circuit area. As a result, all the proposed reversible circuits are efficient regarding cell count, delay, and circuit area. Finally, based on the presented reversible gates, a novel QCA design of a reversible full adder\full subtractor (FA\FS) is proposed. Compared to the state-of-the-art circuits, the proposed QCA design of FA\FS reversible circuit achieved up to 57% area savings, with 46% and 29% reduction in cell number and delay, respectively.

TI Bolometric detection of Josephson inductance in a highly resistive
   environment
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Josephson junction is a building block of quantum circuits. Its behavior, well understood when treated as an isolated entity, is strongly affected by coupling to an electromagnetic environment. In 1983, Schmid predicted that a Josephson junction shunted by a resistance exceeding the resistance quantum RQ = h/4e2 approximate to 6.45 k omega for Cooper pairs would become insulating since the phase fluctuations would destroy the coherent Josephson coupling. However, recent microwave measurements have questioned this interpretation. Here, we insert a small Josephson junction in a Johnson-Nyquist-type setup where it is driven by weak current noise arising from thermal fluctuations. Our heat probe minimally perturbs the junction's equilibrium, shedding light on features not visible in charge transport. We find that the Josephson critical current completely vanishes in DC charge transport measurement, and the junction demonstrates Coulomb blockade in agreement with the theory. Surprisingly, thermal transport measurements show that the Josephson junction acts as an inductor at high frequencies, unambiguously demonstrating that a supercurrent survives despite the Coulomb blockade observed in DC measurements.
   The predicted dissipative quantum phase transition in a Josephson junction coupled to resistive environment has been examined in recent experiments. In a heat transport experiment, Subero et al. show that the junction acts as an inductor at high frequencies, while DC charge transport confirms insulating behaviour.

TI Droplets of the Order Parameter in a Low Density Attracting Electron
   System in the Presence of a Strong Random Potential
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The properties of a two-dimensional low density (n MUCH LESS-THAN 1) electron system with strong onsite Hubbard attraction U > W (W is the bandwidth) in the presence of a strong random potential V uniformly distributed in the range from -V to +V are considered. Electronic hops only at neighboring sites on the square lattice are taken into account, thus W = 8t. The calculations were carried out for a lattice of 24 x 24 sites with periodic boundary conditions. In the framework of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach we observed an appearance of inhomogeneous states of spatially separated Fermi-Bose mixture of Cooper pairs and unpaired electrons with the formation of bosonic droplets of different size in the matrix of the unpaired normal states We observed a decrease in the droplet size (from larger droplets to individual bielectronic pairs) when we decrease the electron density at fixed values of the Hubbard attraction and random potential. The obtained results are important for the construction of the gross phase diagram and understanding of the nature of the phase transition between superconducting, normal metallic and localized states in quasi-2D (thin) film of a dirty metal. In a more practical sense it is interesting also for the experimental implementation of superconducting qubits on quantum circuits with high impedances in granular superconductors.

TI Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) that define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here, we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when increasing the number of qubits in a hydrogen chain shows that the subspace size required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes that cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum chemistry calculations.

TI Ultracompact Programmable Silicon Photonics Using Layers of Low-Loss
   Phase-Change Material Sb2Se3 of Increasing
   Thickness
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB High-performance programmable silicon photonic circuits are considered to be a critical part of next-generation architectures for optical processing, photonic quantum circuits, and neural networks. Low-loss optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a promising route toward nonvolatile free-form control of light. Here, we exploit the direct-write digital patterning of waveguides using layers of the PCM Sb2Se3 with thickness values from 20 to 100 nm, demonstrating the scaling of induced optical phase shift with thickness and the ability to strongly increase the effect per pixel for thicker layers. We exploit the excellent refractive index matching between Sb2Se3 and silicon to achieve a low-loss hybrid platform for programmable photonics. A 5-fold reduction in the modulation length of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is achieved with increasing thickness compared to the 20 nm thin-film Sb2Se3 devices, which decreased to 5 mu m in this work. Application of the thicker PCM layers in direct-write digital programming of a multimode interferometer shows a corresponding 3-fold reduction of the number of programmed pixels to below 10 pixels per device. The demonstrated scaling of performance with Sb2Se3 layer thickness is important for establishing the optimum working range for hybrid silicon-Sb2Se3 devices and holds promise for achieving ultracompact, programmable photonic circuits.

TI Disorder-free localization in continuous-time quantum walks: Role of
   symmetries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the phenomenon of disorder-free localization in quantum systems with global permutation symmetry. We use permutation group theory to systematically construct permutation-symmetric many-fermion Hamiltonians and interpret them as generators of continuous-time quantum walks. When the number of fermions is very large we find that all the canonical basis states localize at all times, without the introduction of any disorder coefficients. This time-independent localization is not the result of any emergent disorder, distinguishing it from existing mechanisms for disorder-free localization. Next we establish the conditions under which the localization is preserved. We find that interactions that preserve and break the global permutation symmetry sustain localization. Furthermore, the basis states of systems with reduced permutation symmetry localize even for a small number of fermions when the symmetry-reducing parameters are tuned accordingly. We show that similar localization also occurs for a permutation-symmetric Heisenberg spin chain and permutation-symmetric bosonic systems, implying that the localization is independent of the superselected symmetry. Finally, we make connections of the Hamiltonians studied here to the adjacency matrices of graphs and use this to propose a prescription for disorder-free localization in continuous-time quantum walk systems. Many of the models proposed here feature all-to-all connectivity and can be potentially realized on superconducting quantum circuits, trapped ion systems, and ultracold atoms.

TI Quantum time dynamics employing the Yang-Baxter equation for circuit
   compression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum time dynamics (QTD) is considered a promising problem for quantum supremacy on near-term quantum computers. However, QTD quantum circuits grow with increasing time simulations. This study focuses on simulating the time dynamics of one-dimensional (1D) integrable spin chains with nearest-neighbor interac-tions. We have proved the existence of a reflection symmetry in the quantum circuit employed for simulating the time evolution of certain classes of 1D Heisenberg model Hamiltonians by virtue of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and how this symmetry can be exploited to compress and produce a shallow quantum circuit. With this compression scheme, the depth of the quantum circuit becomes independent of step size and only depends on the number of spins. We show that the depth of the compressed circuit is rigorously a linear function of the system size for the studied Heisenberg model Hamiltonians in the present work. As a consequence, the number of CNOT gates in the compressed circuit only scales quadratically with the system size, which allows for the simulations of time dynamics of very large 1D spin chains. We derive the compressed circuit representations for different special cases of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We compare and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by performing simulations on quantum computers.

TI Structural optimization of lattice-matched
   Sc0.14Al0.86N/GaN superlattices for photonic
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB ScxAl1-xN is an emerging III-nitride material known for its high piezoelectric coefficient and ferroelectric properties. Integration of wide-bandgap ScxAl1-xN with GaN is particularly attractive for quantum photonic devices. Achieving low defect complex multilayers incorporating ScxAl1-xN, though, requires precise lattice-matching and carefully optimized growth parameters. This study systematically investigates the molecular-beam epitaxy of short-period ScxAl1-xN/GaN superlattices with total thicknesses of up to 600 nm on GaN templates. X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping confirmed lattice-matching at x = 0.14 +/- 0.01 Sc composition regardless of the thickness of GaN interlayers, as evidenced by symmetric superlattice satellites aligned in-plane with the underlying substrate peak. Superlattices with Sc compositions deviating from this lattice-matching condition exhibited strain-induced defects ranging from crack formation to partial relaxation. Scanning transmission electron microscopy investigation of the ScxAl1-xN/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor in setting the nitride composition variation and implicitly band structure profile along the growth direction. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy also revealed that Sc incorporation exhibits delays relative to Al at both onset and termination. Optimal growth conditions for superlattices with 6 nm ScxAl1-xN layers were observed at approximately 600 and 550 degrees C for structures with thick GaN layers (6 nm) and ultra-thin GaN layers (<= 2 nm), respectively.

TI Molecular dynamic simulation of structural stability of carbon and
   silicon composite nanowires
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In the field of electronic and computational technology, silicon nanowires (SiNWs), as one-dimensional semiconductor materials, possess superior and distinctive photovoltaic and electronic characteristics. Their application in microelectronic circuits has greatly facilitated the development of advanced fields, including aerospace and quantum computation. However, the stability of SiNWs decreases in a thermal environment, highlighting the enhancement of their thermal stability as a critical research focus. In this paper, structural models of SiNWs coated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of different sizes were constructed. The thermal stability of these composite nanowires during heating from 300 to 3000 K was investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The CNTs exhibited shell contraction and folding at temperatures above 500 K, which enhanced protection and induced the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. As a result, several isolated Si atoms reassembled into diamond clusters, thereby increasing the crystallization rate. The number of diamond clusters initially increased and then decreased with increasing temperature, and there is a significant peak in systems with a larger CNT folding diameter. The CNTs with the smallest diameter exhibit the highest stability at room temperature, while larger systems exhibit higher thermal stability due to the folding of CNTs. These findings contribute to the development of CNT-SiNW composites with optimal thermal stability.

TI Quantum advantage and stability to errors in analogue quantum simulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Several quantum hardware platforms, while being unable to perform fully fault-tolerant quantum computation, can still be operated as analogue quantum simulators for addressing many-body problems. However, due to the presence of errors, it is not clear to what extent those devices can provide us with an advantage with respect to classical computers. In this work, we make progress on this problem for noisy analogue quantum simulators computing physically relevant properties of many-body systems both in equilibrium and undergoing dynamics. We first formulate a system-size independent notion of stability against extensive errors, which we prove for Gaussian fermion models, as well as for a restricted class of spin systems. Remarkably, for the Gaussian fermion models, our analysis shows the stability of critical models which have long-range correlations. Furthermore, we analyze how this stability may lead to a quantum advantage, for the problem of computing the thermodynamic limit of many-body models, in the presence of a constant error rate and without any explicit error correction.
   Analogue quantum simulators have looser requirements than digital ones, but rigorous results on their usefulness in the noisy case are few. Here, the authors conclude that analogue quantum simulators are robust to errors and can provide superpolynomial to exponential quantum advantage when used to compute relevant many-body observables.

TI Radical pairs may play a role in microtubule reorganization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The exact mechanism behind general anesthesia remains an open question in neuroscience. It has been proposed that anesthetics selectively prevent consciousness and memory via acting on microtubules (MTs). It is known that the magnetic field modulates MT organization. A recent study shows that a radical pair model can explain the isotope effect in xenon-induced anesthesia and predicts magnetic field effects on anesthetic potency. Further, reactive oxygen species are also implicated in MT stability and anesthesia. Based on a simple radical pair mechanism model and a simple mathematical model of MT organization, we show that magnetic fields can modulate spin dynamics of naturally occurring radical pairs in MT. We propose that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the reaction cycle, which translates into a change in the MT density. We can reproduce magnetic field effects on the MT concentration that have been observed. Our model also predicts additional effects at slightly higher fields. Our model further predicts that the effect of zinc on the MT density exhibits isotopic dependence. The findings of this work make a connection between microtubule-based and radical pair-based quantum theories of consciousness.

TI Toward the nonequilibrium thermodynamic analog of complexity and the
   Jarzynski identity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The Jarzynski identity can describe small-scale nonequilibrium systems through stochastic thermodynamics. The identity considers fluctuating trajectories in a phase space. The complexity geometry frames the discussions on quantum computational complexity using the method of Riemannian geometry, which builds a bridge between optimal quantum circuits and classical geodesics in the space of unitary operators. Complexity geometry enables the application of the methods of classical physics to deal with pure quantum problems. By combining the two frameworks, i.e., the Jarzynski identity and complexity geometry, we derived a complexity analog of the Jarzynski identity using the complexity geometry. We considered a set of geodesics in the space of unitary operators instead of the trajectories in a phase space. The obtained complexity version of the Jarzynski identity strengthened the evidence for the existence of a well-defined resource theory of uncomplexity and presented an extensive discussion on the second law of complexity. Furthermore, analogous to the thermodynamic fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we proposed a version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the complexity. Although this study does not focus on holographic fluctuations, we found that the results are surprisingly suitable for capturing their information. The results obtained using nonequilibrium methods may contribute to understand the nature of the complexity and study the features of the holographic fluctuations.

TI Dynamical Magic Transitions in Monitored Clifford+T Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The classical simulation of highly entangling quantum dynamics is conjectured to be generically hard. Thus, recently discovered measurement-induced transitions between highly entangling and lowentanglement dynamics are phase transitions in classical simulability. Here, we study simulability transitions beyond entanglement: noting that some highly entangling dynamics (e.g., integrable systems or Clifford circuits) are easy to classically simulate, thus requiring "magic"-a subtle form of quantum resource-to achieve computational hardness, we ask how the dynamics of magic competes with measurements. We study the resulting "dynamical magic transitions" focusing on random monitored Clifford circuits doped by T gates (injecting magic). We identify dynamical "stabilizer purification"-the collapse of a superposition of stabilizer states by measurements-as the mechanism driving this transition. We find cases where transitions in magic and entanglement coincide, but also others with a magic and simulability transition in a highly (volume-law) entangled phase. In establishing our results, we use Pauli-based computation, a scheme distilling the quantum essence of the dynamics to a magic state register subject to mutually commuting measurements. We link stabilizer purification to "magic fragmentation" wherein these measurements separate into disjoint, O(1)-weight blocks, and relate this to the spread of magic in the original circuit becoming arrested.

TI Code switching revisited: Low-overhead magic state preparation using
   color codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a protocol to prepare a high-fidelity magic state on a two-dimensional (2D) color code using a three-dimensional (3D) color code. Our method modifies the known code-switching protocol with (1) a recently discovered transversal gate between the 2D and the 3D code and (2) a judicious use of flag-based postselection. We numerically demonstrate that these modifications lead to a significant improvement in the fidelity of the magic state. For instance, subjected to a uniform circuit-level noise of 10-3 (excluding idling noise), our code-switching protocol yields a magic state encoded in the distance-3 2D color code with a logical infidelity of 4.6 x 10-5 +/- 1.6 x 10-5 (quantified by an error-corrected logical state tomography) with an 84% of acceptance rate. Used in conjunction with a postselection approach, extrapolation from a polynomial fit suggests a fidelity improvement to 5.1 x 10-7for the same code. Our protocol is aimed for architectures that allow nonlocal connectivity and should be readily implementable in near-term devices. Finally, we also present a simulation technique akin to an extended stabilizer simulator which effectively incorporates the non-Clifford T gate, that permits to simulate the protocol without resorting to a resource intensive state-vector simulation.

TI Near-Infrared Active Metasurface for Dynamic Polarization Conversion
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Control of optical polarization is central to harnessing the properties of electromagnetic radiation for many applications, including 3D imaging and quantum computation. However, conventional optical polarizing components are typically bulky and static, that is, fixed in their degree of polarization control. Active metasurfaces have potential for versatile polarization control in a compact form factor by temporally modulating electromagnetic amplitudes and phase between orthogonal electric field components. Here, dynamic control of the polarization state of reflected light from an active metasurface is demonstrated. The metasurface uses indium tin oxide (ITO) as an active element in an array of aluminum nanoantennas operating in the telecom range. Applying an electrical bias between the ITO layer and the back reflector modulates the carrier concentration in ITO at the gate-dielectric/ITO interface, resulting in complex refractive index modulation in the epsilon-near-zero condition. This index modulation alters the degree of excitation of plasmonic modes corresponding to the orthogonal polarization components, leading to polarization modulation. By suitably biasing the metasurface, linearly polarized incident light can be converted to cross-polarized, circularly polarized or elliptically polarized light upon reflection. Dynamic control of the reflected polarization state has potentially wide applications in dynamic wave plates, spatial light modulators, and adaptive wavefront control.

TI A Streamlined Demonstration That Stabilizer Circuits Simulation Reduces
   to Boolean Linear Algebra
SO LOBACHEVSKII JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
AB Gottesman-Knill theorem states that computations on stabilizer circuits can be simulated on a classical computer, conventional simulation algorithms extensively use linear algebra over bit strings. For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations. This approach gives a new perspective on explaining the work of stabilizer tableau methods (reproducing the asymptotics) and creates opportunity for exploring various tensor-contraction techniques in stabilizer simulation.

TI Scalable Networking of Neutral-Atom Qubits: Nanofiber-Based Approach for
   Multiprocessor Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Neutral atoms are among the leading platforms toward realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). However, scaling up a single neutral-atom device beyond 104 atoms to meet the demands of FTQC for practical applications remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, we clarify the criteria and technological requirements for further scaling based on multiple neutral atom quantum processing units (QPUs) connected through photonic networking links. Our quantitative analysis shows that nanofiber optical cavities have the potential as an efficient atom-photon interface to enable fast entanglement generation between atoms in distinct neutral-atom modules, allowing multiple neutral-atom QPUs to operate cooperatively without sacrificing computational speed. Using state-of-the-art millimeter-scale nanofiber cavities with the finesse of thousands, over a hundred atoms can be coupled to the cavity mode with an optical tweezer array, with expected single-atom cooperativity exceeding 100 for telecom-band transition of ytterbium atoms. This enables efficient time-multiplexed entanglement generation with a predicted Bell-pair generation rate of 105 s-1 while maintaining a small footprint for channel multiplexing. These proposals and results indicate a promising pathway for building large-scale multiprocessor fault-tolerant quantum computers using neutral atoms, nanofiber optical cavities, and fiber-optic networks.

TI Monolayer J-Aggregate Crystals Strong Coupling with an All-Dielectric
   Metasurface for Photonic Properties Modification
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Strong coupling between light and matter, achieved by hybridizing material transitions such as bright excitons and cavity photons, offers exciting opportunities for manipulating the optical and transport properties of nanomaterials. These advancements have potential applications in technologies ranging from all-optical switching to quantum computation. Achieving strong coupling in such hybrid systems requires high-quality cavities and emitters with large oscillator strengths. In this work, the integration of a titanium dioxide (TiO2) metasurface with a high-quality monolayer molecular J-aggregate crystal is presented to realize strong coupling. Leveraging the high-Q modes (Bound States in the Continuum and guided mode resonances) of the TiO2 metasurface and the large oscillator strength of J-aggregate excitons, strong coupling is observed with a Rabi splitting of 78 meV in both photoluminescence (PL) and reflection spectra at room temperature. Additionally, under strong coupling, uniform modification of the emission properties across the entire sample is achieved: the polarization degree of emission is enhanced to 94% and the non-radiative recombination ratio is reduced from 34% down to 2%. This study introduces another nanophotonic platform, extending beyond conventional photonic cavities and plasmonic structures, for achieving strong coupling with the organic molecular excitons.

TI Architecture for generation and coil stabilization of an integrated
   PZT-enabled microcomb
SO OPTICA
AB Silicon nitride integrated dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) microcombs have emerged as a future solution to bring metrological optical frequency comb (OFC) capabilities into a photonic integrated platform with mass-scale fabrication benefits. Precision applications demand low comb line phase noise as well as high repetition rate stability, including quantum sensing and computing, precision metrology, and microwave generation. However, current approaches to reducing comb noise and repetition rate stabilization involve complex architectures, multiple lasers, and high-power components, that combined are challenging to integrate to the chip scale. A CMOS compatible system for on-chip DKS comb ignition and stabilization, capable of providing lab-based performance to non-experts and portable applications, remains to be demonstrated. To achieve this goal, new architectures are needed to simplify the comb control, stabilization, actuation, and pump laser requirements, while lowering the overall power and enabling integrated solutions. Here we demonstrate a greatly simplified stabilized DKS comb architecture with a single laser, and a single point electronic control of both the microcomb generation and its stabilization to a 16 m long coil-resonator reference. The PZT-controlled microcomb and coil-resonator reference are both fabricated in the low-loss CMOS-compatible silicon nitride integration platform. PZT-enabled control brings flexibility and simplicity to the soliton generation and comb line frequency noise reduction using a single CW fixed frequency pump laser, resulting in significantly reduced electronic and optical infrastructure. The silicon nitride microcomb is integrated with a low-power, broadband, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuator that is driven by a simple electronic control sequence that establishes both soliton generation and dual wavelength lock to the 16 m coil resonator. We demonstrate coil-resonator thermorefractive noise (TRN) limited pump frequency stability with comb line stabilization as low as 66 Hz integral linewidth and repetition rate phase noise of the 108 GHz soliton equivalent to-118 dBc/Hz when divided down to 10 GHz. We also demonstrate that this approach is able to suppress the 1 kHz frequency noise by 4 orders of magnitude, to below 10 Hz2/Hz, over the complete 35 nm wide comb spectrum. The low-power PZT actuator consumes nW bias power and the coil resonator allows flexible dual locking using arbitrary comb lines. These results show a clear path toward full chip integration of stabilized soliton microcombs with simplicity and versatility absent in other schemes. Such integrated architectures will open up their use in deployable ultra-low phase noise mmWave and RF generation, fieldable precision metrology, quantum sensing, portable and space-based applications, and high-capacity coherent fiber communications.

TI Bayesian frequency metrology with optimal Ramsey interferometry in
   optical atomic clocks
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Frequency metrology is a cornerstone of modern precision measurements and optical atomic clocks have emerged as one of the most precise measurement devices. In this progress report, we explore various Ramsey interrogation schemes tailored to optical atomic clocks primarily limited by laser noise. To incorporate frequency fluctuations directly into the theoretical model, we consider a Bayesian framework. In this context, we review fundamental bounds arising in Bayesian estimation theory, which serve as a benchmark throughout this work. We investigate the trade-off between entanglement-enhanced sensitivity and robustness against laser noise in order to identify optimal initial states, measurement schemes and estimation strategies. Beside standard protocols based on coherent spin states, spin-squeezed states and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, we consider variational Ramsey protocols implemented via low-depth quantum circuits based on one-axis twisting operations to approach optimal stability. In particular, we review known and identify new optimal Ramsey interrogation schemes for a variety of scenarios, including different experimental platforms, ensemble sizes and regimes characterized by a wide range of interrogation durations and dead times. Hence, this work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for optimizing Ramsey interrogation schemes, providing guidance for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks.

TI Higher-order band topology
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB A conventional topological insulator (TI) has gapped bulk states but gapless edge states. The emergence of the gapless edge states is dictated by the bulk topological invariant of the insulator and the preservation of relevant symmetries. Over the past four years, a new type of TI has been found, which hosts gapless hinge or corner states, rather than edge states. These unconventional TIs, termed higher-order TIs (HOTIs), are common among crystalline and quasi-crystalline materials. Higher-order band topology expands our previous understanding of topological phases and provides unprecedented lower-dimensional boundary states for devices. Here, we review the principles, theories and experimental realizations of HOTIs for both electrons and classical waves. There is an emphasis on the development of HOTIs in photonic, phononic and circuit systems owing to their special contributions to these fields. From these discussions, we remark on trends and challenges in the field and the impact of higher-order band topology on other scientific disciplines.
   The recent discovery of higher-order band topology in topological insulators has unveiled the hierarchical structure of topological band theory. This Perspective reviews this rapidly developing field and discusses future directions, including open challenges, future trends, synergy and its use in other fields and potential applications.

TI Quantum generative adversarial networks based on a readout error
   mitigation method with fault tolerant mechanism
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Readout errors caused by measurement noise are a significant source of errors in quantum circuits, which severely affect the output results and are an urgent problem to be solved in noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computing. In this paper, we use the bit-flip averaging (BFA) method to mitigate frequent readout errors in quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN) for image generation, which simplifies the response matrix structure by averaging the qubits for each random bit-flip in advance, successfully solving problems with high cost of measurement for traditional error mitigation methods. Our experiments were simulated in Qiskit using the handwritten digit image recognition dataset under the BFA-based method, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the generated images converges to 0.04, 0.05, and 0.1 for readout error probabilities of p = 0.01, p = 0.05, and p = 0.1, respectively. Additionally, by evaluating the fidelity of the quantum states representing the images, we observe average fidelity values of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.95 for the three readout error probabilities, respectively. These results demonstrate the robustness of the model in mitigating readout errors and provide a highly fault tolerant mechanism for image generation models.

TI An Optical Tool to Optimize the Output of a Photonic Integrated Chip
   Architecture
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB Photonic Integrated Chips (PICs) are an up-and-coming solution for base building blocks of quantum computers. The ready accessibility of photonics integrated systems and the fact that they allow for direct monolithic integration with electronics in a compact architecture have pushed the academic community to inspect their capabilities further. Still, at this stage, their characterization, control, and fine-tuning is an open issue for which this work aims to provide a viable solution. In this paper we present a method for an easy setup and an efficient architecture to simultaneously optimize multiple outputs of a PIC. The proposed solution can be embedded in an automation tool for tuning and verifying output on- and off-chip detectors. We fabricated a Silicon Oxynitride (SiON)-based PIC featuring a network of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) arranged in Clements architecture driven by Titanium-Titanium Nitride (TiTiN) thermistors. We interfaced the chip electronically through commercial driver modules and optically through optical guides and controlled it through a Python optimization algorithm. Finally, we retrieved the feedback of the control both by sensing it through integrated silicon photodetectors and by an image processing algorithm capable of inspecting the light intensity scattered by the waveguides in a custom region.

TI Ultrafast thermo-optical control of spins in a 2D van der Waals
   semiconductor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Laser pulses provide one of the fastest means of manipulating electron spins in magnetic compounds and pave the way to ultrafast operation within magnetic recording, quantum computation and spintronics. However, effective management of the heat deposited during optical excitation is an open challenge. Layered two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials possess unique thermal properties due to the highly anisotropic nature of their chemical bonding. Here we show how to control the rate of heat flow, and hence the magnetization dynamics, induced by an ultrafast laser pulse within the 2D ferromagnet Cr2Ge2Te6. Using time-resolved beam-scanning magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and microscopic spin modelling calculations, we show that by reducing the thickness of the magnetic layers, an enhancement of the heat dissipation rate into the adjacent substrate leads to a substantial reduction in the timescale for magnetization recovery from several nanoseconds down to a few hundred picoseconds. Finally, we demonstrate how the low thermal conductivity across vdW layers may be used to obtain magnetic domain memory behaviour, even after exposure to intense laser pulses. Our findings reveal the distinctive role of vdW magnets in the ultrafast control of heat conduction, spin dynamics and non-volatile memory.

TI Probing semiconductor quantum well qubits and associated Shannon entropy
   using semi-relativistic quantum mechanics
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Electron states in GaAs, GaN and AlN quantum wells are studied by solving a semi-relativistic wave equation within the effective mass approximation. The quantum states are in turn used to probe the properties of two-level qubits formed in the different quantum wells at various temperatures. Results indicated that the period of oscillation between the quantum states increases with increasing width of the quantum wells, with AlN having the longest period and shortest for GaAs. Transition rates were also studied, since their product with the period of oscillation yield important information concerning the feasibility of carrying out a quantum computation. This product is equivalent to the ratio of the period of oscillation between states to the lifetime of an electron in an excited state. From the results, GaAs quantum wells may be preferable as they have the lowest ratio compared with the other quantum wells of other materials. AlN has the highest ratio of the three semiconductors considered here. Shannon entropy in the different quantum wells was studied also. It was found that the entropy in GaAs quantum wells varies rapidly through the passage of time, while those of GaN and AlN vary relatively slowly.

TI Optomechanical parametric oscillation of a quantum light-fluid lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Two-photon coherent states are one of the main building pillars of nonlinear and quantum optics. They are the basis for the generation of minimum-uncertainty quantum states and entangled photon pairs, applications not obtainable from standard coherent states or one-photon lasers. Here, we describe a fully resonant optomechanical parametric amplifier involving a polariton condensate in a trap lattice quadratically coupled to mechanical modes. The quadratic coupling derives from nonresonant virtual transitions to extended discrete excited states induced by the optomechanical coupling. Nonresonant continuous-wave laser excitation leads to striking experimental consequences, including the emergence of optomechanically induced intersite parametric oscillations and intersite tunneling of polaritons at discrete intertrap detunings corresponding to sums of energies of the two involved mechanical oscillations (20- and 60-GHz confined vibrations). We show that the coherent mechanical oscillations correspond to parametric resonances with a threshold condition different from that of standard linear optomechanical self-oscillation. The associated Arnold tongues display a complex scenario of states within the instability region. The observed phenomena can have applications for the generation of entangled phonon pairs and squeezed mechanical states relevant in sensing and quantum computation and for the bidirectional frequency conversion of signals in a technologically relevant range.

TI Solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation with a transformer-based
   framework
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Accurately solving the Schr & ouml;dinger equation for intricate systems remains a prominent challenge in physical sciences. Here we present QiankunNet, a neural network quantum state (NNQS) framework that combines Transformer architectures with efficient autoregressive sampling to solve the many-electron Schr & ouml;dinger equation. At its core is a Transformer-based wave function ansatz that captures complex quantum correlations through attention mechanisms, effectively learning the structure of many-body states. The quantum state sampling employs layer-wise Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that naturally enforces electron number conservation while exploring orbital configurations. The framework incorporates physics-informed initialization using truncated configuration interaction solutions, providing principled starting points for variational optimization. Our systematic benchmarks demonstrate QiankunNet's versatility across different chemical systems. For molecular systems up to 30 spin orbitals, we achieved correlation energies reaching 99.9% of the full configuration interaction (FCI) benchmark, setting a new standard for neural network quantum states. Most notably, in treating the Fenton reaction mechanism, a fundamental process in biological oxidative stress, QiankunNet successfully handled a large CAS(46e,26o) active space, enabling accurate description of the complex electronic structure evolution during Fe(II) to Fe(III) oxidation.

TI Monte Carlo matrix-product-state approach to the false vacuum decay in
   the monitored quantum Ising chain
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB In this work we characterize the false vacuum decay in the ferromagnetic quantum Ising chain with a weak longitudinal field subject to continuous monitoring of the local magnetization. Initializing the system in a metastable state, the false vacuum, we study the competition between coherent dynamics, which tends to create resonant bubbles of the true vacuum, and measurements which induce heating and reduce the amount of quantum correlations. To this end we exploit a numerical approach based on the combination of matrix product states with stochastic quantum trajectories which allows for the simulation of the trajectory-resolved non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting many-body systems in the presence of continuous measurements. We show how the presence of measurements affects the false vacuum decay: At short times the departure from the local minimum is accelerated while at long times the system thermalizes to an infinite-temperature incoherent mixture. For large measurement rates the system enters a quantum Zeno regime. The false vacuum decay and the thermalization physics are characterized in terms of the magnetization, connected correlation function, and the trajectory-resolved entanglement entropy.

TI Interferometric single-shot parity measurement in InAs-Al hybrid devices
SO NATURE
AB The fusion of non-Abelian anyons is a fundamental operation in measurement-only topological quantum computation(1). In one-dimensional topological superconductors (1DTSs)(2, 3-4), fusion amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we introduce a device architecture(5) that is compatible with future tests of fusion rules. We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity(6, 7, 8, 9, 10-11) in indium arsenide-aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire(12, 13-14). The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1fF. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in 3.6 mu s at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1%.

TI Disorder-assisted assembly of strongly correlated fluids of light
SO NATURE
AB Guiding many-body systems to desired states is a central challenge of modern quantum science, with applications from quantum computation(1,2) to many-body physics(3) and quantum-enhanced metrology(4). Approaches to solving this problem include step-by-step assembly(5,6), reservoir engineering to irreversibly pump towards a target state(7,8) and adiabatic evolution from a known initial state(9,10). Here we construct low-entropy quantum fluids of light in a Bose-Hubbard circuit by combining particle-by-particle assembly and adiabatic preparation. We inject individual photons into a disordered lattice for which the eigenstates are known and localized, then adiabatically remove this disorder, enabling quantum fluctuations to melt the photons into a fluid. Using our platform(11), we first benchmark this lattice melting technique by building and characterizing arbitrary single-particle-in-a-box states, then assemble multiparticle strongly correlated fluids. Intersite entanglement measurements performed through single-site tomography indicate that the particles in the fluid delocalize, whereas two-body density correlation measurements demonstrate that they also avoid one another, revealing Friedel oscillations characteristic of a Tonks-Girardeau gas(12,13). This work opens new possibilities for the preparation of topological and otherwise exotic phases of synthetic matter(3,14,15).

TI NON-CONTACT HARMONIC DETECTION OF FERROMAGNETIC MATERIAL DEFECTS BASED
   ON SQGSR AND OPLTF
SO METROLOGY AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS
AB In order to find the defects in ferromagnetic materials, a non-contact harmonic detection method is proposed. According to the principle of frequency modulated carrier wave, a tunnel magneto resistance harmonic focusing vector array detector was designed which radiates lower and higher frequency electromagnetic waves through the coil array to the detection targets. We use bistable stochastic resonance to enhance the energy of collected weak target signal and apply quantum computation and a Sobol low deviation sequence to improve genetic algorithm performance. Then we use the orthogonal phase-locked loop to eliminate the intrinsic background excitation field and tensor calculations to fuse the vector array signal. The finite element model of array detector and the magnetic dipole harmonic numerical model were also established. The simulation results show that the target signal can be identified electively, its focusing performance is improved by 2 times, and the average signal-to-noise ratio is improved by 9.6 times after the algorithm processing. For the experiments, we take Q235 steel pipeline as the object to realize the recognition of three defects. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed method is more effective for ferromagnetic materials defects detection.

TI Proximity induced band gap opening in topological-magnetic
   heterostructure
   (Ni80Fe20/p-TlBiSe2/p-Si) under ambient
   condition
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The broken time reversal symmetry states may result in the opening of a band gap in TlBiSe2 leading to several interesting phenomena which are potentially relevant for spintronic applications. In this work, the quantum interference and magnetic proximity effects have been studied in Ni80Fe20/p-TlBiSe2/p-Si (Magnetic/TI) heterostructure using physical vapor deposition technique. Raman analysis shows the symmetry breaking with the appearance of A(1u)(2) mode. The electrical characteristics are investigated under dark and illumination conditions in the absence as well as in the presence of a magnetic field. The outcomes of the examined device reveal excellent photo response in both forward and reverse bias regions. Interestingly, under a magnetic field, the device shows a reduction in electrical conductivity at ambient conditions due to the crossover of weak localization and separation of weak antilocalization, which are experimentally confirmed by magnetoresistance measurement. Further, the photo response has also been assessed by the transient absorption spectroscopy through analysis of charge transfer and carrier relaxation mechanisms. Our results can be beneficial for quantum computation and further study of topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructure and topological material based spintronic devices due to high spin orbit coupling along with dissipationless conduction channels at the surface states.

TI Framework for resource quantification in infinite-dimensional general
   probabilistic theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Resource theories provide a general framework for the characterization of properties of physical systems in quantum mechanics and beyond. Here we introduce methods for the quantification of resources in general probabilistic theories (GPTs), focusing in particular on the technical issues associated with infinite-dimensional state spaces. We define a universal resource quantifier based on the robustness measure, and show it to admit a direct operational meaning: in any GPT, it quantifies the advantage that a given resource state enables in channel discrimination tasks over all resourceless states. We show that the robustness acts as a faithful and strongly monotonic measure in any resource theory described by a convex and closed set of free states, and can be computed through a convex conic optimization problem. Specializing to continuous-variable quantum mechanics, we obtain additional bounds and relations, allowing an efficient computation of the measure and comparison with other monotones. We demonstrate applications of the robustness to several resources of physical relevance: optical nonclassicality, entanglement, genuine non-Gaussianity, and coherence. In particular, we establish exact expressions for various classes of states, including Fock states and squeezed states in the resource theory of nonclassicality and general pure states in the resource theory of entanglement, as well as tight bounds applicable in general cases.

TI Quantum spin driven Yu-Shiba-Rusinov multiplets and
   fermionparity-preserving phase transition in K 3 C 60
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Magnetic impurities in superconductors are of increasing interest due to emergent Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states and Majorana zero modes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a direct relationship between the YSR multiple states and magnetic anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins remains poorly characterized. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we systematically resolve individual transition-metal (Fe, Cr, and Ni) impurities induced YSR multiplets as well as their Zeeman effects in the K 3 C 60 superconductor. The YSR multiplets show identical d orbital -like wave functions that are symmetry-mismatched to the threefold K 3 C 60 (1 1 1) host surface, breaking point-group symmetries of the spatial distribution of YSR bound states in real space. Remarkably, we identify an unprecedented fermion-parity-preserving quantum phase transition between ground states with opposite signs of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that can be manipulated by an external magnetic field. These findings can be readily understood in terms of anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins, and thus elucidate the intricate interplay between the magnetic anisotropy and YSR multiplets.

TI Quantum advantage in charging cavity and spin batteries by repeated
   interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recently, an unconditional advantage has been demonstrated for the process of charging of a quantum battery in a collisional model [Seah et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 100601 (2021)]. Motivated by the question of whether such an advantage could be observed experimentally, we consider a model where the battery is described by a quantum harmonic oscillator or a large spin, charged via repeated interactions with a stream of qubit units. For both setups, we show that a quantum protocol can significantly outperform the most general adaptive classical schemes, leading to 90 and 38% higher charging power for the cavity and large spin batteries, respectively. Toward an experimental realization, we also characterize the robustness of this quantum advantage to imperfections (noise and decoherence) considering implementations with state-of-the-art micromasers and hybrid superconducting devices.

TI Parametric amplification in a Josephson junction array Fabry-Pérot
   cavity
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers (SPAs) with near-quantum-limited added noise are crucial for weak signal detection applications such as astronomical receivers, quantum computation, and fundamental physics experiments. Commercially available SPAs include Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), which offer high gain but narrow bandwidth performance; and Josephson-junction Travelling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPAs), which provide broader bandwidth at the cost of a complicated fabrication procedure, lower fabrication yield, and larger footprint area. In this paper, we investigate the parametric amplification of microwave signals in a Josephson array embedded in a low-Q Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavity. We fabricated a 500-junction array device and measured >15 dB phase-preserving gain over a similar to 350 MHz bandwidth, while offering almost two orders of magnitude improvement in compression point (P-1dB = -106.2 dBm) compared to standard JPAs. Furthermore, using a novel measurement technique, we configured our device to operate in the phase-sensitive mode, measuring a phase-sensitive extinction ratio (PSER) of 42.3 +/- 2.81 dB, in line with state-of-the-art values for JPAs. These promising performances, combined with the ease of fabrication and improved yield compared with JTWPAs, underscore the potential of these devices for applications in advanced detection schemes.

TI Plasmonic Nanocavity to Boost Single Photon Emission From Defects in
   Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Efficient and compact single photon emission platforms operating at room temperature with ultrafast speed and high brightness will be fundamental components of the emerging quantum communications and computing fields. However, so far, it is very challenging to design practical deterministic single photon emitters based on nanoscale solid-state materials that meet the fast emission rate and strong brightness demands. Here, a solution is provided to this longstanding problem by using metallic nanocavities integrated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes with defects acting as nanoscale single photon emitters (SPEs) at room temperature. The presented hybrid nanophotonic structure creates a rapid speedup and large enhancement in single photon emission at room temperature. Hence, the nonclassical light emission performance is substantially improved compared to plain hBN flakes and hBN on gold-layered structures without nanocavity. Extensive theoretical calculations are also performed to accurately model the new hybrid nanophotonic system and prove that the incorporation of plasmonic nanocavity is key to efficient SPE performance. The proposed quantum nanocavity single photon source is expected to be an element of paramount importance to the envisioned room-temperature integrated quantum photonic networks.
   The quantum properties of single photon emitters in thin hexagonal boron nitride flakes are enhanced at room temperature using metallic nanocavities composed of silver nanocubes and gold film. The hybrid nanophotonic structure creates a rapid speedup and enhancement in single photon emission due to the designed plasmon nanocavity. These findings are explained by rigorous theoretical calculations. image

TI Direct-bonded diamond membranes for heterogeneous quantum and electronic
   technologies
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Diamond has superlative material properties for a broad range of quantum and electronic technologies. However, heteroepitaxial growth of single crystal diamond remains limited, impeding integration and evolution of diamond-based technologies. Here, we directly bond single-crystal diamond membranes to a wide variety of materials including silicon, fused silica, sapphire, thermal oxide, and lithium niobate. Our bonding process combines customized membrane synthesis, transfer, and dry surface functionalization, allowing for minimal contamination while providing pathways for near unity yield and scalability. We generate bonded crystalline membranes with thickness as low as 10 nm, sub-nm interfacial regions, and nanometer-scale thickness variability over 200 by 200 mu m2 areas. We measure spin coherence times T2 for nitrogen vacancy centers in 150 nm-thick bonded membranes of up to 623 +/- 21 mu s, suitable for advanced quantum applications. We demonstrate multiple methods for integrating high quality factor nanophotonic cavities with the diamond heterostructures, highlighting the platform versatility in quantum photonic applications. Furthermore, we show that our ultra-thin diamond membranes are compatible with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which enables interfacing coherent diamond quantum sensors with living cells while rejecting unwanted background luminescence. The processes demonstrated herein provide a full toolkit to synthesize heterogeneous diamond-based hybrid systems for quantum and electronic technologies.
   Development of diamond-based quantum and electronic technologies requires heterogeneous integration, which has remained challenging. This work realizes direct bonding of single crystal diamond membranes to a broad range of technology-relevant substrates while maintaining quantum coherence for hosted qubits.

TI Theoretical Predictions of Intrinsic Superconductivity in a Novel
   Two-Dimensional Cr3B5 Material
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The rapid development of electronic, energy, and quantum technologies has elevated the demand for high-performance superconducting materials, making the design of new 2D superconductors a key research hotspot. In this study, by means of structure prediction method combined with first-principles calculations, we successfully identified an unprecedented two-dimensional(2D) Cr3B5 material. The 2D Cr3B5 features a unique layered structure with high stability, as validated by cohesive energy calculations (7.54 eV/atom), elastic constant analysis, and phonon dispersion studies. Electronic structure analysis reveals a high density of states at the Fermi level, dominated by Cr-3d orbitals, supporting strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Low-frequency in-plane vibrations of Cr atoms contribute significantly to the EPC, yielding a computed constant (lambda) of 0.896 and a superconducting transition temperature (T c) of 11.678 K, making it practical and viable under liquid helium conditions. These findings establish Cr3B5 as an intrinsic phonon-mediated transition-metal boride superconductor with significant potential for experimental realization, paving the way for designing and understanding new 2D superconducting materials.

TI Thresholded single-photon underwater imaging and detection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical underwater target imaging and detection have been a tough but significant challenge in deep-sea exploration. Distant reflected signals drown in various underwater noises due to strong absorption and scattering, resulting in degraded image contrast and reduced detection range. Single-photon feature operating at the fundamental limit of the classical electromagnetic waves can broaden the realm of quantum technologies. Here we experimentally demonstrate a thresholded single-photon imaging and detection scheme to extract photon signals from the noisy underwater environment. We reconstruct the images obtained in a high-loss underwater environment by using photon-limited computational algorithms. Furthermore, we achieve a capability of underwater detection down to 0.8 photons per pulse at Jerlov type III water up to 50 meters, which is equivalent to more than 9 attenuation lengths. The results break the limits of classical underwater imaging and detection and may lead to many quantum-enhanced applications, like air-to-sea target tracking and deep-sea optical exploration.

TI Subcycle spectral structures of light-induced states in attosecond
   transient absorption of helium dressed by an orthogonally polarized
   laser field
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present the subcycle spectral structures from attosecond transient absorption spectra of helium by accurately solving the full three-dimensional time-dependent Schr & ouml;dinger equation in extreme ultraviolet attosecond pulse and an orthogonally polarized infrared (IR) laser field. We discover that the subcycle spectral features associated with the dressed 1snp (n >= 4) states and light-induced states, referred to as ns-, nd-, np- and nf-, can be strongly modified or even enhanced when the strength ratio of the orthogonal laser field in two polarized laser directions changes. To understand the spectral evolution of the subcycle structures, we perform calculations of the time-dependent population and time-frequency analysis. The results indicate that more quantum channels can be opened by the attosecond pulse combined with the orthogonally polarized IR laser field, leading to robust absorption spectra of light-induced states. Our theoretical findings predict that the orthogonally polarized laser field is useful for manipulating subcycle transition dynamics in the transient absorption process.

TI Securing Medical Information Transmission Between IoT Devices: An
   Innovative Hybrid Encryption Scheme Based on Quantum Walk, DNA Encoding,
   and Chaos
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB The healthcare industry has undergone a transformation due to the widespread use of advanced communication technologies and wireless sensor networks such as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Health Information Exchange Technology (HIET), Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) and Health IoT (HIoT). These technologies have led to an increase in the transmission of medical data, particularly medical imaging data, over various wireless communication channels. However, transmitting high-quality color medical images over insecure internet channels like the Internet and communication networks like 5G presents significant security risks that could threaten patients' data privacy. Furthermore, this process can also burden the limited bandwidth of the communication channel, leading to delayed data transmission. To address security concerns in healthcare data, researchers have focused a lot of attention on medical image encryption as a means of protecting patient data. This paper presents a color image encryption scheme that integrates multiple encryption techniques, including alternate quantum random walks, controlled Rubik's Cube transformations, and the integration of the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem with Hill Cipher (ECCHC). The proposed scheme divides various plaintext images by creating a regular cube by layering planes of a fixed size. Each plane is rotated in an anticlockwise direction, followed by row, column and face swapping, and then DNA encoding is performed. The image cube encoded with DNA is combined with the chaotic cube through DNA addition, and a couple of random DNA sequences are chosen for DNA mutation. After undergoing DNA mutation, the encoded cube is then decoded using DNA. The proposed method has the theoretical capability of encrypting 2D images of unlimited size and number by utilizing an infinitely large cube. The proposed image encryption scheme has been rigorously tested through various experimental simulations and cyberattack analysis, which shows the efficiency and reliability of the proposed encryption scheme.

TI The Untapped Potential of Ascon Hash Functions: Benchmarking, Hardware
   Profiling, and Application Insights for Secure IoT and Blockchain
   Systems
SO SENSORS
AB Hash functions are fundamental components in both cryptographic and non-cryptographic systems, supporting secure authentication, data integrity, fingerprinting, and indexing. While the Ascon family, selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2023 for lightweight cryptography, has been extensively evaluated in its authenticated encryption mode, its hashing and extendable-output variants, namely Ascon-Hash256, Ascon-XOF128, and Ascon-CXOF128, have not received the same level of empirical attention. This paper presents a structured benchmarking study of these hash variants using both the SMHasher framework and custom Python-based simulation environments. SMHasher is used to evaluate statistical and structural robustness under constrained, patterned, and low-entropy input conditions, while Python-based experiments assess application-specific performance in Bloom filter-based replay detection at the network edge, Merkle tree aggregation for blockchain transaction integrity, lightweight device fingerprinting for IoT identity management, and tamper-evident logging for distributed ledgers. We compare the performance of Ascon hashes with widely used cryptographic functions such as SHA3 and BLAKE2s, as well as high-speed non-cryptographic hashes including MurmurHash3 and xxHash. We assess avalanche behavior, diffusion consistency, output bias, and keyset sensitivity while also examining Ascon-XOF's variable-length output capabilities relative to SHAKE for applications such as domain-separated hashing and lightweight key derivation. Experimental results indicate that Ascon hash functions offer strong diffusion, low statistical bias, and competitive performance across both cryptographic and application-specific domains. These properties make them well suited for deployment in resource-constrained systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, blockchain indexing frameworks, and probabilistic authentication architectures. This study provides the first comprehensive empirical evaluation of Ascon hashing modes and offers new insights into their potential as lightweight, structurally resilient alternatives to established hash functions.

TI Graph-theoretic approach to Bell experiments with low detection
   efficiency
SO QUANTUM
AB Bell inequality tests where the detec-tion efficiency is below a certain threshold eta crit can be simulated with local hidden-variable models. Here, we introduce a method to identify Bell tests requiring low eta crit and relatively low dimension d of the local quantum systems. The method has two steps. First, we show a family of bipar-tite Bell inequalities for which, for corre-lations produced by maximally entangled states, eta crit can be upper bounded by a function of some invariants of graphs, and use it to identify correlations that require small eta crit. We present examples in which, for maximally entangled states, eta crit < 0.516 for d = 16, eta crit < 0.407 for d = 28, and eta crit < 0.326 for d = 32. We also show evidence that the upper bound for eta crit can be lowered down to 0.415 for d = 16 and present a method to make the upper bound of eta crit arbitrarily small by increas-ing the dimension and the number of set-tings. All these upper bounds for eta crit are valid (as it is the case in the literature) as-suming no noise. The second step is based on the observation that, using the initial state and measurement settings identified in the first step, we can construct Bell inequalities with smaller eta crit and better noise robustness. For that, we use a mod-ified version of Gilbert's algorithm that takes advantage of the automorphisms of the graphs used in the first step. We illustrate its power by explicitly developing an example in which eta crit is 12.38% lower and the required visibility is 14.62% lower than the upper bounds obtained in the first step. The tools presented here may allow for developing high-dimensional loophole-free Bell tests and loophole-free Bell non-locality over long distances.

TI Learning Strikes Again: The Case of the DRS Signature Scheme
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOLOGY
AB Lattice signature schemes generally require particular care when it comes to preventing secret information from leaking through signature transcript. For example, theGoldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) signature scheme and theNTRUSign scheme were completely broken by the parallelepiped-learning attack of Nguyen and Regev (Eurocrypt 2006). Several heuristic countermeasures were also shown vulnerable to similar statistical attacks. At PKC 2008, Plantard, Susilo and Win proposed a new variant of GGH, informally arguing resistance to such attacks. Based on this variant, Plantard, Sipasseuth, Dumondelle and Susilo proposed a concrete signature scheme, called DRS, that is in the round 1 of the NIST post-quantum cryptography project. In this work, we propose yet another statistical attack and demonstrate a weakness of the DRS scheme: one can recover some partial information of the secret key from sufficiently many signatures. One difficulty is that, due to the DRS reduction algorithm, the relation between the statistical leak and the secret seemsmore intricate. We work around this difficulty by training a statistical model, using a few features that we designed according to a simple heuristic analysis. While we only recover partial secret coefficients, this information is easily exploited by lattice attacks, significantly decreasing their complexity. Concretely, we claim that, provided that 100 000 signatures are available, the secret key may be recovered using BKZ-138 for the first set of DRS parameters submitted to the NIST. This puts the security level of this parameter set below 80-bits (maybe even 70-bits), to be compared to an original claim of 128-bits. Furthermore, we review the DRS v2 scheme that is proposed to resist above statistical attack. For this countermeasure, while one may not recover partial secret coefficients exactly by learning, it seems feasible to gain some information on the secret key. Exploiting this information, we can still effectively reduce the cost of lattice attacks.

TI Holograms in our world
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In AdS=CFT, the entanglement wedge EW(B) is the portion of the bulk geometry that can be reconstructed from a boundary region B; in other words, EW(B) is the hologram of B. We extend this notion to arbitrary spacetimes. Given any gravitating region a, we define a max- and a min-entanglement wedge, e(max)(a) and e(min)(a), such that e(min)(a) superset of e(max)(a) superset of a. Unlike their analogs in AdS=CFT, these two spacetime regions can already differ at the classical level, when the generalized entropy is approximated by the area. All information outside a in e(max)(a) can flow inwards towards a, through quantum channels whose capacity is controlled by the areas of intermediate homology surfaces. In contrast, all information outside e(min)(a) can flow outwards. The generalized entropies of appropriate entanglement wedges obey strong subadditivity, suggesting that they represent the von Neumann entropies of ordinary quantum systems. The entanglement wedges of suitably independent regions satisfy a no-cloning relation. This suggests that it may be possible for an observer in a to summon information from spacelike related points in e(max)(a), using resources that transcend the semiclassical description of a.

TI Kyber AHE: An Easy-to-Implement Additive Homomorphic Encryption Scheme
   Based on Kyber and Its Application in Biometric Template Protection
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Homomorphic encryption solutions tend to be costly in terms of memory and computational resources, making them difficult to implement. In this paper, we present Kyber AHE, a lightweight additive homomorphic encryption scheme for computing the addition modulo 2 of two binary strings in the encrypted domain. It is based on the CRYSTALS-Kyber public key encryption (PKE) scheme, which is the basis of the NIST module-lattice-based key-encapsulation mechanism standard. Apart from being quantum-safe, Kyber PKE has other interesting features such as the use of compressed ciphertexts, reduced sizes of keys, low execution times, and the ability to easily increase the security level. The operations performed in the encrypted domain by Kyber AHE are the decompression of ciphertexts, the component-wise modulo q addition of polynomials, and the compression of the results. A great advantage of Kyber AHE is that it can be easily implemented along with CRYSTALS-Kyber without the need for additional libraries. Among the applications of homomorphic encryption, biometric template protection schemes are a promising solution to provide data privacy by comparing biometric features in the encrypted domain. Therefore, we present the application of Kyber AHE for the protection of biometric templates. Experimental results have been obtained using Kyber AHE in an iris biometric template protection scheme with 256-byte features using Kyber512, Kyber768, and Kyber1024 instances. The sizes of the encrypted iris features are 6.0, 8.5, and 12.5 kB for NIST security levels I, III, and V, respectively. Using a commercial laptop, the encryption ranges from 0.755 to 1.73 ms, the evaluation from 0.096 to 0.161 ms, and the decryption from 0.259 to 0.415 ms, depending on the security level.

TI Uniqueness and Optimality of Dynamical Extensions of Divergences
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce an axiomatic approach for channel divergences and channel relative entropies that is based on three information-theoretic axioms of monotonicity under superchannels, i.e., generalized data processing inequality, additivity under tensor products, and normalization, similar to the approach given for the state domain in Gour and Tomamichel [arXiv:2006.11164v1 (2020), arXiv:2006.12408v2 (2020)]. We show that these axioms are sufficient to give enough structure in the channel domain as well, leading to numerous properties that are applicable to all channel divergences. These include faithfulness, continuity, a type of triangle inequality, and boundedness between the min and max channel relative entropies. In addition, we prove a uniqueness theorem showing that the Kullback-Leibler divergence has only one extension to classical channels. For quantum channels, with the exception of the max relative entropy, this uniqueness does not hold. Instead, we prove the optimality of the amortized channel extension of the Umegaki relative entropy, by showing that it provides a lower bound on all channel relative entropies that reduce to the Kullback-Leibler divergence on classical states. We also introduce the maximal channel extension of a given classical state divergence and study its properties.

TI Digital Twins Generated by Artificial Intelligence in Personalized
   Healthcare
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application Featured Application: The potential application of the work relates to novel digital twins of patients or their organs based on artificial intelligence.Abstract Digital society strategies in healthcare include the rapid development of digital twins (DTs) for patients and human organs in medical research and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical practice to develop effective treatments in a cheaper, quicker, and more effective manner. This is facilitated by the availability of large historical datasets from previous clinical trials and other real-world data sources (e.g., patient biometrics collected from wearable devices). DTs can use AI models to create predictions of future health outcomes for an individual patient in the form of an AI-generated digital twin to support the rapid assessment of in silico intervention strategies. DTs are gaining the ability to update in real time in relation to their corresponding physical patients and connect to multiple diagnostic and therapeutic devices. Support for this form of personalized medicine is necessary due to the complex technological challenges, regulatory perspectives, and complex issues of security and trust in this approach. The challenge is also to combine different datasets and omics to quickly interpret large datasets in order to generate health and disease indicators and to improve sampling and longitudinal analysis. It is possible to improve patient care through various means (simulated clinical trials, disease prediction, the remote monitoring of apatient's condition, treatment progress, and adjustments to the treatment plan), especially in the environments of smart cities and smart territories and through the wider use of 6G, blockchain (and soon maybe quantum cryptography), and the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as through medical technologies, such as multiomics. From a practical point of view, this requires not only efficient validation but also seamless integration with the existing healthcare infrastructure.

TI Belavkin-Staszewski Quantum Markov Chains
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB It is well known that the conditional mutual information of a quantum state is zero if, and only if, the quantum state is a quantum Markov chain. Replacing the Umegaki relative entropy in the definition of the conditional mutual information by the Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) relative entropy, we obtain the BS-conditional mutual information, and we call the states with zero BS-conditional mutual information Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains. In this article, we establish a correspondence which relates quantum Markov chains and BS-quantum Markov chains. This correspondence allows us to find a recovery map for the BS-entropy in the spirit of the Petz recovery map. Furthermore, we show that, over the set of BS-quantum Markov chains, this correspondence constitutes an entanglement-breaking map. Moreover, we prove a structural decomposition of the Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains and also study states for which the BS-conditional mutual information is only approximately zero. We subsequently extend the aforementioned correspondence, structural decomposition, and recovery map to arbitrary pairs of states and quantum channels. As an application of the correspondence, we find a family of states with non-vanishing conditional mutual information for which it decays superexponentially fast with the size of the middle system.

TI Twirling channels have minimal mixed-unitary rank
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB For a positive integer d and a unitary representation rho : G -> U(d) of a compact group G, the twirling channel for this representation is the linear mapping Phi : M-d -> M-d defined as Phi(X) = integral(G) d mu(g) rho(g)X rho(g(-1)) for every X is an element of M-d, where mu is the Haar measure on G. Such channels are examples of mixed-unitary channels, as they are in the convex hull of the set of unitary channels of a fixed size. By Caratheodory's theorem, these channels can always be expressed as a finite linear combination of unitary channels. We consider the mixed-unitary rank of twirling channels which is the minimum number of distinct unitary conjugations required to express the channel as a convex combination of unitary channels and show that the mixed-unitary rank of every twirling channel is always equal to its Choi rank, both of which are equal to the dimension of the von Neumann algebra generated by the representation. Moreover, we show how to explicitly construct minimal mixed-unitary decompositions for these types of channels and provide some examples. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Channel Divergences and Complexity in Algebraic QFT
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We consider a notion of divergence between quantum channels in relativistic continuum quantum field theory (QFT) that is derived from the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy and the concept of bimodules for general von Neumann algebras. Key concepts of the divergence that we shall prove based on a new variational formulation of that relative entropy are the subadditivity under composition and additivity under the tensor product between channels. Based on these properties, we propose to use the channel divergence relative to the trivial (identity-) channel as a novel measure of complexity. Using the properties of our channel divergence, we prove in the prerequisite generality necessary for the algebras in QFT that the corresponding complexity has several reasonable properties: (i) the complexity of a composite channel is not larger than the sum of its parts, (ii) it is additive for channels localized in spacelike separated regions, (iii) it is convex, (iv) for an N-ary measurement channel it is log N, (v) for a conditional expectation associated with an inclusion of QFTs with finite Jones index it is given by log(Jones Index).

In this article we employ a deterministic approach in complex space to analyze the dynamics of the 1s-2p electron transition in the hydrogen atom. The electron's spin motion is embodied in the framework of quantum Hamilton mechanics that allows us to examine the transition dynamics more precisely. The transition is driven by an oscillating electric field in the z-direction. The electron's transition process can be visualized by monitoring its motion in the complex space. The quantum potential and the total energy proposed in this paper provide new indices to observe the dynamic changes of electrons in the transition process.

AB Cryptocurrency exchanges are integral to the digital asset economy; however, their rapid growth has been accompanied by recurrent high-impact cyberattacks that erode trust and inflict substantial losses. Guided by the PRISMA-ScR framework, this review systematically screened peer-reviewed and industry sources to construct a validated dataset of 220 major incidents (2009-2024) across centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. We classify attack vectors, analyze repeated high-impact patterns, and identify systemic vulnerabilities spanning cryptographic mechanisms and exchange infrastructure. Across CEX platforms, four of ten identified attack types accounted for 62 of the 80 incidents and approximately $1.764 billion in losses (42.1% of the $4.191 billion CEX total). Across DEX platforms, five of eighteen attack types were responsible for 120 of 140 incidents, totaling $3.755 billion (87.3% of the $4.303 billion DEX total). The overall losses sum to $8.494 billion across 220 incidents (80 CEX; 140 DEX). Repeated vectors comprised 182/220 incidents and $5.519 billion (65.0%) of losses, dominated by wallet/key compromise (78 incidents; $2.394 billion) and DEX system/server/protocol exploits (56 incidents; $1.939 billion); these two classes account for 134/182 repeated incidents (79.1%) and $4.333 billion (78.5%) of repeated losses. We examine the susceptibility of cryptographic defenses to emerging quantum adversaries and assess the exchange readiness for post-quantum threats. This study is the first to systematically compile and quantitatively analyze cybercrime incidents affecting both centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges in a unified dataset, enabling unprecedented comparability of systemic risks with actionable insights for cybersecurity researchers, regulators, and exchange operators seeking quantum-safe infrastructure evolution.

TI Empirical Learning of Dynamical Decoupling on Quantum Processors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a low-overhead method for quantum error suppression. Despite extensive work in DD design, finding pulse sequences that optimally decouple computational qubits is not well understood. Using IBM's superconducting-qubit-based quantum processors, we demonstrate how to empirically tailor DD strategies for an arbitrary quantum circuit and device. These learned DD strategies significantly improve error suppression relative to canonical sequences, with relative improvement increasing with problem size and circuit sophistication. We leverage this to study mirror randomized benchmarking on 100 qubits, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation on 50 qubits, and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm on 27 qubits. Our empirical learning method finds strategies, in constant time independent of circuit width and depth, provides stable performance over long time periods without retraining, and generalizes to larger circuits when trained on small subcircuit structures.

AB The design of cryogenic silicon circuits has gained much importance in recent years, in particular for applications such as quantum computers that require interface electronics with ultra-low levels of power consumption at temperatures as low as 4 K. The design of these circuits is complicated due to the lack of standard design kits for their simulation at these temperatures. Alternative approaches to avoid costly design and fabrication cycles are possible, in particular the use of Look-Up-Table (LUT)-based techniques that exploit the characterization of components at cryogenic temperature. In this paper, we illustrate this approach for the design of an RF Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) using a 28 nm FD-SOI technology that has been characterized at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Dissipation-induced nonreciprocal magnon blockade in a magnon-based
   hybrid system
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB We propose an experimentally realizable nonreciprocal magnonic device at the single-magnon level by exploiting magnon blockade in a magnon-based hybrid system. The coherent qubit-magnon coupling, mediated by virtual photons in a microwave cavity, leads to the energy-level anharmonicity of the composite modes. In contrast, the corresponding dissipative counterpart, induced by traveling microwaves in a waveguide, yields inhomogeneous broadenings of the energy levels. As a result, the cooperative effects of these two kinds of interactions give rise to the emergence of the direction-dependent magnon blockade. We show that this can be demonstrated by studying the equal-time second-order correlation function of the magnon mode. Our study opens an avenue to engineer nonreciprocal magnonic devices in the quantum regime involving only a small number of magnons.

TI Proposal for Entangling Gates on Fluxonium Qubits via a Two-Photon
   Transition
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a family of microwave-activated entangling gates on two capacitively coupled fluxonium qubits. A microwave pulse applied to either qubit at a frequency near the half-frequency of the vertical bar 00 >-vertical bar 11 > transition induces two-photon Rabi oscillations with a negligible leakage outside the computational subspace, owing to the strong anharmonicity of fluxoniums. By adjusting the drive frequency, amplitude, and duration, we obtain the gate family that is locally equivalent to the fermionic-simulation gates such as root SWAP-like and controlled-phase gates. The gate error can be tuned below 10(-4) for a pulse duration under 100 ns without excessive circuit parameter matching. Given that the fluxonium coherence time can exceed 1 ms, our gate scheme is promising for large-scale quantum processors.

TI Improved Attacks on LowMC with Algebraic Techniques
SO IACR TRANSACTIONS ON SYMMETRIC CRYPTOLOGY
AB The LowMC family of SPN block cipher proposed by Albrecht et al. was designed specifically for MPC-/FHE-/ZKP-friendly use cases. It is especially used as the underlying block cipher of PICNIC, one of the alternate third-round candidate digital signature algorithms for NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization. The security of PICNIC is highly related to the difficulty of recovering the secret key of LowMC from a given plaintext/ciphertext pair, which raises new challenges for security evaluation under extremely low data complexity. In this paper, we improve the attacks on LowMC under low data complexity, i.e. 1 or 2 chosen plaintext/ciphertext pairs. For the difference enumeration attack with 2 chosen plaintexts, we propose new algebraic methods to better exploit the nonlinear relation inside the introduced variables based on the attack framework proposed by Liu et al. at ASIACRYPT 2022. With this technique, we significantly extend the number of attack rounds for LowMC with partial nonlinear layers and improve the success probability from around 0.5 to over 0.9. The security margin of some instances can be reduced to only 3/4 rounds. For the key-recovery attack using a single plaintext, we adopt a different linearization strategy to reduce the huge memory consumption caused by the polynomial methods for solving multivariate equation systems. The memory complexity reduces drastically for all 5-/6-round LowMC instances with full nonlinear layers at the sacrifice of a small factor of time complexity. For 5-round LowMC instances with a block size of 129, the memory complexity decreases from 286.46 bits to 248.18 bits while the time complexity even slightly reduces. Our results indicate that the security for different instances of LowMC under extremely low data complexity still needs further exploration.

TI Imperfect 1-Out-of-2 Quantum Oblivious Transfer: Bounds, a Protocol, and
   its Experimental Implementation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Oblivious transfer is an important primitive in modern cryptography. Applications include secure multiparty computation, oblivious sampling, e-voting, and signatures. Information-theoretically secure perfect 1-out-of 2 oblivious transfer is impossible to achieve. Imperfect variants, where both participants' ability to cheat is still limited, are possible using quantum means while remaining classically impossible. Precisely what security parameters are attainable remains unknown. We introduce a theoretical framework for studying semirandom quantum oblivious transfer, which is shown to be equivalent to regular oblivious transfer in terms of cheating probabilities. We then use it to derive bounds on cheating. We also present a protocol with lower cheating probabilities than previous schemes, together with its optical realization. We show that a lower bound of 2/3 on the minimum achievable cheating probability can be directly derived for semirandom protocols using a different method and definition of cheating than used previously. The lower bound increases from 2/3 to approximately 0.749 if the states output by the protocol are pure and symmetric. The oblivious transfer scheme we present uses unambiguous state elimination measurements and can be implemented with the same technological requirements as standard quantum cryptography. In particular, it does not require honest participants to prepare or measure entangled states. The cheating probabilities are 3/4 and approximately 0.729 for sender and receiver, respectively, which is lower than in existing protocols. Using a photonic testbed, we have implemented the protocol with honest parties, as well as optimal cheating strategies. Because of the asymmetry of the receiver's and sender's cheating probabilities, the protocol can be combined with a "trivial" protocol to achieve an overall protocol with lower average cheating probabilities of approximately 0.74 for both sender and receiver. This demonstrates that, interestingly, protocols where the final output states are pure and symmetric are not optimal in terms of average cheating probability.

TI Recycling qubits in near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computers are capable of efficiently contracting unitary tensor networks, a task that is likely to remain difficult for classical computers. For instance, networks based on matrix product states or the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz can be contracted on a small quantum computer to aid the simulation of a large quantum system. However, without the ability to selectively reset qubits, the associated spatial cost can be exorbitant. In this paper, we propose a protocol that can unitarily reset qubits when the circuit has a common convolutional form, thus dramatically reducing the spatial cost for implementing the contraction algorithm on general near-term quantum computers. This protocol generates fresh qubits from used ones by partially applying the time-reversed quantum circuit over qubits that are no longer in use. In the absence of noise, we prove that the state of a subset of these qubits becomes vertical bar 0 . . . 0 , up to an error exponentially small in the number of gates applied. We also provide numerical evidence that the protocol works in the presence of noise and formulate a condition under which the noise-resilience follows rigorously.

TI Machine learning on quantum experimental data toward solving quantum
   many-body problems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Advancements in the implementation of quantum hardware have enabled the acquisition of data that are intractable for emulation with classical computers. The integration of classical machine learning (ML) algorithms with these data holds potential for unveiling obscure patterns. Although this hybrid approach extends the class of efficiently solvable problems compared to using only classical computers, this approach has been only realized for solving restricted problems because of the prevalence of noise in current quantum computers. Here, we extend the applicability of the hybrid approach to problems of interest in many-body physics, such as predicting the properties of the ground state of a given Hamiltonian and classifying quantum phases. By performing experiments with various error-reducing procedures on superconducting quantum hardware with 127 qubits, we managed to acquire refined data from the quantum computer. This enabled us to demonstrate the successful implementation of theoretically suggested classical ML algorithms for systems with up to 44 qubits. Our results verify the scalability and effectiveness of the classical ML algorithms for processing quantum experimental data.

TI Lattice-based provable data possession in the standard model for
   cloud-based smart grid data management systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB The smart grid is considered to be the next-generation electric power network. In a smart grid, there are massive data to be processed, so cloud computing is introduced into it to form a cloud-based smart grid data management system. However, with data no longer being stored locally, how to ensure the integrity of data stored in the cloud in the smart grid has become an urgent problem awaiting solution. Provable data possession has been proposed to solve this problem. With the development of quantum computer technology, quantum attacks-resistant cryptographic schemes are gradually entering people's horizons. Lattice cryptography can resist quantum attacks. In this article, a lattice-based provable data possession scheme is proposed for cloud-based smart grid data management systems. The scheme is proved unforgeable under the small integer solution hard assumption in the standard model. Compared with other two efficient lattice-based provable data possession schemes in the standard model, our scheme also shows efficiency.

TI High-efficiency self-focusing metamaterial grating coupler in silicon
   nitride with amorphous silicon overlay
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Efficient fiber-chip coupling interfaces are critically important for integrated photonics. Since surface gratings diffract optical signals vertically out of the chip, these couplers can be placed anywhere in the circuit allowing for wafer-scale testing. While state-of-the-art grating couplers have been developed for silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides, the moderate index contrast of silicon nitride (SiN) presents an outstanding challenge for implementing efficient surface grating couplers on this platform. Due to the reduced grating strength, a longer structure is required to radiate the light from the chip which produces a diffracted field that is too wide to couple into the fiber. In this work, we present a novel grating coupler architecture for silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits that utilizes an amorphous silicon (alpha-Si) overlay. The high refractive index of the alpha-Si overlay breaks the coupler's vertical symmetry which increases the directionality. We implement subwavelength metamaterial apodization to optimize the overlap of the diffracted field with the optical fiber Gaussian mode profile. Furthermore, the phase of the diffracted beam is engineered to focalize the field into an SMF-28 optical fiber placed 55 mu m above the surface of the chip. The coupler was designed using rigorous three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations supported by genetic algorithm optimization. Our grating coupler has a footprint of 26.8 x 32.7 mu m2 and operates in the O-band centered at 1.31 mu m. It achieves a high directionality of 85% and a field overlap of 90% with a target fiber mode size of 9.2 mu m at the focal plane. Our simulations predict a peak coupling efficiency of - 1.3 dB with a 1-dB bandwidth of 31 nm. The alpha-Si/SiN grating architecture presented in this work enables the development of compact and efficient optical interfaces for SiN integrated photonics circuits with applications including optical communications, sensing, and quantum photonics.

TI Quantum circuit unoptimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Optimization of circuits is an essential task for both quantum and classical computers to improve their efficiency. In contrast, classical logic optimization is known to be difficult, and a lot of heuristic approaches have been developed so far. In this paper, we define and construct a quantum algorithmic primitive called quantum circuit unoptimization, which makes a given quantum circuit complex by introducing some redundancies while preserving circuit equivalence, i.e., the inverse operation of circuit optimization. Using quantum circuit unoptimization, we propose the quantum circuit equivalence test, a decision problem contained both in NP and BQP classes, but is not trivially included in the P class. Furthermore, as a practical application, we construct concrete unoptimization recipes to generate compiler benchmarks and evaluate circuit optimization performance using QISKIT and PYTKET. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the quantum circuit unoptimizer systematically generates redundant circuits that are challenging for compilers to optimize, which can be used to compare the performance of different compilers and improve them. We also offer potential applications of quantum circuit unoptimization, such as generating quantum advantageous machine learning data sets and quantum computer fidelity benchmarks.

TI Controlling Synthetic Spin-Orbit Coupling in a Silicon Quantum Dot with
   Magnetic Field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Tunable synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SSOC) is one of the key challenges in various quantum systems, such as ultracold atomic gases, topological superconductors, and semiconductor quantum dots. Here we experimentally demonstrate controlling the SSOC by investigating the anisotropy of spin-valley resonance in a silicon quantum dot. As we rotate the applied magnetic field in plane, we find a striking nonsinusoidal behavior of resonance amplitude that distinguishes SSOC from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (ISOC), and associate this behavior with the previously overlooked in-plane transverse magnetic field gradient. Moreover, by theoretically analyzing the experimentally measured SSOC field, we predict the quality factor of the spin qubit could be optimized if the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field is rotated away from the traditional working point.

TI Alleviating optical pumping inhomogeneity using a polarization-encoded
   metasurface in NMR co-magnetometers
SO MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING
AB In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) co-magnetometers, the non-uniform transverse energy distribution of the pumping Gaussian beam can result in substantial optical pumping inhomogeneity and decoherence of atomic spins, which hinder the improvement of the precision and sensitivity of the sensor. One of the most significant recent technological advances for laser beam homogenization is the utilization of the microlens array system. However, the homogenized characteristics of the microlens array system vary with the propagation distance of the pumping light and are not suitable for chip integration, which will affect the sensitivity and compactness of the NMR system. To solve this issue, a metasurface homogenizer is demonstrated for encoding intensity information into the polarization profile of an incident Gaussian beam by combining the geometric phase and Malus' law with the transverse intensity distribution independent of the propagation distance. Compared to Gaussian beam pumping at identical input power, the metasurface homogenizer enhances the measured optical magnetic sensitivity by 23%. The proposed metasurface homogenizer not only realizes the higher precision and sensitivity in NMR co-magnetometers, but also highlights how metasurface-based technologies can contribute to the integrated quantum sensing regime.

While superradiance or collective dissipative emission by itself has been typically a detrimental effect for entanglement generation in optical cavities, in the presence of additional drives it can also be used as an entanglement resource. In a recent work [B. Sundar, D. Barberena, A. M. Rey, and A. Pineiro Orioli, companion paper, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 033601 (2024)], we described a protocol for the dissipative generation of two-mode squeezing in the dark state of a six-level system with only one relevant polarization. There we showed that up to two quadratures can be squeezed. Here, we develop a generalized analytic treatment to calculate the squeezing in any multilevel system where atoms can collectively decay by emitting light into two polarization modes in a cavity. We show that in this more general system up to four spin squeezed quadratures can be obtained. We study how finite-size effects constrain the reachable squeezing, and analytically compute the scaling with N. Our findings are readily testable in current optical cavity experiments with alkaline-earth-like atoms.

TI Super-Resolution Airy Disk Microscopy of Individual Color Centers in
   Diamond
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Super-resolution imaging techniques enable nanoscale microscopy in fields such as physics, biology, and chemistry. However, many super-resolution techniques require specialized optical components, such as a helical-phase mask. We present a novel technique, super-resolution Airy disk microscopy, that can be used in a standard confocal microscope without any specialized optics. We demonstrate this technique, in combination with ground state depletion, to image and control nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in bu l k diamond below the diffraction limit. A greater than 14-fold improvement in resolution compared to the diffraction l i m i t is achieved, corresponding to a spatial resolution of 16.9(8) nm for a 1.3 NA microscope with 589 nm light. We make use of our enhanced spatial resolution to control the spins states of individual NV centers separated from each other by less than the diffraction l i m i t , including pairs sharing the same orientation that are indistinguishable with a conventional electron resonance measurement.

TI Sub-nanosecond coherent optical manipulation of a single aromatic
   molecule at cryogenic temperature
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Single molecules trapped in the solid state at liquid helium temperatures are promising quantum emitters for the development of quantum technologies owing to their remarkable photostability and their lifetime-limited optical coherence time of the order of 10 ns. The coherent preparation of their electronic state requires resonant excitation with a Rabi period much shorter than their optical coherence time. Sculpting the optical excitation with sharp edges and a high on-off intensity ratio (similar to 3 x 10(5)) from a single-frequency laser beam, we demonstrate sub-nanosecond drive of a single dibenzanthanthrene molecule embedded in a naphthalene matrix at 3.2 K, over more than 17 Rabi periods. With pulses tailored for a half-Rabi period, the electronic excited state is prepared with fidelity as high as 0.97. Using single-molecule Ramsey spectroscopy, we prove up to 5 K that the optical coherence lifetime remains at its fundamental upper limit set by twice the excited-state lifetime, making single molecules suitable for quantum bit manipulations under standard cryogen-free cooling technologies.

TI Integrating Metamaterial Antenna Node and LiFi for Privacy Preserving
   Intelligent COVID-19 Hospital Patient Management
SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
AB Light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) can be applied with the same network under the different constraints, which is suitable for COVID-19 surveillance in hospitals. The LiFi network is a high-capacity and security platform. A COVID-19 surveillance system using LiFi is proposed, which consists of two switching modes: communication and surveillance. Firstly, the communication targets are to accommodate the electromagnetic interference (EMI) immunity and high-capacity and security data transmission, where secondly the COVID-19 surveillance can be applied. In operation, the up and downlink system uses a metamaterial antenna embedded by Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI). An antenna consists of silver bars embedded at the microring center with two-phase modulators at its sides. The entangled source namely a dark soliton is applied to form the transmission, where the information security based on quantum cryptography can be managed. By using the suitable parameters, the whispering gallery modes (WGMs) are generated and the up and downlink nodes are formed. The input information is multiplexed with time to form the multiplexed signals, where the big data transmission (40 Pbit s(-1)) can be employed. By using the surveillance mode, the plasmonic antenna can be applied for temperature and electric force sensors, which can offer the disinfectant spray and temperature sensor for COVID-19 applications. The optimum plasma force sensitivity is 0.16 N kg(-1) mW(-1). The center frequencies of 191.48 THz and 199.41 THz are obtained for uplink and downlink antennas, respectively. The optimum temperature sensitivity is 0.05 rads(-1) degrees C-1. In conclusion, the novelty of proposed work is that the integrated sensor circuits are employed for COVID-19 surveillance in the hospital. The fuzzy-based system is designed for critical patient monitoring alert using this surveillance and management inside the hospital for COVID-19 patients.

TI Influence of gate work function variations on characteristics of
   fin-shaped silicon quantum dot device with multi-gate under existence of
   gate electrostatic coupling
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB We explored the effects of gate work function variation (WFV) through device simulation on a fin-shaped silicon quantum dot device with a multi-gate configuration for a large-scale integrated array. The threshold voltage (Vth) of current-voltage characteristics is affected by WFV in both main and surrounding gates, indicating the existence of electrostatic coupling among these gates. The electrostatic coupling can be reduced by biasing on the surrounding gates. Furthermore, the concept of Vth, following conventional transistors, works as a reference of voltage and potential in the present multi-gate device. This knowledge contributes to establishing a practical method for the statistical analysis of qubit variability.

TI Estimation of Convex Polytopes for Automatic Discovery of Charge State
   Transitions in Quantum Dot Arrays
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In spin based quantum dot arrays, material or fabrication imprecisions affect the behaviour of the device, which must be taken into account when controlling it. This requires measuring the shape of specific convex polytopes. We present an algorithm that automatically discovers count, shape and size of the facets of a convex polytope from measurements by alternating a phase of model-fitting with a phase of querying new measurements, based on the fitted model. We evaluate the algorithm on simulated polytopes and devices, as well as a real 2 x 2 spin qubit array. Results show that we can reliably find the facets of the convex polytopes, including small facets with sizes on the order of the measurement precision.

TI Spin-Boson Quantum Phase Transition in Multilevel Superconducting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Superconducting circuits are currently developed as a versatile platform for the exploration of manybody physics, by building on nonlinear elements that are often idealized as two-level qubits. A classic example is given by a charge qubit that is capacitively coupled to a transmission line, which leads to the celebrated spin-boson description of quantum dissipation. We show that the intrinsic multilevel structure of superconducting qubits drastically restricts the validity of the spin-boson paradigm due to phase localization, which spreads the wave function over many charge states. Numerical renormalization group simulations also show that the quantum critical point moves out of the physically accessible range in the multilevel regime. Imposing charge discreteness in a simple variational state accounts for these multilevel effects, which are relevant for a large class of devices.

TI Extreme quantum nonlinearity in superfluid thin-film surface waves
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We show that highly confined superfluid films are extremely nonlinear mechanical resonators, offering the prospect to realize a mechanical qubit. Specifically, we consider third-sound surface waves, with nonlinearities introduced by the van der Waals interaction with the substrate. Confining these waves to a disk, we derive analytic expressions for the cubic and quartic nonlinearities and determine the resonance frequency shifts they introduce. We predict single-phonon shifts that are three orders of magnitude larger than in current state-of-the-art nonlinear resonators. Combined with the exquisitely low intrinsic dissipation of superfluid helium and the strongly suppressed acoustic radiation loss in phononic crystal cavities, we predict that this could allow blockade interactions between phonons as well as two-level-system-like behavior. Our work provides a pathway towards extreme mechanical nonlinearities, and towards quantum devices that use mechanical resonators as qubits.

TI Improving application performance with biased distributions of quantum
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider the properties of a specific distribution of mixed quantum states of arbitrary dimension that can be biased towards a specific mean purity. In particular, we analyze mixtures of Haar-random pure states with Dirichlet-distributed coefficients. We analytically derive the concentration parameters required to match the mean purity of the Bures and Hilbert-Schmidt distributions in any dimension. Numerical simulations suggest that this value recovers the Hilbert-Schmidt distribution exactly, offering an alternative and intuitive physical interpretation for ensembles of Hilbert-Schmidt-distributed random quantum states. We then demonstrate how substituting these Dirichlet-weighted Haar mixtures in place of the Bures and Hilbert-Schmidt distributions results in measurable performance advantages in machine-learning-based quantum state tomography systems and Bayesian quantum state reconstruction. Finally, we experimentally characterize the distribution of quantum states generated by both a cloud-accessed IBM quantum computer and an in-house source of polarization-entangled photons. In each case, our method can more closely match the underlying distribution than either Bures or Hilbert-Schmidt distributed states for various experimental conditions.

TI Estimating Trotter approximation errors to optimize Hamiltonian
   partitioning for lower eigenvalue errors
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Trotter approximation in conjunction with quantum phase estimation can be used to extract eigen-energies of a many-body Hamiltonian on a quantum computer. There were several ways proposed to assess the quality of this approximation based on estimating the norm of the difference between the exact and approximate evolution operators. Here, we explore how different error estimators for various partitionings correlate with the true error in the ground state energy due to Trotter approximation. For a set of small molecules we calculate these exact error in ground-state electronic energies due to the second-order Trotter approximation. Comparison of these errors with previously used upper bounds show correlation less than 0.5 across various Hamiltonian partitionings. On the other hand, building the Trotter approximation error estimation based on perturbation theory up to a second order in the time-step for eigenvalues provides estimates with very good correlations with the exact Trotter approximation errors. These findings highlight the non-faithful character of norm-based estimations for prediction of best Hamiltonian partitionings and the need for perturbative estimates.

AB Grover's Adaptative Search (GAS) algorithm combined with the High Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) oracle proposal is currently the Fault Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC)'s main algorithm to solve binary optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a new way to obtain the Grover's oracle needed which is costless in terms of gates and ancilla qubits. This oracle proposal also has zero additional costs linked to decimal numbers of the problem weights and a very small overcost due to high order problems with respect to the other proposals. Nevertheless, it cannot be easily adapted to constrained problems. This new oracle is based on a completely different approach, which uses Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) techniques and amplitude encoding. This method can also be described in the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) framework as a variant of eigenstate search algorithms. Our oracle combines the benefits of both the QS VT amplitude encoding of the problem and GAS strategies to seek eigenvalues.

TI Broadband Fourier transform spectroscopy of quantum emitters
   photoluminescence with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast time scales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be of the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond time scales.

TI Role of bases in quantum optimal control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum optimal control (QOC) supports the advance of quantum technologies by tackling its problems at the pulse level: numerical approaches iteratively work toward a given target by parametrizing the applied time-dependent fields with a finite set of variables. The effectiveness of the resulting optimization depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of variables. We consider different parametrizations in terms of basis functions, asking whether the choice of the applied basis affects the quality of the optimization. Furthermore, we consider strategies to choose the most suitable basis. For comparison, we test three different randomizable bases-introducing the sinc and sigmoid bases as alternatives to the Fourier basis-on QOC problems of varying complexity. For each problem, the basis-specific convergence rates result in a unique ranking. Especially for expensive evaluations, e.g., in closed loop, a potential speedup by a factor of up to 10 may be crucial for the optimization's feasibility. We conclude that a problem-dependent basis choice is an influential factor for QOC efficiency and provide advice for its approach.

TI Gate control of superconducting current: Mechanisms, parameters, and
   technological potential
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB In conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, the logic state of a device is set by a gate voltage (V-G). The superconducting equivalent of such effect had remained unknown until it was recently shown that a V-G can tune the superconducting current (supercurrent) flowing through a nanoconstriction in a superconductor. This gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) can lead to superconducting logics like CMOS logics, but with lower energy dissipation. The physical mechanism underlying the GCS, however, remains under debate. In this review article, we illustrate the main mechanisms proposed for the GCS, and the material and device parameters that mostly affect it based on the evidence reported. We conclude that different mechanisms are at play in the different studies reported so far. We then outline studies that can help answer open questions on the effect and achieve control over it, which is key for applications. We finally give insights into the impact that the GCS can have toward high-performance computing with low-energy dissipation and quantum technologies. (C) 2024 Author(s).

TI Revealing subterahertz atomic vibrations in quantum paraelectrics by
   surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Understanding surface collective dynamics in quantum materials is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to be essential in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz, is challenging because of limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3 and SrTiO3 by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 terahertz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3 broadens substantially below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub-milli-electron volt phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface collective excitations.

TI Molecular beam epitaxy and other large-scale methods for producing
   monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD/TMDC) monolayers have gained considerable attention in recent years for their unique properties. Some of these properties include direct bandgap emission and strong mechanical and electronic properties. For these reasons, monolayer TMDs have been considered a promising material for next-generation quantum technologies and optoelectronic devices. However, for the field to make more gainful advancements and be implemented in devices, high-quality TMD monolayers need to be produced at a larger scale with high quality. In this article, some of the current means to produce larger-scale semiconducting monolayer TMDs will be reviewed. An emphasis will be given to the technique of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for two main reasons: (1) there is a growing body of research using this technique to grow TMD monolayers and (2) there is yet to be a body of work that has summarized the current research for MBE monolayer growth of TMDs.

TI The Effect of Monomer Size on Fusion and Coupling in Colloidal Quantum
   Dot Molecules
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The fusion step in the formation of colloidal quantum dot molecules, constructed from two core/shell quantum dots, dictates the coupling strength and hence their properties and enriched functionalities compared to monomers. Herein, studying the monomer size effect on fusion and coupling, we observe a linear relation of the fusion temperature with the inverse nanocrystal radius. This trend, similar to that in nanocrystal melting, emphasizes the role of the surface energy. The suggested fusion mechanism involves intraparticle ripening where atoms diffuse to the reactive connecting neck region. Moreover, the effect of monomer size and neck filling on the degree of electronic coupling is studied by combined atomistic-pseudopotential calculations and optical measurements, uncovering strong coupling effects in small QD dimers, leading to significant optical changes. Understanding and controlling the fusion and hence coupling effect allows tailoring the optical properties of these nanoscale structures, with potential applications in photonic and quantum technologies.

TI Toward the continuum limit of a (1+1)D quantum link Schwinger model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The solution of gauge theories is one of the most promising applications of quantum technologies. Here, we discuss the approach to the continuum limit for U(1) gauge theories regularized via finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of quantum spin -S operators, known as quantum link models. For quantum electrodynamics (QED) in one spatial dimension, we numerically demonstrate the continuum limit by extrapolating the ground state energy, the scalar, and the vector meson masses to large spin lengths S, large volume N, and vanishing lattice spacing a. By exactly solving Gauss's law for arbitrary S, we obtain a generalized PXP spin model and count the physical Hilbert space dimension analytically. This allows us to quantify the required resources for reliable extrapolations to the continuum limit on quantum devices. We use a functional integral approach to relate the model with large values of half-integer spins to the physics at topological angle Theta 1/4 pi. Our findings indicate that quantum devices will in the foreseeable future be able to quantitatively probe the QED regime with quantum link models.

TI Direct observation of quantum percolation dynamics
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Percolation, describing critical behaviors of phase transition in a geometrical context, prompts wide investigations in natural and social networks as a fundamental model. The introduction of quantum coherence and superposition brings percolation into quantum regime with more fascinating phenomena and unique features, which, however, has not been experimentally explored yet. Here we successfully map these large-scale porous structures into a photonic chip using femtosecond laser direct writing techniques and present an experimental demonstration of quantum transport in hexagonal percolation lattices, probed by coherent light. A quantum percolation threshold of 80% is observed in the prototyped laser-written lattices with up to 1,600 waveguides, which is significantly larger than the classical counterpart of 63%. We also investigate the spatial confinement by localization parameters and exhibit the transition from ballistic to diffusive propagation with the decrease of the occupation probability. Direct observation of quantum percolation may deepen the understanding of the relation among materials, quantum transport, geometric quenching, disorder and localization, and inspire applications for quantum technologies.

TI Collisional losses of ultracold molecules due to intermediate complex
   formation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the properties of intermediate four-atom complexes formed in bimolecular collisions, which may have the critical role for understanding of losses in experiments with ultracold alkali-metal molecules. We show that the variation in the nuclear spin-spin and quadrupole couplings may be strong enough to couple different rotational manifolds resulting in an increase in the density of states and lifetimes of the collision complexes. We estimate the nuclear spin-rotation, spin-spin, and quadrupole coupling constants for bialkali four-atom complexes using ab initio quantum-chemical methods and model the reaction kinetics using an extended rate equation approach. We also reveal that the interaction-induced variation of the electron spin-nuclear spin couplings may explain the recently observed long lifetime of alkali-metal three-atom complexes formed in atom-molecule collisions. Our results can be helpful for interpreting recent experimental data obtained with nonreactive systems which reported unexpectedly large loss rates and for designing future experiments utilizing polar molecules for the purpose of precision measurements and quantum technologies.

TI Optimal entanglement witness for Cooper pair splitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The generation of spin-entangled electrons is an important prerequisite for future solid-state quantum technologies. Cooper pairs in a superconductor can be split into separate electrons in a spin-singlet state, however, detecting their entanglement remains an open experimental challenge. Proposals to detect the entanglement by violating a Bell inequality typically require a large number of current cross-correlation measurements, and not all entangled states can be detected in this way. Here, we instead formulate an entanglement witness that can detect the spin-entanglement using only three cross-correlation measurements of the currents in the outputs of a Cooper pair splitter. We identify the optimal measurement settings for witnessing the entanglement, and we illustrate the use of our entanglement witness with a realistic model of a Cooper pair splitter for which we evaluate the cross-correlations of the output currents. Specifically, we find that the entanglement of the spins can be detected even with a moderate level of decoherence. Our work thereby paves the way for an experimental detection of the entanglement produced by Cooper pair splitters.

TI Self-organized topological insulator due to cavity-mediated correlated
   tunneling
SO QUANTUM
AB Topological materials have potential applications for quantum technologies. Non-interacting topological materials, such as e.g., topological insulators and superconductors, are classified by means of fundamental symmetry classes. It is instead only partially understood how interactions affect topological properties. Here, we discuss a model where topology emerges from the quantum interference between single-particle dynamics and global interactions. The system is composed by soft-core bosons that interact via global correlated hopping in a one-dimensional lattice. The onset of quantum interference leads to spontaneous breaking of the lattice translational symmetry, the corresponding phase resembles non-trivial states of the celebrated Su-SchrieferHeeger model. Like the fermionic Peierls instability, the emerging quantum phase is a topological insulator and is found at half fillings. Originating from quantum interference, this topological phase is found in "exact" density-matrix renormalization group calculations and is entirely absent in the mean-field approach. We argue that these dynamics can be realized in existing experimental platforms, such as cavity quantum electrodynamics setups, where the topological features can be revealed in the light emitted by the resonator.

TI Delaying two-photon Fock states in hot cesium vapor using single photons
   generated on demand from a semiconductor quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Single photons from solid-state quantum emitters are playing a crucial role in the development of photonic quantum technologies and, by extension, higher order states, such as N-photon Fock states, allow for applications, e.g., in quantum-enhanced sensing. To verify the applicability of these states in future quantum technological implementations involving photon-atom interactions (i.e., storage of a quantum state in alkali vapor and photon delay) we utilize in the present study the dispersion of a hot cesium vapor at the D1 line to realize a temporal delay for two-photon Fock states as a result of the slow-light effect. Single photons are generated on demand from an InGaAs quantum dot, while their quantum interference at a beam splitter is used to generate a two-photon Fock state. We verify the successful propagation and the preservation of the two-photon Fock states after the interaction with the slow-light medium, while a significant temporal delay (five times the initial photon length) is achieved with a high vapor transmission of 90%.

TI Transactional Interpretation and the Generalized Poisson Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB The aim of this paper is to study the quantum-like approach to the description of the market in the context of the principle of minimum Fisher information. We wish to investigate the validity of using squeezed coherent states as market strategies. For this purpose, we focus on the representation of any squeezed coherent state with respect to the basis of the eigenvectors of the observable of market risk. We derive a formula for the probability of being the squeezed coherent state in one of these states. The distribution that we call generalized Poisson establishes the relation between the squeezed coherent states and their description in the language of risk in quantum terms. We provide a formula specifying the total risk of squeezed coherent strategy. Then, we propose a risk of risk concept that is in fact the second central moment of the generalized Poisson distribution. This is an important numerical characterization of squeezed coherent strategies. We provide its interpretations on the basis of the uncertainty relation for time and energy.

TI An entanglement monotone from the contextual fraction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The contextual fraction introduced by Abramsky and Brandenburger defines a quantitative measure of contextuality associated with empirical models, i.e. tables of probabilities of measurement outcomes in experimental scenarios. In this paper we define an entanglement monotone relying on the contextual fraction. We first show that any separable state is necessarily non-contextual with respect to any Bell scenario. Then, for 2-qubit states, we associate a state-dependent Bell scenario and show that the corresponding contextual fraction is an entanglement monotone, suggesting contextuality may be regarded as a refinement of entanglement. We call this monotone the quarter-turn contextual fraction, and use it to set an upper bound of approximately 0.601 for the minimum entanglement entropy needed to guarantee contextuality with respect to some Bell scenario.

AB The lateral growth of Si-quantum dots (QDs) on line-patterned SiO2 from the thermal decomposition of pure monosilane (SiH4) has been systematically examined. We confirmed that the Si-QDs diameter in the line direction of the SiO2 patterns has the same growth rate as the SiO2 thin film surface without the line patterns. Moreover, it has been found that in the growth of Si-QDs in the width direction, a surface migration of Si precursors adsorbed from space regions could contribute to dots growth on line-patterned SiO2, which results in an elliptical growth. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a one-dimensional arrangement of highly dense-elliptical shaped Si-QDs with high uniformity in size by controlling line width, CVD time, and temperature.

TI Scheme for Measuring Topological Transitions in a Continuous Variable
   System
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A scheme for measuring topological properties in a two-photon-driven Kerr-nonlinear (KNR) resonator subjected to a single-photon modulation is proposed. The topological properties are revealed through the observation of the Berry curvature and hence the first Chern number, as a nonadiabatic response of the physical observable to the change rate of the control parameter of the modulated drive. The parameter manifold, constructed from the system's Hamiltonian that determines its dynamics constrained in the state space spanned by the even and odd cat states as two basis states, is adjusted so that the degeneracy crossing the manifold indicates a topological transition. The scheme, with such continuous variable states in mesoscopic systems, provides a new perspective for exploration of the geometry and the related topology with complex systems.

TI An approach to p-adic qubits from irreducible representations of
   SO(3)p
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We introduce the notion of a p-adic quantum bit (p-qubit) in the context of the p-adic quantum mechanics initiated and developed after the seminal paper of Volovich [Theor. Math. Phys. 71, 574 (1987)]. In this approach, physics takes place in a three-dimensional p-adic space rather than Euclidean space. Based on our prior work describing the p-adic special orthogonal group [Di Martino et al., arXiv:2104.06228 [math.NT] (2021)], we outline a program to classify its continuous unitary projective representations, which can be interpreted as a theory of p-adic angular momentum. The p-adic quantum bit arises from the irreducible representations of minimal nontrivial dimension two, of which we construct examples for all primes p.

TI Chemistry of the shallow surface of isolated nanodiamonds probed by
   synchrotron X-ray photoemission
SO NANOSCALE
AB Nanodiamonds (NDs) are under active investigation for their unique properties and potential applications in energy harvesting, quantum technologies, and nanomedicine. The surface chemistry of NDs significantly influences their semiconducting behavior, colloidal properties, and interactions with water and light. To gain deeper insights into these properties, this study employs synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the shallow surface chemistry of isolated nanodiamonds in an aerodynamic jet. Employing a photon energy of 360 eV, we probed the surface of nanodiamonds with a depth of 0.3 nm. Based on the collected data, the band diagrams of the nanoparticles have been established, reporting the expected differences in electron affinity between the two surface chemistries. Interestingly, both Ox-MNDs and H-MNDs showed fairly similar C 1s core level signatures, a phenomenon discussed in detail within the article, including the effect of residual water molecules. This raises important questions about the true interface formed with water molecules when NDs are in an aqueous suspension, particularly in the context of their use as photocatalysts.

TI Accurate heat currents via reorganized master equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The accurate characterization of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganization correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so may yield sizable errors, especially at low or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a "reorganized master equation" can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganization energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its "nonreorganized" counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modeling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganized master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.

TI Long-Term Behaviour in an Exactly Solvable Model of Pure Decoherence and
   the Problem of Markovian Embedding
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We consider a well-known, exactly solvable model of an open quantum system with pure decoherence. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, decoherence is a property of open quantum systems important for both quantum technologies and the fundamental question of the quantum-classical transition. It is worth studying how the long-term rate of decoherence depends on the spectral density characterising the system-bath interaction in this exactly solvable model. Secondly, we address a more general problem of the Markovian embedding of non-Markovian open system dynamics. It is often assumed that a non-Markovian open quantum system can be embedded into a larger Markovian system. However, we show that such embedding is possible only for Ohmic spectral densities (for the case of a positive bath temperature) and is impossible for both sub- and super-Ohmic spectral densities. On the other hand, for Ohmic spectral densities, an asymptotic large-time Markovianity (in terms of the quantum regression formula) takes place.

TI Analytical Solutions of the Driven Time-Dependent Jaynes-Cummings Model
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This study explores the dynamics of a Driven Time-Dependent Jaynes-Cummings (DTDJC) model, in which the atom and the field are influenced by an external classical field with time-varying amplitude modulation. By applying a series of unitary transformations and establishing suitable conditions for the time-dependent parameters of the system, the Hamiltonian operator is transformed into one representing a system not driven by an external field, namely a Free TDJC (FTDJC) system. This mapping allows us to determine, in both the time-independent and time-dependent cases, forms of the pumping modulating the field and the atomic population that are amenable to exact analytical solution. The effects of an off-resonance parameter emerging from the analytical solution of the model and the intensity of the classical pumping field on the dynamics of the atomic population are investigated. The exact solution allows us to reveal a rich dynamics of the system (including long-time super-revivals) that could be of use in future quantum technologies.

TI Enhanced Superconductivity in 2H-TaS2 Devices through in Situ
   Molecular Intercalation
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The intercalation of guest species into the gap of van der Waals materials often leads to the emergence of intriguing phenomena such as superconductivity. While intercalation-induced superconductivity has been reported in several bulk crystals, reaching a zero-resistance state in flakes remains challenging. Here, we show a simple method for enhancing the superconducting transition in tens-of-nanometers thick 2H-TaS2 crystals contacted by gold electrodes through in situ intercalation. Our approach enables measuring the electrical characteristics of the same flake before and after intercalation, permitting us to precisely identify the effect of the guest species on the TaS2 transport properties. We find that the intercalation of amylamine molecules into TaS2 flakes causes a suppression of the charge density wave and an increase in the superconducting transition with an onset temperature above 3 K. Additionally, we show that a fully developed zero-resistance state can be achieved in flakes by engineering the conditions of the chemical intercalation. Our findings pave the way for the integration of chemically tailored intercalation compounds in scalable quantum technologies.

TI Probing Non-Equilibrium Pair-Breaking and Quasiparticle Dynamics in Nb
   Superconducting Resonators Under Magnetic Fields
SO MATERIALS
AB We conducted a comprehensive study of the non-equilibrium dynamics of Cooper pair breaking, quasiparticle (QP) generation, and relaxation in niobium (Nb) cut from superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities, as well as various Nb resonator films from transmon qubits. Using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy, we were able to isolate the superconducting coherence and pair-breaking responses. Our results reveal both similarities and notable differences in the temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent dynamics of the SRF cavity and thin-film resonator samples. Moreover, femtosecond-resolved QP generation and relaxation under an applied magnetic field reveals a clear correlation between non-equilibrium QPs and the quality factor of resonators fabricated by using different deposition methods, such as DC sputtering and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering. These findings highlight the pivotal influence of fabrication techniques on the coherence and performance of Nb-based quantum devices, which are vital for applications in superconducting qubits and high-energy superconducting radio-frequency applications.

TI A dissipation-induced superradiant transition in a strontium cavity-QED
   system
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Driven-dissipative many-body systems are ubiquitous in nature and a fundamental resource for quantum technologies. However, they are also complex and hard to model because they cannot be described by the standard tools in equilibrium statistical mechanics. Probing nonequilibrium critical phenomena in pristine setups can illuminate fresh perspectives on these systems. Here, we use an ensemble of cold 88Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse cavity to study the cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, a classic driven-dissipative model describing coherently driven dipoles superradiantly emitting light. We observe its nonequilibrium phase diagram characterized by a second-order phase transition. Below a critical drive strength, the atoms quickly reach the so-called superradiant steady state featuring a macroscopic dipole moment; above the critical point, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations. At longer times, spontaneous emission transforms the second-order transition into a discontinuous first-order transition. Our observations pave the way for harnessing robust entangled states and exploring boundary time crystals in driven-dissipative systems.

TI Quantum mechanics curriculum in the US: Quantifying the instructional
   time, content taught, and paradigms used
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB Quantum mechanics is an integral course for physics students. An understanding of quantum concepts is imperative for enrollment in physics graduate programs, participating in research within physics fields, and employment with companies developing quantum technologies. This study analyzes 188 U.S. research-intensive institutions' course catalogs to determine the role and extent of quantum mechanics in their undergraduate physics programs. All of the institutions required one course on quantum concepts, 92% required two courses, and half required three. Among institutions with complete class data (n 1/4 56), the quantum curriculum was analyzed using course syllabi. The mean number of classroom hours spent on quantum concepts was 63.5 h with a standard deviation of 28.1 h. The most commonly taught themes in the quantum curriculum were the equation and three-dimensional quantum mechanics. However, the Stern-Gerlach experiment was only included in 28% of the course outlines. Despite current efforts to promote a spin-first approach, this study found the traditional position-first approaches were still more common as they were used by 73.7% of instructors.

TI Probing the Nature of Single-Photon Emitters in a WSe2
   Monolayer by Magneto-Photoluminescence Spectroscopy
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising materials to generate single-photon emitters (SPEs). While there are several previous reports in the literature about TMD-based SPEs, the precise nature of the excitonic states involved in them is still under debate. Here, we use magneto-optical techniques under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields to investigate the nature of SPEs in WSe2 monolayers on glass substrates under different strain profiles. Our results reveal important changes on the exciton localization and, consequently, on the optical properties of SPEs. Remarkably, we observe an anomalous PL energy redshift with no significant changes of photoluminescence (PL) intensity under an in-plane magnetic field. We present a model to explain this redshift based on intervalley defect excitons under a parallel magnetic field. Overall, our results offer important insights into the nature of SPEs in TMDs, which are valuable for future applications in quantum technologies.

AB We study the complexity of determining the edge connectivity of a simple graph with cut queries. We show that (i) there is a bounded-error randomized algorithm that computes edge connectivity with O(n) cut queries, and (ii) there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm that computes edge connectivity with (O) over tilde(root n) cut queries. To prove these results we introduce a new technique, called star contraction, to randomly contract edges of a graph while preserving non-trivial minimum cuts. In star contraction vertices randomly contract an edge incident on a small set of randomly chosen "center" vertices. In contrast to the related 2-out contraction technique of Ghaffari, Nowicki, and Thorup [SODA'20], star contraction only contracts vertex-disjoint star subgraphs, which allows it to be efficiently implemented via cut queries. The O(n) bound from item (i) was not known even for the simpler problem of connectivity, and it improves the O(n log(3) n) upper bound by Rubinstein, Schramm, and Weinberg [ITCS'18]. The bound is tight under the reasonable conjecture that the randomized communication complexity of connectivity is Omega(n log n), an open question since the seminal work of Babai, Frankl, and Simon [FOCS'86]. The bound also excludes using edge connectivity on simple graphs to prove a superlinear randomized query lower bound for minimizing a symmetric submodular function. The quantum algorithm from item (ii) gives a nearlyquadratic separation with the randomized complexity, and addresses an open question of Lee, Santha, and Zhang [SODA'21]. The algorithm can alternatively be viewed as computing the edge connectivity of a simple graph with (O) over tilde(root n) matrix-vector multiplication queries to its adjacency matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the use of star contraction outside of the cut query setting by designing a one-pass semi-streaming algorithm for computing edge connectivity in the complete vertex arrival setting. This contrasts with the edge arrival setting where two passes are required.

TI The quantification of a genuine tetrapartite entanglement in a mixed
   spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The genuine tetrapartite entanglement of a quantum mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer is quantified according to the three different approaches incorporated all seven global bisections existing within the tetrapartite system. The degree of an entanglement of each bisection is evaluated through the bipartite negativity at zero- and non-zero temperature taking into account ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic type of intra- (J) and inter-dimer (J(1)) exchange coupling inside the square plaquette. Three utilized quantification methods based on the generalization of (i) a genuine tripartite negativity, (ii) a Coffman, Kundu and Wootters monogamy relation and (iii) a geometric average of complete trisections, result to the qualitatively and almost quantitatively identical behavior of a genuine tetrapartite negativity. It is shown that the genuine tetrapartite negativity exclusively arises from the antiferromagnetic-inter dimer J(1) > 0 coupling, whereas the character of with respect to J (J > 0 or J<0) determines its zero-temperature magnitude as well as its thermal stability with respect to the magnetic field and temperature. As is demonstrated for 0<J(1)/J < 1 the genuine tetrapartite negativity is dramatically reduced due to the preference of magnetic arrangement involving two separable mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers. In an opposite limit the genuine tetrapartite negativity is significantly stable with a threshold temperature proportional to the strength of an inter-dimer coupling J(1). It is found, that all three quantification procedures are insufficient to correctly describe the genuine tetrapartite negativity in a specific part of the parameter space with absence of relevant dimer separable states. Finally, the thermal stability of a genuine tetrapartite negativity is discussed in detail for selected geometries motivated by the real tetranuclear bimetallic complexes with a Cu2Ni2 magnetic core.

TI Accelerating First-Order Secure ML-KEM With Masked SHA-3: Cost,
   Randomness, and Security Evaluation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Hash functions are fundamental for ensuring authenticity and integrity in digital communications. Their importance has grown with the advent of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), as many newly standardized PQC algorithms, such as ML-KEM, heavily rely on hash functions for pseudo-random number generation. Among available standards, SHA-3, published by NIST in 2015, is the recommended choice for PQC applications. However, its adoption in embedded platforms remains limited, particularly in the presence of security threats such as side-channel attacks (SCAs). To mitigate SCAs, masking techniques are widely employed, but their implementation on SHA-3 accelerators is complex due to the non-linearity of the Keccak function. Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM) provides strong security guarantees but requires a significant amount of randomness, introducing additional implementation costs often overlooked in the literature. For instance, existing DOM implementations of Keccak demand 1600 bits of fresh randomness per clock cycle, raising practical concerns about randomness generation and deployment overhead. In this work, we present a hardware accelerator supporting all the SHA-3 functions with first-order masking countermeasure based on a DOM implementation of the Keccak core. For the generation of the randomness required by the DOM countermeasure, we implemented a randomness dispatcher based on Trivium and Bivium ciphers, and we evaluated the cost in terms of area of the circuit in FPGA and ASIC of the countermeasure and of the randomness generation. In addition, we assess its security through Test Vector Leakage Assessment on FPGA. Finally, the accelerator is integrated into a RISC-V-based 32-bit SoC and used to accelerate a first-order masked implementation of ML-KEM, achieving a speed-up ranging from 95x to 264x for the SHA-3-based functions of the KEM decapsulation.

TI One- and two-dimensional quantum lattice algorithms for Maxwell
   equations in inhomogeneous scalar dielectric media. II: Simulations
SO RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS
AB Long-time quantum lattice algorithm (QLA) simulations are performed for the multiple reflection-transmission of an initial electromagnetic pulse propagating normally to a boundary layer region joining two media of different refractive index. For these one-dimensional (1D) simulations, there is excellent agreement between x-, y- and z-representations, as well as very good agreement with nearly all the standard plane wave boundary condition results for reflection and transmission off a dielectric discontinuity. In the QLA simulation, no boundary conditions are imposed at the continuous, but sharply increasing, dielectric boundary layers. Two-dimensional (2D) QLA scattering simulations in the x-z plane are performed for an electromagnetic pulse interacting with a conical dielectric obstacle for the 8-16 qubit model.

TI Iterative quantum-assisted eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The task of estimating the ground state of Hamiltonians is an important problem in physics with numerous applications ranging from solid-state physics to combinatorial optimization. We provide a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating the ground state of a Hamiltonian that builds on the powerful Krylov subspace method in a way that is suitable for current quantum computers. Our algorithm systematically constructs the ansatz by using any given choice of the initial state and the unitaries describing the Hamiltonian. The only task of the quantum computer is to measure overlaps and no feedback loops are required. The measurements can be performed efficiently on current quantum hardware without requiring any complicated measurements such as the Hadamard test. Finally, a classical computer solves a well-characterized quadratically constrained optimization program. Our algorithm can reuse previous measurements to calculate the ground state of a wide range of Hamiltonians without requiring additional quantum resources. Further, we demonstrate our algorithm for solving a class of problems with thousands of qubits. The algorithm works for almost every random choice of the initial state and circumvents the barren plateau problem.

TI Experimental demonstration of breakeven for a compact fermionic encoding
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Solving the Fermi-Hubbard model is a central task in the study of strongly correlated materials. Digital quantum computers can, in principle, be suitable for this purpose, but have so far been limited to quasi-one-dimensional models. This is because of exponential overheads caused by the interplay of noise and the non-locality of the mapping between fermions and qubits. Here we use a trapped-ion quantum computer to experimentally demonstrate that a recently developed local encoding can overcome this problem. In particular, we show that suitable reordering of terms and application of circuit identities-a scheme called corner hopping-substantially reduces the cost of simulating fermionic hopping. This enables the efficient preparation of the ground state of a 6 x 6 spinless Fermi-Hubbard model encoded in 48 physical qubits. We also develop two error mitigation schemes for systems with conserved quantities, based on local postselection and on extrapolation of local observables, respectively. Our results suggest that Fermi-Hubbard models beyond classical simulability can be addressed by digital quantum computers without large increases in gate fidelity.

TI Simulating Chemistry with Fermionic Optical Superlattices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We show that quantum-number-preserving ansatzes for variational optimization in quantum chemistry find an elegant mapping to ultracold fermions in optical superlattices. Using native Hubbard dynamics, trial ground states of molecular Hamiltonians can be prepared and their molecular energies measured in the lattice. The scheme requires local control over interactions and chemical potentials and global control over tunneling dynamics, but foregoes the need for optical tweezers, shuttling operations, or longrange interactions. We describe a complete compilation pipeline from the molecular Hamiltonian to the sequence of lattice operations, thus providing a concrete link between quantum simulation and chemistry. Our work enables the application of recent quantum algorithmic techniques, such as double factorization and quantum tailored coupled cluster, to present-day fermionic optical lattice systems with significant improvements in the required number of experimental repetitions. We provide detailed quantum resource estimates for small nontrivial hardware experiments.

TI Optical Tweezer Arrays of Erbium Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present the first successful trapping of single erbium atoms in an array of optical tweezers. Using a single narrow-line optical transition, we achieve deep cooling for direct tweezer loading, pairwise ejection, and continuous imaging without additional recoil suppression techniques. Our tweezer wavelength choice enables us to reach the magic trapping condition by tuning the ellipticity of the trapping light. Additionally, we implement an ultrafast high-fidelity fluorescence imaging scheme using a broad transition, allowing time-resolved study of the tweezer population dynamics from many to single atoms during light-assisted collisions. In particular, we extract a pair-ejection rate that qualitatively agrees with the semiclassical predictions by the Gallagher-Pritchard model. This Letter represents a promising starting point for the exploration of erbium as a powerful resource for quantum simulation in optical tweezers.

TI Reconstructing effective Hamiltonians from nonequilibrium thermal and
   prethermal steady states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Reconstructing Hamiltonians from local measurements is key to enabling reliable quantum simulations: both validating the implemented model and identifying any leftover terms with sufficient precision is a problem of increasing importance. Here we propose a deep -learning -assisted variational algorithm for Hamiltonian reconstruction by preprocessing a dataset that is diagnosed to contain thermal measurements of local operators. We demonstrate the efficient and precise reconstruction of local Hamiltonians, while long-range interacting Hamiltonians are reconstructed approximately. Away from equilibrium, for periodically and random multipolar driven systems, we reconstruct the effective Hamiltonian widely used for Floquet engineering of metastable steady states. Moreover, our approach allows us to reconstruct an effective quasilocal Hamiltonian even in the heating regime beyond the validity of the prethermal plateau, where perturbative expansions fail.

TI The role of aluminum in controlling defect formation and polytypism in
   silicon carbide via thermal synthesis
SO MATERIALS ADVANCES
AB The synthesis of silicon carbide has been widely explored to tailor its material properties for specific needs, particularly particle size, polytype distribution, and defect density. While many applications require defect-free material, the intrinsic defect states in SiC make it an attractive candidate for quantum technologies. However, the controlled introduction of such defects remains a major challenge. In this work, we investigate the influence of aluminium concentration and high-energy ball milling duration on defect formation and polytype distribution in silicon carbide synthesized through controlled thermal reactions. Our findings highlight the critical role of Al in altering the reaction between Si and C, stabilizing specific polytypes, and promoting the formation of optically and magnetically active point defects. Multivariate analysis using machine learning-assisted partial least squares regression revealed strong correlations between structural parameters and defect concentrations. These results demonstrate that optimizing Al concentration and milling conditions enables controlled synthesis of SiC with tailored polytypism and targeted defect configurations, presenting a scalable route for quantum technological applications.

TI Tip-induced dynamic control of exciton-trion interconversion at the
   nanoscale in two-dimensional semiconductors
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB As two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor devices demand ever higher performance and tunable photo-energy responses, the ability to probe and control exciton-trion interconversion has attracted much attention. However, conventional optical studies predominantly rely on far-field schemes, which suffer from inherent limitations, such as low spatial resolution and weak photoluminescence signals, restricting practical applications. To address these challenges, plasmonic structures have been employed to enhance local electromagnetic fields, facilitating more efficient exciton-trion interconversion in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. Furthermore, tip-enhanced approaches have expanded the frontiers of excitontrion study by enabling nanoscale spatial resolution and various modulation capabilities, under active cavity configuration. This review article addresses the critical challenge of probing and controlling exciton-trion interconversion. It provides a comprehensive overview of current techniques, spanning far field spectroscopy, plasmonic enhancement, and tip based methodologies, including both foundational strategies and emerging advanced modulation schemes. By summarizing recent developments in this field, this work aims to outline future directions for harnessing photonic quasi particles to advance next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

TI Electron-Nuclear Coherent Coupling and Nuclear Spin Readout through
   Optically Polarized VB- Spin States in hBN
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Coherent coupling of defect spins with surrounding nuclei along with the endowment to read out the latter are basic requirements for an application in quantum technologies. We show that negatively charged boron vacancies (V-B(-)) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) meet these prerequisites. We demonstrate Hahn-echo coherence of the V-B(-) spin with a characteristic decay time Tcoh = 15 mu s, close to the theoretically predicted limit of 18 mu s for defects in hBN. Elongation of the coherence time up to 36 mu s is demonstrated by means of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill decoupling technique. Modulation of the Hahn-echo decay is shown to be induced by coherent coupling of the V-B(-) spin with the three nearest N-14 nuclei via a nuclear quadrupole interaction of 2.11 MHz. DFT calculation confirms that the electron-nuclear coupling is confined to the defective layer and stays almost unchanged with a transition from the bulk to the single layer.

TI Simultaneous measurement of multimode squeezing through multimode
   phase-sensitive amplification
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Multimode squeezed light is an increasingly popular tool in photonic quantum technologies, including sensing, imaging, and computation. Meanwhile, the existing methods of its characterization are technically complicated, which reduces the level of squeezing, and mostly deal with a single mode at a time. Here, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we employ optical parametric amplification to characterize multiple squeezing eigenmodes simultaneously. We retrieve the shapes and squeezing degrees of all modes at once through direct detection followed by modal decomposition. This method is tolerant to inefficient detection and does not require a local oscillator. For a spectrally and spatially multimode squeezed vacuum, we characterize eight strongest spatial modes, obtaining squeezing and anti-squeezing values of up to-5.2 +/- 0.2 dB and 8.6 +/- 0.3 dB, respectively, despite the 50% detection loss. This work, being the first exploration of an optical parametric amplifier's multimode capability for squeezing detection, paves the way for the real-time detection of multimode squeezing.

TI Room-temperature coherent manipulation of single-spin qubits in silicon
   carbide with a high readout contrast
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with mature wafer-scale fabrication and micro/nano-processing technologies have recently drawn considerable attention. Although room-temperature single-spin manipulation of colour centres in SiC has been demonstrated, the typically detected contrast is less than 2%, and the photon count rate is also low. Here, we present the coherent manipulation of single divacancy spins in 4H-SiC with a high readout contrast (-30%) and a high photon count rate (150 kilo counts per second) under ambient conditions, which are competitive with the nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. Coupling between a single defect spin and a nearby nuclear spin is also observed. We further provide a theoretical explanation for the high readout contrast by analysing the defect levels and decay paths. Since the high readout contrast is of utmost importance in many applications of quantum technologies, this work might open a new territory for SiC-based quantum devices with many advanced properties of the host material.

TI Suppressing the Dielectric Loss in Superconducting Qubits through Useful
   Geometry Design
SO ENTROPY
AB Dielectric loss from different interfacial layers in the superconducting circuit and from external environment may cause superconducting qubit decoherence. Compared to modeling the entire device at once with a numerical solver, quantitatively formulating the dielectric loss can both describe all loss mechanisms and make the optimization more transparent. In this paper, we first analyze the expression formula of dielectric loss, and obtain a design scheme that can reduce the dielectric loss of qubits. That is, we replace the straight junction wires with the tapered junction wires. Based on this scheme, we perform a simulation to optimize the design of junction wires. Finally, a real experiment is conducted to verify our design. The results show that both the T1 time and T2 time of qubits are significantly improved.

TI New Low-Memory Algebraic Attacks on LowMC in the Picnic Setting
SO IACR TRANSACTIONS ON SYMMETRIC CRYPTOLOGY
AB The security of the post-quantum signature scheme Picnic is highly related to the difficulty of recovering the secret key of LowMC from a single plaintext-ciphertext pair. Since Picnic is one of the alternate third-round candidates in NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, it has become urgent and important to evaluate the security of LowMC in the Picnic setting. The best attacks on LowMC with full S-box layers used in Picnic3 were achieved with Dinur's algorithm. For LowMC with partial nonlinear layers, e.g. 10 S-boxes per round adopted in Picnic2, the best attacks on LowMC were published by Banik et al. with the meet-in-the-middle (MITM) method. In this paper, we improve the attacks on LowMC in a model where memory consumption is costly. First, a new attack on 3-round LowMC with full S-box layers with negligible memory complexity is found, which can outperform Bouillaguet et al.'s fast exhaustive search attack and can achieve better time-memory tradeoffs than Dinur's algorithm. Second, we extend the 3-round attack to 4 rounds to significantly reduce the memory complexity of Dinur's algorithm at the sacrifice of a small factor of time complexity. For LowMC instances with 1 S-box per round, our attacks are shown to be much faster than the MITM attacks. For LowMC instances with 10 S-boxes per round, we can reduce the memory complexity from 32GB (238 bits) to only 256KB (221 bits) using our new algebraic attacks rather than the MITM attacks, while the time complexity of our attacks is about 23.2 similar to 25 times higher than that of the MITM attacks. A notable feature of our new attacks (apart from the 4-round attack) is their simplicity. Specifically, only some basic linear algebra is required to understand them and they can be easily implemented.

TI Trading Locality for Time: Certifiable Randomness from Low-Depth
   Circuits
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The generation of certifiable randomness is the most fundamental information-theoretic task that meaningfully separates quantum devices from their classical counterparts. We propose a protocol for exponential certified randomness expansion using a single quantum device. The protocol calls for the device to implement a simple quantum circuit of constant depth on a 2D lattice of qubits. The output of the circuit can be verified classically in linear time, and is guaranteed to contain a polynomial number of certified random bits assuming that the device used to generate the output operated using a (classical or quantum) circuit of sub-logarithmic depth. This assumption contrasts with the locality assumption used for randomness certification based on Bell inequality violation and more recent proposals for randomness certification based on computational assumptions. Furthermore, to demonstrate randomness generation it is sufficient for a device to sample from the ideal output distribution within constant statistical distance. Our procedure is inspired by recent work of Bravyi et al. (Science 362(6412):308-311, 2018), who introduced a relational problem that can be solved by a constant-depth quantum circuit, but provably cannot be solved by any classical circuit of sub-logarithmic depth. We develop the discovery of Bravyi et al. into a framework for robust randomness expansion. Our results lead to a new proposal for a demonstrated quantum advantage that has some advantages compared to existing proposals. First, our proposal does not rest on any complexity-theoretic conjectures, but relies on the physical assumption that the adversarial device being tested implements a circuit of sub-logarithmic depth. Second, success on our task can be easily verified in classical linear time. Finally, our task is more noise-tolerant than most other existing proposals that can only tolerate multiplicative error, or require additional conjectures from complexity theory; in contrast, we are able to allow a small constant additive error in total variation distance between the sampled and ideal distributions.

TI Controlled preparation of phases in two-dimensional time crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The study of phases is useful for understanding novel states of matter. One such state of matter is time crystals which constitute periodically driven interacting many-body systems that spontaneously break time translation symmetry. Time crystals with arbitrary periods (and dimensions) can be realized using the model of Bose-Einstein condensates bouncing on periodically driven mirror(s). In this work, we identify the different phases that characterize the two-dimensional time crystal. By determining the optimal initial conditions and value of system parameters, we provide a practical route to realize a specific phase of the time crystal. These different phases can be mapped to the many-body states existing on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice model, thereby opening up interesting opportunities for quantum simulation of many-body physics in time lattices.

TI 3D Imaging of Optical Modes in Dielectric Photonic Nanocavities with
   Sub-wavelength Field Confinement
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Dielectric optical cavities are emerging as viable platforms for efficiently concentrating light within extremely small volumes of sub-wavelength dimensions. This breaks with the notion that only plasmonic nanostructures can achieve this scale of confinement and enables strong light-matter interactions without the losses typically associated with metals. Here, we directly visualize the optical modes of a topology-optimized silicon bowtie nanocavity using multi-orientation electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Tomographic reconstruction of the resulting data sets reveals the three-dimensional profiles of several polarized optical modes in close agreement with simulations. A resonance near the telecom wavelength (similar to 1550 nm) is shown to be tightly localized at the bowtie bridge, confirming its deep sub-wavelength mode volume. These findings establish electron beam spectroscopy as a powerful tool for mapping three-dimensional field confinement in dielectric photonic cavities with potential applications in future photonic and quantum technologies.

TI Dielectric-tuned photon-photon coupling in a planar hybrid system
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS IMPACT
AB This study presents photon-photon coupling (PPC) in a microwave hybrid system consisting of a Split Ring Resonator (SRR) and a Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR), both acting as photon modes. Numerical simulations using CST Microwave Studio were performed to design the system and analyze the anticrossing phenomenon between the photon modes (SRR and CSRR) by examining the |S21| versus frequency spectra while varying the size of the CSRR. Additionally, we provide a theoretical framework to explain the observed anticrossing phenomenon due to photon-photon interaction, which shows strong agreement with the simulation. Furthermore, we explore the influence of the substrate's dielectric constant (epsilon r) on the PPC by estimating the coupling constant for different epsilon r values. The results indicate that the coupling strength decreases as epsilon r increases, highlighting a tunable parameter for controlling photon interactions in hybrid microwave systems. This discovery opens new avenues for developing and optimizing tunable systems, which are crucial for progress in quantum technologies.

TI Thermal relaxation time and photothermal optomechanical force in sliced
   photonic crystal silicon nanobeams
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optomechanical devices based on sliced silicon photonic crystal nanobeams could have several use cases in future quantum technologies, especially as quantum transducers between different quantum systems. To create the required pure mechanical states at low temperatures, an understanding of photon absorption, thermal relaxation, and the associated photothermal force is crucial. Here, we characterize the strength of the photothermal force in sliced silicon nanobeam resonators. We extract the thermal relaxation time separately from phonon ray tracing simulations, allowing us to study the strength of the photothermal optomechanical effect without the uncertainty from the thermal relaxation time. With this information, we can put strict upper bounds to the photothermal force and photon absorption (beta beta parameter) in the devices without knowledge of the cavity photon population. The methods we employ can easily be adapted to other geometries and devices for the study of the photothermal effects.

TI Effect of interface trap charge on Coulomb oscillation in MOS-type
   quantum dots
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We have theoretically investigated the effect of an interface trap charge (ITC) on the Coulomb oscillation characteristics in a Si MOS-type quantum dot (Q-dot). We found that the ITC causes a variation in the fundamental characteristics of the Coulomb oscillation: a peak position, a peak height, and a peak interval. We clarified that the dependence of each variation on the ITC position is different from that of the other because of their different physical origins. We also discussed the amount of the peak position variation from the viewpoint of the operation of the Q-dots required in Si quantum computers (QCs). Mitigating the large variation caused by the ITC will be a critical issue for achieving large-scale Si QCs.

TI Periodic quantum Rabi model with cold atoms at deep strong coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum Rabi model describes the coupling of a two-state system to a bosonic field mode. Recent theoretical work has pointed out that a generalized periodic version of this model, which maps onto Hamiltonians applicable in superconducting qubit settings, can be quantum simulated with cold trapped atoms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate atomic dynamics predicted by the periodic quantum Rabi model far in the deep strong-coupling regime. The two-state system is represented by two Bloch bands of cold atoms in an optical lattice, and the bosonic mode by oscillations in a superimposed optical dipole trap potential. The observed dynamics beyond the usual quantum Rabi physics becomes relevant when the edge of the Brillouin zone is reached, and evidence for collapse and revival of the initial state is revealed at extreme coupling conditions.

TI Double degeneracy associated with hidden symmetries in the asymmetric
   two-photon Rabi model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we uncover the elusive level crossings in a subspace of the asymmetric two-photon quantum Rabi model (tpQRM) when the bias parameter of qubit is an even multiple of the renormalized cavity frequency. Due to the absence of any explicit symmetry in the subspace, this double degeneracy at the crossing points implies the existence of the hidden symmetry. It is found that the number of the doubly degenerate crossing points in the asymmetric tpQRM is comparable to that in asymmetric one-photon QRM in terms of the same order of the constrained conditions. The bias parameter required for the occurrence of level crossings in the asymmetric tpQRM is characteristically different from that at a multiple of the cavity frequency in the asymmetric one-photon QRM, suggesting the different hidden symmetries in the two asymmetric QRMs.

TI Microscopic magnetic field imaging with hot atoms via single-pixel
   imaging
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In recent years, sensors based on hot atomic vapor cells have emerged as a compact and highly sensitive means of measuring magnetic fields. Such sensors have been deployed in the field for the measurement of, e.g., biological systems, representing a promising practical application of quantum technologies. However, it remains challenging to obtain high-resolution magnetic field images from these sensors, and in most cases, the spatial resolution of the system is limited by the sensor size. Here, we demonstrate the combination of single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques with an atom vapor Faraday magnetometer to achieve microscopic magnetic field imaging. We demonstrate magnetic field imaging with a spatial resolution of approximate to 62.5 mu m, limited only by the resolution of our digital micromirror device projection system and the absence of magnetic shielding in our experimental setup.

TI Gaussian versus Non-Gaussian Filtering of Phase-Insensitive
   Nonclassicality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Measures of quantum properties are essential to understanding the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems as well as quantifying resources for quantum technologies. Here, two broad classes of bosonic phase-space functions, which are filtered versions of the Glauber-Sudarshan P function, are compared with regard to their ability to uncover nonclassical effects of light through their negativities. Gaussian filtering of the P function yields the family of s-parametrized quasiprobabilities, while more powerful regularized nonclassicality quasiprobabilities are obtained by non-Gaussian filtering. A method is proposed to directly sample such phase-space functions for the restricted case of phase-independent quantum states from balanced homodyne measurements. This overcomes difficulties of previous approaches that manually append uniformly distributed optical phases to the measured quadrature data. We experimentally demonstrate this technique for heralded single- and two-photon states using balanced homodyne detection with varying efficiency. The s-parametrized quasiprobabilities, which can be directly sampled, are non-negative for detection efficiencies below 0.5. By contrast, we show that significant negativities of non-Gaussian filtered quasiprobabilities uncover nonclassical effects for arbitrarily low efficiencies.

TI Quantum Pair Generation in Nonlinear Metasurfaces with Mixed and Pure
   Photon Polarizations
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Metasurfaces are highly effective at manipulating classical light in the linear regime; however, effectively controlling the polarization of nonclassical light generated from nonlinear resonant metasurfaces remains a challenge. Here, we present a solution by achieving polarization engineering of frequency-nondegenerate biphotons emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in GaAs metasurfaces, utilizing quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) resonances to enhance biphoton generation. Through comprehensive polarization tomography, we demonstrate that the emitted photons' polarization directly reflects the qBIC mode's far-field properties. Furthermore, we show that both the type of qBIC mode and the symmetry of the meta-atoms can be tailored to control each single-photon polarization state, and that the subsequent two-photon polarization states are nearly separable, offering potential applications in the heralded generation of single photons with adjustable polarization. This work provides a significant step toward utilizing metasurfaces to generate quantum light and engineer their polarization, a critical aspect for future quantum technologies.

TI Absence of Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order in hcp 4He Dislocation Cores
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The mass transport properties along dislocation cores in hcp 4He are revisited by considering two types of edge dislocations as well as a screw dislocation, using a fully correlated quantum simulation approach. Specifically, we employ the zero-temperature path-integral ground state (PIGS) method together with ergodic sampling of the permutation space to investigate the fundamental dislocation core structures and their off-diagonal long-range order properties. It is found that the Bose-Einstein condensate fraction of such defective 4He systems is practically null (<= 10-6), just as in the bulk defect-free crystal. These results provide compelling evidence for the absence of intrinsic superfluidity in dislocation cores in hcp 4He and challenge the superfluid dislocation-network interpretation of the mass-flux-experiment observations, calling for further experimental investigation.

TI Analogue Non-Causal Null Curves and Chronology Protection in a dc-SQUID

AB We propose an analogue quantum simulator of a 1 + 1D spacetime containing non-causal curves, in particular null geodesics going back in time, by means of a dc-SQUID array embedded on an open superconducting transmission line. This is achieved by mimicking the spatial dependence of the metric with the propagation speed of the electromagnetic field in the simulator, which can be modulated by an external magnetic flux. We show that it is possible to simulate a spacetime region containing non-causal null geodesics, but not a full spacetime containing a chronological horizon separating regions with non-causal null geodesics and regions without them. This is in agreement with a recent suggestion of an analogue-gravity chronology protection mechanism by Barcelo et al.

TI Power-law-exponential interaction induced quantum spiral phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We theoretically predict a kind of power-law-exponential (PLE) dipole-dipole interaction between quantum emitters in a 1D waveguide QED system. This unconventional long-range interaction is the combination of power-law growth and exponential decay couplings. Applying the PLE interaction to a spin model, we uncover the rich many-body phases. Most remarkably, we find that the PLE interaction can induce the ordered and critical spiral phases. These spiral phases emerge from the strong frustration generated by the power-law factor of the PLE interaction; hence they are absent for other types of long-range interaction, e.g., pure exponential and power-law decay interactions. Our work is also applicable for the higher-dimensional systems. It fundamentally broadens the realm of many-body physics and has significant applications in quantum simulation of strongly correlated matter.

TI Two-dimensional arrays of Bose-Einstein condensates: Interference and
   stochastic collapse dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate two-dimensional arrays of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) as a new experimental platform with parallel quantum simulation capability. A defect-free array of up to 49 BECs is formed by loading a single BEC with 50 000 atoms into 7 x 7 optical wells. Each BEC is prepared with independent phases, confirmed by matterwave interference. Based on BEC arrays, we realize fast determination of the phase boundary of BECs with attractive interactions. We also observe the stochastic collapse dynamics from the distribution of atom numbers in the array. We show that the collapse of a BEC can occur much faster than the averaged decay of an ensemble. The BEC arrays enable new forms of experiments to drastically increase the measurement throughput and to quantum simulate, say, large 2D Josephson-junction arrays.

Here, in a top-down approach, we show how exciton confinement can be realised by focused-ion-beam etching of a polished bulk Cu2O crystal without noticeable degradation of the excitonic properties. The etching of the crystal to micron sizes allows for tuning the energies of Rydberg excitons locally, and precisely, by optically induced temperature change. These results pave the way for exploiting the large nonlinearities of Rydberg excitons in micropillars for making non-classical light sources, while the precise tuning of their emission energy opens up a viable pathway for realising a scalable photonic quantum simulation platform.

TI Bound vortex light in an emulated topological defect in photonic
   lattices
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Topology have prevailed in a variety of branches of physics. And topological defects in cosmology are speculated akin to dislocation or disclination in solids or liquid crystals. With the development of classical and quantum simulation, such speculative topological defects are well-emulated in a variety of condensed matter systems. Especially, the underlying theoretical foundations can be extensively applied to realize novel optical applications. Here, with the aid of transformation optics, we experimentally demonstrated bound vortex light on optical chips by simulating gauge fields of topological linear defects in cosmology through position-dependent coupling coefficients in a deformed photonic graphene. Furthermore, these types of photonic lattices inspired by topological linear defects can simultaneously generate and transport optical vortices, and even can control the orbital angular momentum of photons on integrated optical chips.

Here we review several leading candidates in this computational frontier and their workflows for experimental applications of artificial intelligence that may impact the future Electron-Ion Collider. We discuss the motivation for exploring novel methods to solve artificial intelligence and machine learning problems including with customized devices, quantum simulation, and heterogeneous computing systems.

TI Photodissociation spectra of single trapped CaOH+ molecular
   ions
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Molecular ions that are generated by chemical reactions with trapped atomic ions can serve as an accessible testbed for developing molecular quantum technologies. On the other hand, they are also a hindrance to scaling up quantum computers based on atomic ions, as unavoidable reactions with background gases destroy the information carriers. Here, we investigate the single- and two-photon dissociation processes of single CaOH+ molecular ions co-trapped in Ca+ ion crystals using a femtosecond laser system. We report the photodissociation cross section spectra of CaOH+ for single-photon processes at lambda = 245-275 nm and for two-photon processes at lambda = 500-540 nm. Measurements are interpreted with quantum-chemical calculations, which predict the photodissociation threshold for CaOH+ -> Ca+ + OH at 265 nm. This result can serve as a basis for dissociation-based spectroscopy for studying the internal structure of CaOH+. The result also gives a prescription for recycling Ca+ ions in large-scale trapped Ca+ quantum experiments from undesired CaOH+ ions formed in the presence of background water vapor.

TI Heat Dissipation Mechanisms in Hybrid Superconductor-Semiconductor
   Devices Revealed by Joule Spectroscopy
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Understanding heating and cooling mechanisms in mesoscopic superconductor-semiconductor devices is crucial for their application in quantum technologies. Owing to their poor thermal conductivity, heating effects can drive superconducting-to-normal transitions even at low bias, observed as sharp conductance dips through the loss of Andreev excess currents. Tracking such dips across magnetic field, cryostat temperature, and applied microwave power allows us to uncover cooling bottlenecks in different parts of a device. By applying this "Joule spectroscopy" technique, we analyze heat dissipation in devices based on InAs-Al nanowires and reveal that cooling of superconducting islands is limited by the rather inefficient electron-phonon coupling, as opposed to grounded superconductors that primarily cool by quasiparticle diffusion. We show that powers as low as 50-150 pW are able to suppress superconductivity on the islands. Applied microwaves lead to similar heating effects but are affected by the interplay of the microwave frequency and the effective electron-phonon relaxation time.

TI Entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene
   plasmonics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.

TI How to construct CSIDH on Edwards curves
SO FINITE FIELDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
AB CSIDH is an isogeny-based key exchange protocol proposed by Castryck et al. in 2018. It is based on the ideal class group action on Fp-isomorphism classes of Montgomery curves. The original CSIDH algorithm requires a calculation over Fp by representing points as x-coordinate over Montgomery curves. There is a special coordinate on Edwards curves (the wcoordinate) to calculate group operations and isogenies. If we try to calculate the class group action on Edwards curves by using the w-coordinate in a similar way on Montgomery curves, we have to consider points defined over F-p(4) . Therefore, calculating the class group action on Edwards curves with wcoordinates over only F-p is not a trivial task.
   In this paper, we prove some theorems about the properties of Edwards curves. We construct the new CSIDH algorithm using these theorems on Edwards curves with w-coordinates over F-p. This algorithm is as fast as (or a little bit faster than) the algorithm proposed by Meyer and Reith.
   This paper is an extended version of [29]. We added the construction of a technique similar to Elligator on Edwards curves. This technique contributes to the efficiency of the constant-time CSIDH algorithm. We also added the construction of new formulas to compute isogenies in similar to O( e) time on Edwards curves. It is based on formulas on Montgomery curves proposed by Bernstein et al. (root elu's formulas). In our analysis, these formulas on Edwards curves are a little bit We finally implemented CSIDH, root elu's formulas, and CTIDH faster than those on Montgomery curves. [3] (faster constant-time CSIDH) on Edwards curves. Each result shows the efficiency of algorithms on Edwards curves.

TI Entanglement Subvolume Law for 2D Frustration-Free Spin Systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Let H be a frustration-free Hamiltonian describing a 2D grid of qudits with local interactions, a unique ground state, and local spectral gap lower bounded by a positive constant. For any bipartition defined by a vertical cut of length L running from top to bottom of the grid, we prove that the corresponding entanglement entropy of the ground state of H is upper bounded by (O) over tilde (L-5/3). For the special case of a 1D chain, our result provides a new area law which improves upon prior work, in terms of the scaling with qudit dimension and spectral gap. In addition, for any bipartition of the grid into a rectangular region A and its complement, we show that the entanglement entropy is upper bounded as (O) over tilde(vertical bar partial derivative A vertical bar(5/3)) where partial derivative A is the boundary of A. This represents a subvolume bound on entanglement in frustration-free 2D systems. In contrast with previous work, our bounds depend on the local (rather than global) spectral gap of the Hamiltonian. We prove our results using a known method which bounds the entanglement entropy of the ground state in terms of certain properties of an approximate ground state projector (AGSP). To this end, we construct a new AGSP which is based on a robust polynomial approximation of the AND function and we show that it achieves an improved trade-off between approximation error and entanglement.

TI Electric control of magnetic exchange in a molecular spin triangle
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-electric effects are crucial for quantum technologies, offering several advantages over standard magnetic field-based spin control. Seeking a mechanism independent of spin-orbit interaction, here we report the detection of a spin-electric effect in the [Cu3(saltag)(py)6]ClO4 spin triangle. The effect is investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance under electric field modulation on single crystals. The anisotropy of the magnetic response to the electric field is addressed, and comprehensive ab initio calculations are performed to elucidate its origin. We demonstrate that when the electric field is applied in the plane of the triangle, the dominant contribution to the observed spin-electric signal arises from a variation of the isotropic exchange interaction. Our combined theoretical and experimental approach demonstrates that, in our system, there is no evidence of antisymmetric exchange (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) interaction, confirming that electric-field control of magnetic exchange is achievable in the absence of significant spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we underscore the crucial role of the bridging ligand, which opens new avenues for chemically optimizing spin-electric coupling.

TI Erbium-Implanted WS2 Flakes with Room-Temperature Photon
   Emission at Telecom Wavelengths
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Optically addressable spin impurities in crystals along with device engineering provide an attractive route to realizing quantum technologies in the solid state, but reconciling disparate emitter and host material constraints for a given target application is often challenging. Rare-earth ions in two-dimensional (2D) materials could mitigate this problem given the atomic-like transitions of the emitters and the versatile nature of van der Waals systems. Here we combine ion implantation, confocal microscopy, and ab initio calculations to examine the photon emission of Er-doped WS2 flakes. Optical spectroscopy reveals narrow, long-lived photoluminescence lines in the telecom band, which we activate after low-temperature thermal annealing. Spectroscopic and polarization-selective measurements show a uniform response across the ensemble, while the fluorescence brightness remains mostly unchanged with temperature, suggesting nonradiative relaxation channels are inefficient. Our results create opportunities for novel solid state devices coupling 2D-hosted, telecom-band emitters to photonic heterostructures separately optimized for photon manipulation.

TI Excitons in two-dimensional materials and heterostructures: Optical and
   magneto-optical properties
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive systems to explore exciton physics and possible applications in optoelectronics, opto-spintronics, and quantum technologies. Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are direct gap 2D semiconductor materials with robust excitons and two inequivalent K+ and K- valleys. They can be vertically stacked to form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with typically Type II band alignment that enables the formation of interlayer excitons (IEs) and creates Moir & eacute; patterns. Magnetic 2D materials are also promising systems to explore exciton physics and their correlations with magnetic properties. They can be stacked with TMD materials to form magnetic vdW heterostructures. Their optical properties are strongly dependent on the number of layers, charge transfer, defects, strain, and twist angle stacking, which offer a versatile platform to control their physical properties. Here, we review some recent discoveries on the exciton and valley properties of van der Waals materials and heterostructures.

TI Observation of phonon Stark effect
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Stark effect, the electric-field analogue of magnetic Zeeman effect, is one of the celebrated phenomena in modern physics and appealing for emergent applications in electronics, optoelectronics, as well as quantum technologies. While in condensed matter it has prospered only for excitons, whether other collective excitations can display Stark effect remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of phonon Stark effect in a two-dimensional quantum system of bilayer 2H-MoS2. The longitudinal acoustic phonon red-shifts linearly with applied electric fields and can be tuned over similar to 1 THz, evidencing giant Stark effect of phonons. Together with many-body ab initio calculations, we uncover that the observed phonon Stark effect originates fundamentally from the strong coupling between phonons and interlayer excitons (IXs). In addition, IX-mediated electro-phonon intensity modulation up to similar to 1200% is discovered for infrared-active phonon A(2u). Our results unveil the exotic phonon Stark effect and effective phonon engineering by IX-mediated mechanism, promising for a plethora of exciting many-body physics and potential technological innovations.

TI Selective Control of Eu3+ Radiative Emission by Hyperbolic
   Metamaterials
SO MATERIALS
AB In recent years the quest for novel materials possessing peculiar abilities of manipulating light at the nanoscale has been significantly boosted due to the strict demands of advanced nanophotonics and quantum technologies. In this framework radiative decay engineering of quantum emitters is of paramount importance for developing efficient single-photon sources or nanolasers. Hyperbolic metamaterials stand out among the best cutting-edge candidates for photoluminescence control owing to their potentially unlimited photonic density of states and their ability to sustain high-k modes that allow us to strongly enhance the radiative decay rate of quantum light emitters. The aim of the present paper is to show how Au/Al2O3 hyperbolic multilayers can be used to selectively control the photoluminescence of coupled Eu3+ emitters. We point out an enhancement of the Eu3+ transitions when they are in the hyperbolic regime of the metamaterials and a significant alteration of the ED and MD branching ratios by changing the emitter-metamaterial distance.

TI Near-Optimal Variance-Based Uncertainty Relations
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Learning physical properties of a quantum system is essential for the developments of quantum technologies. However, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle constrains the potential knowledge one can simultaneously have about a system in quantum theory. Aside from its fundamental significance, the mathematical characterization of this restriction, known as 'uncertainty relation', plays important roles in a wide range of applications, stimulating the formation of tighter uncertainty relations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limitations of variance-based uncertainty relations, and introduce several 'near optimal' bounds for incompatible observables. Our results consist of two morphologically distinct phases: lower bounds that illustrate the uncertainties about measurement outcomes, and the upper bound that indicates the potential knowledge we can gain. Combining them together leads to an uncertainty interval, which captures the essence of uncertainties in quantum theory. Finally, we have detailed how to formulate lower bounds for product-form variance-based uncertainty relations by employing entropic uncertainty relations, and hence built a link between different forms of uncertainty relations.

TI Prospective sensitivities of atom interferometers to gravitational waves

SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL

AB We survey the prospective sensitivities of terrestrial and space-borne atom interferometers to gravitational waves generated by cosmological and astrophysical sources, and to ultralight dark matter. We discuss the backgrounds from gravitational gradient noise in terrestrial detectors, and also binary pulsar and asteroid backgrounds in space-borne detectors. We compare the sensitivities of LIGO and LISA with those of the 100 m and 1 km stages of the AION terrestrial AI project, as well as two options for the proposed AEDGE AI space mission with cold atom clouds either inside or outside the spacecraft, considering as possible sources the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, supernovae, phase transitions in the early Universe, cosmic strings and quantum fluctuations in the early Universe that could have generated primordial black holes. We also review the capabilities of AION and AEDGE for detecting coherent waves of ultralight scalar dark matter.

TI Polymer-loaded three dimensional microwave cavities for hybrid quantum
   systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Microwave cavity resonators are crucial components of many quantum technologies and are a promising platform for hybrid quantum systems, as their open architecture enables the integration of multiple subsystems inside the cavity volume. To suspend these subsystems within the centre of a cavity where field strengths are strong and uniform, auxiliary support structures are often required, but the effects of these structures on the microwave cavity mode are difficult to predict due to a lack of a priori knowledge of the materials' response in the microwave regime. Understanding these effects becomes even more important when frequency matching is critical and tuning is limited, for example, when matching microwave modes to atomic resonances for atomic vapour cells inside enclosed microwave cavities. Here, we study the microwave cavity mode in the presence of three commonly-used machinable polymers, paying particular attention to the change in resonance and the dissipation of energy. We demonstrate how to use the derived dielectric coefficient for cavity design in a test case, wherein we match a polymer-filled 3D microwave cavity to a hyperfine transition in rubidium.

TI Transverse spin dynamics in structured electromagnetic guided waves
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Spin-momentum locking, a manifestation of topological properties that governs the behavior of surface states, was studied intensively in condensed-matter physics and optics, resulting in the discovery of topological insulators and related effects and their photonic counterparts. In addition to spin, optical waves may have complex structure of vector fields associated with orbital angular momentum or nonuniform intensity variations. Here, we derive a set of spin-momentum equations which describes the relationship between the spin and orbital properties of arbitrary complex electromagnetic guided modes. The predicted photonic spin dynamics is experimentally verified with four kinds of nondiffracting surface structured waves. In contrast to the one-dimensional uniform spin of a guided plane wave, a two-dimensional chiral spin swirl is observed for structured guided modes. The proposed framework opens up opportunities for designing the spin structure and topological properties of electromagnetic waves with practical importance in spin optics, topological photonics, metrology and quantum technologies and may be used to extend the spin-dynamics concepts to fluid, acoustic, and gravitational waves.

TI Lateral exchange bias for Néel-vector control in atomically thin
   antiferromagnets
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Antiferromagnetic (AF) van der Waals (vdW) magnets combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter, the N & eacute;el-vector, remains a key limitation. Here, we achieve N & eacute;el vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr, via an effect we term lateral exchange bias (LEB). We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer N & eacute;el vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve non-volatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AF order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.

TI Pressure induced transition from chiral charge order to time-reversal
   symmetry-breaking superconducting state in Nb-doped
   CsV3Sb5
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Understanding how time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaks in quantum materials is key to uncovering new states of matter and advancing quantum technologies. However, unraveling the interplay between TRS breaking, charge order, and superconductivity in kagome metals continues to be a compelling challenge. Here, we investigate the kagome metal Cs(V1-xNbx)3Sb5 with x = 0.07 using muon spin rotation (mu SR), alternating current (AC) magnetic susceptibility, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), under combined tuning by chemical doping, hydrostatic pressure, magnetic field, and depth from the surface. We find that TRS breaking in the bulk emerges below 40 K-lower than the charge order onset at 58 K-while near the surface, TRS breaking onsets at 58 K and is twice as strong. Niobium doping raises the superconducting critical temperature from 2.5 K to 4.4 K. Under pressure, both the critical temperature and superfluid density double, with TRS-breaking superconductivity appearing above 0.85 GPa. These findings reveal a depth-tunable TRS-breaking state and unconventional superconducting behavior in kagome systems.

TI Scalable and Tunable In-Plane Ge/Si(001) Nanowires Grown by Molecular
   Beam Epitaxy
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Germanium nanostructures offer significant potential in developing advanced integrated circuits and disruptive quantum technologies, yet achieving both scalability and high carrier mobility remains a challenge in materials science. Here, we report an original low-temperature epitaxial method for the growth of site-controlled in-plane germanium nanowires with high hole mobility by molecular beam epitaxy. By reducing the growth temperature, we effectively suppress Si-Ge interdiffusion, ensuring pure germanium composition within the nanowires while preserving their high crystalline quality. The method employs prepatterned ridges on strain-relaxed Si0.75Ge0.25/Si(001) substrates as tailored templates, enabling control over the position, length, spacing, and cross-sectional shape of the nanowires. Electrical measurements of field-effect devices made from as-grown germanium nanowires show that the nanowires are of hole conduction with mobility exceeding 7000 cm2/(V s) at 2-20 K. The method paves a way for fabrication of scalable germanium nanowire networks, providing a reliable platform for the developments of high-performance nanoelectronics and multiqubit chips.

TI Low Loss Hybrid Nb/Au Superconducting Resonators for Quantum Circuit
   Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Superconducting resonators are critical components in a wide range of quantum technologies, including high-performance detectors and amplifiers. However, their performance is often limited by noise and sensitivity issues caused by two-level systems (TLS) originated from oxide layers, such as Nb2O5${\rm Nb}_2{\rm O}_5$, in the device. To address this challenge, a superconducting device combining a 100 nm niobium (Nb) circuit with a 10 nm gold (Au) capping layer is investigated. This study explores the device's performance across a wide range of temperatures and driving powers. Comparing with an uncapped device, it is demonstrated that the Au capping layer effectively avoids oxide formation, thus reducing the TLS density and increasing the internal quality factors. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. These findings provide valuable insights into improving resonator performance by addressing material-specific limitations, paving the way for more robust and efficient superconducting devices and highlight the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators for applications where TLS noise mitigation is critical.

TI Superradiance of ultracold cesium Rydberg |65D5/2⟩ →
   |66P3/2⟩
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We investigate Rydberg |65D(5/2)> -> |66P(3/2)> superradiance in dense ultracold cesium atoms, where the ground atoms are excited to |65D(5/2)> Rydberg states via two-photon excitation in a standard magneto-optical trap. The superradiant spectrum of |65D(5/2)> -> |66P(3/2)> is obtained using the state-selective field ionization technique. We observe its dynamic evolution process by varying the delay time of ionization field t(d). The results show that the evolution process of |65D(5/2)> -> |66P(3/2)> is much shorter than its radiation lifetime at room temperature, which verifies the superradiance effect. The dependence of the superradiance process on Rydberg atoms number N-e and principal quantum number n is investigated. The results show that the superradiance becomes faster with increasing N-e, while it is suppressed for stronger van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Superradiance has potential applications in quantum technologies, and the Rydberg atom is an ideal medium for superradiance. Our system is effective for studying the strong two-body interaction between Rydberg atoms.

TI Sensitive detection of spin-electric coupling in a Cr3
   antiferromagnetic triangle
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Molecular antiferromagnetic triangles are a convenient platform to study the effect of an electric field on the magnetic exchange interactions. However, such effects are typically hard to detect, especially in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. In this work, an asymmetric mu 3-oxo-centered Cr3 triangle was synthesized and structurally characterized as a non-centrosymmetric molecular crystal suitable for probing Spin Electric Coupling (SEC). A combination of single-crystal magnetometry, cantilever torque magnetometry, and continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) allowed precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters, including the weak Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Electric-field-modulated EPR (EFM-EPR) experiments provided the first direct observation of SEC in a CrIII-based complex, revealing measurable electric-field effects on the single-ion tensor and setting an upper bound for the SEC influence on magnetic exchange interactions. These findings demonstrate the exceptional sensitivity of EFM-EPR spectroscopy for quantifying SEC and highlight the crucial role of molecular symmetry and ligand environment in enabling electric control of spin states, thus advancing the rational design of molecular systems for quantum technologies.

TI Exploring Electromagnetic Density of States Near Plasmonic Material
   Interfaces
SO SURFACES
AB The electromagnetic density of states (EM-DOS) plays a crucial role in understanding light-matter interactions, especially at metal-dielectric interfaces. This study explores the impact of interface geometry, material properties, and nanostructures on EM-DOS, with a focus on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and evanescent waves. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the behavior of EM-DOS is analyzed as a function of distance from metal-dielectric interfaces, showing exponential decay with penetration depth. The influence of different metals, including copper, gold, and silver, on EM-DOS is examined. Additionally, the effects of dielectric materials, such as TiO2, PMMA, and Al2O3, on the enhancement of electromagnetic field confinement are discussed. The study also investigates the effect of nanostructures, like nanohole and nanopillar arrays, on EM-DOS by calculating effective permittivity and analyzing the interaction of quantum emitters with these structures. Results show that nanopillar arrays enhance EM-DOS more effectively than nanohole arrays, especially in the visible spectrum. The findings provide insights into optimizing plasmonic devices for applications in sensing, quantum technologies, and energy conversion.

TI Quantum Metrology in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime of Light-Matter
   Interactions: Leveraging Virtual Excitations without Extracting Them
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Virtual excitations, inherent to ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems, induce measurable modifications in system properties, offering a novel resource for quantum technologies. In this Letter, we demonstrate how these virtual excitations and their correlations can be harnessed to enhance precision measurements, without the need to extract them. Building on the paradigmatic Dicke model, which describes the interaction between an ensemble of two-level atoms and a single radiation mode, we propose a method to harness hybridized light-matter modes whose renormalized frequencies encode the effects of virtual excitations for quantum metrology. Remarkably, we find that, for a fixed squeezing parameter xi , exploiting virtual squeezing through oscillator frequency shifts yields a quadratic enhancement in estimation precision-scaling as exp(4 xi)-compared to the conventional exp(2 xi) scaling of real squeezed states. These results show that virtual excitations, though unobservable, can drive metrological performance beyond the standard quantum limit. Our approach establishes a broadly applicable framework for high-precision measurements across a wide class of ultrastrongly coupled quantum systems.

TI Magnetically induced perfect absorption and slow light trapping in a
   double-cavity structure with strontium atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photon manipulation using quantum interference is crucial for understanding the physical meaning of optical phenomena and promoting photonic quantum technologies. Here, two fundamentally optical phenomena, including coherent perfect absorption (CPA) and slow light trapping, are proposed simultaneously in a double-cavity structure with strontium atoms. When two counterpropagating probe fields are injected into the coupled atom-cavity system, we demonstrate that double-cavity-mediated interference assisted by the atomic Zeeman effect can be utilized to control multiple mode splitting in the transmission light. According to the analytical CPA criterion, we report that these splitting modes in the output spectra can be completely absorbed, forming multiple perfect or nearly perfect absorption. More importantly, we illustrate that sizable intracavity field localization can be found at the multiple CPA points, as an amount of system energy stores in the intracavity fields and the atomic excited states. In this case, the dispersion property of the system enables the localized intracavity fields to operate in the long-lived slow-light regime, whose group delay is tuned to be in the order of microseconds.

SO MOLECULES
AB Nanocarbon materials have become extraordinarily compelling for their significant potential in the cutting-edge science and technology. These materials exhibit exceptional physicochemical properties due to their distinctive low-dimensional structures and tailored surface characteristics. An attractive direction at the forefront of this field involves the spatially resolved chemical functionalization of a diverse range of nanocarbons, encompassing carbon nanotubes, graphene, and a myriad of derivative structures. In tandem with the technological leaps in lithography, these endeavors have fostered the creation of a novel class of nanocarbon materials with finely tunable physical and chemical attributes, and programmable multi-functionalities, paving the way for new applications in fields such as nanoelectronics, sensing, photonics, and quantum technologies. Our review examines the swift and dynamic advancements in nanocarbon chemical patterning. Key breakthroughs and future opportunities are highlighted. This review not only provides an in-depth understanding of this fast-paced field but also helps to catalyze the rational design of advanced next-generation nanocarbon-based materials and devices.

TI Magnetic Interactions Between Radical Pairs in Chiral Graphene
   Nanoribbons
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Open-shell graphene nanoribbons have become promising candidates for future applications, including quantum technologies. Here, we characterize magnetic states hosted by chiral graphene nanoribbons (chGNRs). The substitution of a hydrogen atom at the chGNR edge by a ketone effectively adds one p(z) electron to the pi-electron network, producing an unpaired pi-radical. A similar scenario occurs for regular ketone-functionalized chGNRs in which one ketone is missing. Two such radical states can interact via exchange coupling, and we study those interactions as a function of their relative position, which includes a remarkable dependence on the chirality, as well as on the nature of the surrounding ribbon, that is, with or without ketone functionalization. Besides, we determine the parameters whereby this type of system with oxygen heteroatoms can be adequately described within the widely used mean-field Hubbard model. Altogether, we provide insight to both theoretically model and devise GNR-based nanostructures with tunable magnetic properties.

TI Anomalous spectral response of plasmon-exciton strong coupling beyond
   J-C model
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The strong coupling between plasmons and excitons has aroused tremendous interest in recent years, due to its implications for diverse important quantum technologies. Understanding the spectral response properties of these strongly coupled systems is crucial for both the fundamental physics science and the practical applications. Here, we numerically and theoretically demonstrate the spectrum responses of plasmon-exciton strong coupling beyond the J-C model based upon the Au nanorod/dye molecules hybrid system. With increasing the number or oscillator strength of dye molecules, a third/fourth mode in the normal Rabi splitting emerges. These anomalous spectrum Rabi splitting beyond the J-C model are revealed by a unified quantum theory model, which gives the quantified contributions from the plasmon and exciton channels to the total photon absorption spectrum of the hybrid system. Our work not only enriches the understanding of the plasmon-exciton strong coupling, but also may stimulate further researches in this field.

Unfortunately, commercial technologies lack cryogenic compact models for circuit design. In this paper, we target the sizing of the critical input stage of a power efficient low-noise amplifier working at 7 GHz and 4 K with simultaneous noise and power matching for meeting the stringent specifications of a gate-dispersive readout circuit for spin quantum bits. In the absence of a compact model for the transistors in 28 nm FD-SOI technology, we propose a design methodology using a look-up table that has been buit with 4 K DC measurements of technology transistors and their associated capacitors to demonstrate the feasibility of the circuit.

TI Learning temporal data with a variational quantum recurrent neural
   network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method for learning temporal data using a parametrized quantum circuit. We use the circuit that has a similar structure as the recurrent neural network, which is one of the standard approaches employed for this type of machine learning task. Some of the qubits in the circuit are utilized for memorizing past data, while others are measured and initialized at each time step for obtaining predictions and encoding a new input datum. The proposed approach utilizes the tensor product structure to get nonlinearity with respect to the inputs. Fully controllable, ensemble quantum systems such as an NMR quantum computer are a suitable choice of an experimental platform for this proposal. We demonstrate its capability with simple numerical simulations, in which we test the proposed method for the task of predicting cosine and triangular waves and quantum spin dynamics. Finally, we analyze the dependency of its performance on the interaction strength among the qubits in numerical simulation and find that there is an appropriate range of the strength. This work provides a way to exploit complex quantum dynamics for learning temporal data.

TI Many-body phases from effective geometrical frustration and long-range
   interactions in a subwavelength lattice
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Geometrical frustration and long-range couplings are key contributors to create quantum phases with different properties throughout physics. We propose a scheme where both ingredients naturally emerge in a Raman induced subwavelength lattice. We first demonstrate that Raman-coupled multicomponent quantum gases can realize a highly versatile frustrated Hubbard Hamiltonian with long-range interactions. The deeply subwavelength lattice period leads to strong long-range interparticle repulsion with tunable range and decay. We numerically demonstrate that the combination of frustration and long-range couplings generates many-body phases of bosons, including a range of density-wave and superfluid phases with broken translational and time reversal symmetries, respectively. Our results thus represent a powerful approach for efficiently combining long-range interactions and frustration in quantum simulations.

TI Probabilistic inference in the era of tensor networks and differential
   programming
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Probabilistic inference is a fundamental task in modern machine learning. Recent advances in tensor network (TN) contraction algorithms have enabled the development of better exact inference methods. However, many common inference tasks in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) still lack corresponding TN-based adaptations. In this paper, we advance the connection between PGMs and TNs by formulating and implementing tensor-based solutions for the following inference tasks: (A) computing the partition function, (B) computing the marginal probability of sets of variables in the model, (C) determining the most likely assignment to a set of variables, (D) the same as (C) but after having marginalized a different set of variables, and (E) generating samples from a learned probability distribution using a generalized method. Our study is motivated by recent technical advances in the fields of quantum circuit simulation, quantum many-body physics, and statistical physics. Through an experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the integration of these quantum technologies with a series of algorithms introduced in this study significantly improves the performance efficiency of existing methods for solving probabilistic inference tasks.

TI Coherent Phononics of van der Waals Layers on Nanogratings
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Strain engineering can be used to control the physical properties of two-dimensional van der Waals (2D-vdW) crystals. Coherent phonons, which carry dynamical strain, could push strain engineering to control classical and quantum phenomena in the unexplored picosecond temporal and nanometer spatial regimes. This intriguing approach requires the use of coherent GHz and sub-THz 2D phonons. Here, we report on nanostructures that combine nanometer thick vdW layers and nanogratings. Using an ultrafast pump-probe technique, we generate and detect in-plane coherent phonons with frequency up to 40 GHz and hybrid flexural phonons with frequency up to 10 GHz. The latter arises from the periodic modulation of the elastic coupling of the vdW layer at the grooves and ridges of the nanograting. This creates a new type of a tailorable 2D periodic phononic nanoobject, a flexural phononic crystal, offering exciting prospects for the ultrafast manipulation of states in 2D materials in emerging quantum technologies.

TI Thermodynamically Optimized Synthesis of 1T-TaS2 Nanocrystals
   by Chemical Vapor Transport
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB Two-dimensional (2D) TaS2 has emerged as a compelling platform for investigating collective electronic phenomena, particularly due to its intricate charge density wave (CDW) phases. To probe nanoscale CDW behavior and superconductivity, the synthesis of high-quality 1T-TaS2 nanocrystals (NCs) is required. In this work, we report for the first time the optimized synthesis of highly crystalline 1T-TaS2 NCs via a thermodynamically optimized chemical vapor transport approach. A comprehensive investigation was conducted to evaluate the influence of key growth parameters, including substrate type (SiO2/Si, c-sapphire, and mica), substrate temperature, growth duration, and transport agent concentration on the resulting crystal morphology and lateral dimensions. Various techniques have been employed to characterize the produced NCs including optical microscopy (OM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our findings highlight the critical role of the substrate in the growth dynamics and provide a versatile platform for controlled synthesis of the 1T-TaS2 phase, paving the way for its integration into next-generation electronic and quantum technologies.

TI Simulating Static and Dynamic Properties of Magnetic Molecules with
   Prototype Quantum Computers
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB Magnetic molecules are prototypical systems to investigate peculiar quantum mechanical phenomena. As such, simulating their static and dynamical behavior is intrinsically difficult for a classical computer, due to the exponential increase of required resources with the system size. Quantum computers solve this issue by providing an inherently quantum platform, suited to describe these magnetic systems. Here, we show that both the ground state properties and the spin dynamics of magnetic molecules can be simulated on prototype quantum computers, based on superconducting qubits. In particular, we study small-size anti-ferromagnetic spin chains and rings, which are ideal test-beds for these pioneering devices. We use the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm to determine the ground state wave-function with targeted ansatzes fulfilling the spin symmetries of the investigated models. The coherent spin dynamics are simulated by computing dynamical correlation functions, an essential ingredient to extract many experimentally accessible properties, such as the inelastic neutron cross-section.

TI Specific Heat of Electron Plasma Waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Collective modes in a plasma, like phonons in a solid, contribute to a material's equation of state and transport properties, but the long wavelengths of these modes are difficult to simulate with today's finite -size quantum simulation techniques. A simple Debye-type calculation of the specific heat of electron plasma waves is presented, yielding up to 0.05k/e- for warm dense matter (WDM), where thermal and Fermi energies are near 1 Ry = 13.6 eV. This overlooked energy reservoir is sufficient to explain reported compression differences between theoretical hydrogen models and shock experiments. Such an additional specific heat contribution refines our understanding of systems passing through the WDM regime, such as the convective threshold in low-mass main-sequence stars, white dwarf envelopes, and substellar objects; WDM x-ray scattering experiments; and the compression of inertial confinement fusion fuels.

TI Decoherence rate in random Lindblad dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Open quantum systems undergo decoherence, which is responsible for the transition from quantum to classical behavior. The time scale in which decoherence takes place can be analyzed using upper limits to its rate. We examine the dynamics of open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindblad operators sourced from Gaussian and Ginibre ensembles with Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In these systems, the ensemble-averaged purity decays monotonically as a function of time. This decay is governed by the decoherence rate, which is upper-bounded by the dimension of their Hilbert space and is independent of the ensemble symmetry. These findings hold upon mixing different ensembles, indicating the universal character of the decoherence rate limit. Moreover, our findings reveal that open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindbladians tend to exhibit the most rapid decoherence, regardless of the initial state. This phenomenon is associated with the concentration of the decoherence rate near its upper bound. Our work identifies primary features of decoherence in dissipative quantum chaos, with applications ranging from quantum foundations to high-energy physics and quantum technologies.

TI Time-dependent switching of the photon entanglement type using a driven
   quantum emitter-cavity system
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The cascaded decay in a four-level quantum emitter is a well-established mechanism to generate polarization-entangled photon pairs, the building blocks of many applications in quantum technologies. The four most prominent maximally entangled photon pair states are the Bell states. In a typical experiment based on an undriven emitter, only one type of Bell state entanglement can be observed in a given polarization basis. Other types of Bell state entanglement in the same basis can be created by continuously driving the system by an external laser. In this work, we propose a protocol for time-dependent entanglement switching in a four-level quantum emitter-cavity system that can be operated by changing the external driving strength. By selecting different two-photon resonances between the laser-dressed states, we can actively switch back and forth between the different types of Bell state entanglement in the same basis as well as between entangled and nonentangled photon pairs. This remarkable feature demonstrates the possibility to achieve a controlled, time-dependent manipulation of the entanglement type that could be used in many innovative applications.

TI Quantum walks in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Aromaticity is a well-known phenomenon in both physics and chemistry, and is responsible for many unique chemical and physical properties of aromatic molecules. The primary feature contributing to the stability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is the delocalised pi-electron clouds in the 2p(z) orbitals of each of the N carbon atoms. While it is known that electrons delocalize among the hybridized sp(2) orbitals, this paper proposes quantum walk as the mechanism by which the delocalization occurs, and also obtains how the functional chemical structures of these molecules arise naturally out of such a construction. We present results of computations performed for some benzoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in this regard, and show that the quantum walk-based approach does correctly predict the reactive sites and stability order of the molecules considered.

TI Nonequilibrium quantum thermometry with noncommutative system-bath
   couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Accurate temperature estimation in the quantum and cryogenic regimes remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we investigate nonequilibrium quantum thermometry using a single-qubit probe coupled to a bosonic bath through noncommuting interaction operators, which unify pure dephasing and dissipative dynamics within a spin-boson model. We show that the interference between these two coupling channels induces strong non-Markovian feedback between populations and coherences, leading to coherence trapping and enhanced thermal sensitivity. Remarkably, by tuning the coupling structure, the probe's temperature sensitivity exhibits a quadratic low-temperature scaling, even under weak coupling. Moreover, while coherence-based measurements are formally suboptimal, they become the most informative in the early nonequilibrium regime, where memory effects dominate. Our findings identify noncommutative system-bath couplings as a practical and tunable resource for achieving high-precision quantum thermometry in realistic open-system architectures.

TI Preparation of metrological states in dipolar-interacting spin systems
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spin systems are an attractive candidate for quantum-enhanced metrology. Here we develop a variational method to generate metrological states in small dipolar-interacting spin ensembles with limited qubit control. For both regular and disordered spatial spin configurations the generated states enable sensing beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) and, for small spin numbers, approach the Heisenberg limit (HL). Depending on the circuit depth and the level of readout noise, the resulting states resemble Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states or Spin Squeezed States (SSS). Sensing beyond the SQL holds in the presence of finite spin polarization and a non-Markovian noise environment. The developed black-box optimization techniques for small spin numbers (N & LE; 10) are directly applicable to diamond-based nanoscale field sensing, where the sensor size limits N and conventional squeezing approaches fail.

TI Detecting the steerability bounds of generalized Werner states via a
   backpropagation neural network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We use an error backpropagation (BP) neural network to determine whether an arbitrary two-qubit quantum state is steerable and optimize the steerability bounds of the generalized Werner state. Results show that, regardless of how we select the features for the quantum states, we can use the BP neural network to construct several models to obtain high-performance quantum steering classifiers compared with the support vector machine. Moreover, we predict the steerability bounds of the generalized Werner states using the classifiers that are newly constructed by the BP neural network; that is, the predicted steerability bounds are closer to the theoretical bounds. In particular, high-performance quantum steering classifiers with partial information about the quantum states that we need to measure in only three fixed measurement directions are obtained.

TI Quantum engine based on general measurements
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this work, we introduce a three-stroke quantum engine with a single-qubit working substance whose cycle consists of two strokes arise due to performing two distinct general quantum measurements and it is completed by thermalization through contact with a finite temperature thermal reservoir. It is demonstrated that energy is imported into the engine by first measurement channel and work (useful energy) is extracted from it, in a frictionless isentropic manner, by the second measurement channel. It is particularly shown that the engine is capable to have perfect efficiency. In continuation, we equip the engine cycle with two additional adiabatic strokes. As illustrated, the presence of adiabatic strokes in the cycle provide an improved lower bound for the parametrized efficiency range of the engine.

TI Photon-Number-Resolving Detection with Highly Efficient InGaAs/InAlAs
   Single-Photon Avalanche Diode
SO PHOTONICS
AB Photon-number-resolving detectors are in high demand for applications in photonic quantum technology. In this study, we demonstrate the photon-number-resolving capabilities of our self-developed, highly efficient InGaAs/InAlAs single-photon avalanche diode. We achieved intrinsic photon number resolving by harnessing the high multiplication gain generated through an avalanche process in the InAlAs multiplication layer. With a maximum single-photon detection efficiency of 46%, we were able to distinguish photon number states up to 5 from the signal probability distribution without encountering avalanche saturation that could otherwise limit the capability of photon number resolving. We reasonably anticipate that the photon-number-resolving accuracy and capability can be further improved once the noise issue in such InGaAs/InAlAs SPADs is carefully managed.

TI Robust bilinear rotations
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Bilinear rotation elements allow interaction-dependent manipulations of spins in quantum technologies and, particularly, in spectroscopy. We used bilinear rotation in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and derived several ways of introducing robustness into the filter element. We distinguished two performance levels: the coupling dependent inversion of polarization and the full bilinear pi-rotation capability. In addition, all four essential variants of bilinear pi rotations-BIRDd, BIRDr, BIRDd,X, and BIRDr,X filters-were given for all cases studied. In the first step, adiabatic CHIRP-type and BUBI/BUBU pulses lead to improved robustness with respect to offset/detuning effects and variations in B1-field strengths. In the second step, we optimized time-optimal coupling-compensated BIRD elements. Together with correspondingly optimized pulse shapes, we established fully coupling, offset, and B1-compensated bilinear pi-rotation (COB-BIRD) elements and characterized them in theory and experiment. Overall, this demonstrated the use of the robust bilinear rotation capability on a partially aligned sample in a homodecoupled two-dimensional NMR experiment.

TI Motional Sideband Asymmetry of a Solid-State Mechanical Resonator at
   Room Temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The motional sideband asymmetry of a mechanical oscillator interacting with a laser field can be observed when approaching the quantum ground state, where the zero-point energy of the mechanical oscillator becomes a sizable contribution to its motion. In the context of quantum optomechanics, it allows, in principle, calibration-free inference of the thermal equilibrium of a macroscopic mechanical resonator with its optical bath. At room temperature, this phenomenon has been observed in pioneering experiments using levitated nanoparticles. Measuring this effect with solid-state mechanical resonators has been compounded by thermal intermodulation noise, mirror frequency noise and low quantum cooperativity. Here, we sideband-cool a membrane-in-the-middle system close to the quantum ground state from room temperature and observe motional sideband asymmetry in a dual-homodyne measurement. Sideband thermometry yields a minimum phonon occupancy of n<overline>eff = 9.5. Our work provides insights into nonlinear optomechanical dynamics at room temperature and facilitates accessible optomechanical quantum technologies without the need for complex feedback control and cryogenic cooling.

TI Thermal noise in electro-optic devices at cryogenic temperatures
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum bits (qubits) on which superconducting quantum computers are based have energy scales corresponding to photons with GHz frequencies. The energy of photons in the gigahertz domain is too low to allow transmission through the noisy room-temperature environment, where the signal would be lost in thermal noise. Optical photons, on the other hand, have much higher energies, and signals can be detected using highly efficient single-photon detectors. Transduction from microwave to optical frequencies is therefore a potential enabling technology for quantum devices. However, in such a device the optical pump can be a source of thermal noise and thus degrade the fidelity; the similarity of input microwave state to the output optical state. In order to investigate the magnitude of this effect we model the sub-Kelvin thermal behavior of an electro-optic transducer based on a lithium niobate whispering gallery mode resonator. We find that there is an optimum power level for a continuous pump, whilst pulsed operation of the pump increases the fidelity of the conversion.

TI Stark-induced tunable phase transition in the two-photon Dicke-Stark
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically investigate the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in the two-photon Dicke-Stark model, which incorporates both Rabi and Stark coupling. By introducing a Stark coupling term, we significantly reduce the critical Rabi coupling strength required to achieve the SPT, enabling it to occur even in non-ultrastrongcoupling regimes. Using mean-field theory, we derive the conditions for the SPT and show that it exhibits a second-order phase transition. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the transition point can be widely tuned by the Stark coupling strength. The signatures of these Stark-tunable SPT points manifest through atomic pseudospin mean values. When quantum fluctuations are included, the spin-squeezing distributions also reveal the effects of Stark-tunable SPT points. In addition, we propose an experimentally feasible realization using an ion-trap system driven by three lasers. Our scheme enables optical switching between normal and superradiant phases through pump field intensity modulation, where the Stark coupling coefficient serves as the optically tunable parameter. Our results offer an alternative approach to engineer the SPT, extending superradiance-based quantum technologies beyond the ultrastrong-coupling regime.

TI Discrete Chiral Ballistic Polariton Laser
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light appears when the phase of an electromagnetic wavefront winds around its direction of propagation, also known as optical vorticity. Contrary to the binary-valued photon spin, the integer-valued optical vortex charge is unbounded with many advantages in optical communication and trapping and enhancing the capacity of data encoding and multiplexing. Singular optoelectronic and chiroptic quantum technologies rely on the development of coherent and compact light sources of well-defined and reconfigurable OAM. An optically tunable discrete chiral exciton-polariton microlaser is proposed, which leverages strong spin-dependent polariton interactions, structured pumping, and inherent cavity photon spin-to-angular momentum conversion to emit coherent nonlinear light of variable OAM. By choosing pumping patterns with broken inversion symmetry in the microcavity plane, geometric frustration is invoked between spinor ballistic condensates which spontaneously obtain a high-charge circulating current locked with the pump polarization. This optically configurable system requires only a planar cavity, thus avoiding the need for specialized irreversible cavity patterning or metasurfaces.

TI Quantum Light Generation with Ultra-High Spatial Resolution in 2D
   Semiconductors via Ultra-Low Energy Electron Irradiation
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Single photon emitters (SPEs) are building blocks of quantum technologies. Defect engineering of two-dimensional (2D) materials is ideal to fabricate SPEs, wherein spatially deterministic and quality-preserving fabrication methods are critical for integration into quantum devices and cavities. Existing methods use combination of strain and electron irradiation, or ion irradiation, which make fabrication complex, and limited by surrounding lattice damage. Here, only ultra-low energy electron beam (e-beam) irradiation (5 keV) is utilized to create dilute defect density in hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoS2, with ultra-high spatial resolution (<50 nm, extendable to 10 nm). Cryogenic photoluminescence spectra exhibit sharp defect peaks, following power-law for finite density of single defects, and characteristic Zeeman splitting for MoS2 defect complexes. The sharp peaks have low spectral jitter (<200 mu eV), and are tunable with gate-voltage and e-beam energy. Use of low-momentum electron irradiation, ease of processing, and high spatial resolution, will disrupt deterministic creation of high-quality SPEs.

TI Isolating the classical and quantum coherence of a multiphoton system
SO PHOTONIX
AB The classical properties of thermal light fields were instrumental in shaping our early understanding of light. Before the invention of the laser, thermal light was used to investigate the wave-particle duality of light. The subsequent formulation of the quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation later confirmed the classical nature of thermal light fields. Here, we fragment a pseudothermal field into its multiparticle constituents to demonstrate that it can host multiphoton dynamics mediated by either classical or quantum properties of coherence. This is shown in a forty-particle system through a process of scattering mediated by twisted paths endowed with orbital angular momentum. This platform enables accurate projections of the scattered pseudothermal system into isolated multiphoton subsystems governed by quantum dynamics. Interestingly, the isolated multiphoton subsystems exhibiting quantum coherence produce interference patterns previously attributed to entangled optical systems. As such, our work unveils novel mechanisms to isolate quantum systems from classical fields. This possibility opens new paradigms in quantum physics with enormous implications for the development of robust quantum technologies.

This theme has been explored recently, with attention mostly focused on system control or environment engineering. Here, we bring these ideas together to describe the many-body dynamics of an extended atomic array coupled to a squeezed vacuum. We show that fluctuations can drive the array into a pure dark state decoupled from the environment. The dark state is obtained for an even number of atoms and consists of maximally entangled atomic pairs, or dimers, that mimic the behavior of the squeezed field. Each pair displays reduced fluctuations in one polarization quadrature and amplified in another. This dissipation-induced stabilization relies on an efficient transfer of correlations between pairs of photons and atoms. It uncovers the mechanism through which squeezed light causes an atomic array to self-organize and illustrates the increasing importance of spatial correlations in modern quantum technologies where many-body effects play a central role.

TI Turing instability in quantum activator-inhibitor systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Turing instability is a fundamental mechanism of nonequilibrium self-organization. However, despite the universality of its essential mechanism, Turing instability has thus far been investigated mostly in classical systems. In this study, we show that Turing instability can occur in a quantum dissipative system and analyze its quantum features such as entanglement and the effect of measurement. We propose a degenerate parametric oscillator with nonlinear damping in quantum optics as a quantum activator-inhibitor unit and demonstrate that a system of two such units can undergo Turing instability when diffusively coupled with each other. The Turing instability induces nonuniformity and entanglement between the two units and gives rise to a pair of nonuniform states that are mixed due to quantum noise. Further performing continuous measurement on the coupled system reveals the nonuniformity caused by the Turing instability. Our results extend the universality of the Turing mechanism to the quantum realm and may provide a novel perspective on the possibility of quantum nonequilibrium self-organization and its application in quantum technologies.

TI Real-time measurement of non-Hermitian Landau-Zener tunneling near band
   crossings
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Landau-Zener (LZ) tunneling, i.e., the nonadiabatic level transition under strong parameter driving, is a fundamental concept in modern quantum mechanics. With the advent of non-Hermitian physics, research interest has been paid to the LZ tunneling involving level dissipations. However, experimental demonstrations of such an interesting non-Hermitian LZ problem remain yet elusive. By harnessing a synthetic temporal lattice using a fiber-loop circuit, we report on the first real-time measurement of non-Hermitian LZ tunneling in a dissipative two-band lattice model. An innovative approach based on mode interference is developed to measure the transient band occupancies, providing a powerful tool to explore the non-Hermitian LZ tunneling dynamics in non-orthogonal eigenmodes. We find that the loss does not change the final LZ tunneling probability but can highly affect the tunneling process by modifying the typical band occupancies oscillation behaviors. We initiate exploring intriguing LZ physics and measurements beyond the standard Hermitian paradigm, with potential applications in coherent quantum control and quantum technologies.

TI Ubiquitous Superconducting Diode Effect in Superconductor Thin Films
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The macroscopic coherence in superconductors supports dissipationless supercurrents that could play a central role in emerging quantum technologies. Accomplishing unequal supercurrents in the forward and backward directions would enable unprecedented functionalities. This nonreciprocity of critical super -currents is called the superconducting (SC) diode effect. We demonstrate the strong SC diode effect in conventional SC thin films, such as niobium and vanadium, employing external magnetic fields as small as 1 Oe. Interfacing the SC layer with a ferromagnetic semiconductor EuS, we further accomplish the nonvolatile SC diode effect reaching a giant efficiency of 65%. By careful control experiments and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the critical supercurrent nonreciprocity in SC thin films could be easily accomplished with asymmetrical vortex edge and surface barriers and the universal Meissner screening current governing the critical currents. Our engineering of the SC diode effect in simple systems opens the door for novel technologies while revealing the ubiquity of the Meissner screening effect induced SC diode effect in superconducting films, and it should be eliminated with great care in the search for exotic superconducting states harboring finite-momentum Cooper pairing.

TI Effect of Sr Doping on Structural and Transport Properties of
   Bi2Te3
SO MATERIALS
AB Search for doped superconducting topological insulators is of prime importance for new quantum technologies. We report on fabrication of Sr-doped Bi2Te3 single crystals. We found that Bridgman grown samples have p-type conductivity in the low 10(19) cm(-3), high mobility of 4000 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), crystal structure independent on nominal dopant content, and no signs of superconductivity. We also studied molecular beam epitaxy grown SrxBi2-xTe3 films on lattice matched (1 1 1) BaF2 polar surface. Contrary to the bulk crystals thin films have n-type conductivity. Carrier concentration, mobility and c-lattice constant demonstrate pronounced dependence on Sr concentration x. Variation of the parameters did not lead to superconductivity. We revealed, that transport and structural parameters are governed by Sr dopants incorporation in randomly inserted Bi bilayers into the parent matrix. Thus, our data shed light on the structural position of dopant in Bi2Te3 and should be helpful for further design of topological insulator-based superconductors.

TI Experimental Quantum Advantage with Quantum Coupon Collector
SO RESEARCH
AB An increasing number of communication and computational schemes with quantum advantages have recently been proposed, which implies that quantum technology has fertile application prospects. However, demonstrating these schemes experimentally continues to be a central challenge because of the difficulty in preparing high-dimensional states or highly entangled states. In this study, we introduce and analyze a quantum coupon collector protocol by employing coherent states and simple linear optical elements, which was successfully demonstrated using realistic experimental equipment. We showed that our protocol can significantly reduce the number of samples needed to learn a specific set compared with the classical limit of the coupon collector problem. We also discuss the potential values and expansions of the quantum coupon collector by constructing a quantum blind box game. The information transmitted by the proposed game also broke the classical limit. These results strongly prove the advantages of quantum mechanics in machine learning and communication complexity.

In most engineering models the parameters used to simulate the material and its electronic transport properties are derived from experimental results using simple semiempirical approaches. In this paper, we present a high-throughput study of the electron transport properties in Si1-xGex alloys, based on the combination of atomistic first principles calculations and statistical analysis. Our results clarify the effects of the Ge concentration and of disorder on the properties of the Si1-xGex alloy.

TI Excited-State Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance of Spin Defects in
   Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Negatively charged boron vacancy (V-B(-)) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising spin defects in a van der Weals crystal. Understanding the spin properties of the excited state (ES) is critical for realizing dynamic nuclear polarization. Here, we report zero-field splitting in the ES of D-ES = 2160 MHz and its associated optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast of 12% at cryogenic temperature. In contrast to nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond, the ODMR contrast of V-B(-) centers is more prominent at cryotemperature than at room temperature. The ES has a g factor similar to the ground state. The ES photodynamics is further elucidated by measuring the level anticrossing of the V-B(-) defects under varying external magnetic fields. Our results provide important information for utilizing the spin defects of h-BN in quantum technology.

TI Ultra-Sensitive Short-Wave Infrared Single-Photon Detection Using a

SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Ultra-sensitive short-wave infrared (SWIR) photon detection is a crucial aspect of ongoing research in quantum technology. However, developing such detectors on a CMOS-compatible silicon technological platform has been challenging due to the low absorption coefficient for silicon in the SWIR range. In this study, a codoped silicon-based single-electron transistor (SET) in a silicon-on-insulator field-effect transistor (SOI-FET) configuration is fabricated, which successfully detects single photons in the SWIR range with ultra-high sensitivity. The detection mechanism is evidenced by the shift in the onset of the SET current peaks and by the occurrence of random telegraph signals (RTS) under light irradiation, as compared to the dark condition. The calculated sensitivity of our device, in terms of noise equivalent power (NEP), is approximate to 10-19 W Hz-1/2.

TI Integrating Fluorescent Nanodiamonds into Polymeric Microstructures
   Fabricated by Two-Photon Polymerization
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and other color centers in diamond have attracted much attention as non-photobleaching quantum emitters and quantum sensors. Since microfabrication in bulk diamonds is technically difficult, embedding nanodiamonds with color centers into designed structures is a way to integrate these quantum emitters into photonic devices. In this study, we demonstrate a method to incorporate fluorescent nanodiamonds into engineered microstructures using two-photon polymerization (2PP). We studied the optimal concentration of nanodiamonds in the photoresist to achieve structures with at least one fluorescent NV center and good structural and optical quality. Fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy measurements were used to confirm the presence and location of the nanodiamonds, while absorbance measurements assessed scattering losses at higher concentrations. Our results show the feasibility of fabricating microstructures embedded within fluorescent nanodiamonds via 2PP for photonics and quantum technology applications.

TI High-temperature observation of intralayer, interlayer, and Rydberg
   excitons in bulk van der Waals alloy single crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit remarkable optical properties due to the diverse number of strongly bound excitons, which can be fine-tuned by alloying. Despite a flurry of research activity in characterizing these excitons, a comprehensive and profound understanding of their behavior with temperature is lacking. Here, we report the rich spectrum of excitonic features within bulk van der Waals alloy Mo0.5W0.5S2 and Mo0.5W0.5Se2 single crystals through temperature-dependent reflectance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. We observed Rydberg excitons and interlayer excitons in both the single crystals. Notably, we provide the first experimental evidence of highly energetic A' and B' excitons in Mo0.5W0.5S2 at room temperature. The strong carrier-phonon scattering significantly broadens the A', B', and interlayer excitons at room temperature in bulk Mo0.5W0.5S2 single crystal compared to its selenide. Our findings, supported by density functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations, signify the crucial role of carrier-phonon interactions. These results open pathways for next-generation optoelectronic devices and quantum technologies operating at high temperature.

TI Channeling of fluorescence photons from quantum dots into guided modes

SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB We demonstrate the channeling of fluorescence photons from quantum dots (QDs) into guided modes of an optical nanofiber tip (ONFT). We deposit QDs on the ONFT using micro/nano fluidic technology. We measure the photon-counting and emission spectrum of fluorescence photons that are channeled into guided modes of the ONFT. The measured emission spectrum confirms the deposition of QDs on the ONFT. We perform numerical simulations to determine channeling efficiency (eta) for the ONFT and a single dipole source (SDS) system. For the radially oriented SDS at the center of the facet of the ONFT, we found the maximum eta-value of 44% at the fiber size parameter of 7.16, corresponding to the ONFT radius of 0.71 mu m for the emission wavelength at 620 nm. Additionally, we investigate the SDS position dependence in transverse directions on the facet of the ONFT in view of keeping experimental ambiguities. The present fiber inline platform may open new avenues in quantum technologies.

TI Optimal remote restoring of quantum states in communication lines via
   local magnetic field
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Optimal state transport across spin chains, which are proposed as quantum wires for information transfer in solid state quantum architectures, is an important topic for quantum technologies. In this work, we study the remote restoring of a quantum state transferred along a spin chain. The structural state-restoring technique provides proportionality between the appropriate elements of the density matrices of the initial sender state and receiver state at some time instant. We develop a remote state-restoring protocol which uses an inhomogeneous magnetic field with step-wise time-dependent Larmor frequencies as the state-control tool. For simulating the multiparametric Hamiltonian we use two approximating models. First model is based on the Trotter-Suzuki method, while the second model is based on using short pulses of high intensity. In both cases we estimate the accuracy of the approximation and find the optimal restoring parameters (Larmor frequencies) of the protocol which maximize the coefficients in the proportionality for spin chains of various lengths.

TI Characterization of 65-nm CMOS Integrated Resistors in the Cryogenic
   Regime
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB This article presents the experimental characterization and modeling of CMOS resistors in a temperature range extending from room temperature (300 K) down to the deep cryogenic regime at 4 K. A set of poly-silicon resistors with different bulk structures and sizing have been fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and their I-V curves have been obtained experimentally in the 4 to 300 K range with a temperature step of only 0.5 K to obtain a large set of resistance values equally distributed along the temperature range. The plot of the resistance values against temperature has allowed us to obtain the temperature coefficient alpha(T) of the different resistors in the whole temperature range down to 4 K. Interestingly, for all the measured resistors the alpha(T) -T curves show a change in tendency for temperatures spanning from 66 to 98 K, this is, in the vicinity of the condensation temperature of nitrogen (77 K), where most of the thermal contraction of materials occurs.

TI Toward Magneto-Optical Cryogenic Thermometers with High Sensitivity: A
   Magnetic Circular Dichroism Based Thermometric Approach
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Remote temperature probing at the cryogenic range is of utmost importance for the advancement of future quantum technologies. Despite the notable achievements in luminescent thermometers, accurately measuring temperatures below 10K remains a challenging endeavor. In this study, we propose a novel magneto-optical thermometric approach based on the magnetic-circular dichroism (MCD) technique, which offers unprecedented capabilities for meticulous temperature variation analysis at cryogenic temperatures. The inherent temperature sensitivity of the MCD C-term, in conjunction with both positive and negative signals, enables highly sensitive magneto-optical temperature probing. Additionally, a groundbreaking relative thermal sensitivity value of 95.3%K-1 at 2.54K can be achieved using a mononuclear lanthanide complex, [[Ho(acac)(3)(phen)], in the presence of a 0.25T applied magnetic field and using a combination of multiparametric thermal read-out with multiple regression. These results unequivocally demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our methodology for cryogenic temperature sensing.

TI Growth of self-integrated atomic quantum wires and junctions of a Mott
   semiconductor
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Continued advances in quantum technologies rely on producing nanometer-scale wires. Although several state-of-the-art nanolithographic technologies and bottom-up synthesis processes have been used to engineer these wires, critical challenges remain in growing uniform atomic-scale crystalline wires and constructing their network structures. Here, we discover a simple method to fabricate atomic-scale wires with various arrange-ments, including stripes, X-junctions, Y-junctions, and nanorings. Single-crystalline atomic-scale wires of a Mott insulator, whose bandgap is comparable to those of wide-gap semiconductors, are spontaneously grown on graphite substrates by pulsed-laser deposition. These wires are one unit cell thick and have an exact width of two and four unit cells (1.4 and 2.8 nm) and lengths up to a few micrometers. We show that the nonequilibrium reaction-diffusion processes may play an essential role in atomic pattern formation. Our findings offer a previously unknown perspective on the nonequilibrium self-organization phenomena on an atomic scale, paving a unique way for the quantum architecture of nano-network.

TI First-principles ionized-impurity scattering and charge transport in
   doped materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Scattering of carriers with ionized impurities governs charge transport in doped semiconductors. However, electron interactions with ionized impurities cannot be fully described with quantitative first-principles calculations, so their understanding relies primarily on simplified models. Here we show an ab initio approach to compute the interactions between electrons and ionized impurities or other charged defects. It includes the shortand long-range electron-defect (e-d) interactions on equal footing and allows for efficient interpolation of the e-d matrix elements. We combine the e-d and electron-phonon interactions in the Boltzmann transport equation to compute the carrier mobilities in doped silicon over a wide range of temperature and doping concentrations, seamlessly spanning the defect- and phonon-limited transport regimes. The individual contributions of the defect- and phonon-scattering mechanisms to the carrier relaxation times and mean-free paths are analyzed. Our method provides a powerful tool to study electronic interactions in doped materials. It broadens the scope of first-principles transport calculations, enabling studies of a wide range of doped semiconductors and oxides with application to electronics, energy, and quantum technologies.

TI Gauge freedom, quantum measurements, and time-dependent interactions in
   cavity QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The interaction between quantized electromagnetic fields in cavities and natural or artificial atoms has played a crucial role in developing our understanding of light-matter interactions and quantum technologies. Recently, new regimes beyond the weak and strong light-matter coupling of cavity-QED have been explored in several settings, wherein the light-matter coupling rate becomes comparable to (ultrastrong coupling) or even exceeds (deep-strong coupling) the photon frequency. These ultrastrong coupling regimes can give rise to new physical effects and applications, and they challenge our understanding of cavity QED; fundamental issues like the proper definition of subsystems, their quantum measurements, the structure of light-matter ground states, and the analysis of time-dependent interactions are subject to gauge ambiguities that lead to even qualitatively distinct predictions. The resolution of these ambiguities is important for understanding and designing next-generation quantum devices that can operate in extreme coupling regimes. Here we discuss and provide solutions to these ambiguities by adopting an approach based on operational procedures involving measurements on the individual light and matter components of the interacting system.

TI Micro-fabricated caesium vapor cell with 5 mm optical path length
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Micro-fabricated vapor cells have applications in a number of emerging quantum technology-based devices including miniaturized atomic magnetometers, atomic clocks, and frequency references for laser systems. Increasing the cell optical path length (OPL) and smallest cell dimension are normally desirable to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and minimize the de-polarization rate due to collisions between atomic or molecular species and the cell walls. This paper presents a fully wafer-level scalable fabrication process to manufacture vapor cells with dimensions approaching those of glass-blown cells. The fabrication process is described, and spectroscopic measurements (optical absorption and magnetic resonance) are reported. A magnetic resonance linewidth of 350 Hz is demonstrated, and this is the smallest linewidth reported to date for a micro-fabricated vapor cell. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Plasmon-enhanced single photon source directly coupled to an optical
   fiber
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A bright source of fiber-coupled, polarized single photons is an essential component of any realistic quantum network based on today's existing fiber infrastructure. Here, we develop a Purcell-enhanced, polarized source of single photons at room temperature by coupling single colloidal quantum dots to the localized surface plasmon-polariton modes of single gold nanorods, combined on the surface of an optical nanofiber. A maximum enhancement of the photon emission rate of 62 times was measured corresponding to a degree of polarization of 85%, and a brightness enhancement of four times in the fiber mode. Evanescent coupling of photons to the nanofiber guided modes ensures automatic coupling to a single mode fiber. Our technique opens the way to realizing bright sources of polarized single photons connected to fiber networks using a simple composite technique.

TI Multiple channelling single-photon emission with scattering holography
   designed metasurfaces
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Channelling single-photon emission in multiple well-defined directions and simultaneously controlling its polarization characteristics is highly desirable for numerous quantum technology applications. We show that this can be achieved by using quantum emitters (QEs) nonradiatively coupled to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are scattered into outgoing free-propagating waves by appropriately designed metasurfaces. The QE-coupled metasurface design is based on the scattering holography approach with radially diverging SPPs as reference waves. Using holographic metasurfaces fabricated around nanodiamonds with single Ge vacancy centres, we experimentally demonstrate on-chip integrated efficient generation of two well-collimated single-photon beams propagating along different 15 degrees off-normal directions with orthogonal linear polarizations.
   Here the authors demonstrate on-chip single-photon source providing two emission channels with individual direction and polarization control of each channel by implementing a plasmonic holographic metasurface coupled to a Ge-vacancy nanodiamond.

TI Tutorial: Nonlinear magnonics
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Nonlinear magnonics studies the nonlinear interaction between magnons and other physical platforms (phonon, photon, qubit, spin texture) to generate novel magnon states for information processing. In this Tutorial, we first introduce the nonlinear interactions of magnons in pure magnetic systems and hybrid magnon-phonon and magnon-photon systems. Then, we show how these nonlinear interactions can generate exotic magnonic phenomena. In the classical regime, we will cover the parametric excitation of magnons, bistability and multistability, and magnonic frequency comb. In the quantum regime, we will discuss the single-magnon state, Schrodinger cat state, and the entanglement and quantum steering among magnons, photons, and phonons. The applications of the hybrid magnonics systems in quantum transducer and sensing will also be presented. Finally, we look at the future development direction of nonlinear magnonics.

SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB n-type diamond substrates are highly desired for diamond electronics and quantum technology based on NV centers. In this work, we investigate the high growth rates obtained using plasma with high-power densities in a commercial bell-jar chemical vapor deposition reactor equipped with a gas panel for diamond doping with phosphorus impurities. We evidence that the diamond growth rate is increased by adding phosphorus precursor in the gas mixture, up to 21.6 mu m/h. We found conditions for growing extremely thick (up 580 mu m) phosphorus doped (100) diamond homoepilayers keeping a n-type character as shown by optical spectroscopy. From such films we succeed in slicing a free-standing phosphorus-doped diamond plate, showing the feasibility of n-type diamond substrate fabrication for further use in optoelectronics and quantum devices.

AB With the rapid progress of superconducting quantum technology, the demand for cooling capacity from dilution refrigerators (DRs) is growing. The approach of increasing the mass flow rate to obtain a high cooling capacity is limited by the critical velocity of the dilute phase. In this paper, the critical velocity limitation of the dilute phase is considered, and the effects of the dilution unit structures on the performance of a high cooling capacity DR are studied. Furthermore, leveraging the physical properties of He-3 and He-3-He-4 mixtures, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on the viscous heating in the heat exchanger, particularly in the critical velocity conditions. The structural dimensions of the heat exchangers at 0-5000 mu W@100 mK and 0-50 mu W@10 mK are obtained theoretically. This thermodynamic model provides strong support to design and optimize DRs with high cooling capacity.

TI High kinetic inductance cavity arrays for compact band engineering and
   topology-based disorder meters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconducting microwave metamaterials offer enormous potential for quantum optics and information science, enabling the development of advanced quantum technologies for sensing and amplification. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, such metamaterials can be implemented as coupled cavity arrays (CCAs). In the continuous effort to miniaturize quantum devices for increasing scalability, minimizing the footprint of CCAs while preserving low disorder becomes paramount. In this work, we present a compact CCA architecture using superconducting NbN thin films manifesting high kinetic inductance. The latter enables high-impedance CCA (similar to 1.5 k Omega), while reducing the resonator footprint. We demonstrate its versatility and scalability by engineering one-dimensional CCAs with up to 100 resonators and with structures that exhibit multiple bandgaps. Additionally, we quantitatively investigate disorder in the CCAs using symmetry-protected topological SSH edge modes, from which we extract a resonator frequency scattering of 0.22(-0.03)(+0.04%). Our platform opens up exciting prospects for analog quantum simulations of many-body physics with ultrastrongly coupled emitters.

TI Observation of Superradiant Bursts in a Cascaded Quantum System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We experimentally investigate the collective radiative decay of a fully inverted ensemble of two -level atoms for a chiral, i.e., propagation direction -dependent light -matter coupling. Despite a fundamentally different interaction Hamiltonian which has a reduced symmetry compared to the standard Dicke case of superradiance, we do observe a superradiant burst of light. The burst occurs above a threshold number of atoms, and its peak power scales faster with the number of atoms than in the case of free -space Dicke superradiance. We measure the first -order coherence of the burst and experimentally distinguish two regimes, one dominated by the coherence induced during the excitation process and the other governed by vacuum fluctuations. Our results shed light on the collective radiative dynamics of cascaded quantum many -body systems, i.e., systems in which each quantum emitter is only driven by light radiated by emitters that are upstream in the cascade. Our findings may turn out useful for generating multiphoton Fock states as a resource for quantum technologies.

TI Classical Simulation of Short-Time Quantum Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent progress in the development of quantum technologies has enabled the direct investigation of the dynamics of increasingly complex quantum many-body systems. This motivates the study of the complexity of classical algorithms for this problem in order to benchmark quantum simulators and to delineate the regime of quantum advantage. Here, we present classical algorithms for approximating the dynamics of local observables and nonlocal quantities such as the Loschmidt echo, where the evolution is governed by a local Hamiltonian. For short times, their computational cost scales polynomially with the system size and the inverse of the approximation error. In the case of local observables, the proposed algorithm has a better dependence on the approximation error than algorithms based on the Lieb-Robinson bound. Our results use cluster-expansion techniques adapted to the dynamical setting, for which we give a novel proof of their convergence. This has important physical consequences besides our efficient algorithms. In particular, we establish a novel quantum speed limit, a bound on dynamical phase transitions, and a concentration bound for product states evolved for short times.

TI Custom Nonlinearity Profile for Integrated Quantum Light Sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Heralded single-photon sources are a fundamental building block for optical quantum technologies. These sources need to be unfiltered and integrated to have good scalability and avoid unnecessary losses. To attain this goal, it is necessary to control the effective nonlinearity seen by the fields as they mix and propagate in a waveguide source. In this paper, we introduce a method to design nonlinear waveguides with arbitrarily shaped effective nonlinearity profiles. The method takes advantage of the fact that the second-order nonlinear response is a tensor quantity and thus the local effective nonlinearity of a material depends on the propagation direction of the fields participating in the interaction. Thus, by locally changing the propagation direction of the fields we can modulate the wave-mixing process. Our method allows for the waveguide fabrication process to be significantly simplified. The material structure of the waveguide is made by a single crystal, no longer needing oriented patterning or periodic poling. We use our method to design waveguides with a nonlinearity profile that is Gaussian in the propagation length, allowing the generation of perfectly pure heralded single photons.

TI Postprocessing of quantum instruments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Studying sequential measurements is of the utmost importance to both the foundational aspects of quantum theory and the practical implementations of quantum technologies, with both of these applications being abstractly described by the concatenation of quantum instruments into a sequence of a certain length. In general, the choice of instrument at any given step in the sequence can be conditionally chosen based on the classical results of all preceding instruments. For two instruments in a sequence we consider the conditional second instrument as an effective way of postprocessing the first instrument into a new one. This is similar to how a measurement described by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) can be postprocessed into another by way of classical randomization of its outcomes using a stochastic matrix. In this work we study the postprocessing relation of instruments and the partial order it induces on their equivalence classes. We characterize the greatest and the least element of this order, give examples of postprocessings between different types of instruments, and draw connections between postprocessings of some of these instruments and their induced POVMs.

TI Simulating two-dimensional dynamics within a large-size atomic spin
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Encoding a dimension in the internal degree of freedom of an atom provides an interesting tool for quantum simulation, facilitating the realization of artificial gauge fields. We propose an extension of the synthetic dimension toolbox, making it possible to encode two dimensions within a large atomic spin. The protocol combines first- and second-order spin couplings such that the spin projection m and the remainder r = m (mod 3) of its Euclidian division by 3 act as orthogonal coordinates on a synthetic cylinder. It is suited for an implementation with lanthanide atoms, which feature a large electronic spin and narrow optical transitions for applying the required spin couplings. This method is useful for simulating geometries with periodic boundary conditions and engineering various types of topological systems evolving in high dimensions.

TI Fundamental limits on concentrating and preserving tensorized quantum
   resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum technology offers great advantages in many applications by exploiting quantum resources like nonclassicality, coherence, and entanglement. In practice, an environmental noise unavoidably affects a quantum system and it is thus an important issue to protect quantum resources from noise. In this paper, we investigate the manipulation of quantum resources possessing the so-called tensorization property and identify the fundamental limitations on concentrating and preserving those quantum resources. We show that if a resource measure satisfies the tensorization property as well as the monotonicity, it is impossible to concentrate multiple noisy copies into a single better resource by free operations. Furthermore, we show that quantum resources cannot be better protected from channel noises by employing correlated input states on joint channels if the channel output resource exhibits the tensorization property. We address several practical resource measures where our theorems apply and manifest their physical meanings in quantum resource manipulation.

TI Universal scaling of adiabatic tunneling out of a shallow confinement
   potential
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ability to tune quantum tunneling is key for achieving selectivity in manipulation of individual particles in quantum technology applications. In this work we count electron escape events out of a time-dependent confinement potential, realized as a dynamic quantum dot in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. A universal scaling relation of the escape probability as a function of potential barrier rise time and depth is established and developed as a method to probe tunneling rates over many orders of magnitude reaching the limit of shallow anharmonic confinement. Crossover to thermally activated transport is used to estimate the single time-energy scale of the universal model. In application to metrological single-electron sources, in situ calibrated control signals greatly extend the accessible dynamical range for probing the quantization mechanism. Validation of the cubic potential approximation sets a foundation for microscopic modeling of quantum tunneling devices in the shallow confinement regime.

TI Modulation transfer spectroscopy of 7Li D1 line
SO JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
AB We present the first implementation of modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) on the D1 line of Li-7, carried out in a compact heat-pipe vapor cell with cold windows. By varying the pump and probe intensities and polarization configurations, we systematically map the MTS error-signal amplitude, effective linewidth, and slope for the ground-state crossover resonance F = 1x2 -> F ' = 2. We observe Rabi-induced power broadening and identify optimal conditions for laser frequency stabilization via tightly focused beams with total power below 1 mW. The lin perpendicular to lin polarization configuration yields a sharp, symmetric, high-contrast error signal with a maximal slope. Our findings establish the MTS spectrum of the Li-7 D1 line transitions as a reliable frequency reference for quantum technology and ultracold atom experiments, particularly in scenarios where frequency stabilization must be achieved with low laser optical power.

TI Observation of many-body scarring in a Bose-Hubbard quantum simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ongoing quest for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics of complex quantum systems underpins the foundation of statistical physics as well as the development of quantum technology. Quantum many-body scarring has recently opened a window into novel mechanisms for delaying the onset of thermalization by preparing the system in special initial states, such as the Z2 state in a Rydberg atom system. Here we realize many-body scarring in a Bose-Hubbard quantum simulator from previously unknown initial conditions such as the unit-filling state. We develop a quantum-interference protocol for measuring the entanglement entropy and demonstrate that scarring traps the many-body system in a low-entropy subspace. Our work makes the resource of scarring accessible to a broad class of ultracold-atom experiments, and it allows one to explore the relation of scarring to constrained dynamics in lattice gauge theories, Hilbert space fragmentation, and disorder-free localization.

TI Hyperfine structure and collisions in three-photon Rydberg
   electromagnetically induced transparency
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Multiphoton electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of atomic vapors involves several intermediate atomic levels. The substructure of these levels and their collisional interactions can drastically alter experimental EIT signals. Here we report on hyperfine structure and collision effects in three-photon Rydberg EIT on the cascade 5S1/2 -> 5P1/2 -> 5D3/2 -> 25F5/2 in a room-temperature 85Rb vapor cell. In our measurements of EIT spectra, we identify two types of EIT signatures that correspond with distinct excitation pathways and atomic velocity classes in the atomic vapor. The 5D3/2 hyperfine structure and Autler-Townes splittings lead to complex patterns in the EIT spectra, which we analyze with the aid of 10-level EIT simulations. Adding 50 mTorr of Ar gas alters the EIT spectra and induces an additional, third EIT mode. Based on our simulation results, we attribute these changes to hyperfine collisions in the Rb 5D3/2 level. Our study may become useful in quantum technologies involving Rydberg EIT and hyperfine collisions in vapor cells, including noninvasive spatiotemporally resolved electric-field sensing of electric fields in low-pressure plasmas.

TI Nonlinear optics in 2D materials: From classical to quantum
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonics, enabling a wide array of technologies, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light-matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations-such as electrons, excitons, and photons-in low-dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.

TI Impact of annealing and nanostructuring on properties of NV centers
   created by different techniques
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds have been an epicenter of research for diverse applications in quantum technologies. It is therefore imperative that their fabrication techniques are well understood and characterized for the technological scalability of these applications. A comparative study of the optical and spin properties of NVs created by ion implantation and chemical vapor deposition delta-doping is thus presented, combined with an investigation on the impact of annealing in vacuum at different temperatures. In addition, nanopillars are fabricated by electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching for enhanced photon collection efficiency. An extensive combination of characterization techniques is employed. Notably, the smallest nanopillars present fluorescence enhancements of factor around 50, compared to the unstructured regions. Annealing is also demonstrated to increase the optical contrast between the NVs' electronic states, the coherence and relaxation times both in bulk as in pillars. Regarding the NV preparation technique, the delta-doping is shown to create NVs with less lattice defects and strain compared to implantation.

TI CeTaN3 and CeNbN3: Prospective Nitride Perovskites

SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Perovskites constitute an exceptionally tunable materials family with diverse applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy, and quantum technologies. Out of the thousands of known perovskites, the majority of compounds are oxides, halides, and chalcogenides. In contrast, only two nitride perovskites are currently known. In this work we perform a thorough ab initio computational screening of possible nitride perovskites, and we identify two new compounds, CeNbN3 and CeTaN3, with band gaps in the near-infrared to visible range, depending on temperature. In their room-temperature orthorhombic phase, we predict that both compounds exhibit direct or quasidirect band gaps in the range 1.1 2.0 eV, with the Pnma phases matching the Shockley-Queisser limit for photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency. These compounds are also predicted to be strong light absorbers, with absorption coefficients surpassing those of high-performance semiconductors such as GaAs and CH3NH3PbI3. The present findings reveal a potentially new class of nitride semiconductors with promise for electronics, optoelectronics, and light harvesting and for integration with existing nitride-based lighting technology.

TI Line-by-line control of 10,000 modes in a 20 GHz laser frequency comb

AB The independent manipulation of each line in a laser frequency comb is a powerful resource for emerging applications in optical waveform synthesis, spectroscopy, quantum technology, microwave photonics, astrophotonics, and metrology.Previous demonstrations of line-by-line modulation reported the control of hundreds of comb modes, with bandwidth:resolution ratios of a few thousand. Here, we present a spectral shaper concept achieving precise amplitude control of 10,000 comb modes spanning 580-950 nm (200 THz), with a bandwidth:resolution ratio exceeding 20,000. We demonstrate its application to the dynamic flattening and free spectral range control of an astrocomb, together with fully arbitrary line-by-line grayscale modulation. Our approach is directly extendable to dual amplitude and phase shaping as an enabler for high-repetition-rate optical waveform synthesis and precision spectral shaping across unprecedented bandwidths.

TI Bioexcitons by Design: How Do We Get There?
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB Biological pigment-protein complexes (PPCs) exhibit a remarkable ability to tune the optical properties of biological excitons (bioexcitons) through specific pigment-protein interactions. While such fine-tuning allows natural systems (e.g., photosynthetic proteins) to carry out their native functions with near-optimal performance, native function itself is often suboptimal for applications such as biofuel production or quantum technology development. This perspective offers a look at near term prospects for the rational reoptimization of PPC bioexcitons for new functions using site-directed mutagenesis. The primary focus is on the "structure-spectrum" challenge of understanding the relationships between structural features and spectroscopic properties. While recent examples demonstrate that site-directed mutagenesis can be used to tune nearly all key bioexciton parameters (e.g., site energies, interpigment couplings, and electronic-vibrational interactions), critical challenges remain before we achieve truly rational design of bioexciton properties.

AB In two of the main areas of post-quantum cryptography, based on lattices and codes, nearest neighbor techniques have been used to speed up state-of-the-art cryptanalytic algorithms, and to obtain the lowest asymptotic cost estimates to date [May-Ozerov, Eurocrypt'15; Becker-Ducas-Gama-Laarhoven, SODA'16]. These upper bounds are useful for assessing the security of cryptosystems against known attacks, but to guarantee long-term security one would like to have closely matching lower bounds, showing that improvements on the algorithmic side will not drastically reduce the security in the future. As existing lower bounds from the nearest neighbor literature do not apply to the nearest neighbor problems appearing in this context, one might wonder whether further speedups to these cryptanalytic algorithms can still be found by only improving the nearest neighbor subroutines.
   We derive new lower bounds on the costs of solving the nearest neighbor search problems appearing in these cryptanalytic settings. For the Euclidean metric we show that for random data sets on the sphere, the locality-sensitive filtering approach of [Becker-Ducas-Gama-Laarhoven, SODA 2016] using spherical caps is optimal, and hence within a broad class of lattice sieving algorithms covering almost all approaches to date, their asymptotic time complexity of 2(0.292d+o(d)) is optimal. Similar conditional optimality results apply to lattice sieving variants, such as the 2(0.265d+o(d)) complexity for quantum sieving [Laarhoven, PhD thesis 2016] and previously derived complexity estimates for tuple sieving [Herold-Kirshanova-Laarhoven, PKC 2018]. For the Hamming metric we derive new lower bounds for nearest neighbor searching which almost match the best upper bounds from the literature [May-Ozerov, Eurocrypt 2015]. As a consequence we derive conditional lower bounds on decoding attacks, showing that also here one should search for improvements elsewhere to significantly undermine security estimates from the literature.

TI Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the
   exponential distribution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.

TI Conditional Entanglement Amplification via Non-Hermitian Superradiant
   Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Because of the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system can produce distinct measurement outcomes, particularly when coupled to a dissipative environment. Although quantum trajectories that lead to exotic, highly entangled states are possible in principle, their observation is typically hindered by extremely low probabilities. In this Letter, we present a method to significantly enhance the probability of generating highly entangled states in an ensemble of atoms undergoing collective superradiant decay on timescales much shorter than the individual atomic spontaneous emission rate. By analyzing an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the dynamics between photon emission events, we identify the conditions necessary for these rare no-click trajectories to occur with higher likelihood. Crucially, our method relies on initializing the system in a nonclassical state, whose entanglement is amplified via the non-Hermitian superradiant dynamics. This approach provides a new route to creating highly entangled macroscopic states such as atomic Schr & ouml;dinger cat states, paving the way for advancements in quantum metrology and other quantum technologies.

TI Plasmon-enhanced exciton relocalization in quasi-2D perovskites for
   low-threshold room-temperature plasmonic lasing
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Room-temperature nanolasers are crucial for advancing optical communication and photonic quantum technologies due to their capability to generate coherent light at a subwavelength scale. However, their development is constrained by challenges such as insufficient gain, material instability, and high lasing thresholds. By integrating quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites with high-Q plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate a stable, wavelength-tunable, single-mode laser operating at room temperature. This device leverages a unique exciton relocalization effect in quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with additives, substantially enhancing optical gain and improving stability. When coupled with a waveguide-hybridized surface lattice resonance mode, the enhanced light-matter interaction facilitates single-mode lasing with a notably low threshold of 0.9 millijoules per square centimeter. In addition, the device achieves robust lasing performance with extended operational stability (1.8 x 106 excitation pulses). These results provide a scalable, low-cost, and energy-efficient platform for nanolasing, with potential applications in next-generation photonic technologies, including light detection and ranging, sensing, optical communication, and computation.

TI A Disruptive Technology Identification Method for New Power Systems
   Based on Patent Evolution Analysis
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Disruptive technologies have been employed in various fields with a strategic priority in several countries as the core driving force of the fourth industrial revolution, significantly impacting the development of new power systems. It is a kernel to effectively identify the future potential of disruptive technologies. To overcome the subjectivity and limitations of existing disruptive technology identification methods, we propose a disruptive technology identification method based on patent evolution analysis. Firstly, the evolution matrix of the patent data is calculated. Afterward, we dig into the characteristics of disruptive technologies to build a more targeted identification index system. Finally, the fields of electric power communication and energy generation are selected as typical cases to build the patent data sets. The future development of the identified technologies, including the identified quantum technologies and controlled fusion, is analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can identify the key technologies of new power systems accurately and contribute to completing the industrial upgrading and transformation more rapidly.

TI Vacuum-field-induced THz transport gap in a carbon nanotube quantum dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Strong light-matter coupling has been realized at the level of single atoms and photons throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum, except for the THz range. Here, the authors report a THz-scale transport gap, induced by vacuum fluctuations in carbon nanotube quantum dot through the deep strong coupling of a single electron to a THz resonator.
   The control of light-matter interaction at the most elementary level has become an important resource for quantum technologies. Implementing such interfaces in the THz range remains an outstanding problem. Here, we couple a single electron trapped in a carbon nanotube quantum dot to a THz resonator. The resulting light-matter interaction reaches the deep strong coupling regime that induces a THz energy gap in the carbon nanotube solely by the vacuum fluctuations of the THz resonator. This is directly confirmed by transport measurements. Such a phenomenon which is the exact counterpart of inhibition of spontaneous emission in atomic physics opens the path to the readout of non-classical states of light using electrical current. This would be a particularly useful resource and perspective for THz quantum optics.

TI Emergent Optical Resonances in Atomically Phase-Patterned Semiconducting
   Monolayers of WS2
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Atomic-scale control of light-matter interactions represents the ultimate frontier for many applications in photonics and quantum technology. Two-dimensional semiconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides, are a promising platform to achieve such control due to the combination of an atomically thin geometry and convenient photophysical properties. Here, we demonstrate that a variety of durable polymorphic structures can be combined to generate additional optical resonances beyond the standard excitons. We theoretically predict and experimentally show that atomic-sized patches of the 1T phase within the 1H matrix form unique electronic bands that lead to the emergence of robust optical resonances with strong absorption, circularly polarized emission, and long radiative lifetimes. The atomic manipulation of two-dimensional semiconductors opens unexplored scenarios for light harvesting devices and exciton-based photonics.

TI Heat-based circuits using quantum rectification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With the increased power consumption of modern computer components, heat-based circuitry has become ever more relevant due to a lower power expense to process logic bits of information. In heat-based circuits, computations are performed by driving heat currents through a circuit using a temperature difference. Utilizing harmonic oscillators and three-level quantum rectifiers as base components, we study three different heat-based circuits: a series configuration of diodes, a parallel configuration of diodes, and a diode bridge rectifier. We demonstrate the required functionality of each circuit for use as heat-based analogues of standard electronic components. Furthermore, the diode bridge rectifier is found to give a consistent sign of the output bias independent of the input bias, thus rectifying the input. Our results prove the theoretical feasibility of combining heat current components into heat-based circuits. The three circuits should be realizable using several of the current quantum technology platforms.

TI Growth of PbTe nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Advances in quantum technology may come from the discovery of new materials systems that improve the performance or allow for new functionality in electronic devices. Lead telluride (PbTe) is a member of the group IV-VI materials family that has significant untapped potential for exploration. Due to its high electron mobility, strong spin-orbit coupling and ultrahigh dielectric constant it can host few-electron quantum dots and ballistic quantum wires with opportunities for control of electron spins and other quantum degrees of freedom. Here, we report the fabrication of PbTe nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy. We achieve defect-free single crystalline PbTe with large aspect ratios up to 50 suitable for quantum devices. Furthermore, by fabricating a single nanowire field effect transistor, we attain bipolar transport, extract the bandgap and observe Fabry-Perot oscillations of conductance, a signature of quasiballistic transmission.

TI Data-driven quantum approximate optimization algorithm for power systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB Quantum technology provides a ground-breaking methodology to tackle challenging computational issues in power systems. It is especially promising for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) dominant systems that have been widely developed to promote energy sustainability. In those systems, knowing the maximum sections of power and data delivery is essential for monitoring, operation, and control. However, high computational effort is required. By leveraging quantum resources, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides a means to search for these sections efficiently. However, QAOA performance relies heavily on critical parameters, especially for weighted graphs. Here we present a data-driven QAOA, which transfers quasi-optimal parameters between weighted graphs based on the normalized graph density. We verify the strategy with 39,774 expectation value calculations. Without parameter optimization, our data-driven QAOA is comparable with the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. This work advances QAOA and pilots its practical application to power systems in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Induced superconductivity in hybrid
   Au/YBa2Cu3O7-x electrodes on vicinal
   substrates
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Superconducting electrodes are an integral part of hybrid Josephson junctions used in many applications including quantum technologies. We report on the fabrication and characterization of superconducting hybrid Au/YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) electrodes on vicinal substrates. In these structures, superconducting CuO2-planes face the gold film, resulting in a higher value and smaller variation of the induced energy gap compared to conventional Au/YBCO electrodes based on films with the c-axis normal to the substrate surface. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe an energy gap of about 10-17 meV at the surface of the 15- nm-thick gold layer deposited in situ atop the YBCO film. To study the origin of this gap, we fabricate nanoconstrictions from the Au/YBCO heterostructures and measure their electrical transport characteristics. The conductance of the nanoconstrictions shows a series of dips due to multiple Andreev reflections in YBCO and gold, providing clear evidence of the superconducting nature of the gap in gold. We consider the Au/YBCO electrodes to be a versatile platform for hybrid Josephson devices with a high operating temperature.

TI Low-loss silicon nitride photonic ICs for near-infrared wavelength

AB Low-loss photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are the key elements in future quantum technologies, nonlinear photonics and neural networks. The low-loss photonic circuits technol-ogy targeting C-band application is well established across multi-project wafer (MPW) fabs, whereas near-infrared (NIR) PICs suitable for the state-of-the-art single-photon sources are still underdeveloped. Here, we report the labs-scale process optimization and optical characterization of low-loss tunable photonic integrated circuits for single-photon applications. We demonstrate the lowest propagation losses to the date (as low as 0.55 dB/cm at 925 nm wavelength) in single-mode silicon nitride submicron waveguides (220x550 nm). This performance is achieved due to advanced e-beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching steps which yields waveguides vertical sidewalls with down to 0.85 nm sidewall roughness. These results provide a chip-scale low-loss PIC platform that could be even further improved with high quality SiO2 cladding, chemical-mechanical polishing and multistep annealing for extra-strict single-photon applications.

TI Investigating a (3+1)D topological θ-term in the Hamiltonian formulation
   of lattice gauge theories for quantum and classical simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum technologies offer the prospect to efficiently simulate sign-problem afflicted regimes in lattice field theory, such as the presence of topological terms, chemical potentials, and out-of-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, we derive the (3 + 1)D topological theta-term for Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in the Hamiltonian formulation, paving the way toward Hamiltonian-based simulations of such terms on quantum and classical computers. We further study numerically the zero-temperature phase structure of a (3 + 1)D U(1) lattice gauge theory with the theta-term via exact diagonalization for a single periodic cube. In the strong coupling regime, our results suggest the occurrence of a phase transition at constant values of theta, as indicated by an avoided level crossing and abrupt changes in the plaquette expectation value, the electric energy density, and the topological charge density. These results could in principle be cross-checked by the recently developed (3 + 1)D tensor network methods and quantum simulations, once sufficient resources become available.

TI Quantum concepts in optical polarization
SO ADVANCES IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
AB We comprehensively review the quantum theory of the polarization properties of light. In classical optics, these traits are characterized by the Stokes parameters, which can be geometrically interpreted using the Poincare sphere. Remarkably, these Stokes parameters can also be applied to the quantum world, but then important differences emerge: now, because fluctuations in the number of photons are unavoidable, one is forced to work in the three-dimensional Poincare space that can be regarded as a set of nested spheres. Additionally, higher-order moments of the Stokes variables might play a substantial role for quantum states, which is not the case for most classical Gaussian states. This brings about important differences between these two worlds that we review in detail. In particular, the classical degree of polarization produces unsatisfactory results in the quantum domain. We compare alternative quantum degrees and put forth that they order various states differently. Finally, intrinsically nonclassical states are explored, and their potential applications in quantum technologies are discussed. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America.

TI Nature of current flow in the regime of the quantum Hall effect
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) belongs to the most fundamental phenomena of solid state physics and has an important application as resistance standard. It serves as a basis to understand the fractional, anomalous or spin QHEs, candidates for applications in quantum technology due to their topological properties. For optimizing all these applications it is essential to understand where the current flows inside the Hall bar, a question disputed for decades. We perform multiterminal current measurements on a Hall bar and compare the results with limiting models. We confirm, based on these experiments, that the current flow is chiral for the plateaus of quantized Hall resistance. Everywhere else, including the ranges between plateaus, our results comply with the Drude model, which predicts homogeneous current flow across a homogeneous Hall-bar.

TI Three-dimensional programming of nanolaser arrays through a single
   optical microfiber
SO OPTICA
AB Efficient programming of integrated small optical sources is a key component of photonic technologies. However, as the density of laser arrays increases, the miniaturization and scalability of laser control using an electric drive are pushed to the limit. This study presents an all-optical drive scheme for complete programming of nanolaser arrays through a single waveguide port. Three photonic crystal nanolasers, printed three-dimensionally on the sides of a 2-mu m-diameter fiber with an 18 mu mlaser spacing, were entirely controlled by modal interference, adjusted by the polarization and pulse width of the pump beam through the same fiber. Our approach is applicable to various small optical sources coupled to a single waveguide, and it will lay the foundation for applications in high-density optical integrated circuits, biosensing, and quantum network technologies.

TI Joule spectroscopy of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanodevices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices offer highly tunable platforms, potentially suitable for quantum technology applications, that have been intensively studied in the past decade. Here we establish that measurements of the superconductor-to-normal transition originating from Joule heating provide a powerful spectroscopical tool to characterize such hybrid devices. Concretely, we apply this technique to junctions in full-shell Al-InAs nanowires in the Little-Parks regime and obtain detailed information of each lead independently and in a single measurement, including differences in the superconducting coherence lengths of the leads, inhomogeneous covering of the epitaxial shell, and the inverse superconducting proximity effect; all-in-all constituting a unique fingerprint of each device with applications in the interpretation of low-bias data, the optimization of device geometries, and the uncovering of disorder in these systems. Besides the practical uses, our work also underscores the importance of heating in hybrid devices, an effect that is often overlooked.

TI Quantum Cloning of Steering
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum steering in a global state allows an observer to remotely steer a subsystem into different ensembles by performing different local measurements on the other part. We show that, in general, this property cannot be perfectly cloned by any joint operation between a steered subsystem and a third system. Perfect cloning is viable if and only if the initial state is of zero discord. We also investigate the process of cloning the steered qubit of a Bell state using a universal cloning machine. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, which is a type of quantum correlation existing in the states without a local-hidden-state model, is observed in the two copy subsystems. This contradicts the conclusion of no-cloning of quantum steering (EPR steering) [C. Y. Chiu et al., npj Quantum Inf. 2, 16020 (2016)] based on a mutual information criterion for EPR steering.

TI Continuously monitored quantum systems beyond Lindblad dynamics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The dynamics of a quantum system, undergoing unitary evolution and continuous monitoring, can be described in term of quantum trajectories. Although the averaged state fully characterizes expectation values, the entire ensemble of stochastic trajectories goes beyond simple linear observables, keeping a more attentive description of the entire dynamics. Here we go beyond the Lindblad dynamics and study the probability distribution of the expectation value of a given observable over the possible quantum trajectories. The measurements are applied to the entire system, having the effect of projecting the system into a product state. We develop an analytical tool to evaluate this probability distribution at any time t. We illustrate our approach by analyzing two paradigmatic examples: a single qubit subjected to magnetization measurements, and a free hopping particle subjected to position measurements.

TI Two-exciton bound state quantum self-trapping in an extended star graph
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB An attractive Bose-Hubbard model is applied for describing quantum self-trapping in an extended star graph. In the strong coupling limit and when two excitons are created on the core of the star, the dynamics is dominated by pair states whose properties are governed by the branch number N. When N = 2, the star reduces to a linear chain so that the energy does not self-localize. Conversely, when N >= 3, restructuring of the eigenstates arises and a low-energy state occurs describing a pair localized on the core of the star. Preferentially excited, this localized state gives rise to quantum self-trapping of the energy, a process that intensifies as N increases. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Fundamental limit on angular measurements and rotations from quantum
   mechanics and general relativity
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We show that the precision of an angular measurement or rotation (e.g., on the orientation of a qubit or spin state) is limited by fundamental constraints arising from quantum mechanics and general relativity (gravitational collapse). The limiting precision is r(-1) in Planck units, where r is the physical extent of the (possibly macroscopic) device used to manipulate the spin state. This fundamental limitation means that spin states S-1 and S-2 cannot be experimentally distinguished from each other if they differ by a sufficiently small rotation. Experiments cannot exclude the possibility that the space of quantum state vectors (i.e., Hilbert space) is fundamentally discrete, rather than continuous. We discuss the implications for finitism: does physics require infinity or a continuum? (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Classical communication with indefinite causal order for N completely
   depolarizing channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB If two identical copies of a completely depolarizing channel are put into a superposition of their possible causal orders, they can transmit nonzero classical information. Here we study how well we can transmit classical information with N depolarizing channels put in superposition of M causal orders via a quantum SWITCH. We calculate the Holevo quantity if the superposition uses only cyclic permutations of channels and find that it increases with M and it is independent of N. For a qubit it never reaches 1 if we are increasing M. On the other hand, the classical capacity decreases with the dimension d of the message system. Further, for N = 3 and 4 we studied the superposition of all causal orders and uniformly superposed causal orders belonging to different cosets created by a cyclic permutation subgroup.

TI Localization in Quantum Walks with a Single Lattice Defect: A
   Comparative Study
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study how a single lattice defect in a discrete time quantum walk affects the return probability of a quantum particle. This defect at the starting position is modeled by a quantum coin that is distinct from the others over the lattice. This coin has a dependence on omega which quantifies the intensity of the localization. For some sorts of lattice defects, we show how the localization can have a dependence just on omega, and also, the polar alpha and azimuth beta angles of the initial qubit by numerical calculations. We propose a lattice defect whose localization has additional dependence on beta + omega, leading to extra localization profiles. We compare the quantum walks with our lattice defect to the earlier ones, and we discuss their spreading and survival probability.

TI Quantum time and the time-dilation induced interaction transfer
   mechanism
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Given a bipartite quantum system in an energy eigenstate, the dynamical description for one component can be derived via entanglement using the other component as a clock. This is the essence of the Page and Wootters mechanism. Moreover, if the clock is subject to a gravitational-like interaction, relative time evolution is then described by a time-dilated Schr & ouml;dinger equation, in which the so-called redshift operator describes a purely quantum effect, analog to gravitational time-dilation. Here we adopt a nonperturbative approach and present a finite-dimensional generalization of this mechanism, expressing the quantum timedilation effect as an effective interaction involving previously noninteracting system components. We name this a time-dilation induced interaction transfer (TiDIT) mechanism and discuss an example using two coupled spins as a quantum clock model. Our approach is suitable for implementations in current quantum technology and provides a new tool for exploring gravity at the intersection with quantum physics.

TI Steady-state quantum thermodynamics with synthetic negative temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A bath with a negative temperature is a subject of intense debate in recent times. It raises fundamental questions not only on our understanding of negative temperature of a bath in connection with thermodynamics but also on the possibilities of constructing devices using such baths. In this work, we study steady-state quantum thermodynamics involving baths with negative temperatures. A bath with a negative temperature is created synthetically using two baths of positive temperatures and weakly coupling these with a qutrit system. These baths are then coupled to each other via a working system. At steady state, the laws of thermodynamics are analyzed. We find that whenever the temperatures of these synthetic baths are identical, there is no heat flow, which reaffirms the zeroth law. There is always a spontaneous heat flow for different temperatures. In particular, heat flows from a bath with a negative temperature to a bath with a positive temperature which, in turn, implies that a bath with a negative temperature is "hotter" than a bath with a positive temperature. This warrants an amendment in the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law, as suggested in earlier studies. In all these processes, the overall entropy production is positive, as required by the Clausius statement of the second law. We construct continuous heat engines operating between positive and negative temperature baths. These engines yield maximum possible heat-to-work conversion efficiency, that is, unity. We also study the thermodynamic nature of heat from a bath with a negative temperature and find that it is thermodynamic work but with negative entropy.

TI Polytypic quantum wells in Si and Ge: impact of 2D hexagonal inclusions
   on electronic band structure
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Crystal defects, traditionally viewed as detrimental, are now being explored for quantum technology applications. This study focuses on stacking faults in silicon and germanium, forming hexagonal inclusions within the cubic crystal and creating quantum wells that modify electronic properties. By modeling defective structures with varying hexagonal layer counts, we calculated the formation energies and electronic band structures. Our results show that hexagonal inclusions in Si and Ge exhibit a direct band gap, changing with inclusion thickness, effectively functioning as quantum wells. We find that Ge inclusions have a direct band gap and form type-I quantum wells. This research highlights the potential of manipulating extended defects to engineer the optoelectronic properties of Si and Ge, offering new pathways for advanced electronic and photonic device applications.
   This study reveals the impact of 2D hexagonal inclusions on Si and Ge, prompting their exploitation as light sources in Si photonics.

TI Enhancing the information of nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum systems
   interacting with a two-level atom
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB The effect of nonlinearity, initial atomic state, and different resonance cases on the interaction between nonlinear SU (1, 1) quantum states and a two-level atom is discussed. The optimal behaviours of decoherence, entanglement and quantum coherence are predicted via using the skew information, tomographic entropy, and the relative entropy of coherence, respectively. It is shown that the detuning parameter has a destructive effect on the coherence and consequently on the entanglement if the quantum system is regulated in the ideal SU (1, 1) quantum systems. For the nonlinear SU (1, 1) quantum systems, the ability to suppress the decay of entanglement induced by the detuning may be increased by preparing the initial atomic state in its excited state.

TI Bulk private curves require large conditional mutual information
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We prove a theorem showing that the existence of "private" curves in the bulk of AdS implies two regions of the dual CFT share strong correlations. A private curve is a causal curve which avoids the entanglement wedge of a specified boundary region U. The implied correlation is measured by the conditional mutual information I(V-1 : V-2 vertical bar U), which is O(1/G(N)) when a private causal curve exists. The regions V-1 and V-2 are specified by the endpoints of the causal curve and the placement of the region U. This gives a causal perspective on the conditional mutual information in AdS/CFT, analogous to the causal perspective on the mutual information given by earlier work on the connected wedge theorem. We give an information theoretic argument for our theorem, along with a bulk geometric proof. In the geometric perspective, the theorem follows from the maximin formula and entanglement wedge nesting. In the information theoretic approach, the theorem follows from resource requirements for sending private messages over a public quantum channel.

AB We experimentally demonstrate frequency non-degenerate photon-pair generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing from a novel CS2-filled microstructured optical fiber. CS2 has high nonlinearity, narrow Raman lines, a broad transmission spectrum, and also has a large index contrast with the microstructured silica fiber. We can achieve phase matching over a large spectral range by tuning the pump wavelength, allowing the generation of idler photons in the infrared region, which is suitable for applications in quantum spectroscopy. Moreover, we demonstrate a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of larger than 90 and a pair generation efficiency of about 10-2 per pump pulse, which shows the viability of this fiber-based platform as a photon-pair source for quantum technology applications.

TI A Post-Quantum Fuzzy Commitment Scheme for Biometric Template
   Protection: An Experimental Study
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The proliferation and extensive acceptance of biometrics in many sectors is due to its merits over traditional password-based authentication. Several biometric template protection schemes have been proposed during the last decade to address the security and privacy issues related to biometrics. While error-correcting coding is required in the design of these schemes, it has been shown to degrade security and accuracy performance. In this study, a new post-quantum fuzzy commitment scheme (PQFC) for biometric template protection is designed, which is proved to be secure based on the Short Vector Problem (SVP) of the lattice. The present work provides the first systematic construction of biometric template protection that does not rely on error-correcting codes. To that purpose, a novel biometric-based PQFC authentication system based on a smartcard is created, with the biometric template protected by PQFC. Furthermore, biometric matching is done indirectly. The biometric-based PQFC authentication system is examined using an iris database of 108 individuals. According to the experimental data, the accuracy of iris recognition with PQFC is 99.1 percent, which is higher than the accuracy without PQFC, which is 97.4 percent. A False Accepting Rate (FAR) of 0% is achieved, while the False Rejection Rate (FRR) is 2.9%. The FRR can be adjusted by employing the best standard iris recognition algorithm. The execution time for the essential operations of PQFC and the storage requirements are estimated. Furthermore, the security of the proposed authentication system is analyzed, showing that the renewability, unlinkability, and irreversibility of the ISO/IEC 24745 standard are fulfilled without downgrading the accuracy. The overall performance of this work demonstrated that the PQFC is a promising technique for biometric template protection that is also suitable for the Internet of Things and cloud computing applications.

TI α-z-Renyi Divergences in von Neumann Algebras: Data Processing
   Inequality, Reversibility, and Monotonicity Properties in α, z
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We study the alpha-z-Renyi divergences D-alpha,D-z (psi & Vert;phi) where alpha, z > 0 (alpha not equal 1) for normal positive functionals psi, phi on general von Neumann algebras, introduced in Kato and Ueda (arXiv:2307.01790) and Kato (arXiv:2311.01748). We prove the variational expressions and the data processing inequality (DPI) for the alpha-z-Renyi divergences. We establish the sufficiency theorem for D-alpha,D-z(psi & Vert;phi), saying that for (alpha, z) inside the DPI bounds, the equality D-alpha,D-z(psi degrees gamma & Vert;phi degrees gamma) = D-alpha,D-z(psi & Vert;phi) < infinity in the DPI under a quantum channel (or a normal 2-positive unital map) gamma implies the reversibility of gamma with respect to psi, phi. Moreover, we show the monotonicity properties of D-alpha,D-z(psi & Vert;phi) in the parameters alpha, z and their limits to the normalized relative entropy as alpha NE arrow 1 and alpha SE arrow 1.

TI Experimental realization and synchronization of a quantum van der Pol
   oscillator
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Classical self-sustained oscillators, which generate periodic motion without periodic external forcing, are ubiquitous in science and technology. The realization of nonclassical self-oscillators is an important goal of quantum physics. We here present the experimental implementation of a quantum van der Pol oscillator, a paradigmatic autonomous quantum driven-dissipative system with nonlinear damping, using a single trapped atom. We demonstrate the existence of a quantum limit cycle in phase space in the absence of a drive and the occurrence of quantum synchronization when the nonlinear oscillator is externally driven. We additionally show that synchronization can be enhanced with the help of squeezing perpendicular to the direction of the drive and, counterintuitively, linear dissipation. We also observe the bifurcation to a bistable phase-space distribution for large squeezing. Our results pave the way for the exploration of self-sustained quantum oscillators and their application to quantum technology.

TI Improving Quantum Search on Simple Graphs by Pretty Good
   Structured Oracles
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum search algorithms provide a way to speed up combinatorial search, and have found several applications in modern quantum technology. In particular, spatial search on graphs, based on continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), represents a promising platform for the implementation of quantum search in condensed matter systems. CTQW-based algorithms, however, work exactly on complete graphs, while they are known to perform poorly on realistic graphs with low connectivity. In this paper, we put forward an alternative search algorithm, based on structuring the oracle operator, which allows one to improve the localization properties of the walker by tuning only the on-site energies of the graph, i.e., without altering its topology. As such, the proposed algorithm is suitable for implementation in systems with low connectivity, e.g., rings of quantum dots or superconducting circuits. Oracle parameters are determined by Hamiltonian constraints, without the need for numerical optimization.

TI Quantum Subroutine for Efficient Matrix Multiplication
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose an efficient quantum subroutine for matrix multiplication that computes a state vector encoding the entries of the product of two matrices in superposition. The subroutine exploits efficient state preparation techniques and shows a potential speed-up with respect to classical methods. The most important benefit of our subroutine is that it encodes the entries of the matrix product directly in the state vector, which can be used for further computations within the same quantum circuit. All scenarios involving the computation of non-homomorphic functions of the product of two matrices can benefit from our technique. As a possible application, we discuss the computation of the variance of the entries of a matrix product, which can be a useful tool for some machine learning algorithms.

TI Data-enhanced variational Monte Carlo simulations for Rydberg atom
   arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rydberg atom arrays are programmable quantum simulators capable of preparing interacting qubit systems in a variety of quantum states. Due to long experimental preparation times, obtaining projective measurement data can be relatively slow for large arrays, which poses a challenge for state reconstruction methods such as tomography. Today, novel ground-state wave-function Ansc tze like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be efficiently trained not only from projective measurement data, but also through Hamiltonian-guided variational Monte Carlo (VMC). In this paper, we demonstrate how pretraining modern RNNs on even small amounts of data significantly reduces the convergence time for a subsequent variational optimization of the wave function. This suggests that essentially any amount of measurements obtained from a state prepared in an experimental quantum simulator could provide significant values for neural-network-based VMC strategies.

TI Amplification mechanism with interacting atomic gases
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The use of atoms, molecules, and free electrons in quantum amplifiers has greatly advanced precision measurements, paving the way for the development of extremely-low-noise quantum devices such as masers and lasers. Here, we investigate the signal amplification of interacting spins and observe the amplification of magnetic fields using mixtures of interacting alkali-metal and noble gases. In contrast to noninteracting systems used as amplifiers, we demonstrate that interactions resulting from random atomic collisions give rise to two distinct amplification phenomena. These phenomena provide essential resources for enhancing quantum sensing capabilities. Our results show that magnetic fields can be amplified by at least two orders of magnitude, enhancing magnetic sensitivity to the femtotesla per root hertz level. Additionally, we report a counterpart phenomenon, deamplification, where the magnetic noise response is suppressed by at least one order of magnitude within certain frequency regimes. In this work alkali-metal and noble-gas spins are weakly coupled. We further explore how the performance of amplification changes with the interaction strength as the two spin gases gradually enter the strong-coupling regime, unveiling hitherto unexplored amplification effects that hold promise for enhancing precision measurements.

TI DNA Logic-Integrated Quantum Nanosensor for MicroRNA Diagnostics
SO JACS AU
AB Nanodiamonds (NDs) with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are emerging as powerful quantum nanosensors (QNs) in biomedical applications due to their exceptional sensitivity. However, achieving optimal diagnostics performance necessitates both high sensitivity and selectivity; especially in practical biomedical settings, it remains challenging for QNs to provide quantitative analyses when multiple analytes are present. Here, we present a biosensing platform that integrates DNA logic gates (DLGs) with spin-based quantum sensing, termed DLG-QN for ultrasensitive and ultraselective diagnostics. Utilizing an AND DLG, both NDs and magnetic beads (MBs) are functionalized with hairpin DNA strands. In the presence of both miRNA-21 and miRNA-155-key biomarkers overexpressed in cancer-the hairpin DNAs undergo conformational changes that facilitate DNA-guided self-assembly of NDs and MBs, enriching the target signal. Resonant microwave modulation of ND fluorescence emission allows for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) detection by separating the signal from background fluorescence via spin-enhanced analysis. This platform demonstrated ultrasensitive and ultraselective detection of miRNA-21 and miRNA-155 with a limit of detection of 19.8 fM, highlighting its potential as a general biosensing strategy for precision diagnostics involving multiple biomarkers.

TI Quantum Multiple Hypothesis Testing Based on a Sequential Discarding
   Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We consider the quantum multiple hypothesis testing problem, focusing on the case of hypothesis represented by pure states. A sequential adaptive algorithm is derived and analyzed first. This strategy exhibits a decay rate in the error probability with respect to the expected value of measurements greater than the optimal decay rate of the fixed-length methods. A more elaborated scheme is developed next, by serially concatenating multiple implementations of the first scheme. In this case each stage considers as a priori hypothesis probability the a posteriori probability of the previous stage. We show that, by means of a fixed number of concatenations, the expected value of measurements to be performed decreases considerably. We also analyze one strategy based on an asymptotically large concatenation of the initial scheme, demonstrating that the expected number of measurements in this case is upper bounded by a constant, even in the case of zero average error probability. A lower bound for the expected number of measurements in the zero error probability setting is also derived.

TI Homogeneous spin-dephasing time of NV- centre in
   millimetre-scale 12C-enriched high-pressure high-temperature
   diamond crystals
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centres in diamond crystals are promising colour centres for high-sensitivity quantum sensors. A long dephasing time (T-2* > 10 mu s) is essential for achieving increased sensitivity and higher uniformity of T-2* in millimetre-scale diamond is strongly desired for femto-tesla weak magnetic field detection. High uniformity of T-2* for NV- centres is achieved herein. The median value of T-2*, <T-2*>, in the C-12-enriched high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) grown diamond with a nitrogen concentration of 1.3 +/- 0.4 ppm is 4.5 mu s. The variance of T-2* is only 10% over a millimetre-scale region (1.1 x 1.1 mm(2)) within the 0.4 mm thick {111} growth sector. <T-2*> is similar to 2/3 times the value limited by the dipole-dipole interaction from the electron-spin bath of nitrogen impurities, suggesting that the residual strain gradient in the HPHT diamond crystal partially limits T-2*. Reducing the strain gradient in diamond crystals provide a pathway to achievement of high sensitivity magnetometry using NV quantum sensing.

TI Optimal Floquet state engineering for large scale atom interferometers
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The effective control of atomic coherence with cold atoms has made atom interferometry an essential tool for quantum sensors and precision measurements. The performance of these interferometers is closely related to the operation of large wave packet separations. We present here a novel approach for atomic beam splitters based on the stroboscopic stabilization of quantum states in an accelerated optical lattice. The corresponding Floquet state is generated by optimal control protocols. In this way, we demonstrate an unprecedented Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) interferometer, with a momentum separation of 600 photon recoils (600 & hbar;k) between its two arms. Each LMT beam splitter is realized in a remarkably short time (2 ms) and is highly robust against the initial velocity dispersion of the wave packet and lattice depth fluctuations. Our study shows that Floquet engineering is a promising tool for exploring new frontiers in quantum physics at large scales, with applications in quantum sensing and testing fundamental physics.
   Large-scale atom interferometers enable precise measurements of fundamental constants and novel sensors. This study uses Floquet formalism to create an optimal transported state, resulting in an efficient large-momentum-transfer interferometer, advancing largescale interferometers.

TI Single-crystal diamond growth by hot-filament CVD: a recent advances for
   doping, growth rate and defect controls
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB Diamond single crystals have garnered significant attention due to their wide-ranging applications, encompassing not only semiconducting films but also potential quantum sensing materials. The hot-filament activated chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) technique has been extensively employed to produce polycrystalline diamond films, hard coatings, boron-doped diamond electrodes, and thermal management applications, primarily due to its notable advantages in scalability (>12 inches). However, the growth of single crystals presents certain challenges, such as wire contaminations originating from heated filament materials, which are particularly concerning for electronic applications. Furthermore, low-rate growth is unfavorable for industrial implementation. Nonetheless, recent discoveries have demonstrated that intentionally-doped metal impurities can enhance the crystallinity of diamonds, resulting in highly uniform Schottky barrier diodes with low leakage currents. Moreover, by elevating the filament temperature to 3000 degrees C, growth rates exceeding 10 mu m/h have been successfully achieved. This study provides a concise overview of the recent advancements in hot-filament CVD growth, focusing on growth, doping, metal incorporation effects, and device performance.

TI Quantifying Spin Defect Density in hBN via Raman and Photoluminescence
   Analysis
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Negatively charged boron vacancies (V-B(-)) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are emerging as promising solid-state spin qubits due to their optical accessibility, structural simplicity, and compatibility with photonic platforms. However, quantifying the density of such defects in thin hBN flakes has remained elusive, limiting progress in device integration and reproducibility. Here, an all-optical method is presented to quantify V(B )(-)defect density in hBN by correlating Raman and photoluminescence (PL) signatures with irradiation fluence. Two defect-induced Raman modes, D1 and D2, are identified and assigned them to vibrational modes of V(B )(-)using polarization-resolved Raman measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By adapting a numerical model originally developed for graphene, an empirical relationship linking Raman (D1, E- 2g) and PL intensities is established to absolute defect densities. This method is universally applicable across various irradiation types and uniquely suited for thin flakes, where conventional techniques fail. The approach enables accurate, direct, and non-destructive quantification of spin defect densities down to 10(15 )defects/cm(3), offering a powerful tool for optimizing and benchmarking hBN for quantum optical applications.

TI Suppressing Thermal Noise to Sub-Millikelvin Level in a Single-Spin
   Quantum System Using Realtime Frequency Tracking
SO MICROMACHINES
AB A single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a diamond can be used as a nanoscale sensor for magnetic field, electric field or nuclear spins. Due to its low photon detection efficiency, such sensing processes often take a long time, suffering from an electron spin resonance (ESR) frequency fluctuation induced by the time-varying thermal perturbations noise. Thus, suppressing the thermal noise is the fundamental way to enhance single-sensor performance, which is typically achieved by utilizing a thermal control protocol with a complicated and highly costly apparatus if a millikelvin-level stabilization is required. Here, we analyze the real-time thermal drift and utilize an active way to alternately track the single-spin ESR frequency drift in the experiment. Using this method, we achieve a temperature stabilization effect equivalent to sub-millikelvin (0.8 mK) level with no extra environmental thermal control, and the spin-state readout contrast is significantly improved in long-lasting experiments. This method holds broad applicability for NV-based single-spin experiments and harbors the potential for prospective expansion into diverse nanoscale quantum sensing domains.

TI Broadband microwave detection using electron spins in a hybrid

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensing has developed into a main branch of quantum science and technology. It aims at measuring physical quantities with high resolution, sensitivity, and dynamic range. Electron spins in diamond are powerful magnetic field sensors, but their sensitivity in the microwave regime is limited to a narrow band around their resonance frequency. Here, we realize broadband microwave detection using spins in diamond interfaced with a thin-film magnet. A pump field locally converts target microwave signals to the sensor-spin frequency via the non-linear spin-wave dynamics of the magnet. Two complementary conversion protocols enable sensing and high-fidelity spin control over a gigahertz bandwidth, allowing characterization of the spin-wave band at multiple gigahertz above the sensor-spin frequency. The pump-tunable, hybrid diamond-magnet sensor chip opens the way for spin-based gigahertz material characterizations at small magnetic bias fields.
   Electron spins in diamond allow magnetometry with high sensitivity, but the bandwidth in the microwave regime is limited to a narrow band around their resonance frequency. Here, the authors solve this problem by coupling the spins to a thin film of yttrium iron garnet, exploiting the non-linear spin-wave dynamics of the magnet.

TI A superresolution-enhanced spectrometer beyond the Cramer-Rao bound in
   phase sensitivity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Precision measurement has been an important research area in sensing and metrology. In classical physics, the Fisher information determines the maximum extractable information from statistically unknown signals, based on a joint probability density function of independently and identically distributed random variables. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) indicates the minimum error of the Fisher information, generally known as the shot-noise limit. On the other hand, coherence has pushed the resolution limit further overcoming the diffraction limit using many-wave interference strictly confined to the first-order intensity correlation. However, practical implementation is limited by the lithographic constraints in, e.g., optical gratings. Recently, a coherence technique of superresolution has been introduced to overcome the diffraction limit in phase sensitivity using higher-order intensity correlations of a phase-controlled output field from an interferometer. Here, the superresolution is adopted for precision metrology in an optical spectrometer, whose enhanced frequency resolution is linearly proportional to the intensity-product order, overcoming CRLB. Unlike quantum sensing using entangled photons, this technique is purely classical and offers robust performance against environmental noises, benefiting from the interferometer's scanning mode for fringe counting.

TI Amplitude and phase noise in two-membrane cavity optomechanics
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Cavity optomechanics is a suitable field to explore quantum effects on macroscopic objects and develop quantum technology applications. A perfect control of the laser noise is required to operate the system in such extreme conditions necessary to reach the quantum regime. In this paper, we consider a Fabry-Perot cavity, driven by two laser fields, with two partially reflective SiN membranes inside it. We describe the effects of amplitude and phase noise on the laser introducing two additional noise terms in the Langevin equations of the system's dynamics. Experimentally, we add an artificial source of noise on the laser. We calibrate the intensity of the noise, inject it into the system, and check the validity of the theoretical model. This procedure provides an accurate description of the effects of a noisy laser in the optomechanical setup and allows for quantifying the amount of noise.

TI Observation of magnetic amplification using dark spins
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum amplification enables the enhancement of weak signals and is of great importance for precision measurements, such as biomedical science and tests of fundamental symmetries. Here, we observe a previously unexplored magnetic amplification using dark noble -gas nuclear spins in the absence of pump light. Such dark spins exhibit remarkable coherence lasting up to 6 min and the resilience against the perturbations caused by overlapping alkali -metal gas. We demonstrate that the observed phenomenon, referred to as "dark spin amplification," significantly magnifies magnetic field signals by at least three orders of magnitude. As an immediate application, we showcase an ultrasensitive magnetometer capable of measuring subfemtotesla fields in a single 500-s measurement. Our approach is generic and can be applied to a wide range of noble -gas isotopes, and we discuss promising optimizations that could further improve the current signal amplification up to 10 4 with 21 Ne, 10 5 with 129 Xe, and 10 6 with 3 He. This work unlocks opportunities in precision measurements, including searches for ultralight dark matter with sensitivity well beyond the supernova -observation constraints.

TI Reduced photothermal heating in diamonds enriched with H3 point defects
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Solid-state laser refrigeration of semiconductors remains an outstanding experimental challenge. In this work, we show that, following excitation with a laser wavelength of 532 nm, bulk diamond crystals doped with H3 centers both emit efficient up-conversion (anti-Stokes) photoluminescence and also show significantly reduced photothermal heating relative to crystals doped with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. The H3 center in diamond is a highly photostable defect that avoids bleaching at high laser irradiances of 10-70 MW/cm(2) and has been shown to exhibit laser action, tunable over the visible band of 500-600 nm. The observed reduction of photothermal heating arises due to a decrease in the concentration of absorbing point defects, including NV-centers. These results encourage future exploration of techniques for H3 enrichment in diamonds under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions for the simultaneous anti-Stokes fluorescence cooling and radiation balanced lasing in semiconductor materials. Reducing photothermal heating in diamond through the formation of H3 centers also opens up new possibilities in quantum sensing via optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy at ambient conditions.

TI Quantum non-Gaussian coherences of an oscillating atom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum coherence between energy eigenstates of harmonic oscillators is essential for quantum physics. Even the most elementary binary superpositions of the ground and the higher eigenstate are highly required for quantum sensing, thermodynamics, and computing. We derive upper bounds for quantum coherences achieved by classical and Gaussian states and operations and, subsequently, obtain a hierarchy of the thresholds for the off-diagonal elements necessary to reach genuine quantum non-Gaussian coherences. The presented analysis demonstrates that certification based solely on estimation of coherences can cover the quantum non-Gaussian states, which are undetectable by the criteria based solely on the estimation of the corresponding state populations. We experimentally demonstrate the unambiguous observation of quantum non-Gaussian coherences in mechanical vibrations of a single calcium ion up to the superposition of zero and six phonons. The analysis of the robustness with respect to pure dephasing in a motional Ramsey experiment demonstrates the feasibility of their storage for up to more than 20 ms for superpositions with a large energy difference of participating number states. The presented observations prove that atomic oscillations go deeply into a diverse area of discrete quantum non-Gaussian coherent phenomena critical for their applications.

TI Measuring kinetic parameters using quantum plasmonic sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The measurement of parameters that describe kinetic processes is important in the study of molecular interactions. It enables a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying how different biological entities interact with each other, such as viruses with cells, vaccines with antibodies, or new drugs with specific diseases. In this work, we study theoretically the use of quantum sensing techniques for measuring the kinetic parameters of molecular interactions. The sensor we consider is a plasmonic resonance sensor-a label-free photonic sensor that is one of the most widely used in research and industry. The first type of interaction we study is the antigen BSA interacting with antibody IgG1, which provides a large sensor response. The second type is the enzyme carbonic anhydrase interacting with the tumor growth inhibitor benzenesulfonamide, which produces a small sensor response. For both types of interaction we consider the use of two-mode Fock states, squeezed vacuum states, and squeezed displaced states. We find that these quantum states offer an enhancement in the measurement precision of kinetic parameters when compared to that obtained with classical light. The results may help in the design of more precise quantum-based sensors for studying kinetics in the life sciences.

TI Dissipative phase transitions in n-photon driven quantum
   nonlinear resonators
SO QUANTUM
AB We investigate and characterize the emergence of finite-component dissipative phase transitions (DPTs) in nonlinear photon resonators subject to n-photon driving and dissipation. Exploiting a semiclassical approach, we derive general results on the occurrence of second-order DPTs in this class of systems. We show that for all odd n, no second-order DPT can occur while, for even n, the competition between higher-order nonlinearities determines the nature of the criticality and allows for second-order DPTs to emerge only for n = 2 and n = 4. As pivotal examples, we study the full quantum dynamics of three-and four-photon driven-dissipative Kerr resonators, confirming the prediction of the semiclassical analysis on the nature of the transitions. The stability of the vacuum and the typical timescales needed to access the different phases are also discussed. We also show a first-order DPT where multiple solutions emerge around zero, low, and high-photon numbers. Our results highlight the crucial role played by strong and weak symmetries in triggering critical behaviors, providing a Liouvillian framework to study the effects of high-order nonlinear processes in driven-dissipative systems, that can be applied to problems in quantum sensing and information processing.

TI Characterisation of CVD diamond with high concentrations of nitrogen for
   magnetic-field sensing applications
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are a leading platform for practical quantum sensors. Reproducible and scalable fabrication of NV-ensembles with desired properties is crucial, as is an understanding of how those properties influence performance. This work addresses these issues by characterising nitrogen-doped diamond produced by the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method across a range of synthesis conditions. This is shown to produce material with widely differing absorption characteristics, which is linked to the level of defects other than substitutional nitrogen (NS) and NV. In such material, the achievable concentration of NV- ([NV-]) is found to be influenced by the as-grown properties. At the 10-20 ppm level for [NS], the production of CVD-grown material with strain levels sufficient not to limit achievable device sensitivity is demonstrated and a favourable product of [NV-] and T2* is obtained. Additionally, reproducible properties over a batch of 23 samples from a single synthesis run are achieved, which appears promising for the scalability efforts underway in this area of research.

TI Confinement Driven Spin-Texture Evolution in Directly Written
   Nanomagnets
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB In low-dimensional magnetic structures, magnetostatic energy minimization yields a uniform spin-texture, resembling that of a macroscopic bar magnet, thereby limiting their scope for applications. Here, the formation of non-collinear spin-textures such as N & eacute;el-type domain walls with perpendicular core magnetization, stable under ambient conditions, in magnetic nanostructures with dimensions reduced to approximate to 25 nm, is experimentally demonstrated. A single-step magnetic writing process is deployed, wherein a nano-focused beam of penetrating ions displaces atoms locally and converts a short-range ordered precursor alloy that is paramagnetic to a strain-relaxed lattice that is ferromagnetic, thus manifesting a controllable spin-texture evolution. Simulations show that the spin-textures rely on the presence of symmetry breaking due to crystallographic misalignments within the confined geometries. Theoretical considerations yield the critical dimension below which perpendicular N & eacute;el walls are stabilized. These results provide a direct route to implementing spatially confined non-collinear spin-textures generating local perpendicular magnetic fields, that are necessary in applications such as spin-transport and spin-based quantum sensing.

TI Dicke Superradiance Requires Interactions beyond Nearest Neighbors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Photon-mediated interactions within an excited ensemble of emitters can result in Dicke superradiance, where the emission rate is greatly enhanced, manifesting as a high-intensity burst at short times. The superradiant burst is most commonly observed in systems with long-range interactions between the emitters, although the minimal interaction range remains unknown. Here, we put forward a new theoretical method to bound the maximum emission rate by upper bounding the spectral radius of an auxiliary Hamiltonian. We harness this tool to prove that for an arbitrary ordered array with only nearest-neighbor interactions in all dimensions, a superradiant burst is not physically observable. We show that Dicke superradiance requires minimally the inclusion of next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For exponentially decaying interactions, the critical coupling is found to be asymptotically independent of the number of emitters in all dimensions, thereby defining the threshold interaction range where the collective enhancement balances out the decoherence effects. Our findings provide key physical insights to the understanding of collective decay in many-body quantum systems, and the designing of superradiant emission in physical systems for applications such as energy harvesting and quantum sensing.

TI Thermal resonance-enhanced transparency in room-temperature Rydberg
   gases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We report the enhanced optical transmission in the coherent, off-resonant excitation of Rydberg atom gases at room temperature via a two-photon process. Here thermal resonance-enhanced transparency (TRET) is induced when the detuning of the two lasers is adjusted to compensate the atomic thermal-motion-induced energy shifts, i.e., single- and two-photon Doppler shifts. We show that the atomic velocity is mapped into the transmission of the probe fields, which can be altered by independently and selectively exciting different velocity groups through sweeping the detuning. The maximal transmission in TRET is about 8 times higher than that under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Utilizing the TRET effect, we enhance the sensitivity of a Rydberg microwave receiver to be 28.7 nV cm-1 Hz-1/2, ultimately reaching a factor of 2.1 of the EIT case. When atoms of separate velocity groups are excited simultaneously by multiple laser sets of different detuning, the receiver sensitivity increases with the number of laser sets. Our study paves the way to exploit light-matter interaction via the TRET, and contributes to current efforts in developing quantum sensing, primary gas thermometry, and wireless communication with room-temperature atomic gases.

TI An All-Dielectric Metasurface Polarimeter
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The polarization state of light is a key parameter in many imaging systems. For example, it can image mechanical stress and other physical properties that are not seen with conventional imaging and can also play a central role in quantum sensing. However, polarization is more difficult to image, and polarimetry typically involves several independent measurements with moving parts in the measurement device. Metasurfaces with interleaved designs have demonstrated sensitivity to either linear or circular/ elliptical polarization states. Here, we present an all-dielectric metapolarimeter for direct measurement of any arbitrary polarization state from a single-unit-cell design. By engineering a completely asymmetric design, we obtained a metasurface that can excite eigenmodes of the nanoresonators, thus displaying a unique diffraction pattern for not only any linear polarization state but all elliptical polarization states (and handedness) as well. The unique diffraction patterns are quantified into Stokes parameters with a resolution of 5?? and with a polarization state fidelity of up to 99 ?? 1%. This holds promise for applications in polarization imaging and quantum state tomography.

TI Preferential Placement of Aligned Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Chemical
   Vapor Deposition Overgrown Diamond Microstructures
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The usefulness of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is augmented by a low defect and impurity density in the surrounding host material, and applications benefit from the ability to control the position of the NV centers. Herein, a process to create NV centers on single-crystalline diamond microstructures by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is presented. Pyramidal structures with {111} side facets are formed during the intrinsic overgrowth of dry chemically etched cylindrical pillars on a substrate with {100} surface orientation. A thin nitrogen-doped epitaxial layer is deposited on top of the pyramids resulting in the creation of NV centers exclusively on the {111} pyramid side faces. Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and spin echo measurements reveal preferential alignment of the NV centers in a single {111} direction and a T 2 time of 55 mu s . The T 2 time of the NV centers is limited by the surrounding substitutional nitrogen (P1 center) concentration of [P 1 ] = 5 ppm . A low density of other paramagnetic spin noise is detected by double-electron electron resonance (DEER) measurements.

TI Interferometry in an Atomic Fountain with Ytterbium Bose-Einstein
   Condensates
SO ATOMS
AB We present enabling experimental tools and atom interferometer implementations in a vertical "fountain" geometry with ytterbium Bose-Einstein condensates. To meet the unique challenge of the heavy, non-magnetic atom, we apply a shaped optical potential to balance against gravity following evaporative cooling and demonstrate a double Mach-Zehnder interferometer suitable for applications such as gravity gradient measurements. Furthermore, we also investigate the use of a pulsed optical potential to act as a matter wave lens in the vertical direction during expansion of the Bose-Einstein condensate. This method is shown to be even more effective than the aforementioned shaped optical potential. The application of this method results in a reduction of velocity spread (or equivalently an increase in source brightness) of more than a factor of five, which we demonstrate using a two-pulse momentum-space Ramsey interferometer. The vertical geometry implementation of our diffraction beams ensures that the atomic center of mass maintains overlap with the pulsed atom optical elements, thus allowing extension of atom interferometer times beyond what is possible in a horizontal geometry. Our results thus provide useful tools for enhancing the precision of atom interferometry with ultracold ytterbium atoms.

TI Microcontroller-Optimized Measurement Electronics for Coherent Control
   Applications of NV Centers
SO SENSORS
AB Long coherence times at room temperature make the NV center a promising candidate for quantum sensors and quantum computers. The necessary coherent control of the electron spin triplet in the ground state requires microwave pi pulses in the nanosecond range, obtained from the Rabi oscillation of the mS spin states of the magnetic resonances of the NV centers. Laboratory equipment has a high temporal resolution for these measurements but is expensive and, therefore, uninteresting for fields such as education. In this work, we present measurement electronics for NV centers that are optimized for microcontrollers. It is shown that the Rabi frequency is linear to the output of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and is used to adapt the time length pi of the electron spin flip, to the limited pulse width resolution of the microcontroller. This was achieved by breaking down the most relevant functions of conventional laboratory devices and replacing them with commercially available integrated components. The result is a cost-effective handheld setup for coherent control applications of NV centers.

TI Optically Pumped Magnetometer Measuring Fatigue-Induced Damage in Steel
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application Piezomagnetic fatigue testing of ferromagnetic specimens with highly sensitive optically pumped magnetometers as a method for early damage formation detection. Uniaxial fatigue testing of micro-mechanical metallic specimens can provide valuable insight into damage formation. Magnetic and piezomagnetic testing are commonly used for qualitative characterization of damage in ferromagnetic specimens. Sensitive and accurate measurements with magnetic sensors is a key part of such a characterization. This work presents an experimental setup to induce structural defects in a micro-mechanical fatigue test. Simultaneously, the resulting piezomagnetic signals are measured during the complete lifetime of the tested specimen. The key component is a highly sensitive optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) used to measure the piezomagnetic hysteresis of a small specimen whose structural defects can be analyzed on a small scale by other metallographic characterization methods as well. This setup aims to quantify the magnetic signatures of damage during the fatigue process, which could enable non-destructive mechanical testing of materials. This paper reports the initial results obtained from this novel micro-magneto-mechanical test setup for a ferritic steel specimen.

TI Imaging of OAM-entangled photon pairs in the Bessel-Gauss basis with
   full index control
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB In this paper, we directly image the orbital angular momentum (OAM) correlations, expressed in the Bessel-Gauss (BG) basis, present in quantum-entangled photon pairs produced by the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). We use a spatial light modulator that displays an appropriate phase mask, followed by coupling into a single-mode fiber, so as to project the signal, or heralding, photon onto a BG mode, and verify that the idler, or heralded, photon is projected non-locally as expected. In contrast with similar experiments relying on Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes, our current experiment permits, firstly, full index control (allowing the experimenter to define both the azimuthal index l(s) and the continuous radial index krs, also referred to as scaling parameter). Importantly, while not resolving the radial index leaves the heralded single photon in a statistical mixture of all available radial modes, the ability to determine both indices allows us to herald single photons in a particular BG mode, described by a quantum-mechanically pure state. Our use of BG modes permits, secondly, the spatially-resolved detection of the heralded single photon, both in the near and far fields, with a time-gated intensified CCD camera, making it possible to experimentally determine both the radial and azimuthal indices of the heralded single photon. Thirdly, the fact that for BG modes the radial index (scaling parameter) is continuous makes it possible to use the scaling parameter as a continuous adjustment in quantum state engineering, for precise mode matching, or for the selection of photon-pair properties such as the spiral bandwidth, as we experimentally demonstrate. We believe that our work opens up interesting new possibilities in the field of quantum communications based on the spatial degree of freedom of photon pairs.

TI Analyte-dependent Rabi splitting in solid-state plexcitonic sensors
   based on plasmonic nanoislands strongly coupled to J-aggregates
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A key challenge in the field of plexcitonic quantum devices is the fabrication of solid-state, device-friendly plexcitonic nanostructures using inexpensive and scalable techniques. Lithography-free, bottom-up nanofabrication methods have remained relatively unexplored within the context of plexcitonic coupling. In this work, a plexcitonic system consisting of thermally dewetted plasmonic gold nanoislands (AuNI) coated with a thin film of J-aggregates was investigated. Control over nanoisland size and morphology allowed for a range of plasmon resonances with variable detuning from the exciton. The extinction spectra of the hybrid AuNI/J-aggregate films display clear splitting into upper and lower hybrid resonances, while the dispersion curve shows anti-crossing behavior with an estimated Rabi splitting of 180 eV at zero detuning. As a proof of concept for quantum sensing, the AuNI/J-aggregate hybrid was demonstrated to behave as a plexcitonic sensor for hydrochloric acid vapor analyte. This work highlights the possibility of using thermally dewetted nanoparticles as a platform for high-quality, tunable, cost-effective, and scalable plexcitonic nanostructures for sensing devices and beyond.

TI Influence of (N,H)-terminated surfaces on stability, hyperfine
   structure, and zero-field splitting of NV centers in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a density functional theory analysis of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) defect complex in diamond located in the vicinity of (111)- or (100)-oriented surfaces with mixed (N,H)-terminations. We assess the stability and electronic properties of the NV- center, and we study their dependence on the H:N ratio of the surface termination. The formation energy, the electronic density of states, the hyperfine structure, and the zero-field-splitting parameters of an NV- center are analyzed as a function of its distance and orientation to the surface. We find stable NV- centers with bulklike properties at distances of at least similar to 8 angstrom from the surface provided that the surface termination consists of at least 25% substitutional nitrogen atoms. The studied surface terminations have a minor effect on the ground-state properties, whereas the NV orientation has major effects. Our results indicate that axial NV centers near a flat 100% N-terminated (111) surface are the optimal choice for NV-based quantum sensing applications as they are the least influenced by the proximity of the surface.

TI Retrieving Nonlinear Features from Noisy Quantum States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Accurately estimating high -order moments of quantum states is an elementary precondition for many crucial tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, entropy estimation, spectrum estimation, and predicting nonlinear features from quantum states. But in reality, inevitable quantum noise prevents us from accessing the desired value. In this paper, we address this issue by systematically analyzing the feasibility and efficiency of extracting high -order moments from noisy states. We first show that there exists a quantum protocol capable of accomplishing this task if and only if the underlying noise channel is invertible. We then establish a method for deriving protocols that attain optimal sample complexity using quantum operations and classical postprocessing only. Our protocols, in contrast to conventional ones, incur lower overheads and avoid sampling different quantum operations due to a novel technique called the "'observable shift method," making the protocols strong candidates for practical use on current quantum devices. The proposed method also indicates the power of entangled protocols in retrieving highorder information, whereas in the existing methods, entanglement does not help. We further construct the protocol for large quantum systems to retrieve the depolarizing channels, making the proposed method scalable. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of how quantum noise could affect high -order information extraction and provides guidance on how to tackle it.

AB Spatial mode division de-multiplexing of optical signals has many real-world applications, such as quantum computing and both classical and quantum optical communication. In this context, it is crucial to develop devices able to efficiently sort optical signals according to the optical mode they belong to and route them on different paths. Depending on the mode selected, this problem can be very hard to tackle. Recently, researchers have proposed using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) -and NSGA-II in particular- combined with Linkage Learning (LL) to automate the process of design mode sorter. However, given the very large-search scale of the problem, the existing evolutionary-based solutions have a very slow convergence rate. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for mode sorter design that combines (1) stochastic linkage learning, (2) the adaptive geometry estimation-based MOEA (AGE-MOEA-II), and (3) an adaptive mutation operator. Our experiments with two- and three-objectives (beams) show that our approach is faster (better convergence rate) and produces better mode sorters (closer to the ideal solutions) than the state-of-the-art approach. A direct comparison with the vanilla NSGA-II and AGE-MOEA-II also further confirms the importance of adopting LL in this domain.

TI An extendable key space integer image-cipher using 4-bit piece-wise
   linear cat map
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB This paper presents a multiplierless image-cipher, with extendable 2048-bit key-space, based on a 4-dimensional (4D) quantized piece-wise linear cat map (PWLCM). The quantized PWLCM exhibits limit-cycles of 4-bit encoded integers with periods greater than 10(7). The synthesis of the PWLCM in a finite state space allows to eliminate the undesirable finite precision effect due to the hardware realization. The proposed image-cipher combines chaos, modular arithmetic, and lattice-based cryptography to encrypt a color image by performing pixel permutation and diffusion in a single operation. Further, an image-dependent confusion operation based on an 8-bit 2D-PWLCM is performed on the whole image to enhance security. In order to increase the key-space without key duplication, 16 x 16 sub-images are modified using sub-keys of different lattice length vectors generated from the external key. Both simulations and security analyses confirm that the proposed algorithm can resist common cipher attacks, in addition to its advantages such as simplicity, ease of implementation on low-end processors and extensibility of key-space that allows it to easily adapt even for future post-quantum computing attacks.

TI Hyperbolic band theory through Higgs bundles
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS
AB Hyperbolic lattices underlie a new form of quantum matter with potential applications to quantum computing and simu-lation and which, to date, have been engineered artificially. A corresponding hyperbolic band theory has emerged, extend-ing 2-dimensional Euclidean band theory in a natural way to higher-genus configuration spaces. Attempts to develop the hyperbolic analogue of Bloch's theorem have revealed an in-trinsic role for algebro-geometric moduli spaces, notably those of stable bundles on a curve. We expand this picture to in-clude Higgs bundles, which enjoy natural interpretations in the context of band theory. First, their spectral data encodes a crystal lattice and momentum, providing a framework for symmetric hyperbolic crystals. Second, they act as a com-plex analogue of crystal momentum. As an application, we elicit a new perspective on Euclidean band theory. Finally, we speculate on potential interactions of hyperbolic band theory, facilitated by Higgs bundles, with other themes in mathemat-ics and physics.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Low-Frequency Communication Based on Rydberg-Atom Receiver
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Rydberg-atom receivers have developed rapidly with increasing sensitivity. However, studies on their application in low-frequency electric fields remain limited. In this work, we demonstrate low-frequency communication using an electrode-embedded atom cell and a whip antenna without the need for a low-noise amplifier (LNA). Three modulations-binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), on-off keying (OOK), and two-frequency shift keying (2FSK)-were employed for communication using a Rydberg-atom receiver operating near 100 kHz. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the modulated low-frequency signal received by Rydberg atoms was measured at various emission voltages. Additionally, we demonstrated the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) constellation diagram, error vector magnitude (EVM), and eye diagram of the demodulated signal at different symbol rates. The EVM values were measured to be 8.8% at a symbol rate of 2 kbps, 9.4% at 4 kbps, and 13.7% at 8 kbps. The high-fidelity digital color image transmission achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 70 dB. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a Rydberg-atom receiver for low-frequency communication applications.

AB Cryogenic refrigerators can be broadly classified as either continuous flow machines or oscillating flow machines. The acoustic expander is a new hybrid approach that combines the best aspects of these two machines. Globally, the working fluid moves continuously through the recuperative heat exchanger of the cycle while locally the working fluid oscillates in the acoustic expander. This concept has been demonstrated experimentally through the use of reed-valves coupled to an acoustic resonator. This work develops a high-fidelity numerical model that captures non-linear acoustic effects for the future design and optimization of these acoustic expanders. The numerical model solves the fully compressible Navier-stokes equations for various 2D and 3D resonator geometries including both harmonic quarter wave resonators and non-harmonic resonators. The reed valve behavior is simplified using pressure-dependent boundary conditions that can be tuned to represent a variety of reed characteristics. The coupled reed-resonator system spontaneously oscillates at its natural resonance frequency and the numerical model predicts the resonator quality factor and isentropic expansion efficiency. Finally, the numerical model predictions are validated by experimental data. The acoustic expander unlocks new cryogenic cooling paradigms with applications to superconducting magnets and electronics, infrared imaging, quantum sensing, and cryogenic propellant management.

TI Extractable information capacity in sequential measurements metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The conventional formulation of quantum sensing is based on the assumption that the probe is reset to its initial state after each measurement. In a very distinct approach, one can also pursue a sequential measurement scheme in which time-consuming resetting is avoided. In this situation, every measurement outcome effectively comes from a different probe, yet is correlated with other data samples. Finding a proper description for the precision of sequential measurement sensing is very challenging as it requires the analysis of long sequences with exponentially large outcomes. Here, we develop a recursive formula and an efficient Monte Carlo approach to calculate the Fisher information, as a figure of merit for sensing precision, for arbitrary lengths of sequential measurements. Our results show that the value of the Fisher information initially increases nonlinearly with the number of measurements and then asymptotically saturates to a linear scaling. This transition, which fundamentally constrains the extractable information about the parameter of interest, is directly linked to the finite memory of the probe when it undergoes multiple sequential measurements. Based on these findings, we establish a figure of merit to determine the optimal measurement sequence length and exemplify our results in three different physical systems.

TI High Cooperativity Using a Confocal-Cavity-QED Microscope
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) with cooperativity far greater than unity enables high-fidelity quantum sensing and information processing. The high-cooperativity regime is often reached through the use of short single-mode resonators. More complicated multimode resonators, such as the near-confocal optical Fabry-Perot cavity, can provide intracavity atomic imaging in addition to high cooperativity. This capability has recently proved important for exploring quantum many-body physics in the driven-dissipative setting. In this work, we show that a confocal-cavity-QED microscope can realize cooperativity in excess of 110. This cooperativity is on par with the very best single-mode cavities (which are far shorter) and 21 times greater than single-mode resonators of similar length and mirror radii. The 1.7-& mu;m imaging resolution is naturally identical to the photon-mediated interaction range. We measure these quantities by determining the threshold of cavity superradiance when small optically tweezed BoseEinstein condensates are pumped at various intracavity locations. Transmission measurements of an ex situ cavity corroborate these results. We provide a theoretical description that shows how cooperativity enhancement arises from the dispersive coupling to the atoms of many near-degenerate modes.

TI The bandgap-detuned excitation regime in photonic-crystal resonators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Control of nonlinear interactions in microresonators enhances access to classical and quantum field states across nearly limitless bandwidth. A recent innovation has been to leverage coherent scattering of the intraresonator pump field as a control of group-velocity dispersion and nonlinear frequency shifts, which are precursors for the dynamical evolution of new field states. Yet, since nonlinear-resonator phenomena are intrinsically multimode and exhibit complex modelocking, here we demonstrate a new approach to controlling nonlinear interactions with bandgap modes completely separate from the pump laser. We explore this bandgap-detuned excitation regime through generation of benchmark optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and soliton microcombs. Indeed, we show that mode-locked states are phase matched more effectively in the bandgap-detuned regime in which we directly control the modal Kerr shift with the bandgaps without perturbing the pump field. In particular, bandgap-detuned excitation enables an arbitrary, mode-by-mode control of the backscattering rate as a versatile tool for mode-locked state engineering. Our experiments leverage nanophotonic resonators for phase matching of OPOs and solitons, leading to control over threshold power, conversion efficiency, and emission direction that enable application advances in high-capacity signaling and computing, signal generation, and quantum sensing.

TI Optimal control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin ensemble in diamond for
   sensing in the pulsed domain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Defects in solid-state materials provide an ideal, robust platform for quantum sensing. To deliver maximum sensitivity, a large ensemble of noninteracting defects hosting quantum states with long coherence is required. Control of such an ensemble is challenging due to the spatial variation in both the defect energy levels and in any control field across a macroscopic sample. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that we can overcome these challenges using Floquet theory and optimal control optimization methods to efficiently and coherently control a large defect ensemble, suitable for sensing. We apply our methods experimentally to a spin ensemble of up to 4 x 109 nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By explicitly including the hyperfine interaction to the intrinsic 14N nuclear spin in the optimization, we design shaped microwave control pulses that can outperform conventional (??) pulses when applied to sensing schemes, with an improvement in the strength of ensemble response of between 11% and 78%. Through simulation of the ensemble dynamics, we shed light on the bandwidth limitations of large-ensemble reinitialization and propose alternative routes for further improvement.

TI Experimental measurement of kinetic parameters using quantum plasmonic
   sensing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Kinetic models are essential for describing how molecules interact in a variety of biochemical processes. The estimation of a model's kinetic parameters by experiment enables researchers to understand how pathogens, such as viruses, interact with other entities like antibodies and trial drugs. In this work, we report a simple proof-of-principle experiment that uses quantum sensing techniques to give a more precise estimation of kinetic parameters than is possible with a classical approach. The interaction we study is that of bovine serum albumin (BSA) binding to gold via an electrostatic mechanism. BSA is an important protein in biochemical research as it can be conjugated with other proteins and peptides to create sensors with a wide range of specificity. We use single photons generated via parametric down-conversion to probe the BSA-gold interaction in a plasmonic resonance sensor. We find that sub-shot-noise-level fluctuations in the sensor signal allow us to achieve an improvement in the precision of up to 31.8% for the values of the kinetic parameters. This enhancement can, in principle, be further increased in the setup. Our work highlights the potential use of quantum states of light for sensing in biochemical research.

TI Probe Incompatibility in Multiparameter Noisy Quantum Metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We derive fundamental bounds on the maximal achievable precision in multiparameter noisy quantum metrology, valid under the most general entanglement-assisted adaptive strategy, which are tighter than the bounds obtained by a direct use of single-parameter results. This allows us to study the issue of the optimal probe incompatibility in the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters in generic noisy channels, while so far the issue has been studied mostly in effectively noiseless scenarios (where the Heisenberg scaling is possible). We apply our results to the estimation of both unitary and noise parameters and indicate models where the fundamental probe incompatibility is present. In particular, we show that in lossy multiple-arm interferometry the probe incompatibility is as strong as in the noiseless scenario, reducing the potential advantage of simultaneous estimation to a constant factor. Finally, going beyond the multiparameter estimation paradigm, we introduce the concept of random quantum sensing and show how the tools developed may be applied to multiple-channel discrimination problems. As an illustration, we provide a simple proof of the loss of the quadratic advantage of the time-continuous Grover algorithm in the presence of dephasing or erasure noise.

TI Using graphene conductors to enhance the functionality of atom chips
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that the performance and functionality of atom chips can be transformed by using graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures to overcome present limitations on the lifetime of the trapped atom cloud and on its proximity to the chip surface. Our analysis involves Green's-function calculations of the thermal (Johnson) noise and Casimir-Polder atom-surface attraction produced by the atom chip. This enables us to determine the lifetime limitations produced by spin flip, tunneling, and three-body collisional losses. Compared with atom chips that use thick metallic conductors and substrates, atom-chip structures based on two-dimensional materials reduce the minimum attainable atom-surface separation to a few hundred nanometers and increase the lifetimes of the trapped atom clouds by orders of magnitude so that they are limited only by the quality of the background vacuum. We predict that atom chips with two-dimensional conductors will also reduce spatial fluctuations in the trapping potential originating from imperfections in the conductor patterns. These advantages will enhance the performance of atom chips for quantum sensing applications and for fundamental studies of complex quantum systems.

TI Electron charge sensor with hole current operating at cryogenic
   temperature
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB When silicon-on-insulator p-type MOSFET (SOI-PMOS) functions like a capacitor-less 1T-DRAM cell, it is possible for the number of electrons to be sensed at cryogenic temperatures (5 K). We developed a structure that combines silicon-on-insulator n-type MOSFETs (SOI-NMOS) and SOI-PMOS with multiple gates to form a silicon quantum-dot array. In this structure, a variable number of electrons is injected into the SOI-PMOS body by means of the bucket-brigade operation of SOI-NMOS connected in series. The channel-hole current was changed by the injected electrons due to the body bias effect in SOI-PMOS, and the change appeared to be step-like, which suggests a dependence on the elementary charge.

TI General symmetry operators of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The true level crossing in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model without any obvious symmetry can be exhibited in the energy spectrum if the qubit bias is a multiple of the cavity frequency, which should imply the existence of the hidden symmetry. In this work, within a Bogoliubov operator approach, we can readily derive the symmetry operators associated with the hidden symmetry hierarchically for arbitrary multiples. The symmetry operators for small multiples in the literature can be extremely easily reproduced in our general scheme. In addition, a general parity operator is defined through the symmetry operator, which naturally includes the well-known parity operator of the symmetric model. We believe that the present approach can be straightforwardly extended to other asymmetric Rabi models to find the relevant symmetry operators.

TI Stability of Floquet Majorana Box Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In one-dimensional topological superconductors driven periodically with the frequency omega, two types of topological edge modes may appear, the well-known Majorana zero mode and a Floquet Majorana mode located at the quasienergy PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI omega/2. We investigate two Josephson-coupled topological quantum wires in the presence of Coulomb interactions, forming a so-called Majorana box qubit. An oscillating gate voltage can induce Floquet Majorana modes in both wires. This allows for the encoding of three qubits in a sector with fixed electron parity. If such a system is prepared by increasing the amplitude of oscillations adiabatically, it is inherently unstable as interactions resonantly create quasiparticles. This can be avoided by using instead a protocol where the oscillation frequency is increased slowly. In this case, one can find a parameter regime where the system remains stable.

TI Exploring the potential link between prostate cancer and magnetic fields
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB Prostate cancer is the most common solid cancer in men worldwide. Various lifestyle factors have been established as contributors to cancer risk, and prostate cancer is no exception. Elements such as advanced age, diet, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, circadian rhythm disruptions, Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, and sexual activity have all been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. Notably, famous male guitarists from bands spanning the last few decades are now entering the age demographic most closely associated with prostate cancer. It is not surprising that they may fall into the 'at-risk' category. Media speculation has hinted at a potentially higher incidence of prostate cancer among guitarists compared to their bandmates, although no tangible correlation has been established. This speculation piqued our curiosity and prompted an exploration into potential reasons why musicians, particularly guitarists, might be at an elevated risk of developing prostate cancer. We hypothesise the electromagnetic fields generated by the electric guitar may in part explain the possible increase in prostate cancer risk among electric guitarists. This study delves into these intriguing possibilities, shedding light on an area of research that remains speculative but warrants further investigation.

TI Quantum Enhanced Probes of Magnetic Circular Dichroism
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Magneto-optical microscopies, including optical measurements of magnetic circular dichroism, are increasingly ubiquitous tools for probing spin-orbit coupling, charge-carrier g-factors, and chiral excitations in matter, but the minimum detectable signal in classical magnetic circular dichroism measurements is fundamentally limited by the shot-noise limit of the optical readout field. Here, a two-mode squeezed light source is used to improve the minimum detectable signal in magnetic circular dichroism measurements by 3 decibels compared with state-of-the-art classical measurements, even with relatively lossy samples like terbium gallium garnet. These results provide a framework for new quantum-enhanced magneto-optical microscopies that are particularly critical for environmentally sensitive materials and for low temperature measurements where increased optical power can introduce unacceptable thermal perturbations.
   A two-mode squeezed light source generated through four-wave mixing in an atomic vapor was used to suppress the noise in magnetic circular dichroism measurements below the photon shot noise limit. This approach serves as a foundation for new quantum-enhanced probes of magneto-optical properties in materials that are sensitive to photothermally induced changes to basic material properties.image

TI Transfer-printing-based integration of silicon nitride grating structure
   on single-crystal diamond toward sensitive magnetometers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of quantum applications, especially quantum sensing of magnetic field. Implementation of nanostructure into diamond is powerful for efficient photon collection of NV centers and chip-scale miniaturization of the device, which is crucial for sensitive and practical diamond magnetometers. However, fabrication of the diamond nanostructure involves technical limitations and can degrade the spin coherence of the NV centers. In this study, we demonstrate the hybrid integration of a silicon nitride grating structure on a single-crystal diamond by utilizing transfer printing. This approach allows the implementation of the nanostructure in diamond using a simple pick-and-place assembly, facilitating diamond-based quantum applications without any complicated diamond nanofabrication. We observed the intensity enhancement in the collected NV emissions both theoretically and experimentally using the integrated grating structure. By applying the increased photon intensity, we demonstrate the improved magnetic sensitivity of the fabricated device. The proposed hybrid integration approach will offer a promising route toward a compact and sensitive diamond NV-based magnetometer. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI A charge transfer mechanism for optically addressable solid-state spin
   pairs
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Bright point-defect emitters in hexagonal boron nitride have potential applications in quantum sensing and other technologies. However, it can be difficult to correctly identify the microscopic nature of observed defects, creating challenges for further development. A class of bright emitters exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance with no resolvable zero-field splitting has been observed in hexagonal boron nitride across a broad range of wavelengths. However, the microscopic structure of the defects and the physical origin of their optically detected magnetic resonance signal have still not been identified. Here we describe a model that accounts for and provides a physical explanation for all key experimental features of the spin-resolved photodynamics of ensembles and single emitters. The model, inspired by the radical-pair mechanism from spin chemistry, assumes a pair of nearby point defects, one of which is optically active. Using first-principles calculations, we show that simple defect pairs made of common carbon defects provide a plausible realization of our model. As well as addressing open questions about defects in hexagonal boron nitride, our model may also explain similar phenomena observed in other wide-bandgap semiconductors.

TI Chip-scale quantum sensors based on an integrated silicon carbide
   photonic platform
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB This review provides a forward-looking perspective on chip-scale quantum sensors based on integrated silicon carbide (SiC) photonic platforms. Although SiC quantum sensors, which utilize atomic point defects such as silicon vacancies and divacancies, are powerful tools for nanosensing, their performance in bulk-material configurations is often limited by factors such as poor photon collection and inefficient optical control. The novelty of this work lies in its focused analysis of how SiC photonic integration-leveraging components such as as waveguides, resonators, and metasurfaces can overcome these fundamental limitations. We explore how these integrated platforms enhance light-matter interactions, boost readout fidelity, and enable precise control over quantum states, providing a direct pathway to surpass the sensitivity of current bulk-material sensors. By synthesizing recent breakthroughs in SiC photonics with advances in materials science and quantum control, we outline a scalable road-map for developing high-performance, wafer-deployable quantum sensing systems for applications ranging from biomedical imaging to navigation in harsh environments.

TI Silicon Nitride-Photonics-Enabled Optical Pumping for Optically Pumped
   Magnetometer
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Discrete optical system in optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) presents a significant challenge to their integration into high-spatial-resolution magnetic field detection. Here, the electron spin polarization of 87Rb$<^>{87}{\rm Rb}$ atoms using a fiber-coupled silicon nitride (Si3N4${\rm Si}_3{\rm N}_4$) photonic integrated circuit (PIC) is demonstrated, by the way of delivering arrayed elliptically polarized light (EPL) into a vapor cell. Specifically, the photonic integrated circuit (PIC) transforms fiber-coupled 795 nm pump light via optical waveguides to eight divergent free-space beams, simultaneously converting linear polarized light (LPL) into EPL with an average polarization conversion efficiency of 71%. The Si3N4${\rm Si}_3{\rm N}_4$ PIC-enabled OPM has detected the weak magnetic field with an optimal sensitivity of 0.53 pT <middle dot>$\cdot$ Hz-1/2${\rm Hz}<^>{-1/2}$ at 70Hz. This work presents an effective approach for manipulation of alkali atoms using a chip and, crucially, introduces a chip-based pump solution for OPMs. This approach contributes to the integration of nanophotonics with atomic systems, paving the way for future advancements in quantum sensing.

TI Cavity-Mediated Collective Emission from Few Emitters in a Diamond
   Membrane
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB When an ensemble of quantum emitters couples to a common radiation field, their polarizations can synchronize and a collective emission termed superfluorescence can occur. Entering this regime in a freespace setting requires a large number of emitters with a high spatial density as well as coherent optical transitions with small inhomogeneity. Here, we show that, by coupling nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond membrane to a high-finesse microcavity, also few, incoherent, inhomogeneous, and spatially separated emitters-as are typical for solid state systems-can enter the regime of collective emission. We observe a superlinear power dependence of the emission rate as a hallmark of collective emission. Furthermore, we find simultaneous photon bunching and antibunching on different timescales in the second-order autocorrelation function, revealing cavity-induced interference in the quantized emission from about 15 emitters. We develop theoretical models for mesoscopic emitter numbers to analyze the behavior in the Dicke state basis and find that the population of collective states together with cavity enhancement and filtering can explain the observations. Such a system has prospects for the generation of multiphoton quantum states, the preparation of entanglement in few-emitter systems, and enhancement of signals in quantum sensing.

TI Quantum parameter estimation of nonlinear coupling in a trilinear
   Hamiltonian with trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB I propose an efficient method for measuring nonlinear coupling between the collective axial breathing mode and the radial rocking mode induced by the mutual Coulomb repulsion in linear ion crystal. The quantum sensing technique is based on the laser-induced coupling between one of the vibrational modes and the internal ion's spin states which allows to estimate the nonlinear coupling either by measuring the phonon probability distribution or by directly observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. I show that due to the presence of nonlinear phonon coupling the off-resonance interaction between the ion spin states and the axial breathing mode leads to spin-dependent phonon squeezing of the radial rocking mode. Thus the nonlinear coupling can be estimated by measuring population distribution of the motional squeezed state. Furthermore, I show that the off-resonance interaction between the spin and the radial rocking mode creates a spin-dependent beam splitter operation between the two vibrational modes. Thus the parameter estimation can be carried out by detecting the ion spin populations. Finally, I show that the measurement uncertainty precision can reach the Heisenberg limit by using an entangled state between the two collective modes.

TI Diamond photo-electric detectors with introduced silicon-vacancy color
   centers
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Color centers in diamond are promising candidates for quantum sensing in photo-luminescent or photo-electric modes. The photoinduced charge carrier separation in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers makes diamond an excellent visible photodetector. To date, the effect of introducing silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers on the photo-electrical and photo-luminescent properties of diamond remains unclear. To address this issue, high-quality silicon-doped single crystal diamond (Si-SCD) photodetectors were prepared by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). It is found that an extremely low dark current of several picoamperes can be achieved with an oxygen-terminated surface. In addition, although the introduction of SiV centers enhances the device's absorption of near-ultraviolet/visible (NUV/Vis) illumination, it has little impact on the solar blind detection performance, exhibiting a responsivity of 36.2 mA W-1 and detectivity of 2.10 x 1012 jones. Meanwhile, the Si-doped detector also exhibits 102 to 103 times higher responses to NUV/Vis signals and a faster cut-off speed. Moreover, a SiV PL enhancement of 50% was achieved with external electrical bias, demonstrating a higher electric pumping efficiency compared with polycrystalline diamond devices.

TI Fluorescent Nanodiamond-Nanogels for Nanoscale Sensing and Photodynamic
   Applications
SO ADVANCED NANOBIOMED RESEARCH
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds (NDs) are carbon-based nanoparticles with various outstanding magneto-optical properties. After preparation, NDs have a variety of different surface groups that determine their physicochemical properties. For biological applications, surface modifications are crucial to impart a new interface for controlled interactions with biomolecules or cells. Herein, a straightforward synthesis concept denoted "adsorption-crosslinking" is applied for the efficient modification of NDs, which sequentially combines fast noncovalent adsorption based on electrostatic interactions and subsequent covalent crosslinking. As a result, a very thin and uniform nanogel (NG) coating surrounding the NDs is obtained, which imparts reactive groups as well as high colloidal stability. The impact of the reaction time, monomer concentration, molecular weight, structure of the crosslinker on the resulting NG shell, the availability of reactive chemical surface functions, and the quantum sensing properties of the coated NDs are assessed and optimized. Postmodification of the NG-coated NDs is achieved with phototoxic ruthenium complexes yielding ND-based probes suitable for photodynamic applications. The adsorption-crosslinking ND functionalization reported herein provides new avenues toward functional probes and traceable nanocarriers for high-resolution bioimaging, nanoscale sensing, and photodynamic applications.

TI Quantum dialogue based on quantum encryption with single photons in both

SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB In this paper, a novel information-leakage-resistant quantum dialogue (QD) protocol with single photons in both polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom is proposed. This protocol utilizes quantum encryption technology to overcome the information leakage problem; the protocol utilizes quantum encryption and decoy photon technologies to dually protect the single photons with two degrees of freedom used for encoding two communicants' private classical bits, and makes the initial states of the single photons with two degrees of freedom for encoding shared between two communicants through quantum key encryption and decryption. The information-theoretical efficiency of this protocol is 40%.

TI Metastable Brominated Nanodiamond Surface Enables Room Temperature and
   Catalysis-Free Amine Chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Bromination of high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) nanodiamond (ND) surfaces has not been explored and can open new avenues for increased chemical reactivity and diamond lattice covalent bond formation. The large bond dissociation energy of the diamond lattice-oxygen bond is a challenge that prevents new bonds from forming, and most researchers simply use oxygen-terminated NDs (alcohols and acids) as reactive species. In this work, we transformed a tertiary-alcohol-rich ND surface to an amine surface with similar to 50% surface coverage and was limited by the initial rate of bromination. We observed that alkyl bromide moieties are highly labile on HPHT NDs and are metastable as previously found using density functional theory. The strong leaving group properties of the alkyl bromide intermediate were found to form diamond-nitrogen bonds at room temperature and without catalysts. This robust pathway to activate a chemically inert ND surface broadens the modalities for surface termination, and the unique surface properties of brominated and aminated NDs are impactful to researchers for chemically tuning diamond for quantum sensing or biolabeling applications.

TI Low magnetic noise, easy-to-process polystyrene-grafted amorphous alloy
   composites for extremely-weak magnetic measurement at ultra-low
   frequency
SO MATERIALS TODAY ADVANCES
AB Cobalt-based amorphous alloys (Co-MG) demonstrate ultra-high permeability and remarkably-low power loss, positioning them as promising candidates for shielding (near-) static magnetic fields and addressing accuracy limitations in extremely-weak magnetic measurements. However, the brittleness and poor understanding about magnetic performance below 100 Hz have impeded their widespread adoption. To integrate satisfied processing, magnetic and mechanical performances, polystyrene-grafted Co-MG composites are developed. Compared with permalloy-1J85, Co-MG-(g-PS_35 %) composite exhibits 40 % increase in initial permeability, 48 % increase in saturation magnetization, 71 % reduction in remanence within shielding area. In contrast to Mn-Zn ferrite, CoMG-(g-PS_35 %) composite demonstrates the power loss and mu ''/mu ' 2 values lower by an order of magnitude, resulting in magnetic noises 85 % lower at 1 Hz. Furthermore, the resultant composite maintains similar processing-rheological behaviors and mechanical properties compared with bulk polystyrene. It provides an innovative solution to expand real-world applications for biomagnetic detection, and overcome the sensitivity limitation of extremely-weak magnetic measurement.

TI In operando nanothermometry by nanodiamond based
   temperature sensing
SO CARBON
AB Precise evaluation of the temperature and its evolution at microscopic scale in an operating electrochemical device is essential for accessing the mechanism behind device performance for thermal management. However, such information is limited, as most of the existing temperature monitoring of electrochemical processes are carried out at macroscale. Fluorescent nanodiamond (ND) enables sensitive temperature monitoring at nanoscale in a working device without perturbing the electrochemical processes. In this study, we demonstrated spatially resolved temperature monitoring at nanoscale of a zinc (Zn) electroplating process, when temperature fluctuation in the device resulted from Zn dendrite-growth induced internal short circuit. We disclosed for the first time a significant difference in temperature measured at nanoscale by ND sensors and that at millimeter scale by a resistance temperature detector. Spatial temperature non-uniformity was found to persist during the entire Zn electroplating process, and a correlation between its evolution and the temperature fluctuation resulted from the current change was identified. This work represents an important step towards spatially resolved nanothermometry carried out in operando and precise evaluation on the local temperature and its evolution in a working electrochemical device.

TI Using QKD in MACsec for secure Ethernet networks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Media access control security (MACsec) is an IEEE 802.1AE standard for secure communication on Ethernet links. MACsec ensures the confidentiality, integrity and origin authenticity of Ethernet frames. The secrecy of MACsec stems from a root key that is either configured as a pre-shared key or derived from a mutual authentication protocol. However, both methods are not ideal because such a root key may be disclosed due to human errors or broken by quantum attacks. Here, the authors investigate the quantum key distribution (QKD) as an alternative source of trust for MACsec. QKD can be used as either a root key provider or a session key generator. The authors develop a new key exchange protocol based on QKD for Ethernet networks. Furthermore, it is verified by the experiment that QKD could be well integrated into MACsec without performance degradation.

TI Semiquantum group proxy blind signature
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB In this study, we propose the semiquantum group proxy blind signature scheme, in which the signature verifier and some proxy signers only possess limited quantum capabilities. On the basis that the original message content of the original message owner is blind to the original signer, the signature verifier, the proxy signature group and the trusted third party helping complete the signing process, this scheme can accomplish the goal of the original singer authorizing the proxy signature group to sign this original message. This scheme is proved to have unforgeability, non-repudiation, complete blindness and security. Since the signature verifier and some proxy signers only possess limited quantum capabilities, compared with many existing quantum group proxy blind signature protocols, this scheme has a wider range of signature application scenarios.

TI The Radical Pair Mechanism and Its Quantum Role in Plant Reactive Oxygen
   Species Production Under Hypomagnetic Fields
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The Earth's geomagnetic field (GMF) is a fundamental environmental signal for plants, with its perception rooted in quantum biology. Specifically, the radical pair mechanism (RPM) explains how this weak force influences electron spin states in metabolic pathways, providing a framework for its profound biological impact. Research shows that a hypomagnetic field (hMF) directly reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), creating a quantum signature in plants. This is a counterintuitive finding, as it suggests the plant perceives less oxidative stress and, in response, downregulates its antioxidant defenses. This multi-level effect, from a quantum trigger to molecular and metabolic changes, ultimately affects the plant's growth and phenotype. This review suggests a possible link between the GMF and plant health, identifying the GMF as a potential physiological modulator. Manipulating the magnetic field could therefore be a novel strategy for improving crop resilience and growth. However, the fact that some effects cannot be fully explained by the RPM suggests other quantum mechanisms are involved, paving the way for future research into these undiscovered processes and their potential inheritance across generations.

TI Phase-gradient metasurface enables atomic spin chirality detection for
   elliptically polarized laser-pumped atomic magnetometer
SO PHOTONIX
AB The powerful light field manipulation capability of metasurfaces offers a novel development perspective for the quantum precision measurement. By applying the phase-gradient metasurface (PGM) to atomic magnetometers (AMs), we have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a new type of compact single-beam elliptically polarized atomic magnetometers (EPAMs). Employing the fabricated chiral beam splitter PGM with high cross-polarization transmittance, a new atomic spin chirality detection method was devised, enabling the ultra-high sensitivity for extremely weak magnetic field measurement and achieving a high sensitivity of 2.67 pT/Hz1/2 under an external magnetic field of approximately 10,000 nT. The new AMs combine the pumping and probing polarized light, achieving a compact design. The fabricated PGM has a size of only 3 mm x 3 mm x 0.7 mm, which is beneficial for the miniaturization and integration of AMs. This work effectively expands the application of metasurfaces in the field of quantum precision measurement, and also provides a new viewpoint for the design and development of high-sensitivity and miniaturized AMs.

TI Quantum Probes for the Characterization of Nonlinear Media
SO ENTROPY
AB Active optical media leading to interaction Hamiltonians of the form H=lambda & SIM;(a+a & DAG;)zeta represent a crucial resource for quantum optical technology. In this paper, we address the characterization of those nonlinear media using quantum probes, as opposed to semiclassical ones. In particular, we investigate how squeezed probes may improve individual and joint estimation of the nonlinear coupling lambda & SIM; and of the nonlinearity order zeta. Upon using tools from quantum estimation, we show that: (i) the two parameters are compatible, i.e., the may be jointly estimated without additional quantum noise; (ii) the use of squeezed probes improves precision at fixed overall energy of the probe; (iii) for low energy probes, squeezed vacuum represent the most convenient choice, whereas for increasing energy an optimal squeezing fraction may be determined; (iv) using optimized quantum probes, the scaling of the corresponding precision with energy improves, both for individual and joint estimation of the two parameters, compared to semiclassical coherent probes. We conclude that quantum probes represent a resource to enhance precision in the characterization of nonlinear media, and foresee potential applications with current technology.</p>

TI The Efficient Preparation of Normal Distributions in Quantum Registers
SO QUANTUM
AB The efficient preparation of input distributions is an important problem in obtaining quantum advantage in a wide range of domains. We propose a novel quantum algorithm for the efficient preparation of arbitrary normal distributions in quantum registers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to leverage the power of Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reuse (WCMR), in a way that is broadly applicable to a range of state-preparation problems. Specifically, our algorithm employs a repeat-until-success scheme, and only requires a constant-bounded number of repetitions in expectation. In the experiments presented, the use of MCMR enables up to a 862.6x reduction in required qubits. Furthermore, the algorithm is provably resistant to both phase-flip and bit-flip errors, leading to a first-of-its-kind empirical demonstration on real quantum hardware, the MCMR-enabled Honeywell System Models HO and H1-2.

TI Biophysical Interface of Anti-Matter for Virtual Living in Real World: A
   Reality in Chemical Converted in Parallel Worlds
SO BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB We are going to discuss biology and the biophysical phenomenon of the anti-matters. both experimentally and theoretically or philosophically. Anti-matter is used to treat cancer and thymine dimer problems due to CV radiation. Positrons are beamed through tissue at such velocity that they do not annihilate until they encounter cancer cells. Formed gamma rays damage the cancer tissue. Nowadays. anti -matter is used in positron emission tomography (PET). In evolutionary biology where we see evidence that consciousness has emerged in at least humans lifeforms can self-organize to exhibit collective emergent super-consciousness. In this work e are looking at an ontological explanation of the relationship between the results obtained with the Ecology. The proton transfer mechanism is a critical phenomenon that is related to the acid-base characteristics of the nucleobases in Watson Crick base pairs. They exhibited a strong probability for protons to change place within the hydrogen bond due to quantum tunneling which will alter the genetic code and cause mutations. These mutations could be the cause of several diseases such as cancer. Probably the quantum tunneling effect (such as proton transfer) appears in micro parallel worlds

TI Microsecond-lived quantum states in a carbon-based circuit driven by
   cavity photons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots are an attractive platform for the realisation of quantum processors. To achieve long-range coupling between them, quantum dots have been integrated into microwave cavities. However, it has been shown that their coherence is then reduced compared to their cavity-free implementations. Here, we manipulate the quantum states of a suspended carbon nanotube double quantum dot with ferromagnetic contacts embedded in a microwave cavity. By performing quantum manipulations via the cavity photons, we demonstrate coherence times of the order of 1.3 mu s, two orders of magnitude larger than those measured so far in any carbon quantum circuit and one order of magnitude larger than silicon-based quantum dots in comparable environment. This holds promise for carbon as a host material for spin qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

TI Experimental Investigation of Lee-Yang Criticality Using Non-Hermitian
   Quantum System
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Lee-Yang theory clearly demonstrates where the phase transition of many-body systems occurs and the asymptotic behavior near the phase transition using the partition function under complex parameters. The complex parameters make the direct investigation of Lee-Yang theory in practical systems challenging. Here we construct a non-Hermitian quantum system that can correspond to the one-dimensional Ising model with imaginary parameters through the equality of partition functions. By adjusting the non-Hermitian parameter, we successfully obtain the partition function under different imaginary magnetic fields and observe the Lee-Yang zeros. We also observe the critical behavior of free energy in vicinity of Lee-Yang zero that is consistent with theoretical prediction. Our work provides a protocol to study Lee-Yang zeros of the one-dimensional Ising model using a single-qubit non-Hermitian system.

TI Two-party secure semiquantum summation against the collective-dephasing
   noise
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we propose a two-party semiquantum summation protocol, where two classical users can accomplish the summation of their private binary sequences with the assistance of a quantum semi-honest third party (TP). The term 'semi-honest' implies that TP cannot conspire with others but is able to implement all kinds of attacks. This protocol employs logical qubits as traveling particles to overcome the negative influence of collective-dephasing noise and need not make any two parties pre-share a random secret key. The security analysis turns out that this protocol can effectively prevent the outside attacks from Eve and the participant attacks from TP. Moreover, TP has no knowledge about the summation results.

TI Information bound for entropy production from the detailed fluctuation
   theorem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Fluctuation theorems impose fundamental bounds in the statistics of the entropy production with the second law of thermodynamics being the most famous. Using information theory, we quantify the information of entropy production and find an upper tight bound as a function of its mean from the strong detailed fluctuation theorem. The bound is given in terms of a maximal distribution, a member of the exponential family with nonlinear argument. We show that the entropy produced by heat transfer using a bosonic mode at weak coupling reproduces the maximal distribution in a limiting case. The upper bound is extended to the continuous domain and verified for the heat transfer using a levitated nanoparticle. Finally, we show that a composition of qubit swap engines satisfies a particular case of the maximal distribution regardless of its size.

TI Electrochemical Characterization of Ionic Dynamics Resulting from Spin
   Conversion of Water Isomers
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Para- and ortho-isomers of water have different chemical and physical properties. Excitations by magnetic field, laser emission or hydrodynamic cavitation are reported to change energetic levels and spin configurations of water molecules that in turn change macroscopically measurable properties of aqueous solutions. Similar scheme is also explored for dissolved molecular oxygen, where physical excitations form singlet oxygen with different spin configurations and generate a long chain of ionic and free-radical reactions. This work utilizes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize ionic dynamics of proposed spin conversion methods applied to dissolving of carbon dioxide CO2 and hydrogen peroxide H2O2 in pure water excited by fluctuating weak magnetic field in mu T range. Measurement results demonstrate different ionic reactivities and surface tension effects triggered by excitations at 10(-8) J/mL. The CO2- and O-2-related reaction pathways are well distinguishable by EIS. Control experiments without CO2/H2O2 input show no significant effects. Dynamics of electrochemical impedances and temperature of fluids indicates anomalous quasi-periodical fluctuations pointing to possible carbonate-induced cyclic reactions or cyclical spin conversion processes. This approach can underlie the development of affordable electrochemical sensors operating with spin conversion technologies with applications in quantum biology, biophysics, and material science.

TI Continuous variable measurement device independent quantum conferencing
   with postselection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A continuous variable (CV), measurement device independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol is analyzed, enabling three parties to connect for quantum conferencing. We utilise a generalised Bell detection at an untrusted relay and a postselection procedure, in which distant parties reconcile on the signs of the displacements of the quadratures of their prepared coherent states. We derive the rate of the protocol under a collective pure-loss attack, demonstrating improved rate-distance performance compared to the equivalent non-post-selected protocol. In the symmetric configuration in which all the parties lie the same distance from the relay, we find a positive key rate over 6 km. Such postselection techniques can be used to improve the rate of multi-party quantum conferencing protocols at longer distances at the cost of reduced performance at shorter distances.

TI Quantum Control of Radical-Pair Dynamics beyond Time-Local Optimization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We realize arbitrary -wave -form -based control of spin -selective recombination reactions of radical pairs in the low -magnetic -field regime. To this end, we extend the gradient -ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) paradigm to allow for optimizing reaction yields. This overcomes drawbacks of previously suggested time -local optimization approaches for the reaction control of radical pairs, which were limited to high biasing fields. We demonstrate how efficient time -global optimization of the recombination yields can be realized by gradient -based methods augmented by time blocking, sparse sampling of the yield, and evaluation of the central single time -step propagators and their Frechet derivatives using iterated TrotterSuzuki splittings. Results are shown for both a toy model, previously used to demonstrate coherent control of radical -pair reactions in the simpler high -field scenario and, furthermore, for a realistic exciplexforming donor -acceptor system comprising 16 nuclear spins. This raises prospects for the spin control of actual radical -pair systems in ambient magnetic fields, by suppressing or boosting radical reaction yields using purpose -specific radio -frequency wave forms, paving the way for reaction -yield -dependent quantum magnetometry and potentially applications of quantum control to biochemical radical -pair reactions. We demonstrate the latter aspect for two radical pairs implicated in quantum biology.

AB The public keys in a public key cryptosystem need not to be protected for confidentiality, however, it is important to confirm their legality. In this paper, motivated by Meshram et al. (2017), we develop a simple novel key authentication scheme for public key cryptosystems whose security rely on discrete logarithm problem in group ring. The advantage of our novel scheme is that it requires no authority unlike regular certificate based techniques. In our scheme, we consider a pair of secret key and password as the certificate of public key. We show that the security of our scheme relies on discrete logarithm problem in group ring (DLPGR). The DLPGR is an NP problem for which no known quantum algorithm exists that solves it in polynomial time.

AB We describe a technique for self-consistently characterizing both the quantum state of a single-qubit system, and the positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) that describes measurements on the system. The method works with only 10 measurements. We assume that a series of unitary transformations performed on the quantum state are fully known, while making minimal assumptions about both the density operator of the state and the POVM. The technique returns maximum-likely estimates of both the density operator and the POVM. To experimentally demonstrate the method, we perform reconstructions of over 300 state-measurement pairs, and we compare them to their expected density operators and POVMs. We find that 95% of the reconstructed POVMs have fidelities of 0.98 or greater, and 92% of the density operators have fidelities that are 0.98 or greater.

TI Quantum memristor with vacuum-one-photon qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum memristors represent a promising interface between quantum and neuromorphic computing, combining the nonlinear, memory-dependent behavior of classical memristors with the properties of quantum states. An optical quantum memristor can be realized with a vacuum-one-photon qubit entering a tunable beam splitter whose reflectivity is adapted according to the mean number of photons in the device. In this work, we report on the experimental implementation of a bulk quantum-optical memristor, working with single-rail coherent superposition states in the Fock basis, generated via a resonantly excited quantum dot single-photon source. We demonstrate that the coherence of the input state is preserved by the quantum memristor. Moreover, our modular platform allows investigating the nonlinear behavior arising from a cascade of two quantum memristors, a building block for larger networks of such devices toward the realization of complex neuromorphic quantum architectures.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The decoherence of a central electron spin due to the dynamics of a coupled electron-spin bath is a core problem in solid-state spin physics. Ensemble experiments have studied the central spin coherence in detail, but such experiments average out the underlying quantum dynamics of the bath. Here, we show the coherent back-action of an individual NV center on an electron-spin bath and use it to detect, prepare, and control the dynamics of a pair of bath spins. We image the NV-pair system with subnanometer resolution and reveal a long dephasing time [T2 & lowast; = 44(9) ms] for a qubit encoded in the electron-spin pair. Our experiment reveals the microscopic quantum dynamics that underlie the central spin decoherence and provides new opportunities for controlling and sensing interacting spin systems.

This method exploits artificial neural networks to identify noisy transition lines in stability diagrams, guiding a robust exploration strategy leveraging neural network uncertainty estimations. Tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single-quantum-dot technologies, this approach achieves a tuning success rate of over 99% in optimal cases, where more than 10% of the success is directly attributable to uncertainty exploitation. The challenging constraints of small training sets containing high diagram-to-diagram variability allowed us to evaluate the capabilities and limits of the proposed procedure.

TI Quantum Speed-Up in Collisional Battery Charging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a collision model for the charging of a quantum battery by identical nonequilibrium qubit units. When the units are prepared in a mixture of energy eigenstates, the energy gain in the battery can be described by a classical random walk, where both average energy and variance grow linearly with time. Conversely, when the qubits contain quantum coherence, interference effects buildup in the battery and lead to a faster spreading of the energy distribution, reminiscent of a quantum random walk. This can be exploited for faster and more efficient charging of a battery initialized in the ground state. Specifically, we show that coherent protocols can yield higher charging power than any possible incoherent strategy, demonstrating a quantum speed-up at the level of a single battery. Finally, we characterize the amount of extractable work from the battery through the notion of ergotropy.

TI Identification of a Telecom Wavelength Single Photon Emitter in Silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We identify the exact microscopic structure of the G photoluminescence center in silicon by firstprinciples calculations with including a self-consistent many-body perturbation method, which is a telecommunication wavelength single photon source. The defect constitutes of CsCi carbon impurities in its Cs-Sii-Cs configuration in the neutral charge state, where s and i stand for the respective substitutional and interstitial positions in the Si lattice. We reveal that the observed fine structure of its optical signals originates from the athermal rotational reorientation of the defect. We attribute the monoclinic symmetry reported in optically detected magnetic resonance measurements to the reduced tunneling rate at very low temperatures. We discuss the thermally activated motional averaging of the defect properties and the nature of the qubit state.

AB Time-lock puzzles wrap a solution s inside a puzzle P in such a way that "solving" P to find s requires significantly more time than generating the pair (s, P), even if the adversary has access to parallel computing; hence it can be thought of as sending a message s to the future. It is known [Mahmoody, Moran, Vadhan, Crypto'11] that when the source of hardness is only a random oracle, then any puzzle generator with n queries can be (efficiently) broken by an adversary in O(n) rounds of queries to the oracle.
   In this work, we revisit time-lock puzzles in a quantum world by allowing the parties to use quantum computing and, in particular, access the random oracle in quantum superposition. An interesting setting is when the puzzle generator is efficient and classical, while the solver (who might be an entity developed in the future) is quantum-powered and is supposed to need a long sequential time to succeed. We prove that in this setting there is no construction of time-lock puzzles solely from quantum (accessible) random oracles. In particular, for any n-query classical puzzle generator, our attack only asks O(n) (also classical) queries to the random oracle, even though it does indeed run in quantum polynomial time if the honest puzzle solver needs quantum computing.
   Assuming perfect completeness, we also show how to make the above attack run in exactly n rounds while asking a total of m . n queries where m is the query complexity of the puzzle solver. This is indeed tight in the round complexity, as we also prove that a classical puzzle scheme of Mahmoody et al. is also secure against quantum solvers who ask n-1 rounds of queries. In fact, even for the fully classical case, our attack quantitatively improves the total queries of the attack of Mahmoody et al. for the case of perfect completeness from O(mn log n) to mn. Finally, assuming perfect completeness, we present an attack in the "dual" setting in which the puzzle generator is quantum while the solver is classical.
   We then ask whether one can extend our classical-query attack to the fully quantum setting, in which both the puzzle generator and the solver could be quantum. We show a barrier for proving such results unconditionally. In particular, we show that if the folklore simulation conjecture, first formally stated by Aaronson and Ambainis [arXiv'2009] is false, then there is indeed a time-lock puzzle in the quantum random oracle model that cannot be broken by classical adversaries. This result improves the previous barrier of Austrin et. al [Crypto'22] about key agreements (that can have interactions in both directions) to time-lock puzzles (that only include unidirectional communication).

TI Quantum aberrations: Entangling photons with Zernike polynomials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce Zernike polynomials as a novel degree of freedom for encoding quantum information in the spatial structure of photons. Building on their orthogonality and completeness over the unit disk, we develop a framework for generating, manipulating, and detecting photons in Zernike modes, and propose methods for realizing single-photon and two-photon Zernike wave packets. We demonstrate analytically that two-photon states generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion exhibit mode entanglement in the Zernike basis, with correlations arising from selection rules enforced by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Our results open a new pathway for structured spatial entanglement, complementary to schemes based on Laguerre-Gaussian or Hermite-Gaussian modes, and suggest practical experimental implementations based on holographic modulation and optical Fourier techniques.

TI Algorithm for evaluating distance-based entanglement measures
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantifying entanglement in quantum systems is an important yet challenging task due to its NP-hard nature. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for evaluating distance-based entanglement measures. Our approach builds on Gilbert's algorithm for convex optimization, providing a reliable upper bound on the entanglement of a given arbitrary state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by applying it to various examples, such as calculating the squared Bures metric of entanglement as well as the relative entropy of entanglement for GHZ states, W states, Horodecki states, and chessboard states. These results demonstrate that our algorithm is a versatile and accurate tool that can quickly provide reliable upper bounds for entanglement measures.

TI Measuring out-of-time-ordered correlation functions without reversing
   time evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) play a crucial role in the study of thermalization, entanglement, and quantum chaos, as they quantify the scrambling of quantum information due to complex interactions. As a consequence of their out-of-time-ordered nature, OTOCs are difficult to measure experimentally. Here we propose an OTOC measurement protocol that does not rely on the reversal of time evolution and is easy to implement in a range of experimental settings. The protocol accounts for both pure and mixed initial states, and is applicable to systems that interact with environmental degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the application of our protocol by the characterization of scrambling in a periodically driven spin that exhibits quantum chaos.

TI Coherent and dissipative cavity magnonics
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Strong interactions between magnetic materials and electrodynamic cavities mix together spin and photon properties, producing unique hybridized behavior. The study of such coupled spin-photon systems, known as cavity magnonics, is motivated by the flexibility and controllability of these hybridized states for spintronic and quantum information technologies. In this Tutorial, we examine and compare both coherent and dissipative interactions in cavity magnonics. We begin with a familiar case study, the coupled harmonic oscillator, which provides insight into the unique characteristics of coherent and dissipative coupling. We then examine several canonical cavity-magnonic systems, highlighting the requirements for different coupling mechanisms, and conclude with recent applications of spin-photon hybridization, for example, the development of quantum transducers, memory architectures, isolators, and enhanced sensing.

TI Constraint Preserving Mixers for the Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithm
SO ALGORITHMS
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm/quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) is a heuristic to find approximate solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Most of the literature is limited to quadratic problems without constraints. However, many practically relevant optimization problems do have (hard) constraints that need to be fulfilled. In this article, we present a framework for constructing mixing operators that restrict the evolution to a subspace of the full Hilbert space given by these constraints. We generalize the "XY"-mixer designed to preserve the subspace of "one-hot" states to the general case of subspaces given by a number of computational basis states. We expose the underlying mathematical structure which reveals more of how mixers work and how one can minimize their cost in terms of the number of CX gates, particularly when Trotterization is taken into account. Our analysis also leads to valid Trotterizations for an "XY"-mixer with fewer CX gates than is known to date. In view of practical implementations, we also describe algorithms for efficient decomposition into basis gates. Several examples of more general cases are presented and analyzed.

AB We can utilize the Fisher quantum information matrix to evaluate the precision of any multiparametric forecasting methodology, due to the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. Using the density matrix vectorization approach, we examine both simultaneous and individual estimation procedures and the ratios of different estimation strategies. Our investigation takes into account interaction and intrinsic decoherence parameters, along with time, across various parameter combinations in a two-twisting axis model. Our findings suggest that using a simultaneous approach for multiple parameters in multiparameter estimation methods is generally more effective, offering higher precision than strategies that focus on individual parameters.

TI Chaotic switching for quantum coin Parrondo's games with application to
   encryption
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum game theory has stimulated some interest in recent years with the advancement of quantum information theory. This interest has led to a resurgence of quantum Parrondo's games. With two losing games combining to give a winning game, this paradoxical idea is known as Parrondo's paradox. By using chaotic switching between the two losing quantum games, we show that it is possible to achieve Parrondo's paradox involving a quantum walker playing two-sided quantum coin tossing games. Furthermore, we show that the framework of chaotic switching in quantum coin tosses can be applied to encryption. This is a proposal to deploy a quantum coin toss with chaotic switching for semiclassical encryption.

TI Non-Hermitian Anharmonicity Induces Single-Photon Emission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Single-photon sources are in high demand for quantum information applications. A paradigmatic way to achieve single-photon emission is through anharmonicity in the energy levels, such that the absorption of a single photon from a coherent drive shifts the system out of resonance and prevents absorption of a second one. We identify a novel mechanism for single-photon emission through non-Hermitian anharmonicity, i.e., anharmonicity in the losses instead of in the energy levels. We demonstrate the mechanism in two types of systems, including a feasible setup consisting of a hybrid metallodielectric cavity weakly coupled to a twolevel emitter, and show that it induces high-purity single-photon emission at high repetition rates.

TI Optical force induced by strong exciton-plasmon coupling
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Positioning a single quantum emitter in the vicinity of a plasmonic antenna is a fundamental step in constructing a coupling system for quantum information applications. In the strong-coupling regime, optical forces beyond perturbative Rayleigh gradient forces are dominant in positioning and trapping the quantum emitter but are rarely explored by including the electronic contribution of the quantum emitter. Here we study the optical forces induced by the strong exciton-plasmon coupling between a single quantum dot and a plasmonic nanoantenna. Interestingly, both attractive and repulsive optical forces can be generated, which are fully controllable and tunable by engineering both excitons and plasmons.

We find that two microwave fields can be squeezed simultaneously when the effective coupling constants between mechanical oscillator and two microwave fields are chosen appropriately. In particular, the squeezing of one microwave mode can be larger than 3 dB even at high temperature. We also find that bipartite and genuine tripartite entanglement can be generated in this system which are robust against thermal fluctuations. Our scheme may have potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

AB Bell states are a fundamental resource in photonic quantum information processing. These states have been generated successfully in many photonic degrees of freedom. Their manipulation, however, in the momentum space remains challenging. Here, we present a scheme for engineering the symmetry of two-photon states entangled in the transverse momentum degree of freedom through the use of a spatially variable phase object. We demonstrate how a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer must be constructed to verify the symmetry in momentum entanglement via photon "bunching/anti-bunching" observation. We also show how this approach allows generating states that acquire an arbitrary phase under the exchange operation.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Light carries information and energy simultaneously. Manipulating light for communication and energy conversion significantly promotes the progress of human society. Initially, different types of lenses and mirrors are used to help people view further and smaller through telescopes and microscopes. Phenomena such as reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction are well studied. Among these, the polarization density (P) within a medium is proportional to the electric field (E) of excitation light. As light intensity increases (specifically when a high-power laser is invented and introduced to optical research and production), interactions between medium and intense light fields normally show results that are different from those under traditional conditions. The concepts and applications of nonlinear optics are currently at the optical research stage. Nonlinear optics, which describes the nonlinear interactions between light and nonlinear medium (i.e., P depends nonlinearly on E), is a significant component of modern optics for both fundamental research and technical applications. Nonlinear interactions involve various processes such as harmonic generation, spontaneous parametric downconversion, the Kerr effect, and the electro-optic effect. Utilizing these processes, we can expand the usable laser wavelength range from deep ultraviolet to terahertz bands and create light sources carrying quantum information. Various types of instruments based on nonlinear optics are available in optical laboratories and factories. Mode-locked lasers produce ultrashort laser pulses for time-resolved measurements and laser manufacturing. Optical parametric oscillators and optical parametric amplifiers can be used to produce wavelength-tunable lasers. Quantum light sources create entangled photon pairs for quantum communication. In these applications, the core components are efficient nonlinear processes. However, weak nonlinear interactions between most medium and phase mismatches result in low conversion efficiency. There are two main ways to improve the overall efficiency: finding materials with high nonlinear coefficients and exploring a highly efficient corresponding phase matching method. Various high-performance optical crystal materials, including organic and inorganic materials, are studied and are still being widely pursued. Simultaneously, suitable phase matching methods are required for high conversion efficiency, which is crucial for practical applications. Phase matching methods are typically developed for a series of optical crystal materials with common properties. For example, birefringent phase matching is used for crystals with strong birefringent properties, whereas quasi-phase matching is suitable for polarized crystals. Therefore, the search for new types of high-performance nonlinear optical crystals must be accompanied by the corresponding phase matching methods. With the emergence of diverse materials with different properties, optical crystal material families and phase matching methods are being replenished. Progress Different types of nonlinear crystals and their corresponding phase matching methods have been developed over the past few decades. The most commonly used phase matching method is birefringent phase matching, which is first proposed in 1962. Here, a birefringent crystal separates the fundamental wave and second-harmonic generation (SHG) wave along different optical axes.
   A carefully selected incident polarization angle and cut angle of the crystal are required for precise refractive-index matching between the fundamental wave and SHG wave (Fig. 3). Utilizing birefringent phase matching, deep-ultraviolet laser generation is achieved with high conversion efficiency. Next, quasi-phase matching with inversion-poled domains is studied based on polarized materials such as lithium niobate crystals. The wavevector mismatch between the fundamental wave and the SHG wave is filled by a predesigned superlattice (Fig. 5). Through a unique periodic structure design, phase matching for third-and higher-order harmonic generation is realized, demonstrating the flexibility of quasi-phase matching (Fig. 6). Two-dimensional optical crystal materials attract significant attention because of their high nonlinear coefficients and excellent integration abilities (Fig. 7). However, traditional phase matching methods, such as birefringent and quasi-phase matching, cannot be applied to two-dimensional materials directly. The newly developed twist phase matching method can be used on layered materials, which exhibits high conversion efficiency and flexibility for two-dimensional materials such as rhombohedral boron nitride and one-dimensional materials such as multiwalled boron nitride nanotubes (Fig. 8). Conclusions and Prospects In conclusion, different types of nonlinear optical crystals and their corresponding phase matching methods are developed for various applications. Nowadays, new families of optical crystals are under study for higher conversion efficiencies, broader wavelength ranges, and novel functionalities. New phase matching mechanisms for highly efficient and universally applicable nonlinear crystal materials are also being pursued. In the future, optical crystals together with corresponding phase matching methods working in the extreme wavelength range (i. e., deeper ultraviolet and longer terahertz wavebands), generating ultrahigh output power, integrating with on-chip photonic circuits, and carrying quantum information are predicted to remain in high demand.

We first review the main potential advantages of these hole-spin qubits with respect to their electron-spin counterparts and give a general theoretical framework describing them. The basic features of spin-orbit coupling and hyperfine interaction in the valence band are discussed, together with consequences on coherence and spin manipulation. In the second part of the article, we provide a survey of experimental realizations, which spans a relatively broad spectrum of devices based on GaAs, Si and Si/Ge heterostructures.

TI Universal compressive tomography in the time-frequency domain
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum state tomography is a basic tool in quantum information, but it becomes a challenging task that requires an immense number of measurement configurations as the system dimension grows. We implement an adaptive compressive tomography scheme capable of reconstructing any arbitrary low-rank spectral-temporal optical signal with extremely few measurement settings and without any ad hoc assumption about the initially unknown signal. This is carried out by implementing projections onto arbitrary user-specified optical modes. We present conclusive experimental results for both temporal modes and frequency bins, which showcase the versatility of our method and thereby introduce a universal optical reconstruction framework to these platforms.

TI Quantum Otto engine driven by quantum fields
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We consider a quantum Otto engine using an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector model which interacts with a quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. We express a generic condition for extracting positive work in terms of the effective temperature of the detector. This condition reduces to the well-known positive work condition in the literature under the circumstances where the detector reaches thermal equilibrium with the field. We then evaluate the amount of work extracted by the detector in two scenarios: an inertial detector in a thermal bath and a circulating detector in the Minkowski vacuum, which is inspired by the Unruh quantum Otto engine.

AB We study the wave-particle duality in a general Mach-Zehnder interferometer with an asymmetric beam splitter from the viewpoint of quantum information theory. The correlations (including the classical correlation and the quantum correlation) between the particle and the which-path detector are derived when they are in pure state or mixed state at the output of Mach-Zehnder interferometer. It is found that the fringe visibility and the correlations are effected by the asymmetric beam splitter and the input state of the particle. The complementary relations between the fringe visibility and the correlations are also presented.

TI Entanglement estimation of Werner states with a quantum extreme learning
   machine
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) have emerged as a potent tool for various quantum information processing tasks. We present a QELM protocol for estimating the amount of entanglement in Werner states. The protocol requires the generation of a sequence of random Werner states, which are then combined with a reservoir state and evolved using an Ising Hamiltonian. A set of observables based on the Bloch basis is constructed and employed to train the system to recognize unseen features. To assess the protocol's robustness, noise is introduced into the input states, and the system's performance under these noisy conditions is analyzed. Additionally, the influence of the magnetic-field parameter within the Ising Hamiltonian on the estimation accuracy is investigated.

TI Coherent perfect absorption of quantum light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) was introduced as a classical optics phenomenon of a standing-wave absorption by a subwavelength film. In this paper, we develop a theory of CPA of quantized standing waves taking account of a subwavelength thickness of the absorber. This approach allows us to merge all known quantum effects of CPA under a single theory and introduce other regimes of CPA including CPA of NOON states with arbitrary number of entangled photons, orthogonally squeezed vacuum states, continuous variable entangled states, and Schrodinger cat states. Detailed analysis of the quantum regime of CPA sheds light on fundamental aspects of quantum light dissipation and its practical implementation in quantum optics and quantum information.

TI Quality control recommendations for RNASeq using FFPE samples based on
   pre-sequencing lab metrics and post-sequencing bioinformatics metrics
SO BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS
AB Background Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues have many advantages for identification of risk biomarkers, including wide availability and potential for extended follow-up endpoints. However, RNA derived from archival FFPE samples has limited quality. Here we identified parameters that determine which FFPE samples have the potential for successful RNA extraction, library preparation, and generation of usable RNAseq data. Methods We optimized library preparation protocols designed for use with FFPE samples using seven FFPE and Fresh Frozen replicate pairs, and tested optimized protocols using a study set of 130 FFPE biopsies from women with benign breast disease. Metrics from RNA extraction and preparation procedures were collected and compared with bioinformatics sequencing summary statistics. Finally, a decision tree model was built to learn the relationship between pre-sequencing lab metrics and qc pass/fail status as determined by bioinformatics metrics. Results Samples that failed bioinformatics qc tended to have low median sample-wise correlation within the cohort (Spearman correlation < 0.75), low number of reads mapped to gene regions (< 25 million), or low number of detectable genes (11,400 # of detected genes with TPM > 4). The median RNA concentration and pre-capture library Qubit values for qc failed samples were 18.9 ng/ul and 2.08 ng/ul respectively, which were significantly lower than those of qc pass samples (40.8 ng/ul and 5.82 ng/ul). We built a decision tree model based on input RNA concentration, input library qubit values, and achieved an F score of 0.848 in predicting QC status (pass/fail) of FFPE samples. Conclusions We provide a bioinformatics quality control recommendation for FFPE samples from breast tissue by evaluating bioinformatic and sample metrics. Our results suggest a minimum concentration of 25 ng/ul FFPE-extracted RNA for library preparation and 1.7 ng/ul pre-capture library output to achieve adequate RNA-seq data for downstream bioinformatics analysis.

TI Above-gap quasiparticle excitations in disordered graphene junctions
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The behavior of superconducting graphene junctions is governed by the electrical transparency of the superconductor-graphene interface. When the transparency is reduced, a finite quasiparticle density emerges that strongly modifies charge transport. We show that graphene junctions with reduced contact transparency exhibit above-gap resistance peaks forming complex current- and magnetic field-dependent diamond-shaped interference patterns across devices with different transparencies. These features are quantitatively explained by Tomasch and McMillan-Rowell oscillations, identifying quasiparticle interference as their origin. These findings underscore the limited understanding of quasiparticle processes in diffusive superconducting junctions, which hold implications for research on superconducting quantum information architectures and their applications.

We show both the aspects of universality in these distributions and their limitations. We concentrate in some detail on measures imported from the quantum information approach such as the fidelity susceptibility, and more generally, geometric tensor matrix elements.

TI Statistical Analysis of the Photon Loss in Fiber-Optic Communication

AB In optical communication systems, photons are lost due to the attenuation of the transmission medium. To efficiently implement quantum information protocols, we need to be able to precisely describe such processes. In this paper, we propose statistical methods to estimate the attenuation coefficient of the fiber link. By following the Beer-Lambert law, we utilize the properties of the exponential distribution to estimate the rate parameter based on observable data. In particular, we determine the explicit forms of unbiased estimators that are suitable for censored (truncated) sets of data. Moreover, we focus on minimum-variance methods that ensure a reliable estimation of the attenuation coefficient.

TI Cryogenic lithium-niobate-on-insulator optical filter
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Photonic integrated circuits have garnered significant attention and experienced rapid development in recent years. To provide fundamental building blocks for scalable optical classical and quantum information processing, one important direction is to develop cryogenic compatible photonic integrated devices. Here, we prepare one optical filter on a lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform based on a multimode waveguide grating and verify its availability at temperature from 295 to 7 K. We find that the integrated optical filter still shows good quality under cryogenic conditions, and the shift of the working wavelength at different temperatures is well explained by the index variation of the material. These results advance LNOI integrated optical devices in applications under cryogenic conditions. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group

Microfabricated chip-based 3D ion traps are scalable to store many ions for the realization of a large number of qubits, provide deep trapping potentials compared to surface traps, and very good shielding from external electric fields. In this work, we give an overview of our recent developments on chip-based 3D ion traps. Different types of chip materials, the integration of electronic filter components on-chip and compact electrical connections in vacuum are discussed. Further, based on finite element method simulations, we discuss how integrating micro-optics in 3D ion traps is possible without disturbing the trapped ions.

Here, we extend the exploration of steering-enhanced quantum metrology from single noiseless phase shifts to superpositions of noisy phase shifts. As concrete examples, we consider a control system that manipulates a target system to pass through a superposition of either dephased or depolarized phase shifts channels. We show that using such superpositions of noisy phase shifts can suppress the effects of noise and improve metrology. Furthermore, we also implemented proof-of-principle experiments for a superposition of dephased phase shifts on the IBM quantum experience, demonstrating a clear improvement on metrology.

TI Quantum fluidic charge density wave transport
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We discuss charge density wave transport as the periodic flow of a quantum fluid of electron-phonon correlates, viewed as quantum solitons, within the condensate. Pair creation of charged soliton droplets is prevented by their electrostatic energy below a Coulomb-blockade threshold electric field. Above threshold, the quantum fluid flows in drip-like fashion as microscopic entities tunnel coherently from one charging energy macrostate to the next. We summarize the time-correlated soliton tunneling model and compare simulations of coherent oscillations, narrow band noise, and current-voltage characteristics with experiment. We also explore the possibility of collective quantum behavior at room temperature in some materials. Finally, we discuss potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Quantum control with multi-dimensional Gaussian quantum invariant
SO QUANTUM
AB The framework of quantum invariants is an elegant generalization of adiabatic quantum control to control fields that do not need to change slowly. Due to the unavailability of invariants for systems with more than one spatial dimension, the benefits of this framework have not yet been exploited in multi-dimensional systems. We construct a multi-dimensional Gaussian quantum invariant that permits the design of time-dependent potentials that let the ground state of an initial potential evolve towards the ground state of a final potential. The scope of this framework is demonstrated with the task of shuttling an ion around a corner which is a paradigmatic control problem in achieving scalability of trapped ion quantum information technology.

TI Quantum Szilard engine for the fractional power-law potentials
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this study, we consider the quantum Szilard engine with a single particle under the fractional power-law potential. We suggest that such kind of the Szilard engine works a Stirling-like cycle. We obtain energy eigenvalues and canonical partition functions for the degenerate and non-degenerate cases in this cycle process. By using these quantities we numerically compute work and efficiency for this thermodynamic cycle for various power-law potentials with integer and non-integer exponents. We show that the presented simple engine also yields positive work and efficiency. We discuss the importance of fractional dynamics in physics and finally, we conclude that fractional calculus should be included in the fields of quantum information and thermodynamics.

TI Gaussian quantum steering for continuous variables sharing in an
   expanding universe
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Realistic quantum systems are affected by the expanding universe in their preparation and quantum information processing. In this paper, we study the relationship between the Gaussian quantum steering distribution and the parameters of the expanding universe. The expansion process of the universe can be described as a channel acting on a two-mode squeezed Gaussian state, with the evolution of quantum steering from the asymptotic past to the asymptotic future resulting in new distributions parameterized by cosmic parameters. We find that Gaussian quantum steering is more sensitive to the volume change of the expanding universe than the expansion rate, and the Gaussian quantum steering generated by particles with suitable mass and small momentum is more affected by the expanding universe.

TI Perfect tensor hyperthreads
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Bit threads, a dual description of the Ryu-Takyanagi formula for holographic entanglement entropy (EE), can be interpreted as a distillation of the quantum information to a collection of Bell pairs between different boundary regions. In this article we discuss a generalization to hyperthreads which can connect more than two boundary regions leading to a rich and diverse class of convex programs. By modeling the contributions of different species of hyperthreads to the EEs of perfect tensors we argue that this framework may be useful for helping us to begin to probe the multipartite entanglement of holographic systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this technology can potentially be used to understand holographic entropy cone inequalities and may provide an avenue to address issues of locking.

TI Entangling a Hole Spin with a Time-Bin Photon: A Waveguide Approach for
   Quantum Dot Sources of Multiphoton Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Deterministic sources of multiphoton entanglement are highly attractive for quantum information processing but are challenging to realize experimentally. In this Letter, we demonstrate a route toward a scaleable source of time-bin encoded Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and linear cluster states from a solid-state quantum dot embedded in a nanophotonic crystal waveguide. By utilizing a self-stabilizing double-pass interferometer, we measure a spin-photon Bell state with (67.8 +/- 0.4)% fidelity and devise steps for significant further improvements. By employing strict resonant excitation, we demonstrate a photon indistinguishability of (95.7 +/- 0.8)%, which is conducive to fusion of multiple cluster states for scaling up the technology and producing more general graph states.

TI Electron Phase Detection in Single Molecules by Interferometry
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Interferometry has underpinned a century of discoveries, ranging from the disproval of the ether theory to the detection of gravitational waves, offering insights into wave dynamics with unrivaled precision through the measurement of phase relationships. In electronics, phase-sensitive measurements can probe the nature of transmissive topological and quantum states, but are only possible using complex device structures in magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate electronic interferometry in a single-molecule device through the study of nonequilibrium Fano resonances. We show the phase difference between an electronic orbital and a coupled Fabry-Perot resonance are tunable through electric fields, and consequently it is possible to read out quantum information in the smallest materials, offering new avenues for the coherent manipulation down to single molecules.

SO MRS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Several hundred plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy synthesis experiments of GaN and ZnO thin film crystals were organized into data sets that correlate the operating parameters selected for growth to two figures of merit: a binary determination of surface morphology, and a continuous Bragg-Williams measure of lattice ordering (S2). Quantum as well as conventional supervised machine learning algorithms were optimized and trained on the data, enabling a comparison of their generalization performance. The models displaying the best generalization performance on each data set were subsequently used to predict each figure of merit across the ZnO and GaN processing spaces.

TI Dual Optical Cycling Centers Mounted on an Organic Scaffold: New
   Insights from Quantum Chemistry Calculations and Symmetry Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Molecules cooled to ultracold temperatures are desirable for applications in fundamental physics and quantum information science. However, cooling polyatomic molecules with more than six atoms has not yet been achieved. Building on the idea of an optical cycling center (OCC), a moiety supporting a set of localized and isolated electronic states within a polyatomic molecule, molecules with two OCCs (bi-OCCs) may afford better cooling efficiency by doubling the photon scattering rate. By using quantum chemistry calculations, we assess the extent of the coupling of the two OCCs with each other and the molecular scaffold. We show that promising coolable bi-OCC molecules can be proposed by following chemical design principles.

TI Bound entangled Bell diagonal states of unequal local dimensions, and
   their witnesses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bell diagonal states constitute a well -studied family of bipartite quantum states that arise naturally in various contexts in quantum information. In this paper we generalize the notion of Bell diagonal states to the case of unequal local dimensions and investigate their entanglement properties. We extend the family of entanglement criteria of Sarbicki et al. [Phys. Rev. A 101, 012341 (2020)] to non -Hermitian operator bases to construct entanglement witnesses for the class of generalized Bell diagonal states. We then show how to optimize the witnesses with respect to noise robustness. Finally, we construct bound entangled states that are detected by these witnesses, but not by the usual computable cross norm or realignment and de Vicente criteria.

TI Reformulating the Quantum Uncertainty Relation through Geometric
   Illustrations
SO ADVANCES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The uncertainty principle stands as a fundamental tenet within the realm of quantum theory. In this study, we embark on a reexamination of an emerging variant of the uncertainty relation within both pure and mixed quantum systems, leveraging a geometric elucidation. Subsequently, an enhancement to this relation is achieved by the incorporation of a surface angle denoted as theta, thereby transforming it from an inequality into an equation. Notably, this surface angle encapsulates the dynamics inherent in quantum state transitions. Complementing our analysis, a series of calculations are conducted, yielding results that offer an intuitive elucidation of the uncertainty relation across distinct quantum states. Consequently, this method bears significance as a pivotal visual insight within the domain of quantum information and measurement.

TI Black hole information recovery from gravitational waves
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We study the classical and quantum black hole information in gravitational waves from a black hole's history. We review the necessary concepts regarding quantum information in many-body systems to motivate information retrieval and content in gravitational waves. We then show the first step in an optimal information retrieval strategy is to search for information in gravitational waves, compared to searching for correlations in Hawking radiation. We argue a large portion of the information of the initial collapsing state may be in the gravitational waves. Using the Zerilli equation for particles falling radially into Schwarzschild black holes, we then describe a method to retrieve full classical information about infalling sources, including masses, infall times and angles.

TI Seven definitions of bipartite bound entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB An entangled state is bound entangled if one cannot combine any number of copies of the state to a maximally entangled state by using only local operations and classical communication. If one formalizes this notion of bound entanglement, one arrives immediately at four different definitions. In addition, at least three more definitions are commonly used in the literature, in particular in the very first paper on bound entanglement. Here we review critical distillation protocols and we examine how different results from quantum information theory interact in order to prove that all seven definitions are eventually equivalent. Our self-contained analysis unifies and extends previous results scattered in the literature and reveals details of the structure of bound entanglement.

AB We report on the characterization of heating rates and photoinduced electric charging on a micro fabricated surface ion trap with integrated waveguides. Microfabricated surface ion traps have received considerable attention as a quantum information platform due to their scalability and manufacturability. Here, we characterize the delivery of 435-nm light through waveguides and diffractive couplers to a single ytterbium ion in a compact trap. We measure an axial heating rate at room temperature of 0.78 1 0.05 q/ms and see no increase due to the presence of the waveguide. Furthermore, the electric field due to charging of the exposed dielectric outcoupler settles under normal operation after an initial shift. The frequency instability after settling is measured to be 0.9 kHz.

TI Topological superconductivity in a magnetic-texture coupled Josephson
   junction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topological superconductors are appealing building blocks for robust and reliable quantum information processing. Most platforms for engineering topological superconductivity rely on a combination of superconductors, materials with intrinsic strong spin-orbit coupling, and external magnetic fields, detrimental for superconductivity. We propose a setup where a conventional Josephson junction is linked via a magnetic-textured barrier. Antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic insulators with periodically arranged domains are compatible with our proposal, which does not require intrinsic spin-orbit or external magnetic fields. We find that the topological phase depends on the magnitude and period of the barrier magnetization. The superconducting phase controls the topological transition, which could be detected as a sharp suppression of the supercurrent across the junction.

SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In the past decade, strong coupling between light and matter has transitioned from a theoretical idea to an experimental reality. This represents a new field of quantum light-matter interaction, which makes the coupling strength comparable to the transition frequencies in the system. In addition, the achievement of multimode strong coupling has led to such applications as quantum information processing, lasers, and quantum sensors. This paper introduces the theoretical principle of multimode strong coupling based on surface plasmons and reviews the research related to the multimode interactions between light and matter. Perspectives on the future development of plasmonic multimode coupling are also discussed.

It can in particular be used as a witness to establish the degree of multiparticle entanglement in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we use polynomials of the density matrix to construct monotonically increasing lower bounds that converge to the QFI. Using randomized measurements we propose a protocol to accurately estimate these lower bounds in state-of-theart quantum technological platforms. We estimate the number of measurements needed to achieve a given accuracy and confidence level in the bounds, and present two examples of applications of the method in quantum systems made of coupled qubits and collective spins.

TI Approximate combinatorial optimization with Rydberg atoms: The barrier
   of interpretability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Analog quantum computing with Rydberg atoms is seen as an avenue to solve hard graph optimization problems, because they naturally encode the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on unit disk (UD) graphs, a problem that admits rather efficient approximation schemes on classical computers. Going beyond UD-MIS to address generic graphs requires embedding schemes, typically with chains of ancilla atoms, and an interpretation algorithm to map results back to the original problem. However, interpreting approximate solutions obtained with realistic quantum computers proves to be a difficult problem. As a case study, we evaluate the ability of two interpretation strategies to correct errors in the recently introduced crossing lattice embedding. We find that one strategy, based on finding the closest embedding solution, leads to very high qualities, albeit at an exponential cost. The second strategy, based on ignoring defective regions of the embedding graph, is polynomial in the graph size, but it leads to a degradation of the solution quality which is prohibitive under realistic assumptions on the defect generation. Moreover, more favorable defect scalings lead to a contradiction with well-known approximability conjectures. Therefore, it is unlikely that a scalable and generic improvement in solution quality can be achieved with Rydberg platforms-thus moving the focus to heuristic algorithms.

TI Electrostatic formation and charge stability of gate-defined double
   quantum dots in silicon MOS structures
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, we investigate how an array of isolated gate electrodes influences the formation and electrostatic behavior of double quantum dots at the silicon/silicon dioxide interface in a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure. We propose a modeling approach that predicts the formation of two coupled quantum dots by applying a combination of positive and negative voltages to the gates. Using a two-dimensional self-consistent solution of the Poisson and Schr & ouml;dinger equations, we compute the surface potential and charge distribution, obtaining results consistent with those in Schmidt A et al (2014 J. Appl. Phys. 116 044503). We further examine the effect of gate voltage variations on the charge stability diagram, demonstrating the sensitivity of dot size and charge density to small voltage changes. The capacitance matrix is extracted, and the resulting electrostatic energy calculations provide insights into the system's charge transport behavior, as reflected in the charge stability diagram. Our findings highlight the strong sensitivity of silicon-based spin qubits to gate voltages and reinforce the suitability of silicon MOS platforms for quantum computing applications, owing to their compatibility with standard CMOS fabrication technologies.

TI A Blockchain Copyright Protection Scheme Based on CP-ABE Scheme with
   Policy Update
SO SENSORS
AB Although the copyright protection schemes supported by blockchain have significantly changed traditional copyright data management, there are still some data security challenges that cannot be ignored, especially the secure access and controllable management of copyright data. Quantum computing attacks also pose a threat to its security. Targeting these issues, we design and propose a blockchain copyright protection scheme based on attribute-based encryption (ABE). In this scheme, the security advantages of blockchain technology are utilized to ensure the authenticity and integrity of copyright data. Based on lattice cryptography and the decision ring learning with errors (R-LWE) problem, a new ABE algorithm that supports searchable ciphertext and policy updates is designed. Then, we introduce it into the blockchain copyright protection scheme, which enables secure access to copyright data and fine-grained control. In addition, the lattice cryptography can strengthen this scheme against quantum attacks. Through security analysis, our scheme can prove to be secure against adaptive chosen keyword attacks, selective chosen plaintext attacks, and adaptive chosen policy attacks in the random oracle model. More importantly, the comparison analysis and experimental results show that our proposed approach has lower computation costs and storage costs. Therefore, our scheme has better security and performance in copyright protection.

TI Secure Multi-Party Quantum Summation Based on Quantum Homomorphic
   Encryption
SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Secure multi-party computation has been playing a fundamental role in terms of classical cryptography. Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) could compute the encrypted data without decryption. At present, most protocols use a semi-honest third party (TP) to protect participants' secrets. We use a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme instead of TP to protect the privacy of parties. Based on quantum homomorphic encryption, a secure multi-party quantum summation scheme is proposed in which N participants can delegate a server with strong quantum computing power to assist computation. By delegating the computation and key update processes to a server and a semi-honest key center, participants encrypt their private information data using Pauli operators to get the sum. Besides, the server can design and optimize the summation lines itself, and the correct results can be obtained even if the secret information is negative. The correctness analysis showed that the participants could correctly obtain the results of the calculation. The security analysis proves the scheme is resistant to both outside attack and participant's attack, and is secure against collusive attack by up to N-2 participants. From the theoretical point of view, our protocol can extend to other secure multi-party computing problems.

TI Spin-singlet to triplet Cooper pair converter interface
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Magnetic molecules deposited on a metallic substrate constitute a method to engineer the spin properties of the molecule and has potential application in low-power information storage devices. Here, the authors investigate a superconductor/molecule/normal metal heterostructure and demonstrate spin-ordering and proximity induced superconducting properties at the metallo-molecular interface.
   Combining magnetic and superconducting functionalities enables lower energy spin transfer and magnetic switching in quantum computing and information storage, owing to the dissipationless nature of quasi-particle mediated supercurrents. Here, we put forward a system where emergent spin-ordering and diffusion of Cooper pairs are achieved at a non-intrinsically magnetic nor superconducting metallo-molecular interface. Electron transport, magnetometry and low-energy muon spin rotation are used to probe time-reversal symmetry breaking in these structures. By comparing the Meissner expulsion in a system including a Cu/C-60 spin-converter interface to one without, we observe a paramagnetic contribution that can be explained due to the conversion of spin-singlet Cooper pair states into odd-frequency triplet states. These results demonstrate the potential of metallo-molecular interfaces to achieve singlet to triplet Cooper pair conversion, a capability not present in either metal or molecule separately that could be used in the generation and controlled diffusion of spin polarised dissipationless currents.

TI Holographic naturalness and topological phase transitions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
AB We show that our Universe lives in a topological and non-perturbative vacuum state full of a large amount of hidden quantum hairs, the hairons. We will discuss and elaborate on theoretical evidences that the quantum hairs are related to the gravitational topological winding number in vacuo. Thus, hairons are originated from topological degrees of freedom, holographically stored in the de Sitter area. The hierarchy of the Planck scale over the Cosmological Constant (CC) is understood as an effect of a Topological Memory intrinsically stored in the space-time geometry. Any UV quantum destabilizations of the CC are re-interpreted as Topological Phase Transitions, related to the disappearance of a large ensamble of topological hairs. This process is entropically suppressed, as a tunneling probability from the N- to the 0-states. Therefore, the tiny CC in our Universe is a manifestation of the rich topological structure of the space-time. In this portrait, a tiny neutrino mass can be generated by quantum gravity anomalies and accommodated into a large N-vacuum state. We will re-interpret the CC stabilization from the point of view of Topological Quantum Computing. An exponential degeneracy of topological hairs non-locally protects the space-time memory from quantum fluctuations as in Topological Quantum Computers.

TI Generalized concentratable entanglement via parallelized permutation
   tests
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information theory and technologies, but its quantification has been a persistent challenge. Concentratable entanglement (CE), introduced recently, can be estimated from just two copies of a quantum state. Here, we propose generalized concentratable entanglement (GCE), a broader class of multipartite entanglement measures naturally tied to quantum Tsallis entropies, and present a parallelized protocol for estimating GCE across multiple state copies. Increasing the number of copies yields an improved error bound in the presence of imperfections. We prove that GCE is a well-defined entanglement monotone and conjecture some new entropic inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate the concentration of entanglement into W states using three-state copies. Our results contribute to more robust and versatile characterizations of multipartite entanglement.

TI Characterizing and mitigating timing-noise- induced decoherence in
   single-electron sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Identifying and controlling decoherence in single -electron sources (SESs) is important for their applications in quantum information processing. The recent experiments with ultrashort electron pulses [J. D. Fletcher et al. , Nat. Commun. 10 , 5298 (2019)] demonstrate strong decoherence that cannot be caused by traditional mechanisms such as electron -electron or electron -phonon interactions. Here we propose timing noise as a universal model, consistent with existing experimental data, to explain strong decoherence of ultrafast SES pulses, without resorting to any specific microscopic mechanism for such decoherence. We also propose a protocol to filter out timing noise which works even in the presence of other decoherence effects, such as those present in, e.g., low -energy SESs.

TI Signature of Cascade Transitions between Interlayer Excitons in a Moire?
   Superlattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A moire superlattice in transition metal dichalcogenides heterostructure provides an exciting platform for studying strongly correlated electronics and excitonic physics, such as multiple interlayer exciton (IX) energy bands. However, the correlations between these IXs remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate the cascade transitions between IXs in a moire superlattice by performing energy-and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements in the MoS2/WSe2 heterostructure. Furthermore, we show that the lower-energy IX can be excited to higher-energy ones, facilitating IX population inversion. Our finding of cascade transitions between IXs contributes to the fundamental understanding of the IX dynamics in moire superlattices and may have important applications, such as in exciton condensate, quantum information protocols, and quantum cascade lasers.

TI Energetic Cost of Measurements Using Quantum, Coherent, and Thermal
   Light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum measurements are basic operations that play a critical role in the study and application of quantum information. We study how the use of quantum, coherent, and classical thermal states of light in a circuit quantum electrodynamics setup impacts the performance of quantum measurements, by comparing their respective measurement backaction and measurement signal to noise ratio per photon. In the strong dispersive limit, we find that thermal light is capable of performing quantum measurements with comparable efficiency to coherent light, both being outperformed by single-photon light. We then analyze the thermodynamic cost of each measurement scheme. We show that single-photon light shows an advantage in terms of energy cost per information gain, reaching the fundamental thermodynamic cost.

TI Overlap junctions for superconducting quantum electronics and amplifiers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Due to their unique properties as lossless, nonlinear circuit elements, Josephson junctions lie at the heart of superconducting quantum information processing. Previously, we demonstrated a two-layer, submicrometer-scale overlap junction fabrication process suitable for qubits with long coherence times. Here, we extend the overlap junction fabrication process to micrometer-scale junctions. This allows us to fabricate other superconducting quantum devices. For example, we demonstrate an overlap junction-based Josephson parametric amplifier that uses only two layers. This efficient fabrication process yields frequency-tunable devices with negligible insertion loss, a gain of
   similar to 30 dB, and quantum limited noise performance. Compared to other processes, the overlap junction allows for fabrication with minimal infrastructure, high yield, and state-of-the-art device performance.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Unsharp measurement is a unique type of measurement which provides a tradeoff between information gain and state disturbance. Such measurement is a crucial method in quantum theory and shows potential in various applications. We propose a device-independent scheme for certifying unsharp measurements with binary outcome in an efficient manner. Our scheme has low consumption of measurement resources and is robust against noise. In experiment, we demonstrate the certification of a typical kind of unsharp measurements. We achieve high fidelities above 0.9 when the strength of the unsharp measurement is less than 0.6 and get near unity fidelities in the low measurement strength range. Our scheme can be applied to enhance the feasibility and practicability of device-independent quantum information processing tasks.

This paper traces the early history of the Born rule 100 years ago, its generalization (essential for today's quantum optics and quantum information theory) to POVMs around 50 years ago, and a modern derivation from an intuitive definition of the notion of a quantum detector. Also discussed is the extent to which the various forms of the Born rule have, like any other statement in physics, a restricted domain of validity, which leads to problems when applied outside this domain.

TI Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a superconducting Szilard engine
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We implement a Szilard engine using a 2-bit logical unit consisting of inductively coupled quantum flux parametrons-Josephson-junction superconducting circuits with applications in both the classical and quantum information processing regimes. Detailed simulations show that it is highly thermodynamically efficient while functioning as a Maxwell demon-converting heat to work. The physically-calibrated design is targeted to direct experimental exploration. However, in realizing experiments variations in Josephson junction fabrication introduce asymmetries that result in energy inefficiency and low operational fidelity. We provide a design solution that mitigates these practical challenges. The resulting platform is ideally suited to probe the thermodynamic foundations of information processing devices far from equilibrium.

TI Correlated twin-photon generation in a silicon nitride loaded thin film
   PPLN waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photon-pair sources based on thin film lithium niobate on insulator technology have a great potential for integrated optical quantum information processing. We report on such a source of correlated twin-photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion in a silicon nitride (SiN) rib loaded thin film periodically poled lithium niobate (LN) waveguide. The generated correlated photon pairs have a wavelength centred at 1560 nm compatible with present telecom infrastructure, a large bandwidth (21 THz) and a brightness of similar to 2.5 x 10(5) pairs/s/mW/GHz. Using the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, we have also shown heralded single photon emission, achieving an autocorrelation g(H )((2))(0) ? 0.04.

TI The effect of curvature on local observables in quantum field theory
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.

TI A Simple Quantum Picture of the Relativistic Doppler Effect
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The relativistic Doppler effect comes from the fact that observers in different inertial reference frames experience space and time differently, while the speed of light always remains the same. Consequently, a wave packet of light exhibits different frequencies, wavelengths, and amplitudes. In this paper, we present a local approach to the relativistic Doppler effect based on relativity, spatial and time translational symmetries, and energy conservation. Afterwards, we investigate the implications of the relativistic Doppler effect for the quantum state transformations of wave packets of light and show that a local photon is a local photon at the same point in the spacetime diagram in all inertial frames.

TI Is Gravitational Entanglement Evidence for the Quantization of
   Spacetime?
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB Experiments witnessing the entanglement between two particles interacting only via the gravitational field have been proposed as a test whether gravity must be quantized. In the language of quantum information, a non-quantum gravitational force would be modeled by local operations with classical communication (LOCC), which cannot generate entanglement in an initially unentangled state. This idea is criticized as too constraining on possible alternatives to quantum gravity. We present a parametrized model for the gravitational interaction of quantum matter on a classical spacetime, inspired by the de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics, which results in entanglement and thereby provides an explicit counterexample to the claim that only a quantized gravitational field possesses this capability.

TI Trans-IR flows to black hole singularities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study analytic continuations of holographic renormalization group (RG) flows beyond their infrared (IR) fixed points. Such "trans-IR" flows are a natural framework for describing physics inside of black holes. First, we construct a monotonic holographic a-function which counts degrees of freedom along a trans-IR flow. Using this function, we argue that the degrees of freedom "thin out" and vanish when flowing to a trans-IR endpoint, represented by a Kasner singularity. We then recast well-studied quantum information probes in the language of trans-IR flows, finding that entanglement and complexity from volume generally fail to fully probe the trans-IR while 2-point correlations and complexity from action generally do so in a complementary manner.

TI Analysis and Design of a Non-Magnetic Bulk CMOS Passive Circulator Using
   25% Duty-Cycle Clock
SO MICROMACHINES
AB A circulator, which is a non-reciprocal device, is widely used in full-duplex systems, future communication and sensing networks, and quantum computing, and it is difficult to implement a passive topology on a chip. Based on switch-based spatio-temporal conductivity modulation, in this study, we design and implement a non-magnetic on-chip passive circulator operating at the Ku band in a 90-nm bulk CMOS technology using a 25% duty-cycle I/Q clock signal. With the virtue of the four-phase non-overlapping clock signal, the proposed circulator achieves a 3.9 dB transmitter (TX)-to-antenna (ANT) and a 4.0 dB ANT-to-receiver (RX) insertion loss with a 1-dB bandwidth of 2.7 GHz (21.4%). The TX-to-RX isolation is better than 17.2 dB, and the TX-to-ANT IIP3 and ANT-to-RX IIP3 are 19.7 dBm and 20.0 dBm, respectively, while occupying a die area of 1.55 mm x 1.15 mm. Although low-cost bulk CMOS technology is used, competitive isolation, linearity performance, and isolation bandwidth are achieved in the proposed design.

TI Investigation of bi-particle states in gate-array-controlled quantum-dot
   systems aided by machine learning techniques
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum computing architectures require an accurate and efficient description in terms of many-electron states. Recent implementations include quantum dot arrays, where the ground state of a multi q-bit system can be altered by voltages applied to the top gates. An extensive investigation concerning the spectra of the many-electron systems under multiple operation conditions set by external voltages typically requires a relatively large number of Hamiltonian diagonalizations, where the Coulomb interaction is considered in an exact manner. Instead of making exhaustive calculations using high throughput computing, we approach this problem by augmenting numerical diagonalizations with machine learning techniques designed to predict the many-electron eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. To this end, we employ and compare the results from linear regression methods such as multivariate least squares (MLS) as well as non-linear techniques based on kernel ridge regression (KRR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The input feature vectors are assembled from readily available information comprised from a binary representation of the potential and the strength of the Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, employing a linear classifier, we establish a rule for detecting a singlet-triplet transition which may arise for certain potential configurations.

TI QUBO formulations for training machine learning models
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Training machine learning models on classical computers is usually a time and compute intensive process. With Moore's law nearing its inevitable end and an ever-increasing demand for large-scale data analysis using machine learning, we must leverage non-conventional computing paradigms like quantum computing to train machine learning models efficiently. Adiabatic quantum computers can approximately solve NP-hard problems, such as the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), faster than classical computers. Since many machine learning problems are also NP-hard, we believe adiabatic quantum computers might be instrumental in training machine learning models efficiently in the post Moore's law era. In order to solve problems on adiabatic quantum computers, they must be formulated as QUBO problems, which is very challenging. In this paper, we formulate the training problems of three machine learning models-linear regression, support vector machine (SVM) and balanced k-means clustering-as QUBO problems, making them conducive to be trained on adiabatic quantum computers. We also analyze the computational complexities of our formulations and compare them to corresponding state-of-the-art classical approaches. We show that the time and space complexities of our formulations are better (in case of SVM and balanced k-means clustering) or equivalent (in case of linear regression) to their classical counterparts.

TI Exploring the Topological Properties of Magnetic Zintl Compounds
   Eu5M2X6: A First-Principles Study
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Topological materials have attracted widespread research interest due to their exceptional surface states and exotic transport properties. Integrating magnetism with topologically nontrivial properties in quantum materials can induce novel phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the quantum magnetoelectric effect, which are crucial for advancing electronic devices, quantum computing, and spintronics. Here, we explore the topological properties of a subset of stable intrinsic magnetic materials within the Zintl phase family, Eu5M2X6 (M = Ge, Sn, or Pb; X = As, Sb, or Bi). Notably, four materials (Eu5Ge2As6, Eu5Sn2Sb6, Eu5Sn2Bi6, and Eu5Pb2As6) exhibit an axion phase with a nontrivial topological invariant Z 4 = 2, suggesting the presence of topological surface states in their AFM configurations. Interestingly, we demonstrate the coexistence of a higher-order topological nature and an axion phase in the out-of-plane AFM configuration. In contrast, the in-plane AFM configuration hosts a gapless Dirac surface state. Moreover, the paramagnetic phase of seven materials exhibits a strong topological character with Z 2 = 1. Our study highlights the remarkable tunability of topological phases in Eu5M2X6 materials, enabling precise control over electronic and topological states through magnetic configurations.

TI A Reversible Perspective on Petri Nets and Event Structures
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC
AB Event structures have emerged as a foundational model for concurrent computation, explaining computational processes by outlining the events and the relationships that dictate their execution. They play a pivotal role in the study of key aspects of concurrent computation models, such as causality and independence, and have found applications across a broad range of languages and models, spanning realms like persistence, probabilities, and quantum computing. Recently, event structures have been extended to address reversibility, where computational processes can undo previous computations. In this context, reversible event structures provide abstract representations of processes capable of both forward and backward steps in a computation. Since their introduction, event structures have played a crucial role in bridging operational models, traditionally exemplified by Petri nets and process calculi, with denotational ones, i.e., algebraic domains. In this context, we revisit the standard connection between Petri nets and event structures under the lenses of reversibility. Specifically, we introduce a subset of contextual Petri nets, dubbed reversible causal nets, that precisely correspond to reversible prime event structures. The distinctive feature of reversible causal nets lies in deriving causality from inhibitor arcs, departing from the conventional dependence on the overlap between the postset and preset of transitions. In this way, we are able to operationally explain the full model of reversible prime event structures.

TI Electric Field Gradient Calculations for Ice VIII and IX Using
   Polarizable Embedding: A Comparative Study on Classical Computers and
   Quantum Simulators
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB We test the performance of the polarizable embedding variational quantum eigensolver self-consistent field (PE-VQE-SCF) model for computing electric field gradients with comparisons to conventional complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculations and experimental results. We compute quadrupole coupling constants for ice VIII and ice IX. We find close agreement of the quantum-computing PE-VQE-SCF results with the results from the classical PE-CASSCF calculations and with experiment. Furthermore, we observe that the inclusion of the environment is crucial for obtaining results that match the experimental data. The calculations for ice VIII are within the experimental uncertainty for both CASSCF and VQE-SCF for oxygen and lie close to the experimental value for ice IX as well. With the VQE-SCF, which is based on an adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored (ADAPT) ansatz, we find that the inclusion of the environment and the size of the different basis sets do not directly affect the gate counts. However, by including an explicit environment, the wavefunction and therefore the optimization problem become more complicated, which usually results in the need to include more operators from the operator pool, thereby increasing the depth of the circuit.

TI Fusion of Majorana bound states with mini-gate control in
   two-dimensional systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A hallmark of topological superconductivity is the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana bound states (MBS), its chargeless zero-energy emergent quasiparticles. The resulting fractionalization of a single electron, stored nonlocally as a two spatially-separated MBS, provides a powerful platform for implementing fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. However, despite intensive efforts, experimental support for MBS remains indirect and does not probe their non-Abelian statistics. Here we propose how to overcome this obstacle in mini-gate controlled planar Josephson junctions (JJs) and demonstrate non-Abelian statistics through MBS fusion, detected by charge sensing using a quantum point contact, based on dynamical simulations. The feasibility of preparing, manipulating, and fusing MBS in two-dimensional (2D) systems is supported in our experiments which demonstrate the gate control of topological transition and superconducting properties with five mini gates in InAs/Al-based JJs. While we focus on this well-established platform, where the topological superconductivity was already experimentally detected, our proposal to identify elusive non-Abelian statistics motivates also further MBS studies in other gate-controlled 2D systems.
   The current efforts to look for Majorana bound states (MBS) still cannot probe the hallmark property, the non-Abelian statistics. Here, the authors propose to realize non-Abelian statistics through MBS fusion in mini-gate controlled planar Josephson junctions.

Assuming that the base vectors are complex random variables with unit modular, we show that the LSD is the Mar & ccaron;enko-Pastur law. Comparing with the existing results, our limiting setting allows k to grow much faster than n. Consequently, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for Mar & ccaron;enko-Pastur law to serve as the LSD of our matrix model. Our approach is based on the moment method.

TI Hierarchy of Nonlinear Entanglement Dynamics for Continuous Variables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The entanglement produced by a bilinear Hamiltonian in continuous variables has been thoroughly studied and widely used. In contrast, the physics of entanglement resulting from nonlinear interaction described by partially degenerate high-order Hamiltonians remains unclear. Here, we derive a hierarchy of sufficient and necessary conditions for the positive-partial-transposition separability of bipartite nonlinear quantum states. The proposed criteria detect the nonpositive-partial-transposition inseparability of higher-order moments of states, which provides a systematic framework for the characterization of this kind of entanglement. Through numerical simulation of cubic and quartic Hamiltonians, we demonstrate the existence and competition of a hierarchy of entanglement witnesses, revealing the mechanism underlying such entanglement. Our results may provide a new direction in continuous variable quantum information processing.

TI Finding optimal Bell inequalities using the cone-projection technique
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bell inequalities are relevant for many problems in quantum information science, but finding them for many particles is computationally hard. Recently, a computationally feasible method called cone-projection technique has been developed to find all optimal Bell inequalities under some constraints, which may be given by some symmetry or other linear conditions. In this paper we extend this work in several directions. We use the method to generalize the 14422 inequality to three particles and a so-called guess-your-neighbor's-input inequality to four particles. Additionally, we find Bell inequalities for three particles that generalize the 13322 inequality and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality at the same time. We discuss the obtained inequalities in some detail and characterize their violation in quantum mechanics.

TI Investigation of Thermoelectric Properties in Altermagnet
   RuO2
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB An altermagnet, characterized by its distinctive magnetic properties, may hold potential applications in diverse fields such as magnetic materials, spintronics, data storage, and quantum computing. As a prototypical altermagnet, RuO2 exhibits spin polarization and demonstrates the advantageous characteristics of high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. These exceptional properties endow it with considerable promise in the emerging field of thermal spintronics. We studied the electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of RuO2; the constructed RuO2/TiO2/RuO2 all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junction (AFMTJ) exhibited thermally induced magnetoresistance (TIMR), reaching a maximum TIMR of 1756% at a temperature gradient of 5 K. Compared with prior studies on RuO2-based antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions, the novelty of this work lies in the thermally induced magnetoresistance based on its superior thermoelectric properties. In parallel structures, the spin-down current dominates the transmission spectrum, whereas in antiparallel structures, the spin-up current governs the transmission spectrum, underscoring the spin-polarized thermal transport. In addition, thermoelectric efficiency emphasizes the potential of RuO2 to link antiferromagnetic robustness with ferromagnetic spin functionality. These findings promote the development of efficient spintronic devices and spin-based storage technology for waste heat recovery and emphasize the role of spin splitting in zero-magnetization systems.

TI Driving a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier into chaos:
   Effects of a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB We tackled the numerical analysis of the dynamic response of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) by varying the driving parameters, with a focus on the pathways leading to chaotic behavior. By tuning the working conditions, we explore the broad spectrum of dynamical regimes accessible to JTWPAs, delineating the conditions under which transition to chaos occurs. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to junctions characterized by a non-sinusoidal current phase relation (CPR) and explore the consequences on the amplifier's performance. Through the study of gain characteristics, Poincar & eacute; sections, and Fourier spectra, we provide an in-depth understanding of how CPR nonlinearity and nonsinusoidality influence the operational effectiveness and stability of JTWPAs. This investigation offers insights into optimizing the device for enhanced performance and robustness against chaotic disruptions, in order to establish a framework for predicting and controlling JTWPA behavior in practical applications. In fact, we identify the regions in the parameter space where the input signal is maximally amplified without excessive noise or undesired harmonics. This effort paves the way for the development of devices with tailored dynamic responses and for advancements in quantum computing and precision measurement technologies, where stability and high fidelity are of paramount importance.

TI Nonlinear geometric phase coded ferroelectric nematic fluids for
   nonlinear soft-matter photonics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Simultaneous manipulation of multiple degrees of freedom of light lies at the heart of photonics. Nonlinear wavefront shaping offers an exceptional way to achieve this goal by converting incident light into beams of new frequencies with spatially varied phase, amplitude, and angular momenta. Nevertheless, the reconfigurable control over structured light fields for advanced multimode nonlinear photonics remains a grand challenge. Here, we propose the concept of nonlinear geometric phase in an emerging ferroelectric nematic fluid, of which the second-order nonlinear susceptibility carries spin-dependent nonlinearity phase. A case study with photopatterned q-plates demonstrates the generation of second-harmonic optical vortices with spin-locked topological charges by using cascaded linear and nonlinear optical spin-orbit interactions. Furthermore, we present the dynamic tunability of second-harmonic structured light through temperature, electric field, and twisted elastic force. The proposed strategy opens new avenues for reconfigurable nonlinear photonics, with potential applications in optical communications, quantum computing, high-resolution imaging, etc.
   The challenge of simultaneously manipulating multiple degrees of freedom of light is central to photonics due to its wide range of applications. Pan et al. introduce an approach using ferroelectric nematic fluids to achieve nonlinear wavefront shaping, offering reconfigurable control over structured light fields for advanced photonic applications.

TI Harnessing ferroic ordering in thin film devices for analog memory and
   neuromorphic computing applications down to deep cryogenic temperatures
SO FRONTIERS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The future computing beyond von Neumann era relies heavily on emerging devices that can extensively harness material and device physics to bring novel functionalities and can perform power-efficient and real time computing for artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. Additionally, brain-like computing demands large scale integration of synapses and neurons in practical circuits that requires the nanotechnology to support this hardware development, and all these should come at an affordable process complexity and cost to bring the solutions close to market rather soon. For bringing AI closer to quantum computing and space technologies, additional requirements are operation at cryogenic temperatures and radiation hardening. Considering all these requirements, nanoelectronic devices utilizing ferroic ordering has emerged as one promising alternative. The current review discusses the basic architectures of spintronic and ferroelectric devices for their integration in neuromorphic and analog memory applications, ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain structures and control of their dynamics for reliable multibit memory operation, synaptic and neuronal leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) functions, concluding with their large-scale integration possibilities, challenges and future research directions.

TI Faster Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms via Kronecker products
SO INFORMATION AND INFERENCE-A JOURNAL OF THE IMA
AB The Kronecker product is an important matrix operation with a wide range of applications in signal processing, graph theory, quantum computing and deep learning. In this work, we introduce a generalization of the fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss projection for embedding vectors with Kronecker product structure, the Kronecker fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform (KFJLT). The KFJLT reduces the embedding cost by an exponential factor of the standard fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform's cost when applied to vectors with Kronecker structure, by avoiding explicitly forming the full Kronecker products. We prove that this computational gain comes with only a small price in embedding power: consider a finite set of p points in a tensor product of d constituent Euclidean spaces circle times(1)(k=d) R-nk, and let N = Pi(d)(k=1) n(k). With high probability, a random KFJLT matrix of dimension m x N embeds the set of points up to multiplicative distortion (1 +/- epsilon) provided m greater than or similar to epsilon(-2) log(2d-1)(p) logN. We conclude by describing a direct application of the KFJLT to the efficient solution of large-scale Kronecker-structured least squares problems for fitting the CP tensor decomposition.

TI Scalar Product Lattice Computation for Efficient Privacy-Preserving
   Systems
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Privacy-preserving (PP) applications allow users to perform online daily actions without leaking sensitive information. The PP scalar product (PPSP) is one of the critical algorithms in many private applications. The state-of-the-art PPSP schemes use either computationally intensive homomorphic (public-key) encryption techniques, such as the Paillier encryption to achieve strong security (i.e., 128 b) or random masking technique to achieve high efficiency for low security. In this article, lattice structures have been exploited to develop an efficient PP system. The proposed scheme is not only efficient in computation as compared to the state-of-the-art but also provides a high degree of security against quantum attacks. Rigorous security and privacy analyses of the proposed scheme have been provided along with a concrete set of parameters to achieve 128-b and 256-b security. Performance analysis shows that the scheme is at least five orders faster than the Paillier schemes and at least twice as faster than the existing randomization technique at 128-b security. Also the proposed scheme requires six-time fewer data compared to the Paillier and randomization-based schemes for communications.

TI Thermal Characteristics of a Double Intra-Cavity Contact VCSEL for
   Cryogenic Optical Links
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Cryogenic computing systems, including quantum computers, cryo-CMOS and superconducting processors, necessitate efficient optical data links capable of operation at temperatures as low as 4 K. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers optimized for cryogenic conditions (cryo-VCSELs) present a promising high-bandwidth, efficient, and scalable technology for such optical interconnections. This study focuses on a comprehensive characterization of intra-cavity contact cryo-VCSELs, investigating laser behavior over an extensive temperature range from 6 K to 200 K. Accurate design of VCSEL structure for operation at low temperatures requires precise knowledge of cavity temperature at varying bias currents, to account for the shifts occurring in the resonance mode wavelength and gain spectra. To this end, the lasing wavelength shifts corresponding to different junction temperatures across multiple bias current levels were investigated. Additionally, a thermal analysis employing finite element simulation was conducted to accurately estimate actual cavity temperatures, ensuring informed detuning decisions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that double IC contact design significantly reduces series resistance and thermal load to cryostat compared to conventional conducting distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) configurations.

TI Elastomeric Cavity Opto-Mechanics: Low-Power Soliton Frequency Combs
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB An innovative, previously unexplored approach that leverages elastomeric membranes (EM) to develop a highly deformable cavity optomechanical resonator is proposed. This resonator generates multi soliton frequency combs (FCs) with low power consumption, a phenomenon of great interest in the realm of nonlinear light-matter interactions. This approach marks a breakthrough due to its streamlined simplicity, utilizing a single continuous-wave (CW) laser pump and an external acoustic wave. Matching the acoustic wave frequency with natural frequencies of the EM resonator accompanied by mechanical Kerr nonlinearities and dispersion give rise to the formation of mechanical FCs. The hyperelastic mechanical resonator and electromagnetic cavity resonance are parametrically coupled within the microwave frequency range, catalyzing the generation of mechanical FCs and their seamless transformation into optomechanical solitons within the optical domain with remarkable efficiency. Achieving stable pulse trains with a free spectral range ranging from 2 to 9 kHz using a few millimeter-sized cavity by supplying 2 to 4 mW pump power marks a pivotal advancement in chip-scale optomechanical resonators. This breakthrough holds transformative potential in domains such as quantum computing and spectroscopy. This method is fundamental to the creation of a mechanical Kerr medium, effectively bypassing the reliance on high mechanical quality-factors.

TI An Efficient CNN-Based Intrusion Detection System for IoT: Use Case
   Towards Cybersecurity
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB Today's environment demands that cybersecurity be given top priority because of the increase in cyberattacks and the development of quantum computing capabilities. Traditional security measures have relied on cryptographic techniques to safeguard information systems and networks. However, with the adaptation of artificial intelligence (AI), there is an opportunity to enhance cybersecurity through learning-based methods. IoT environments, in particular, work with lightweight systems that cannot handle the large data communications typically required by traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to find anomalous patterns, making it a challenging problem. A deep learning-based framework is proposed in this study with various optimizations for automatically detecting and classifying cyberattacks. These optimizations involve dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering. Additionally, the framework utilizes an enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) variant called Intelligent Intrusion Detection Network (IIDNet) to detect and classify attacks efficiently. Layer optimization at the architectural level is used to improve detection performance in IIDNet using a Learning-Based Intelligent Intrusion Detection (LBIID) algorithm. The experimental study conducted in this paper uses a benchmark dataset known as UNSW-NB15 and demonstrated that IIDNet achieves an outstanding accuracy of 95.47% while significantly reducing training time and excellent scalability, outperforming many existing intrusion detection models.

TI A quantum circuit to generate random numbers within a specific interval
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Random numbers are of vital importance in fields such as cyptography and scientific simulations. However, it is well known how difficult it is for classical computers to generate random numbers. This is not the case for quantum computers, which are able to genuinely generate random numbers thanks to the property of superposition and their counter-intuitive concept of measurement. However, despite the simplicity of designing a circuit that generates a random number between 0 and 2(N) - 1 (being N the number of available qubits), designing a quantum circuit to generate a number within a specific interval is far from trivial. This paper proposes a customizable circuit design to generate random numbers. The circuit is non-hardware dependent, it allows fault-tolerance, and it can be used by current quantum devices. Therefore, it is a valuable tool for all those quantum applications and algorithms that need to work with random numbers. Moreover, a comparator circuit has also been designed as part of this work. This comparator is the best currently available in the literature in terms of qubits, T-count, and T-depth. It is therefore a useful tool for any other circuit or algorithm where this operation is needed.

TI THE SYNTACTIC SIDE OF AUTONOMOUS CATEGORIES ENRICHED OVER GENERALISED
   METRIC SPACES
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Programs with a continuous state space or that interact with physical processes often require notions of equivalence going beyond the standard binary setting in which equivalence either holds or does not hold. In this paper we explore the idea of equivalence taking values in a quantale V, which covers the cases of (in)equations and (ultra)metric equations among others.Our main result is the introduction of a V-equational deductive system for linear lambda-calculus together with a proof that it is sound and complete. In fact we go further than this, by showing that linear lambda-theories based on this V-equational system form a category equivalent to a category of autonomous categories enriched over 'generalised metric spaces'. If we instantiate this result to inequations, we get an equivalence with autonomous categories enriched over partial orders. In the case of (ultra)metric equations, we get an equivalence with autonomous categories enriched over (ultra)metric spaces. Additionally, we show that this syntax-semantics correspondence extends to the affine setting.We use our results to develop examples of inequational and metric equational systems for higher-order programming in the setting of real-time, probabilistic, and quantum computing.

TI A review of recent advances in quantum-inspired metaheuristics
SO EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum-inspired metaheuristics emerged by combining the quantum mechanics principles with the metaheuristic algorithms concepts. These algorithms extend the diversity of the population, which is a primary key to proper global search and is guaranteed using the quantum bits' probabilistic representation. In this work, we aim to review recent quantum-inspired metaheuristics and to cover the merits of linking the quantum mechanics notions with optimization techniques and its multiplicity of applications in real-world problems and industry. Moreover, we reported the improvements and modifications of proposed algorithms and identified the scope's challenges. We gathered proposed algorithms of this scope between 2017 and 2022 and classified them based on the sources of inspiration. The source of inspiration for most quantum-inspired metaheuristics are the Genetic and Evolutionary algorithms, followed by swarm-based algorithms, and applications range from image processing to computer networks and even multidisciplinary fields such as flight control and structural design. The promising results of quantum-inspired metaheuristics give hope that more conventional algorithms can be combined with quantum mechanics principles in the future to tackle optimization problems in numerous disciplines.

TI Image-charge detection of the Rydberg transition of electrons on
   superfluid helium confined in a microchannel structure
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The image-charge detection provides a new direct method for the detection of the Rydberg transition of electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium. The interest in this method is motivated by the possibility to accomplish the spin state readout for a single trapped electron, thus opening a new pathway towards using electron spins on liquid helium for quantum computing. Here, we report on the image-charge detection of the Rydberg transition in a many-electron system confined in an array of 20 mu m wide and 4 mu m deep channels filled with superfluid helium. Such detection is made possible because of a significant enhancement of the image-charge signal due to close proximity of trapped electrons to the electrodes embedded in the microchannel structure. The transition frequency of electrons in the range of 400-500 GHz is highly controllable by the dc bias voltages applied to the device and is in a good agreement with our calculations. This work demonstrates that microchannel structures provide a suitable platform for electron manipulation and their quantum state detection, with a feasibility of scaling the detection method to a single electron.

TI Reflected entropy in AdS3/WCFT
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Reflected entropy is a newly proposed notion in quantum information. It has important implications in holography. In this work, we study the reflected entropy in the framework of the AdS(3)/WCFT correspondence. We determine the scaling dimensions and charges of various twist operators in non-Abelian orbifold WCFT by generalizing the uniformization map and taking into account of the charge conservation. This allows us to compute the reflected entropy, logarithmic negativity and odd entropy for two disjoint intervals in holographic WCFT. We find that the reflected entropy can be related holographically to the pre-entanglement wedge cross-section, which is given by the minimal distance between the benches in two swing surfaces.

TI Performance of coherent-state quantum target detection in the context of
   asymmetric hypothesis testing
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Due to the difficulties of implementing joint measurements, quantum illumination schemes that are based on signal-idler entanglement are difficult to implement in practice. For this reason, one may consider quantum-inspired designs of quantum lidar/radar where the input sources are semi-classical (coherent states) while retaining the quantum aspects of the detection. The performance of these designs could be studied in the context of asymmetric hypothesis testing by resorting to the quantum Stein's lemma. However, here the authors discuss that, for typical finite-size regimes, the second- and third-order expansions associated with this approach are not sufficient to prove quantum advantage.

TI Two-photon emission from uniform acceleration: Unruh excitation,
   radiative decay, and field entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We analyze the two-photon emission process of a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. Using second-order perturbation theory, we derive the exact final quantum state of the field and classify the emitted photon pairs according to their The RR and LL contributions produce photon pairs within a single Rindler wedge, while RL and LR emissions generate entanglement across wedges. The first emission arises from a counterrotating (Unruh) excitation, followed by a rotating Wigner-Weisskopf-like decay. Our results reveal how acceleration imprints entanglement and thermal structure on the radiation, offering new insight into quantum field theory in noninertial frames and potential applications in relativistic quantum information.

TI Red and infrared colour centres in zinc oxide epitaxial nanowires
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The integration of quantum emitters in semiconductor nanowires (NWs) offers appealing prospects for quantum optics and quantum information applications. Here, we study the visible emission from metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy zinc oxide NWs. We show that the NWs frequently incorporate native red-emitting colour centres at about 650 nm, in the form of small ensembles exhibiting photon antibunching, down to individual emitters. Additional post-treatment can yield modification of the number and the optical properties of the emitters, as well as generate near-infrared emitters (similar to 780 nm). Our results could be used for the realisation of guided quantum sources deterministically integrated in hybrid devices.

   singularities from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Yb:KGW oscillator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Femtosecond optical vortices with a phase singular point have diverse applications such as microscopic particles manipulation, special-structure micro-processing and quantum information. Raising the number of singularity points can provide additional dimensions of control. Here we report for what we believe is the first time the generation of femtosecond optical vortices with multiple (two and five) singularities directly from a laser oscillator. The average powers and pulse durations of the resulting vortex pulses are several hundred milliwatts and less than 300 fs, respectively. This work represents an innovate way for obtaining femtosecond multi vortices, opening the way to the further studies of optical vortex crystals and their applications.

TI High-fidelity and Robust Stimulated Raman Transition with
   Parameter-modulated Optimal Control
SO JETP LETTERS
AB High-fidelity and robust quantum control is essential for large-scale quantum information processing. The stimulated Raman transition that utilizes second-order coupling effect is a valuable and conventional technique for manipulating states in multi-level quantum systems, but its accuracy is limited by the driving-induced Stark shift. Here, we propose a new parameter-modulated method to effectively compensate the Stark-shift effect, so that we are able to realize high-fidelity and robust stimulated Raman transition with optimal control. Additionally, its robustness against different systematic errors can be further improved via optimization its average fidelity under these specific errors. Besides, our method has potential applications for high-fidelity and robust quantum control in high-order coupling scenarios.

TI Traveling discontinuity at the quantum butterfly front
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We formulate a kinetic theory of quantum information scrambling in the context of a paradigmatic model of interacting electrons in the vicinity of a superconducting phase transition. We carefully derive a set of coupled partial differential equations that effectively govern the dynamics of information spreading in generic dimensions. Their solutions show that scrambling propagates at the maximal speed set by the Fermi velocity. At early times, we find exponential growth at a rate set by the inelastic scattering. At late times, we find that scrambling is governed by shock-wave dynamics with traveling waves exhibiting a discontinuity at the boundary of the light cone. Notably, we find perfectly causal dynamics where the solutions do not spill outside of the light cone.

TI Generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states using multiport splitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Symmetric multiport splitters are versatile tools in optical quantum information processing. They can be used for studying multiparticle scattering, for studying distinguishability and mixedness, and also for the generation of multipartite entangled quantum states. Here, we show that N-photon N-mode Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be generated using symmetric multiport beam splitters. Varying the input states' internal de-grees of freedom and postselecting onto certain photon-number distributions allows the probabilistic generation of GHZ states with arbitrary photon numbers. We present two schemes, one for odd and one for even numbers of photons, to generate GHZ states using symmetric multiport splitters and compare them to a strategy utilizing a 2N-port network as well as the standard postselection method.

TI Remote asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering of magnons via a
   single pathway of Bogoliubov dissipation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a scheme to generate remote asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering of two magnon modes in a hybrid ferromagnet-superconductor system. In our scheme, the indirect coherent coupling between two distant magnons and a A-type superconducting atom is established via exchange of virtual photons in two dispersive cavities. As a consequence, the artificial atom acting as a reservoir can produce asymmetrical magnon-magnon steering via a single dissipation channel. Interestingly, we find that the steering directivity is determined by cooling either Bogoliubov mode selectively rather than increasing the extra noise as in conventional schemes. This provides a novel idea to prepare remote EPR steering in solid devices, which may find potential applications in quantum information processing.

In this work, endohedral fullerene molecules M@C-28 with different transition-metal cores were explored through systematic first-principles calcu-lations and spin dynamics analyses. Many of them have bias-tunable structure, stable magnetization, and sizable magnetic anisotropy energy. Furthermore, some of them may have spin-relaxation time up to several milliseconds for their quantum spin states at high temperature (similar to 10 K) after full consideration of spin-vibration couplings. Our results suggest that these M@C-28 provide a rich pool of single-molecule magnets for diverse applications.

AB Topologically protected states are important in realizing robust excitation transfer between distant sites in photonic lattices. Here, we propose an efficient gap-protected transfer of photons in a scalable one-dimensional waveguide array by transporting the topological defect state of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The separation between neighboring waveguides is designed according to the Jaynes-Cummings model. As a result, the zero-energy eigenstate is topologically protected from the extended states by a constant energy gap, which leads to a fast and robust excitation transfer. We also show that the transport can be further sped up by the quasi-periodic oscillation induced by the non-adiabatic effect. This scheme has potential applications in scalable quantum information processing.

TI Quantum valley pseudospin controlled by strain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Valleytronics, as an alternative to traditional electronics or spintronics, is based on the encoding of quantum information in pseudospin valley quantum numbers, rather than in charge or spin states. A key ingredient is the (optical) manipulation of valley states before loss of coherence, which can be as fast as 100 fs. Previous works have shown the possibility of valley state manipulation using external fields. Here, we propose uniaxial strain as a more flexible and robust scheme to manipulate the valley state through the breaking of the crystal symmetry and the concomitant lifting of the degeneracy of the 1s exciton energy. Our theory is corroborated by state-of-the-art numerical simulations in monolayer hBN and shows the possibility to control valley pseudospin at the attosecond timescale.

TI The end of space-time
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB We will highlight that despite there being various approaches to quantum gravity, there are universal approach-independent features of quantum gravity. The geometry of space-time becomes an emergent structure, which emerges from some purely quantum gravitational degrees of freedom. We argue that these quantum gravitational degrees of freedom can be best understood using quantum information theory. Various approaches to quantum gravity seem to suggest that quantum gravity could be a third quantized theory, and such a theory would not be defined in space-time, but rather in an abstract configuration space of fields. This supports the view that space-time geometry is not fundamental, thus effectively ending the space-time description of nature.

TI Mitigation of exchange crosstalk in dense quantum dot arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Coupled spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum computing and simulations of complex many-body phenomena. However, on the path of scale-up, crosstalk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe challenge. While crosstalk onto the quantum dot potentials is nowadays routinely compensated for, crosstalk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult to tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and implement a way of characterizing and compensating crosstalk on adjacent exchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge. We show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier crosstalk element without knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2 x 4 quantum dot array. We uncover striking differences among these crosstalk elements that can be linked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate the method by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same method should be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor platforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is present or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well-suited for automated tuning routines as we obtain a standout feature that can be easily tracked and directly returns the magnitude of the crosstalk.

TI Polymerization-with-assembly enables homogeneous circularly polarized
   luminescence structures
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) characteristics hold significant promise for a range of applications, including information security, three-dimensional (3D) display, quantum computing, and spintronics. Recent approaches combining QDs with chiral liquid crystal assemblies have demonstrated amplified CPL performance (specifically, luminescence dissymmetry factor, g(lum) > 10(-1)). However, the inherent fluidity and alignment sensitivity of chiral liquid crystals, along with QD aggregation and phase separation, continue to hinder the uniformity and long-term stability of these systems. In this work, we developed an in-situ helical co-assembly polymerization strategy that covalently incorporated InP-based QDs into chiral liquid crystal polymer templates, forming QD-based polymeric superhelical structures. We synthesized high-quality InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs and functionalized their surfaces with polymerizable groups to enable reactivity. By precisely tuning the photonic bandgap of the chiral liquid crystal polymers, we achieved chiral parented templates with high chiroptical activity overlapping full-visible-spectrum. Through covalent crosslinking with the QDs, a polymer network was formed, resulting in a maximum g(lum) of 1.0. This polymerization-with-assembly approach offers exceptionally flexible and precise control over both the composition and architecture of superhelical materials, paving the way for high-quality CPL materials with broad applications in advanced technologies.

TI Strain-tuning of spin anisotropy in single-layer phosphorene: insights
   from Elliott-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Materials and systems that exhibit persistent spin texture provide a platform for creating robust spin states that can be used in quantum computing, information storage, and other advanced technological applications. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a persistent spin texture can be obtained in monolayer phosphorene with broken space inversion symmetry and subjected to external strain. We calculate the effects of strain on the intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene and show that for the tensile strain of about 1.2% in the zigzag direction, conduction electrons near the Gamma point maintain a consistent and uniform spin polarization direction. The anisotropy of spin polarization is reflected in the parameters of an effective symmetry-adapted spin-orbit Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the calculated spin relaxation rates due to the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism display a giant anisotropy, up to 105, which is directly related to the discovered persistent spin texture. We also show that strain can reverse the anisotropy of spin mixing parameter b2 connected to the Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism. Our results suggest that spin texture in phosphorene can be modulated by strain, enabling its potential usage in spintronics.

TI Consciousness, Cognition and the Neuronal Cytoskeleton - A New Paradigm
   Needed in Neuroscience
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB Viewing the brain as a complex computer of simple neurons cannot account for consciousness nor essential features of cognition. Single cell organisms with no synapses perform purposeful intelligent functions using their cytoskeletal microtubules. A new paradigm is needed to view the brain as a scale-invariant hierarchy extending both upward from the level of neurons to larger and larger neuronal networks, but also downward, inward, to deeper, faster quantum and classical processes in cytoskeletal microtubules inside neurons. Evidence shows self-similar patterns of conductive resonances repeating in terahertz, gigahertz, megahertz, kilohertz and hertz frequency ranges in microtubules. These conductive resonances apparently originate in terahertz quantum dipole oscillations and optical interactions among pi electron resonance clouds of aromatic amino acid rings of tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine within each tubulin, the component subunit of microtubules, and the brain's most abundant protein. Evidence from cultured neuronal networks also now shows that gigahertz and megahertz oscillations in dendritic-somatic microtubules regulate specific firings of distal axonal branches, causally modulating membrane and synaptic activities. The brain should be viewed as a scale-invariant hierarchy, with quantum and classical processes critical to consciousness and cognition originating in microtubules inside neurons.

TI A new method of software vulnerability detection based on a quantum
   neural network
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the field of network security, although there has been related work on software vulnerability detection based on classic machine learning, detection ability is directly proportional to the scale of training data. A quantum neural network has been proven to solve the memory bottleneck problem of classical machine learning, so it has far-reaching prospects in the field of vulnerability detection. To fill the gap in this field, we propose a quantum neural network structure named QDENN for software vulnerability detection. This work is the first attempt to implement word embedding of vulnerability codes based on a quantum neural network, which proves the feasibility of a quantum neural network in the field of vulnerability detection. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed QDENN can effectively solve the inconsistent input length problem of quantum neural networks and the problem of batch processing with long sentences. Furthermore, it can give full play to the advantages of quantum computing and realize a vulnerability detection model at the cost of a small amount of measurement. Compared to other quantum neural networks, our proposed QDENN can achieve higher vulnerability detection accuracy. On the sub dataset with a small-scale interval, the model accuracy rate reaches 99%. On each subinterval data, the best average vulnerability detection accuracy of the model reaches 86.3%.

TI Nanosecond laser shock detonation of nanodiamonds: from laser-matter
   interaction to graphite-to-diamond phase transition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXTREME MANUFACTURING
AB Nanodiamonds (NDs) have been widely explored for applications in drug delivery, optical bioimaging, sensors, quantum computing, and others. Room-temperature nanomanufacturing of NDs in open air using confined laser shock detonation (CLSD) emerges as a novel manufacturing strategy for ND fabrication. However, the fundamental process mechanism remains unclear. This work investigates the underlying mechanisms responsible for nanomanufacturing of NDs during CLSD with a focus on the laser-matter interaction, the role of the confining effect, and the graphite-to-diamond transition. Specifically, a first-principles model is integrated with a molecular dynamics simulation to describe the laser-induced thermo-hydrodynamic phenomena and the graphite-to-diamond phase transition during CLSD. The simulation results elucidate the confining effect in determining the material's responses to laser irradiation in terms of the temporal and spatial evolutions of temperature, pressure, electron number density, and particle velocity. The integrated model demonstrates the capability of predicting the laser energy threshold for ND synthesis and the efficiency of ND nucleation under varying processing parameters. This research will provide significant insights into CLSD and advance this nanomanufacturing strategy for the fabrication of NDs and other high-temperature-high-pressure synthesized nanomaterials towards extensive applications.

TI An Effective Signcryption with Optimization Algorithm for IoT-enabled
   Secure Data Transmission
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Internet of Things (IoT) allows several low resources and controlled devices to interconnect, calculate processes and make decisions in the communication network. In the heterogeneous environment for IoT devices, several challenging issues such as energy, storage, efficiency, and security. The design of encryption techniques enables the transmission of the data in the IoT environment in a secured way. The proper selection of optimal keys helps to boost the encryption performance. With this motivation, the study presents a signcryption with quantum chaotic krill herd algorithm for secured data transmission (SCQCKH-SDT) in IoT environment. The proposed SCQCKHSDT technique aims to effectively encrypts the data by the use of optimal keys generated by the CQKH algorithm. The proposed SCQCKH-SDT technique initially employs the signcryption technique for the encryption of data. In order to optimize the secrecy, the optimal key generation process is carried out using Chaotic Krill Herd (CQKH) algorithm. The CQKH algorithm incorporates the concept of quantum computing and chaotic theory into the traditionalKHalgorithm. The performance validation of the SCQCKH-SDT technique is performed using benchmark dataset. An extensive comparative analysis reported the superior performance of the SCQCKH-SDT technique over the recent approaches.

TI The Cost of Improving the Precision of the Variational Quantum
   Eigensolver for Quantum Chemistry
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB New approaches into computational quantum chemistry can be developed through the use of quantum computing. While universal, fault-tolerant quantum computers are still not available, and we want to utilize today's noisy quantum processors. One of their flagship applications is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)-an algorithm for calculating the minimum energy of a physical Hamiltonian. In this study, we investigate how various types of errors affect the VQE and how to efficiently use the available resources to produce precise computational results. We utilize a simulator of a noisy quantum device, an exact statevector simulator, and physical quantum hardware to study the VQE algorithm for molecular hydrogen. We find that the optimal method of running the hybrid classical-quantum optimization is to: (i) allow some noise in intermediate energy evaluations, using fewer shots per step and fewer optimization iterations, but ensure a high final readout precision; (ii) emphasize efficient problem encoding and ansatz parametrization; and (iii) run all experiments within a short time-frame, avoiding parameter drift with time. Nevertheless, current publicly available quantum resources are still very noisy and scarce/expensive, and even when using them efficiently, it is quite difficult to perform trustworthy calculations of molecular energies.

TI Selective Area Growth of Josephson Junctions in Ladder-Like Structures
   of Bismuth Islands
SO SMALL METHODS
AB A distinguishing characteristic of Josephson junctions (JJs) is their nonlinear current-voltage response, which fulfills the requirements for superconducting quantum computing. Achieving atomically sharp interfaces between superconductors and weak links in JJs can realize the superconductivity proximity effect, advancing the investigation of intrinsic properties in unconventional superconductors and their potential applications. Here, a contamination-free approach to fabricating planar JJs using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is presented. The self-assembled Bi buffer layer forms a ladder-like framework on Si (111) 7 x 7 reconstructions, consisting of a wetting layer of Bi interspersed with Bi crystalline islands. Upon depositing Pb on this Bi buffer layer, Pb atoms dominantly nucleate on the Bi wetting layer, bypassing the Bi islands to form arrayed JJs. The selective area growth of Pb thin films is attributed to the higher nucleation densities for Pb on the Bi wetting layer compared to Bi crystalline islands. In situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal the superconducting correlations within the interior of junctions. The study establishes an in-vacuo deposition method for fabricating pristine JJs, facilitating the potential investigation of emergent superconducting phenomena in designed heterostructures.

AB To become a DHS/NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD), academic institutions must satisfy several specific Knowledge Units (KUs). How they achieve this is up to the institutions. In this case study, we follow the methodology of an earlier work to demonstrate how key parts of an electronic voting (E-voting)-oriented cybersecurity curriculum, proposed by Hostler et al. [4] in 2021, maps into the DHS/NSA KUs supporting the CAE-CD designation, from two aspects: E-voting principle based topics, i.e., from theory and a plug-and-play e-voting system's composing components, i.e., from practice. We grouped CAE-CD KUs into those required as prerequisites, closely related, related/supported, and not covered by the E-voting curriculum. Teachers can then choose which KUs they will use and teach using only the parts of the E-voting-oriented curriculum they deem relevant, and in a depth they find appropriate to their educational objectives, while meeting the requirements of the selected KUs. We conclude with a discussion of how LLMs (Large Language Models) and quantum computing might be added to the E-voting-oriented curriculum.

TI Multiple superconducting phases driven by pressure in the topological
   insulator GeSb4Te7
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Tuning superconductivity in topological materials by means of chemical substitution, electrostatic gating, or pressure is thought to be an effective route towards realizing topological superconductivity with their inherent Majorana fermions, the manipulation of which may form the basis for future topological quantum computing. It has recently been established that the pseudo-binary chalcogenides (ACh)m(Pn2Ch3)n (A = Ge, Mn, Pb, etc.; Pn = Sb or Bi; Ch = Te, Se) may host novel topological quantum states such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and topological axion states. Here we map out the phase diagram of one member in this series, the topological insulator candidate GeSb4Te7 up to pressures of -35 GPa, through a combination of electrical resistance measurements, Raman spectroscopy, as well as first-principles calculations. Three distinct superconducting phases emerge under the pressure above -11, -17, and -31 GPa, which are accompanied by concomitant structural transitions, evidenced from the changes in the Raman modes. The first-principles calculations validate the existence of a topological insulating state at ambient pressure and predict two possible structural transitions at 10 and 17 GPa, in agreement with the experimental observations. Overall, our results establish the GeSb4Te7 family of materials as a fertile arena for further exploring various topological phenomena, including topological phase transitions and putative topological superconductivity.

TI Perspectives for the Growth of Epitaxial 2D van der Waals Layers with an
   Emphasis on Ferromagnetic Metals for Spintronics
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Wafer scale epitaxial growth of 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures is of ultimate importance for applications. Using synthetic thin film methods is also important to realize 2D materials which do not exist in nature and cannot be grown in equilibrium in bulk form. In this work, the perspectives in wafer scale growth of 2D van der Waals metallic ferromagnets (FMs) and the combination with other structurally and chemically compatible materials are described to propose functional devices. The areas such as 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic pi-junctions for quantum computing, and all 2D magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) and spin orbit torque devices which can be used for spintronics are identified. It is foreseen that a new class of Janus materials which can be realized only by epitaxial synthetic methods can enhance the performance of spintronic devices. Finally, this work describes the perspectives to overcome the shortcomings of epitaxial techniques and layer transfer by proposing remote epitaxy for the detachment of 2D materials films from the substrate and the use of liquid substrates or liquid catalysts to achieve single crystalline 2D materials films over large areas on the wafer.

AB There is no escaping Internet's favorite buzzword for 2022: The Metaverse. Everyone is talking about it, but only a few know what it is or how it works. One can look at the Metaverse as a 3D model of the Internet where it is possible to spend your reality parallel to the virtual world. In broad terms, Metaverse can be explained as a virtual space, graphically rich, leaning towards verisimilitude where people can do all sorts of things they do in real-life such as shop, play, socialize, and party. The pandemic has accelerated innovations in the digital age. Looking beyond revolutions in telehealth, payments, remote monitoring, and secure data -sharing are other essential innovations in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and blockchain technology. The Metaverse is still in its nascent stage and evolving continuously, having a huge potential in health care to combine the technologies of AI, AR/VR, web 3.0, Internet of medical devices, and quantum computing, along with robotics to give a new direction to healthcare systems.

TI Computed Mass-Fragmentation Energy Profiles of Some Acetalized
   Monosaccharides for Identification in Mass Spectrometry
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Our study found that quantum calculations can differentiate fragmentation energies into isomeric structures with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as those of acetalized monosaccharides. It was justified by the good results that have been published in recent years on the discrimination of structural isomers and diastereomers by correlating the calculated mass energy fragmentation profiles with their mass spectra. Based on the quantitative structure-fragmentation relationship (QSFR), this technique compares the intensities of primary ions from the experimental spectrum using the mass energy profiles calculated for the candidate structures. Maximum fit is obtained for the true structure. For a preliminary assessment of the accuracy of the identification of some di-O-isopropylidene monosaccharide diastereomers, we used fragmentation enthalpies (Delta H-f) and Gibbs energies (Delta(f)G) as the energetic descriptors of fragmentation. Four quantum chemical methods were used: RM1, PM7, DFT Delta H-f and DFT Delta(f)G. The mass energy database shows that the differences between the profiles of the isomeric candidate structures could be large enough to be distinguished from each other. This database allows the optimization of energy descriptors and quantum computing methods that can ensure the correct identification of these isomers.

TI Fast Coherent Control of a Nitrogen-Vacancy-Center Spin Ensemble Using a
   KTaO3 Dielectric Resonator at Cryogenic Temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Microwave delivery to samples in a cryogenic environment can pose experimental challenges such as restricting optical access, space constraints, and heat generation. Moreover, existing solutions that overcome various experimental restrictions do not necessarily provide a large homogeneous oscillating magnetic field over macroscopic length scales, which is required for control of spin ensembles or fast gate operations in scaled-up quantum computing implementations. Here, we show fast and coherent control of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy spin ensemble by taking advantage of the high permittivity of a KTaO3 dielectric resonator at cryogenic temperatures. We achieve Rabi frequencies of up to 48 MHz, with a total power-to-field conversion factor C-p = 9.66 mT/W (approximately 191 MHz(Rabi)/root W). We use the nitrogen-vacancy-center spin ensemble to probe the quality factor, the coherent enhancement, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field inside the diamond sample. The key advantages of the dielectric resonator utilized in this work are ease of assembly, in situ tunability, a high magnetic field conversion efficiency, a low-volume footprint, and optical transparency. This makes KTaO3 dielectric resonators a promising platform for the delivery of microwave fields for the control of spins in various materials at cryogenic temperatures.

Here we extend previous work in modeling biological systems with fully scale-independent quantum information theoretic tools to develop a uniform, scalable representation of synapses, dendritic and axonal processes, neurons, and local networks of neurons. In this representation, hierarchies of quantum reference frames act as hierarchical active-inference systems. The resulting model enables specific predictions of correlations between synaptic activity, dendritic remodeling, and trophic reward. We summarize how the model may be generalized to nonneural cells and tissues in developmental and regenerative contexts.

TI New computable entanglement monotones from formal group theory
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We present a mathematical construction of new quantum information measures that generalize the notion of logarithmic negativity. Our approach is based on formal group theory. We shall prove that this family of generalized negativity functions, due their algebraic properties, is suitable for studying entanglement in many-body systems. Under mild hypotheses, the new measures are computable entanglement monotones. Also, they are composable: their evaluation over tensor products can be entirely computed in terms of the evaluations over each factor, by means of a specific group law. In principle, they might be useful to study separability and (in a future perspective) criticality of mixed states, complementing the role of Renyi's entanglement entropy in the discrimination of conformal sectors for pure states.

TI Precision Measurement of the Microwave Dielectric Loss of Sapphire in
   the Quantum Regime with Parts-per-Billion Sensitivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Dielectric loss is known to limit state-of-the-art superconducting qubit lifetimes. Recent experiments imply upper bounds on bulk dielectric loss tangents on the order of 100 parts per billion but because these inferences are drawn from fully fabricated devices with many loss channels, these experiments do not definitely implicate or exonerate the dielectric. To resolve this ambiguity, we devise a measurement method capable of separating and resolving bulk dielectric loss with a sensitivity at the level of 5 x 10-9. The method, which we call the dielectric dipper, involves the in situ insertion of a dielectric sample into a high-quality microwave cavity mode. Smoothly varying the participation of the sample in the cavity mode enables a differential measurement of the dielectric loss tangent of the sample. The dielectric dipper can probe the low-power behavior of dielectrics at cryogenic temperatures and does so without the need for any lithographic process, enabling controlled comparisons of substrate materials and processing techniques. We demonstrate the method with measurements of sapphire grown by edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) in comparison to high-grade sapphire grown by the heat-exchanger method (HEMEX). For EFG sapphire, we infer a bulk loss tangent of 63(8) x 10-9 and a substrate-air interface loss tangent of 15(3) x 10-4 (assuming a sample surface thickness of 3 nm). For a typical transmon, this bulk loss tangent would limit device quality factors to Q <= 20 x 106, suggesting that bulk loss is likely the dominant loss mechanism in the longest-lived transmons on sapphire. We also demonstrate this method on HEMEX sapphire and bound its bulk loss tangent to be less than 19(6) x 10-9. As this bound is about 3 times smaller than the bulk loss tangent of EFG sapphire, the use of HEMEX sapphire as a substrate would lift the bulk dielectric coherence limit of a typical transmon qubit to several milliseconds.

TI Spin resonance spectroscopy with an electron microscope
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Coherent spin resonance methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, have led to spectrally highly sensitive, non-invasive quantum imaging techniques. Here, we propose a pump-probe spin resonance spectroscopy approach, designed for electron microscopy, based on microwave pump fields and electron probes. We investigate how quantum spin systems couple to electron matter waves through their magnetic moments and how the resulting phase shifts can be utilized to gain information about the states and dynamics of these systems. Notably, state-of-the-art transmission electron microscopy provides the means to detect phase shifts almost as small as that due to a single electron spin. This could enable state-selective observation of spin dynamics on the nanoscale and indirect measurement of the environment of the examined spin systems, providing information, for example, on the atomic structure, local chemical composition and neighboring spins.

TI Scallop smoothing process for uniform gold coating on DRIE-etched
   surfaces in ion-trap chips
SO MICRO AND NANO SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB Semiconductor-based ion-trap chips are a leading platform for scalable quantum computing, but their performance is often limited by photogenerated charge carriers accumulating on exposed silicon surfaces. In this work, we present a comprehensive fabrication process for silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer-based ion-trap chips that addresses this challenge through optimized scallop smoothing and angled gold evaporation. We compare two scallop smoothing methods-frontside reactive ion etching (RIE) and backside RIE-and develop optimized process recipes for each using iterative test structures. Backside RIE smoothing achieves near-complete scallop removal with minimal undercut, while frontside RIE smoothing, although requiring tighter control to minimize undercut, remains viable when preservation of the buried oxide (BOX) layer is necessary. The use of SOI substrates ensures consistent device-layer thickness by leveraging the BOX as an etch-stop layer during backside deep RIE, further enhancing the reproducibility of smoothing. Finally, angled gold evaporation following the scallop smoothing process yields uniform gold coverage on vertical sidewalls without causing electrical shorts between electrode structures. Scanning electron microscopy confirms clean sidewalls and defect-free gold films. These process improvements suppress semiconductor charging, stabilize ion confinement, and enable reliable, high-fidelity quantum operations in quantum charge-coupled device architectures.

TI Advances in Numerical Modeling for Heat Transfer and Thermal Management:
   A Review of Computational Approaches and Environmental Impacts
SO ENERGIES
AB Advances in numerical modeling are essential for heat-transfer applications in electronics cooling, renewable energy, and sustainable construction. This review explores key methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the Finite Element Method (FEM), the Finite Volume Method (FVM), and multiphysics modeling, alongside emerging strategies such as Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), machine learning (ML), reduced-order modeling (ROM), and high-performance computing (HPC). While these techniques improve accuracy and efficiency, they also increase computational energy demands, contributing to a growing carbon footprint and sustainability concerns. Sustainable computing practices, including energy-efficient algorithms and renewable-powered data centers, offer potential solutions. Additionally, the increasing energy consumption in numerical modeling highlights the need for optimization strategies to mitigate environmental impact. Future directions point to quantum computing, adaptive models, and green computing as pathways to sustainable thermal management modeling. This study systematically reviews the latest advancements in numerical heat-transfer modeling and, for the first time, provides an in-depth exploration of the roles of computational energy optimization and green computing in thermal management. This review outlines a roadmap for efficient, environmentally responsible heat-transfer models to meet evolving demands.

TI Noise robust detection of quantum phase transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computing allows for the manipulation of highly correlated states whose properties quickly go beyond the capacity of any classical method to calculate. Thus one natural problem which could lend itself to quantum advantage is the study of ground-states of condensed matter models, and the transitions between them. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple "phaselike" regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using preoptimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in a simple, noise-robust manner which is agnostic to the method of ground state preparation. This work shows promising potential for near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, including avoided crossings and nonadiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.

TI Learning quantum properties from short-range correlations using
   multi-task networks
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Characterizing multipartite quantum systems is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics. The problem, however, becomes challenging when the system size is large and the properties of interest involve correlations among a large number of particles. Here we introduce a neural network model that can predict various quantum properties of many-body quantum states with constant correlation length, using only measurement data from a small number of neighboring sites. The model is based on the technique of multi-task learning, which we show to offer several advantages over traditional single-task approaches. Through numerical experiments, we show that multi-task learning can be applied to sufficiently regular states to predict global properties, like string order parameters, from the observation of short-range correlations, and to distinguish between quantum phases that cannot be distinguished by single-task networks. Remarkably, our model appears to be able to transfer information learnt from lower dimensional quantum systems to higher dimensional ones, and to make accurate predictions for Hamiltonians that were not seen in the training.
   Inferring quantum properties of many-body systems is both essential and challenging. Here the authors develop a neural network model that infers these properties from short-range measurements using a quantum-adapted multi-task learning approach.

TI Bendable non-silicon RISC-V microprocessor
SO NATURE
AB Semiconductors have already had a very profound effect on society, accelerating scientific research and driving greater connectivity. Future semiconductor hardware will open up new possibilities in quantum computing, artificial intelligence and edge computing, for applications such as cybersecurity and personalized healthcare. By nature of its ethos, open hardware provides opportunities for even greater collaboration and innovations across education, academic research and industry. Here we present Flex-RV, a 32-bit microprocessor based on an open RISC-V (ref.(1)) instruction set fabricated with indium gallium zinc oxide thin-film transistors(2) on a flexible polyimide substrate, enabling an ultralow-cost bendable microprocessor. Flex-RV also integrates a programmable machine learning (ML) hardware accelerator inside the microprocessor and demonstrates new instructions to extend the RISC-V instruction set to run ML workloads. It is implemented, fabricated and demonstrated to operate at 60kHz consuming less than 6mW power. Its functionality when assembled onto a flexible printed circuit board is validated while executing programs under flat and tight bending conditions, achieving no worse than 4.3% performance variation on average. Flex-RV pioneers an era of sub-dollar open standard non-silicon 32-bit microprocessors and will democratize access to computing and unlock emerging applications in wearables, healthcare devices and smart packaging.

TI Study on the relation between interface trap creation and MOSFET
   degradation under channel hot carrier stressing at cryogenic
   temperatures
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB In general, the degradation mechanism of MOSFETs has been discussed relating to hydrogen. For instance, interface traps are created due to the Si-H bond breakage at the MOS interface by hot (energetic) carriers under electrical stressing (e.g. channel hot carrier (CHC) and F-N stressing). In addition, it is also reported that hydrogen also relates to bulk trap creation. However, these hydrogen-related degradation mechanisms have been discussed based on the results within the conventional measurement temperature region. Recently, the reliabilities of MOSFETs at cryogenic temperatures have attracted much attention assuming that the electron devices are applied to quantum computing and space exploration. However, degradation mechanisms at cryogenic temperatures have yet to be fully clarified. In this paper, the degradations of MOSFETs under a CHC stressing in the temperature range of 77 K similar to 300 K are investigated. Especially, we focus on the degradation of MOSFETs due to interface trap creation. As a result, MOSFETs degrade more under cryogenic temperature compared to that near RT. This result implies the existence of an additional degradation mechanism at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Cryogenic Characterization of Low-Frequency Noise in 40-nm CMOS
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB This paper presents an extensive characterization of the low-frequency noise (LFN) at room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperature (4.2K) of 40-nm bulk-CMOS transistors. The noise is measured over a wide range of bias conditions and geometries to generate a comprehensive overview of LFN in this technology. While the RT results are in-line with the literature and the foundry models, the cryogenic behavior diverges in many aspects. These deviations include changes with respect to RT in magnitude and bias dependence that are conditional on transistor type and geometry, and even an additional systematic Lorentzian feature that is common among individual devices. Furthermore, we find the scaling of the average LFN with the area and its variability to be similar between RT and 4.2K, with the cryogenic scaling reported systematically for the first time. The findings suggest that, as no consistent decrease of LFN at lower temperatures is observed while the white noise is reduced, the impact of LFN for precision analog design at cryogenic temperatures gains a more predominant role.

TI On-Wafer Vector-Network-Analyzer Measurements at mK Temperatures

AB We describe a system for performing on-wafer vector-network-analyzer measurements from 100 MHz to 15 GHz at mK temperatures (i.e., less than 20 mK). We first demonstrate a camera-less probe positioning system and calibrate this system at 4.4 K. We then use this positioning system to perform both on-wafer scattering-parameter calibrations and on-wafer large-signal-network-analysis calibrations at 4.4 K and mK temperatures. The scattering-parameter calibrations were based on cooled printed transmission lines while the power and electrical phase calibrations required for on-wafer large-signal network analysis calibrations were performed by transferring room temperature coaxial power and electrical phase calibrations through long attenuated coaxial lines to our cryogenic on-wafer reference plane. Finally, we perform scattering-parameter measurements of common interconnect structures and measurements of modulated-signals typical of those used to control superconducting transmon qubits commonly used in quantum-computing applications. We also demonstrate our ability to predistort the modulated signals we created, and we assess the drift and stability of our system, which we found to be on the order of a few tenths of a dB and a few degrees.

TI Multidimensional hyperspin machine
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB From condensed matter to quantum chromodynamics, multidimensional spins are a fundamental paradigm, with a pivotal role in combinatorial optimization and machine learning. Machines formed by coupled parametric oscillators can simulate spin models, but only for Ising or low-dimensional spins. Currently, machines implementing arbitrary dimensions remain a challenge. Here, we introduce and validate a hyperspin machine to simulate multidimensional continuous spin models. We realize high-dimensional spins by pumping groups of parametric oscillators, and show that the hyperspin machine finds to a very good approximation the ground state of complex graphs. The hyperspin machine can interpolate between different dimensions by tuning the coupling topology, a strategy that we call "dimensional annealing". When interpolating between the XY and the Ising model, the dimensional annealing substantially increases the success probability compared to conventional Ising simulators. Hyperspin machines are a new computational model for combinatorial optimization. They can be realized by off-the-shelf hardware for ultrafast, large-scale applications in classical and quantum computing, condensed-matter physics, and fundamental studies.
   Spin simulators can solve many combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented by spin models, but they are limited to low-dimensional spins. Here the authors propose a simulator of multidimensional spins in arbitrary dimension, using a system of coupled parametric oscillators with a common pump.

TI THE COMPLEXITY OF APPROXIMATING THE COMPLEX-VALUED POTTS MODEL
SO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
AB We study the complexity of approximating the partition function of the q-state Potts model and the closely related Tutte polynomial for complex values of the underlying parameters. Apart from the classical connections with quantum computing and phase transitions in statistical physics, recent work in approximate counting has shown that the behaviour in the complex plane, and more precisely the location of zeros, is strongly connected with the complexity of the approximation problem, even for positive real-valued parameters. Previous work in the complex plane by Goldberg and Guo focused on q = 2, which corresponds to the case of the Ising model; for q > 2, the behaviour in the complex plane is not as well understood and most work applies only to the real-valued Tutte plane. Our main result is a complete classification of the complexity of the approximation problems for all non-real values of the parameters, by establishing #P-hardness results that apply even when restricted to planar graphs. Our techniques apply to all q >= 2 and further complement/refine previous results both for the Ising model and the Tutte plane, answering in particular a question raised by Bordewich, Freedman, Lov ' asz and Welsh in the context of quantum computations.

TI Scalable connectivity for Ising machines: Dense to sparse
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In recent years, hardware implementations of Ising machines have emerged as a viable alternative to quantum computing for solving hard optimization problems, among other applications. Unlike quantum hardware, dense connectivity can be achieved in classical systems; however, we show that dense connectivity leads to severe frequency slowdowns and interconnect congestion, scaling unfavorably with system size. As a scalable solution, we propose a systematic sparsification method for dense graphs by introducing copy nodes to limit the number of neighbors per graph node. In addition to solving interconnect congestion, this approach enables constant frequency scaling, where all spins in a network can be updated in constant time. Nonetheless, sparsification introduces new difficulties, such as constraint-breaking between copied spins and increased convergence times to solve optimization problems, especially if exact ground states are sought. Relaxing the exact-solution requirements, we find that the overheads in convergence times are milder. We demonstrate these ideas by designing probabilistic bit Ising machines using ASAP7 (a predictive 7-nm fin field-effect-transistor technology model) process design kits as well as field-programmable-gate-array-based implementations. Finally, we show how formulating problems in naturally sparse networks (e.g., by invertible logic) sidesteps challenges introduced by sparsification methods.

TI State of practice: Evaluating GPU performance of state vector and tensor
   network methods
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB The frontier of quantum computing (QC) simulation on classical hardware is quickly reaching the hard scalability limits for computational feasibility. Nonetheless, there is still a need to simulate large quantum systems classically, as the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are yet to be considered fault tolerant and performant enough in terms of operations per second. Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. This article investigates the limits of current state-of-the-art simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum subroutines, each in different configurations, with a special emphasis on performance. We perform both single process and distributed scaleability experiments on a supercomputer. We correlate the performance measures from such experiments with the metrics that characterise the benchmark circuits, identifying the main reasons behind the observed performance trends. Specifically, we perform distributed sliced tensor contractions, and we analyse the impact of pathfinding quality on contraction time, correlating both results with topological circuit characteristics. From our observations, given the structure of a quantum circuit and the number of qubits, we highlight how to select the best simulation strategy, demonstrating how preventive circuit analysis can guide and improve simulation performance by more than an order of magnitude.

TI SparseAuto: An Auto-scheduler for Sparse Tensor Computations using
   Recursive Loop Nest Restructuring
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Automated code generation and performance enhancements for sparse tensor algebra have become essential in many real-world applications, such as quantum computing, physical simulations, computational chemistry, and machine learning. General sparse tensor algebra compilers are not always versatile enough to generate asymptotically optimal code for sparse tensor contractions. This paper shows how to generate asymptotically better schedules for complex sparse tensor expressions using kernel fission and fusion. We present generalized loop restructuring transformations to reduce asymptotic time complexity and memory footprint.
   Furthermore, we present an auto-scheduler that uses a partially ordered set (poset)-based cost model that uses both time and auxiliary memory complexities to prune the search space of schedules. In addition, we highlight the use of Satisfiability Module Theory (SMT) solvers in sparse auto-schedulers to approximate the Pareto frontier of better schedules to the smallest number of possible schedules, with user-defined constraints available at compile-time. Finally, we show that our auto-scheduler can select better-performing schedules and generate code for them. Our results show that the auto-scheduler provided schedules achieve orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to the code generated by the Tensor Algebra Compiler (TACO) for several computations on different real-world tensors.

TI Pauli String Partitioning Algorithm with the Ising Model for
   Simultaneous Measurements
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB We propose an efficient algorithm for partitioning Pauli strings into subgroups, which can be simultaneously measured in a single quantum circuit. Our partitioning algorithm drastically reduces the total number of measurements in a variational quantum eigensolver for a quantum chemistry, one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. The algorithm is based on the Ising model optimization problem, which can be quickly solved using an Ising machine. We develop an algorithm that is applicable to problems with sizes larger than the maximum number of variables that an Ising machine can handle (nbit) through its iterative use. The algorithm has much better time complexity and solution optimality than other existing algorithms. We investigate the performance of the algorithm using the second-generation Digital Annealer, a high-performance Ising hardware, for up to 65535 Pauli strings using Hamiltonians of molecules and the full tomography of quantum states. We demonstrate a time complexity of O(N) for N <= nbit and O(N2) for N > nbit for the worst case, where N denotes the number of candidate Pauli strings and nbit = 8,192 in this study. The reduction factor, which is the number of Pauli strings divided by the number of obtained partitions, can be 200 at maximum.

TI Two-dimensional oxygen functionalized honeycomb and zigzag dumbbell
   silicene with robust Dirac cones
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Dumbbell-like structures are recently found to be energetically favored in group IV two-dimensional (2D) materials, exhibiting rich physics and many interesting properties. In this paper, using first-principles calculations, we have investigated the oxidized form of the hexagonal honeycomb (ODB-h) and zigzag dumbbell silicene (ODB-z). We confirm that both oxidization processes are energetically favorable, and their phonon spectra further demonstrate the dynamic stability. Contrary to the pristine dumbbell silicene structures (PDB-h and PDB-z silicene), these oxidized products ODB-h and ODB-z silicene are both semimetals with Dirac cones at the Fermi level. The Dirac cones of ODB-h and ODB-z silicene are at the K point and between Y and Gamma points respectively, possessing high Fermi velocities of 3.1 x 10(5) m s(-1) (ODB-h) and 2.9-3.4 x 10(5) m s(-1) (ODB-z). The origin of the Dirac cones is further explained by tight-binding models. The semimetallic properties of ODB-h and ODB-z are sensitive to compression due to the self-absorption effect, but quite robust against the tensile strain. These outstanding properties make oxidized dumbbell silicene a promising material for quantum computing and high-speed electronic devices.

TI Universal method to estimate quantum coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Coherence is a defining property of quantum theory that accounts for quantum advantage in many quantum information tasks. Although many coherence quantifiers were introduced in various contexts, the lack of efficient methods to estimate them restricts their applications. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing one universal method to provide measurable bounds for most current coherence quantifiers. Our method is motivated by the observation that the distance between the state of interest and its diagonal parts in the reference basis, which lies at the heart of the coherence quantifications, can be readily estimated by the disturbance effect and uncertainty of the reference measurement. Thus, our method of bounding coherence provides a feasible and broadly applicable avenue for detecting coherence, facilitating its further practical applications.

TI Simultaneous ground-state cooling of identical mechanical oscillators by
   Lyapunov control
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The simultaneous cooling of multiple mechanical oscillators in the cavity optomechanical system has aroused people's attention and may be applicable in the quantum information process. In this paper, a scheme to realize the simultaneous ground-state cooling of two identical mechanical oscillators is proposed, where the frequency of one of the oscillators is designed according to Lyapunov control. By this method, the dark mode can effectively couple with the bright mode so that the two identical oscillators can be simultaneously cooled to their ground state. Extending this scheme into multiple identical mechanical oscillators, we show that simultaneous cooling can also be achieved.

TI Quantum-limited resolution of partially coherent sources
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Discriminating two spatially separated sources is one of the most fundamental problems in imaging. Recent research based on quantum parameter estimation theory shows that the resolution limit of two incoherent point sources given by Rayleigh can be broken. However, in realistic optical systems, there often exists coherence in the imaging light field, and there have been efforts to analyze the optical resolution in the presence of partial coherence. Nevertheless, how the degree of coher-ence between two point sources affects the resolution has not been fully understood. Here, we analyze the quantum-limited resolution of two partially coherent point sources by explicitly relating the state after evolution through the optical systems to the coherence of the sources. In particular, we consider the situation in which coherence varies with the separation. We propose a feasible experiment scheme to realize the nearly optimal measurement, which adaptively chooses the binary spatial-mode demultiplexing measurement and direct imaging. Our results will have wide applications in imaging involving coherence of light.

We provide in-depth explanations of the basic concepts and elements of the framework of GPTs, and we also prove several wellknown results. The review is self-contained and it is meant to provide the reader with consistent introduction to GPTs. Our tools mainly include convex geometry, but we also introduce diagrammatic notation and we often express equations via diagrams.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI QCCP: a taskflow programming model for emerging computing scenario
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB As the demand for computing power continues to rise, it is difficult for a single type of computing device or architecture to satisfy the current situation. Diversity and heterogeneity are becoming more and more popular. Seamlessly integrating the realms of high performance computing and quantum computing, and harnessing their collective potential, has emerged as a consensus approach to effectively address the pressing need for increased computing power. In the emerging computing scenario, various different types of computing devices have super-heterogeneous characteristics, and there are significant differences in computational principles, programming models, parallelism, etc. Effectively harnessing these disparate resources and achieving a unified programming paradigm have become urgent imperatives. To address the above problems, this paper introduces QCCP, a taskflow programming model that enables efficient collaborative computing between classical computers and quantum computers. QCCP establishes a unified programming abstraction, shields the super-heterogeneous characteristics of the underlying network and hardware, and supports flexible scheduling for different computational backends. The experimental results indicate that QCCP can support the processing of hybrid classical-quantum applications with diverse program structures. In particular, QCCP reveals its immense potential and superiority in tackling real-world challenges, specifically in the realm of quantum circuit cutting and reconstruction.

TI Investigating the effect of two-state approaches on students'
   understanding of quantum measurement: A quasiexperimental field study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB With the rise of quantum computing, interest has grown in using two-state quantum systems (qubits) at the secondary level to foster students' conceptual understanding. Quantum measurement, in particular, is central to quantum theory and its accurate conceptualization by students is crucial for grasping fundamental quantum principles. However, instructional methods typically make use of different contexts (i.e., different two-state systems), significantly affecting students' conceptual development in quantum physics. In this paper, we report findings from a cluster-randomized field trial involving 181 students taught through three inquiry-based, two-state approaches: the which-path-encoded single-photon, the polarization, and the double-well potential approach. All three approaches supported students' conceptual development, yet students taught using photon polarization and the double-well potential significantly outperformed those participating in a course following the which-path-encoded single-photon approach. Our findings indicate that students participating in the which-path-encoded single-photon approach often retain mixed-thinking frameworks, whereas those taught with photon polarization or the double-well potential approaches were more likely to develop toward quantum thinking. Thus, our findings underpin how influential the choice of (experimental) context is on students' conceptual development (also) in quantum physics.

TI Revealing the loss mechanisms of a 3D superconducting microwave cavity
   for use in a dark matter search
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas including quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches. Their extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which makes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to understand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity, with a fundamental mode frequency of about 2.5123 GHz, and how they change as the cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We found that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature Tc, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below Tc results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift of the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the superconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin to dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 2.76x107 at 130 mK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature of the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.

TI Forensics System for Internet of Vehicles Based on Post-Quantum
   Blockchain
SO SENSORS
AB Internet of Vehicles (IoV) serves as the data support for intelligent transportation systems, and the information security of the IoV is of paramount importance. In view of the problems of centralized processing, easy information leakage, and weak anti-interference ability in traditional vehicle networking systems, this paper proposes a blockchain architecture suitable for IoV forensics scenario. By leveraging the decentralized, distributed storage and tamper-proof capabilities of blockchain, it solves the privacy protection and data security issues of the system. Considering the threat of quantum computing to the encryption technology in traditional blockchain, this paper integrates lattice cryptography and ring signatures into digital signature technology, achieving privacy protection and traceability of the signer's identity. To enhance the efficiency of lattice-based cryptographic algorithms, the DualRing technology is introduced, which reduces the computational time and storage consumption of ring signatures. Theoretical analysis has proved the correctness, anonymity, unlinkability, and traceability of the proposed scheme, which is applicable to the IoV forensics system. Simulation comparisons demonstrated that the proposed scheme significantly improves computational efficiency and reduces storage overhead. When the number of ring members is 256, the signature and verification times require only 65.76 ms and 21.46 ms, respectively.

TI Toward improved property prediction of 2D materials using many-body
   quantum Monte Carlo methods
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The field of 2D materials has grown dramatically in the past two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computing applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. To overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest, including graphene, phosphorene, MoS2, CrI3, VSe2, GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.

TI An Auto-Adjusting Hybrid Quantum Genetic Algorithm-Spectre platform for
   the multi-objective optimization of analog circuit sizing
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Among the phases constituting analog circuit design, circuit sizing is considered labor-intensive, formidable, and heavily experience-dependent due to its non-linearity. Asa result, design automation coupled with effective optimization techniques has arisen as a feasible candidate to address challenges with circuit design and satisfy the increasing need for high-performance circuits. Among evolutionary algorithms, the combination of the genetic algorithm (GA) and quantum computing techniques has yielded the hybrid quantum genetic algorithm (HQGA) which has proven to be an effective optimization method in many fields due to its convergence rate and near-optimal solutions. This paper introduces an upgraded version of HQGA we call the Auto-adjusting Hybrid Quantum Genetic Algorithm (AHQGA) which avoids premature convergence and improves convergence speed through the use of an additional best-fitness-based scheme for rotation angles. In particular, this work proposes the utility of AHQGA for the multi-objective optimization of analog circuit sizing, with the two- stage Miller-compensated operational amplifier (op-amp) used as a topological case study. Additionally, for an objective evaluation, optimization results by AHQGA are compared with those by HQGA with fixed rotation angles and classical GA.

TI Advanced Quantum Control With Ensemble Reinforcement Learning: A Case
   Study on the XY Spin Chain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This research presents an ensemble Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach that combines Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms to tackle quantum control problems. This research aims to use the complementary strengths of DQN and PPO algorithms to develop robust and adaptive control policies for noisy and uncertain quantum systems. We comprehensively analyse the proposed ensemble learning, including algorithmic details, implementation specifics, and experimental results. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble approach in learning control strategies for manipulating quantum systems towards a random target state. The results highlight the potential of ensemble RL techniques in addressing the challenges of quantum control tasks, such as system noise and dynamics. By integrating multiple RL agents within an ensemble framework, We aim to advance current developments in quantum control and create a new path for the development of adaptive control systems for quantum systems. The performance of the ensemble model is assessed against Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) and robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) to demonstrate its efficiency in highly challenging and noisy environments.

TI High-Frequency Trading in Bond Returns: A Comparison Across Alternative
   Methods and Fixed-Income Markets
SO COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB A properly performing and efficient bond market is widely considered important for the smooth functioning of trading systems in general. An important feature of the bond market for investors is its liquidity. High-frequency trading employs sophisticated algorithms to explore numerous markets, such as fixed-income markets. In this trading, transactions are processed more quickly, and the volume of trades rises significantly, improving liquidity in the bond market. This paper presents a comparison of neural networks, fuzzy logic, and quantum methodologies for predicting bond price movements through a high-frequency strategy in advanced and emerging countries. Our results indicate that, of the selected methods, QGA, DRCNN and DLNN-GA can correctly interpret the expected bond future price direction and rate changes satisfactorily, while QFuzzy tend to perform worse in forecasting the future direction of bond prices. Our work has a large potential impact on the possible directions of the strategy of algorithmic trading for investors and stakeholders in fixed-income markets and all methodologies proposed in this study could be great options policy to explore other financial markets.

TI Restoring and tailoring very high dimensional spatial entanglement of a
   biphoton state transmitted through a scattering medium
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB We report experimental results where a momentum entangled biphoton state with a Schmidt number of a few thousand is retrieved and manipulated when only one photon of the pair is transmitted through a thin scattering medium. For this purpose, the transmission matrix of the complex medium is first measured with a phase-shifting interferometry measurement method using a spatial light modulator (SLM) illuminated with a laser source. From this matrix, different phase masks are calculated and addressed on the SLM to spatially control the focusing of the laser through the complex medium. These same masks are used to manipulate the phase of the biphoton wave function transmitted by the thin diffuser in order to restore and control in the same way the momentum correlations between the far-field images of twin beams issued from strongly spatial-multi-mode spontaneous parametric down conversion.

TI Lost photon enhances superresolution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum imaging can beat classical resolution limits, imposed by the diffraction of light. In particular, it is known that one can reduce the image blurring and increase the achievable resolution by illuminating an object by entangled light and measuring coincidences of photons. If an root n-photon entangled state is used and the nth-order correlation function is measured, the point-spread function (PSF) effectively becomes root n times narrower relatively to classical coherent imaging. Quite surprisingly, measuring n-photon correlations is not the best choice if an n-photon entangled state is available. We show that for measuring (n - 1)-photon coincidences (thus, ignoring one of the available photons), PSF can be made even narrower. This observation paves a way for a strong conditional resolution enhancement by registering one of the photons outside the imaging area. We analyze the conditions necessary for the resolution increase and propose a practical scheme, suitable for observation and exploitation of the effect.

TI Magnon-induced electric polarization and magnon Nernst effects
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Magnons offer a promising path toward energy-efficient information transmission and the development of next-generation classical and quantum computing technologies. However, efficiently exciting, manipulating, and detecting magnons remains a critical need. We show that magnons, despite their charge-neutrality, can induce electric polarization through their spin and orbital moments. This effect is governed by system symmetry, magnon band hybridization, and interactions with other quasiparticles. We calculate the electric polarization induced by magnons in two-dimensional collinear honeycomb and noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs), showing that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction yields a finite net electric polarization. In NiPSe3, a collinear honeycomb AFM with Zigzag order, the induced net electric polarization is about three orders of magnitude greater than in MnPS3, a collinear honeycomb AFM with N & eacute;el phase. In the noncollinear AFM KFe3(OH)6(SO4)2, the net electric polarization can be tuned via magnon hybridization, which can be controlled by external magnetic fields. These findings reveal that electric fields could be used to both detect and manipulate magnons under certain conditions by leveraging their spin and orbital angular moment. They also suggest that the discovery or engineering of materials with substantial magnon orbital moments could enhance practical uses of magnons for future computing and information transmission applications.

TI Reinforcement learning in dynamic job shop scheduling: a comprehensive
   review of AI-driven approaches in modern manufacturing
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB Dynamic job shop scheduling (DJSS) demands real-time adaptability under unpredictable conditions such as sudden job arrivals, equipment failures, and fluctuating demands. Traditional scheduling approaches-though foundational-often fall short when faced with rapid changes and high computational complexity. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), especially reinforcement learning (RL), offer powerful alternatives by continuously refining scheduling policies through interaction with live shop-floor data. This review systematically examines AI-driven scheduling methods, highlighting how evolutionary heuristics, advanced machine learning, and RL-based algorithms each address the demands of modern manufacturing. Emphasis is placed on RL's capacity to cope with large state spaces, handle continuous or discrete control, and integrate domain heuristics for more robust real-time decision-making. Despite these advances, challenges remain in algorithm scalability, interpretability, data availability, and standardization of performance metrics. Future directions point toward leveraging digital twins, quantum computing, hybrid models, and explainable RL to ensure more resilient, transparent, and scalable solutions. By illuminating both current achievements and persistent gaps, this review underscores the transformative potential of RL in dynamic scheduling and highlights actionable steps for broader industrial adoption.

TI Code generation for classical-quantum software systems modeled in UML
SO SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
AB Quantum computing is gaining an increasing interest since it can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computing. Thus, many organizations are researching and launching investments for integrating quantum software into their existing systems. Software modernization (as based on Model-Driven Engineering) has been proposed to migrate from/to the so-called hybrid software systems, which integrate classical and quantum software. In that process, both, reverse engineering and restructuring phases, have already been investigated. However, forward engineering phase for generating hybrid source code from high-level design models has not yet been addressed. Thus, this research proposes a quantum code generation technique from extended UML design models. It consists of a set of Model-to-Text transformations (defined through Epsilon Generation Language) to generate both Python and Qiskit code, which, respectively, integrate classical and quantum code. The transformation has been validated through a multi-case study with 7 hybrid software systems modeled in UML, which demonstrated that the transformation is effective and efficient. The implication of this work is that the software modernization process for hybrid software systems can be completed by tackling forward engineering phase, and that Model-Driven Engineering can therefore globally facilitate industry adoption of quantum software.

TI Increased localization of Majorana modes in antiferromagnetic chains on
   superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems are a key platform for custom-designed topological supercon-ductors. Ideally, the ends of a one-dimensional MSH structure will host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs), the fundamental unit of topological quantum computing. However, some experiments with ferromagnetic (FM) chains show a more complicated picture. Due to tiny gap sizes and hence long coherence lengths, MZMs might hybridize and lose their topological protection. Recent experiments on a niobium surface have shown that both FM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains may be engineered, with the magnetic order depending on the crystallographic direction of the chain. While FM chains are well understood, AFM chains are less so. Here, we study two models inspired by the niobium surface: A minimal model to elucidate the general topological properties of AFM chains and an extended model to more closely simulate a real system by mimicking the proximity effect. We find that, in general, for AFM chains, the topological gap is larger than for FM ones, and thus, coherence lengths are shorter for AFM chains, yielding more pronounced localization of MZMs in these chains. While for some parameters AFM chains may be topologically trivial, we find in these cases that adding an adjacent chain can result in a nontrivial system, with a single MZM at each chain end.

TI Error-mitigated simulation of quantum many-body scars on quantum
   computers with pulse-level control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum many-body scars are an intriguing dynamical regime in which quantum systems exhibit coherent dy-namics and long-range correlations when prepared in certain initial states. We use this combination of coherence and many-body correlations to benchmark the performance of present-day quantum computing devices by using them to simulate the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic initial state in mixed-field Ising chains of up to 19 sites. In addition to calculating the dynamics of local observables, we also calculate the Loschmidt echo and a nontrivial unequal-time connected correlation function that witnesses long-range many-body correlations in the scarred dynamics. We find coherent dynamics to persist over up to 40 Trotter steps even in the presence of various sources of error. To obtain these results, we leverage a variety of error-mitigation techniques including noise tailoring, zero-noise extrapolation, dynamical decoupling, and physically motivated postselection of measurement results. Crucially, we also find that using pulse-level control to implement the Ising interaction yields a substantial improvement over the standard controlled -NOT-based compilation of this interaction. Our results demonstrate the power of error-mitigation techniques and pulse-level control to probe many-body coherence and correlation effects on present-day quantum hardware.

TI White-Light-Driven Resonant Emission from a Monolayer Semiconductor
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Resonant emission in photonic structures is very useful to construct all-photonic circuits for optical interconnects and quantum computing. Optical generation of most resonant-emitting modes in photonic structures is obtained by coherent pumping rather than incoherent illumination. Particularly, the development of white-light- or even solar-powered on-chip light sources remains challenging but is very attractive in view of the much facile availability of these incoherent excitation sources. Here, net resonant emission from a monolayer semiconductor is demonstrated under simulated solar illumination by a white-light-emitting diode. The device is formed by embedding a 2D gain medium into a planar microcavity on a silicon wafer, which is compatible with the prevailing on-chip photonic technology. Coherent and white-light excitation sources are, respectively, selected for optical pumping, where the output light in two cases exhibits well-consistent resonant wavelength, linewidth, polarization, location, and Gaussian-beam profile. The fundamental TEM00 mode behaves as a doublet emission, resulting from anisotropy-induced non-degenerate states with orthogonal polarizations. The extraordinary spectral flipping is attributed to the competitive interplay of resonant absorption and emission. This work paves a way toward white-light or solar-powered state-of-the-art photonic applications at the chip scale.

TI From Spins to Beams: Antenna Array Synthesis and Optimization Using
   Simulated Bifurcations of Parametric Oscillators
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
AB The rapid evolution of wireless communication, including the deployment of 5G and the advent of 6G networks, has dramatically increased the complexity of antenna system design and optimization. Traditional optimization methods often show limitations in addressing the high dimensionality, discrete configuration spaces, and complex scattering environments involved in advanced array design and beamforming. This article presents a versatile and novel framework for antenna array synthesis and optimization using simulated bifurcations (SBs) of nonlinear parametric oscillators. The discrete design variables are mapped onto spin states in the Ising model. The optimal antenna configuration is found by solving the ground-state solution of the Hamiltonian function through a quantum-inspired SB algorithm. We demonstrate the proposed work across a range of antenna synthesis scenarios. These include beamforming with conformal arrays, array thinning, maximization of beam efficiency (BE), and sum-rate optimization. The results highlight the potential of the proposed work for addressing complex optimization problems in antenna arrays.

AB To become a DHS/NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD), academic institutions must satisfy several specific Knowledge Units (KUs). How they achieve this is up to the institutions. In this case study, we follow the methodology of an earlier work to demonstrate how key parts of an electronic voting (E-voting)-oriented cybersecurity curriculum, proposed by Hostler et al. [4] in 2021, maps into the DHS/NSA KUs supporting the CAE-CD designation, from two aspects: E-voting principle based topics, i.e., from theory and a plug-and-play e-voting system's composing components, i.e., from practice. We grouped CAE-CD KUs into those required as prerequisites, closely related, related/supported, and not covered by the E-voting curriculum. Teachers can then choose which KUs they will use and teach using only the parts of the E-voting-oriented curriculum they deem relevant, and in a depth they find appropriate to their educational objectives, while meeting the requirements of the selected KUs. We conclude with a discussion of how LLMs (Large Language Models) and quantum computing might be added to the E-voting-oriented curriculum.

TI Superconductivity and quantum oscillations in single crystals of the
   compensated semimetal CaSb2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Bulk superconductivity in a topological semimetal is a first step towards realizing topological superconductors, which can host Majorana fermions allowing us to achieve quantum computing. Here, we report superconductivity and compensation of electrons and holes in single crystals of the nodal-line semimetal CaSb2. We characterize the superconducting state and find that Cooper pairs have moderate-weak coupling, and the superconducting transition in specific heat down to 0.22 K deviates from that of a BCS superconductor. The nonsaturating magnetoresistance and electron-hole compensation at low temperature are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing nodal-line features. Furthermore, we observe de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations consistent with a small Fermi surface in the semimetallic state of CaSb2. Our DFT calculations show that the two electron bands crossing the Fermi level are associated with Sb1 zig-zag chains, while the hole band is associated with Sb2 zig-zag chains. The Sb1 zig-zag chains form a distorted square net, which may relate the MSb2 family to the well-known MSbTe square net semimetals. Realization of superconductivity and a compensated semimetal state in single crystals of CaSb2 establishes the diantimonide family as a candidate class of materials for achieving topological superconductivity.

TI Exploiting random phenomena in magnetic materials for data security,
   logics, and neuromorphic computing: Challenges and prospects
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Random phenomena are ubiquitous in magnetism. They include, for example: the random orientation of magnetization in an assembly of non-interacting isotropic magnets; arbitrary maze domain patterns in magnetic multilayers with out-of-plane anisotropy, random polarization, and chirality of an array of magnetic vortices; or Brownian skyrmion motion, among others. Usually, for memory applications, randomness needs to be avoided to reduce noise and enhance stability and endurance. However, these uncontrolled magnetic effects, especially when incorporated in magnetic random-access memories, offer a wide range of new opportunities in, e.g., stochastic computing, the generation of true random numbers, or physical unclonable functions for data security. Partial control of randomness leads to tunable probabilistic bits, which are of interest for neuromorphic computing and for new logic paradigms, as a first step toward quantum computing. In this Perspective, we present and analyze typical materials that exhibit stochastic magnetic phenomena and we show some examples of emerging applications. The current challenges in terms of material development, as well as new strategies to tune stochasticity, enhance energy efficiency, and improve operation speeds are discussed, aiming to provide new prospects and opportunities in this compelling research field.

We review the potential effect for the next four years or so on the aspirations of an academic career versus more realistic career goals. We urge people in mid-career about the need to reassess previous goals. We stress the need for students or researchers to acquire technical skills in high-performance computing (HPC), data analytics, artificial intelligence, and/or visualization along with a broad set of technical skills in applied computer science and mathematics. We give advice about hot prospects in several areas that have great potential for advancement in the coming decade, such as visualization, deep learning, quantum computing and information, and cloud computing, all of which lie within the aegis of HPC. Our forecast is that the pandemic will significantly reshape the job landscape and career paths for both young and established researchers and we discuss bluntly the dire situation facing junior people in geosciences in the aftermath of the pandemic around the world until 2024.

TI Three-Dimensional Integration of Functional Oxides and Crystalline
   Silicon for Optical Neuromorphic Computing Using Nanometer-Scale Oxygen
   Scavenging Barriers
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Dating to the first reports of epitaxial oxide deposition on Si(001), the integration of complex oxides on silicon has been a fast-moving area of research, where fundamental materials physics is intimately connected to tremendous technological promise in such areas as integrated electronics, optical neuromorphic and quantum computing, and sensing, to name a few. Despite their great promise, devices relying on the co-integration of silicon and epitaxial perovskites are typically limited to basic, planar geometries due to practical issues with their fabrication. In this paper, we overcome these long-standing challenges by developing a method to produce high-quality Si(001)/TMO/Si(001)/TMO heterostructures without wafer bonding, resulting in the straightforward three-dimensional integration of functional complex oxides and active Si(001) layers into a technologically relevant platform that is needed for on-chip hardware implementations of neuromorphic computing based on optical signals. We present detailed structural and chemical characterization of our heterostructures and discuss generalized design rules for their fabrication. Our results exponentially expand the universe of practically achievable TMO-based integrated devices and push this promising class of materials closer to realizing their hill technological potential.

TI Cryogenic Neuromorphic Synaptic Behavior in 180 nm Silicon Transistors
   for Emerging Computing Systems
SO ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), there is an increasing demand for high-speed, energy-efficient hardware capable of running complex machine learning algorithms. Traditional hardware is constrained by the Von Neumann bottleneck, resulting in high power consumption and slower speeds. Inspired by the human brain, bio-mimicking the dynamic synaptic plasticity of the biological synapse using synaptic transistors is crucial to building the next generation of high-performance computing hardware-based neural networks. This study investigates neuromorphic behavior in 180 nm bulk complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices at 4 K, emphasizing memory properties and synapse-like characteristics. These findings position bulk CMOS as a scalable, energy-efficient, cryo-compatible platform for neuromorphic and quantum computing use. Gated-pulse measurements are used to study potentiation-depression behavior by quantifying conductance changes as functions of pulse amplitude and width. These results closely resemble biological synaptic plasticity, laying the groundwork for integrating cryo-CMOS technology into neuromorphic computing. The work reported here aims to work toward the development of hybrid computational systems by bridging the gap between conventional CMOS devices and emerging cryogenic technology, offering new avenues for scalable, energy-efficient, and high-performance cryogenic neuromorphic technologies.

TI Artificial Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism of Bulk van der Waals
   VSe2
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Originating from spin and orbital motion, van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetism has emerged as a significant platform to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism in reduced dimensions, including quantum computing, sensing, and data storage. However, currently, available vdW ferromagnetic materials can be achieved with mechanical exfoliation and low-temperature operation, which completely limits the monolithic integration of vdW ferromagnets with other functional materials. Nonetheless, the direct synthesis of room-temperature vdW ferromagnets has not been achieved commercially, owing to the imprecise control of the layer-by-layer growth, high-temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, herein, an artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform has been reported, which activates the nano-crystallization and its corresponding ferromagnetism in bulk VSe2 via Ar + H2S plasma sulfurization. Sweeping the magnetic field, vdW ferromagnetism has been spatially resolved, which experimentally correlates with magnetization reversal behavior and domain pinning effects. Furthermore, nano-crystallization of VSe2 is clearly validated with transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and selected area diffraction analysis. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform can artificially inject the ferromagnetism in bulk vdW VSe2, which has not been possible previously.

AB This study investigates the effectiveness of quantum methods in tackling the cubic knapsack problem (CKP). The CKP is not only NP-hard but also extremely difficult to solve in practice. Benchmark instances of small size (including some with only 60 items) remain unsolved to proven optimality. We solve the CKP using the latest Digital Annealer (DA) prototype, an extended Ising machine available through the Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization (QIIO) service on Fujitsu's Kozuchi platform. Specifically, we propose two formulations: a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) and a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. The latter is derived by reformulating the HUBO model into an equivalent quadratic form. These models are solved using the QIIO solver and compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms, a greedy heuristic, and two mixed integer programs. Additionally, we introduce a postprocessing heuristic to ensure the feasibility of solutions generated by the DA solver, as within short time limits, it does not always produce feasible solutions. Computational experiments are conducted on instances with up to 200 items and varying densities of nonzero objective coefficients. The results indicate that the HUBO formulation is highly competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving the best new solutions for six large instances.

TI Photoionization of Rydberg atoms in optical lattices
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We develop a formalism for photoionization (PI) and potential energy curves (PECs) of Rydberg atoms in ponderomotive optical lattices and apply it to examples covering several regimes of the optical-lattice depth. The effect of lattice-induced PI on Rydberg-atom lifetime ranges from noticeable to highly dominant when compared with natural decay. The PI behavior is governed by the generally rapid decrease of the PI cross sections as a function of angular-momentum (l), lattice-induced l-mixing across the optical-lattice PECs, and interference of PI transition amplitudes from the lattice-mixed into free-electron states. In GHz-deep lattices, l-mixing leads to a rich PEC structure, and the significant low-l PI cross sections are distributed over many lattice-mixed Rydberg states. In lattices less than several tens-of-MHz deep, atoms on low-l PECs are essentially l-mixing-free and maintain large PI rates, while atoms on high-l PECs trend towards being PI-free. Characterization of PI in GHz-deep Rydberg-atom lattices may be beneficial for optical control and quantum-state manipulation of Rydberg atoms, while data on PI in shallower lattices are potentially useful in high-precision spectroscopy and quantum-computing applications of lattice-confined Rydberg atoms.

TI New signatures of the spin gap in quantum point contacts
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB One dimensional semiconductor systems with strong spin-orbit interaction are both of fundamental interest and have potential applications to topological quantum computing. Applying a magnetic field can open a spin gap, a pre-requisite for Majorana zero modes. The spin gap is predicted to manifest as a field dependent dip on the first 1D conductance plateau. However, disorder and interaction effects make identifying spin gap signatures challenging. Here we study experimentally and numerically the 1D channel in a series of low disorder p-type GaAs quantum point contacts, where spin-orbit and hole-hole interactions are strong. We demonstrate an alternative signature for probing spin gaps, which is insensitive to disorder, based on the linear and non-linear response to the orientation of the applied magnetic field, and extract a spin-orbit gap Delta E approximate to 500 mu eV. This approach could enable one-dimensional hole systems to be developed as a scalable and reproducible platform for topological quantum applications. In one-dimensional systems, the combination of a strong spin-orbit interaction and an applied magnetic field can give rise to a spin-gap, however experimental identification is difficult. Here, the authors present new signatures for the spin-gap, and verify these experimentally in hole QPCs.

TI A Quantum-Hybrid Framework for Urban Environmental Forecasting
   Integrating Advanced AI and Geospatial Simulation
SO SENSORS
AB The paper examines the development of forecasting and modeling technologies for environmental processes using classical and quantum data analysis methods. The main focus is on the integration of deep neural networks and classical algorithms, such as AutoARIMA and BATS, with quantum approaches to improve the accuracy of forecasting environmental parameters. The research is aimed at solving key problems in environmental monitoring, particularly insufficient forecast accuracy and the complexity of processing small data with high discretization. We developed the concept of an adaptive system for predicting environmental conditions in urban agglomerations. Hybrid forecasting methods were proposed, which include the integration of quantum layers in LSTM, Transformer, ARIMA, and other models. Approaches to spatial interpolation of environmental data and the creation of an interactive air pollution simulator based on the A* algorithm and the Gaussian kernel were considered. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The practical significance lies in the possibility of using the developed models for operational monitoring and forecasting of environmental threats. The results of the work can be applied in environmental information systems to increase the accuracy of forecasts and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.

TI Linkable Ring Signature for Privacy Protection in Blockchain-Enabled
   IIoT
SO SENSORS
AB The blockchain-enabled industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) faces security threats such as quantum computing attacks and privacy disclosure. Targeting these issues, in this study, we design a new lattice-based linkable ring signature (LRS) scheme, which is used to achieve privacy protection for the blockchain-enabled IIoT. Firstly, by using the trapdoor generation algorithm on the lattice and the rejection sampling lemma, we propose a new lattice-based LRS scheme with anti-quantum security and anonymity. Then, we introduce it into blockchain. Through the stealth address and key image technologies, we construct a privacy protection scheme for blockchain in the IIoT, and this LRS scheme protects identity privacy for users through anonymous blockchain. In addition, it also can resist the double spending attack with the linking user's signature. Lastly, we provide a security analysis, and it is proven that our ring signature scheme satisfies correctness, anonymity, unforgeability and linkability. Compared with other similar schemes, the performance simulation indicates that our scheme's public key and signature are shorter in size, and its computation overhead and time cost are lower. Consequently, our novel LRS scheme is more secure and practical, which provides privacy protection and anti-quantum security for the blockchain-enabled IIoT.

The CN includes an Infrastructure Spoke plus 10 thematic Spokes and, besides building a world-class supercomputing cloud infrastructure, its purpose is to carry out research in computing and high-performance data analysis, identified as strategic areas for any future scientific and technological development. In particular the Spoke 2, dedicated to "Fundamental Research & Space Economy", addresses the challenge of increasing computational needs in the field of theoretical and experimental collider physics, astroparticle physics and gravitational waves investigation. In this contribution, after a short overview of the CN and of the planned infrastructure, the status and perspectives of the Spoke 2 are presented. Furthermore, two use-cases are illustrated: i) data-driven identification of signals in different experimental apparatuses (in particular a Liquid Argon TPC and a ground array of water-Cherenkov detectors) using self-supervised neural networks; ii) analysis of satellite imagery for the segmentation of wildfire-affected areas, employing supervised deep learning techniques on the data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and the Copernicus Emergency Management Service.

TI Denoising of imaginary time response functions with Hankel projections
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Imaginary-time response functions of finite-temperature quantum systems are often obtained with methods that exhibit stochastic or systematic errors. Reducing these errors comes at a large computational cost-in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the reduction of noise by a factor of two incurs a simulation cost of a factor of four. In this paper, we relate certain imaginary-time response functions to an inner product on the space of linear operators on Fock space. We then show that data with noise typically does not respect the positive definiteness of its associated Gramian. The Gramian has the structure of a Hankel matrix. As a method for denoising noisy data, we introduce an alternating projection algorithm that finds the closest positive definite Hankel matrix consistent with noisy data. We test our methodology at the example of fermion Green's functions for continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo data and show remarkable improvements of the error, reducing noise by a factor of up to 20 in practical examples. We argue that Hankel projections should be used whenever finite-temperature imaginary-time data of response functions with errors is analyzed, be it in the context of quantum Monte Carlo, quantum computing, or in approximate semianalytic methodologies.

TI RANet: a custom CNN model and quanvolutional neural network for the
   automated detection of rheumatoid arthritis in hand thermal images
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease which affects the small joints. Early prediction of RA is necessary for the treatment and management of the disease. The current work presents a deep learning and quantum computing-based automated diagnostic approach for RA in hand thermal imaging. The study's goals are (i) to develop a custom RANet model and compare its performance with the pretrained models and quanvolutional neural network (QNN) to distinguish between the healthy subjects and RA patients, (ii) To validate the performance of the custom model using feature selection method and classification using machine learning (ML) classifiers. The present study developed a custom RANet model and employed pre-trained models such as ResNet101V2, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet201 to classify the RA patients and normal subjects. The deep features extracted from the RA Net model are fed into the ML classifiers after the feature selection process. The RANet model, RA Net+ SVM, and QNN model produced an accuracy of 95%, 97% and 93.33% respectively in the classification of healthy groups and RA patients. The developed RANet and QNN models based on thermal imaging could be employed as an accurate automated diagnostic tool to differentiate between the RA and control groups.

TI Leveraging Knapsack QAOA Approach for Optimal Electric Vehicle Charging
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The electric vehicle (EV) industry is currently afflicted with inefficient charging systems. Considering the growing adoption of EVs, optimization strategies for efficient charging, and overcoming constraints such as a limited power supply and extended waiting times, are required. The knapsack algorithm, a classical technique that maximizes value and capacity, enables efficient utilization of the limited available power supply while minimizing waiting times in EV charging scenarios. However, the knapsack problem is notoriously NP-hard, making it difficult to find efficient solutions classically. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA) to resolve the EV charging problem using a knapsack-based formulation. By incorporating a knapsack problem constraint into the QAOA, we overcome the limitations of the original QAOA method and provide a potential solution to the knapsack problem. We extensively evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of our approach in finding optimal EV charging solutions in both noise-free simulations and noisy real quantum devices. The proposed method achieves impressive approximation ratios of up to 100% and 50% in noise-free and noisy environments, respectively.

TI Surface-Driven Evolution of the Anomalous Hall Effect in Magnetic
   Topological Insulator MnBi2Te4 Thin Films
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Understanding the effects of the interfacial modification to the functional properties of magnetic topological insulator thin films is crucial for developing novel technological applications from spintronics to quantum computing. Here, a large electronic and magnetic response is reported to be induced in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 by controlling the propagation of surface oxidation. It is shown that the formation of the surface oxide layer is confined to the top 1-2 unit cells but drives large changes in the overall magnetic response. Specifically, a dramatic reversal of the sign of the anomalous Hall effect is observed to be driven by finite thickness magnetism, which indicates that the film splits into distinct magnetic layers each with a unique electronic signature. These data reveal a delicate dependence of the overall magnetic and electronic response of MnBi2Te4 on the stoichiometry of the top layers. This study suggests that perturbations resulting from surface oxidation may play a non-trivial role in the stabilization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in this system and that understanding targeted modifications to the surface may open new routes for engineering novel topological and magnetic responses in this fascinating material.

TI Asymmetric Confidentiality in Blockchain Embedded Smart Grids in Galois
   Field
SO FRONTIERS IN BLOCKCHAIN
AB Economic growth requires a sharp increase in the utilization of energy. Since the initial mechanical era, financial development has been driven by industrialization, transportation, and, most important of all, electrification, majorly achieved by petroleum product ignition. This way of development has had malicious and abusive aftershocks on the environment since the beginning. Smart grids are an idea to slightly diminish the burden on our Mother Nature, but this idea is getting tainted by the anticipation of ferocious technophiles who may try to get the grid down using quantum computers in the coming years. Thus, security becomes one of the major concerns for the smart grid. In this paper, we propose a quantum-resistant framework for associating smart grids and blockchain embedded with a permutation-substitution-based public-key cryptosystem in Galois Field to prevent unauthorized access and perform encryption of the private information of the user and consumption statistics. Permutation and substitution are performed to increase the diffusion and confusion of the data. Expenditures are quantified from the dissipation particulars, and the payment of electricity bill is performed using our blockchain wallet. The prediction model of consumption data is generated availing stochastic gradient descent. The performance analysis of the proposed cryptosystem is predicted after a simulation of the smart grid.

TI Imaging Nucleation and Propagation of Pinned Domains in Few-Layer
   Fe5-x GeTe2
SO ACS NANO
AB Engineering nontrivial spin textures in magnetic van der Waals materials is highly desirable for spintronic applications based on hybrid heterostructures. The recent observation of labyrinth and bubble domains in the near room-temperature ferromagnet Fe5-xGeTe2 down to a bilayer thickness was thus a significant advancement toward van der Waals-based many-body physics. However, the physical mechanism responsible for stabilizing these domains remains unclear and requires further investigation. Here, we combine cryogenic scanning diamond quantum magnetometry and field reversal techniques to elucidate the high-field propagation and nucleation of bubble domains in trilayer Fe5-xGeTe2. We provide evidence of pinning-induced nucleation of magnetic bubbles and further show an unexpectedly high layer-dependent coercive field. These measurements can be easily extended to a wide range of magnetic materials to provide valuable nanoscale insight into domain processes critical for spintronic applications.

TI A Superalgebra Within: Representations of Lightest Standard Model
   Particles Form a Z25-Graded Algebra
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB It is demonstrated how a set of particle representations, familiar from the Standard Model, collectively form a superalgebra. Those representations mirroring the behavior of the Standard Model's gauge bosons, and three generations of fermions, are each included in this algebra, with exception only to those irreps involving the top quark. This superalgebra is isomorphic to the Euclidean Jordan algebra of 16 x16 hermitian matrices,H-16(C) , and is generated by division algebras. The division algebraic substructure enables a natural factorization between internal and spacetime symmetries. It also allows for the definition of a Z(2)(5) grading on the algebra. Those internal symmetries respecting this substructure are found to be & sfr;& ufr;(3)(C)circle plus & sfr;& ufr;(2)(L)circle plus & ufr;(1)(Y), in addition to four iterations of & ufr;(1). For spatial symmetries, one finds multiple copies of & sfr;& ofr;(3). Given its Jordan algebraic foundation, and its apparent non-relativistic character, the model may supply a bridge between particle physics and quantum computing. We close by describing how this article fits into the larger picture of Bott Periodic Particle Physics, first introduced in 2014, 2021, 2023.

TI Quantum-Classical Optimization for Efficient Genomic Data Transmission
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper presents a hybrid computational architecture for efficient and robust digital transmission inspired by helical genetic structures. The proposed system integrates advanced modulation schemes, such as multi-pulse-position modulation (MPPM), high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and chirp spread spectrum (CSS), along with Reed-Solomon error correction and quantum-assisted search, to optimize performance in noisy and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) optical environments, including VLC channels modeled with log-normal fading. Through mathematical modeling and simulation, we demonstrate that the number of helical transmissions required for genome-scale data can be drastically reduced-up to 95% when using parallel strands and high-order modulation. The trade-off between redundancy, spectral efficiency, and error resilience is quantified across several configurations. Furthermore, we compare classical genetic algorithms and Grover's quantum search algorithm, highlighting the potential of quantum computing in accelerating decision-making and data encoding. These results contribute to the field of operations research and supply chain communication by offering a scalable, energy-efficient framework for data transmission in distributed systems, such as logistics networks, smart sensing platforms, and industrial monitoring systems. The proposed architecture aligns with the goals of advanced computational modeling and optimization in engineering and operations management.

TI High-fidelity sub-microsecond single-shot electron spin readout above
   3.5 K
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electron spin qubits in semiconductors are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing due to their small size, long coherence and manufacturability. Typically, readout in spin qubits has been performed using energy-selective readout with extremely high fidelities up to 99.95% at millikelvin temperatures. Despite achieving record fidelities at low electron temperatures, the readout time remains on the order of 1 mu s to 100 mu s and comparable to the electron spin coherence time. In this paper we show that by engineering the location of two multi-donor quantum dot qubits with nanoscale precision we can demonstrate latched parity readout of two electrons in only 175 ns integration time with a fidelity of 99.44% at mK temperatures. Most importantly we show that this combination of strong confinement potential present in donor qubits with precision engineering of the tunnel rates allows us to operate our compact sensors at the highest temperatures recorded so far (3.7 K) using latched spin readout, giving a maximum fidelity of 97.87% in 1.5 mu s. Our results demonstrate a clear performance improvement of state preparation and measurement using donor systems and offer the real possibility for operation of the surface-code using electron spins in semiconductor qubits.

TI Self-organized topological insulator heterostructures via eutectic
   solidification of Bi2Te3-Te
SO NEXT MATERIALS
AB Topological insulators (TI) are generating increasing interest as a new state of matter and due to the potential use of topologically-protected gapless surface states in spintronic devices and quantum computing. However, challenges such as high sensitivity to the atmosphere, the low surface-to-volume ratio, and the need for various material junctions currently limit their application. Here, a novel, natural and simple approach to the fabrication of volumetric TI heterostructures that can overcome these core challenges is presented, using the example of a Bi2Te3-Te eutectic composite. The proposed method based on directional solidification of eutectic composites, enables the formation of ensembles of parallel TI-other material heterojunctions through a self-organization process. It also offers control over the heterostructures' dimensions/refinement. Electron microscopy techniques show that the heterostructure exhibits a lamellar/layered microstructure with atomically smooth Bi2Te3||Te interfaces. Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy experiments confirm the existence of metallic surface states, while Kelvin probe force microscopy depicts the formed p-n junctions. The new degrees of freedom offered here, such as control of heterojunction chemical composition, packing density, and available fabrication techniques, may facilitate large-scale customized printing of topological devices.

TI Tailoring polymer-based magnetoelectrics for spintronics: Evaluating the
   converse effect
SO APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY
AB The use of magnetoelectric (ME) materials for switching the magnetization of spintronic devices is highly attractive due to their non-volatility, high-speed operation, reduced heat dissipation, miniaturization, and scalability. Despite the numerous reports in the literature focusing on the evaluation of the direct ME effect, the converse effect remains inadequately studied. This gap in knowledge significantly hinders the development of spintronic-related applications such as magnetic sensors, data storage, quantum computing and environmental/ biomedical monitoring devices. Here we demonstrate tailored mechanical (Young's Modulus of 1.2 GPa), electric (conductivity of 3.4 x 10- 6 S.m- 1, dielectric constant (17 at 1 kHz), magnetic saturation (approximate to 9 emu.g- 1); piezoelectric (|d33|=11 pC.N- 1), and converse ME (coefficient up to 6.3 mOe.cm.V- 1: the highest reported on 1-3 composites and just 1 order of magnitude lower than the ones exhibited by ceramic-based 2-2 composites) properties obtained on P(VDF-TrFE)-based composites produced by solvent-casting. This work not only assesses various magnetostrictive fillers, such as CoFe2O4, Fe3O4, and NdFeB, but also advances the development of lowvoltage-induced converse magnetoelectric (ME) coupling essential for high-performance spintronic device applications.

TI Reduction of the molecular hamiltonian matrix using quantum community
   detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum chemistry is interested in calculating ground and excited states of molecular systems by solving the electronic Schrodinger equation. The exact numerical solution of this equation, frequently represented as an eigenvalue problem, remains unfeasible for most molecules and requires approximate methods. In this paper we introduce the use of Quantum Community Detection performed using the D-Wave quantum annealer to reduce the molecular Hamiltonian matrix in Slater determinant basis without chemical knowledge. Given a molecule represented by a matrix of Slater determinants, the connectivity between Slater determinants (as off-diagonal elements) is viewed as a graph adjacency matrix for determining multiple communities based on modularity maximization. A gauge metric based on perturbation theory is used to determine the lowest energy cluster. This cluster or sub-matrix of Slater determinants is used to calculate approximate ground state and excited state energies within chemical accuracy. The details of this method are described along with demonstrating its performance across multiple molecules of interest and bond dissociation cases. These examples provide proof-of-principle results for approximate solution of the electronic structure problem using quantum computing. This approach is general and shows potential to reduce the computational complexity of post-Hartree-Fock methods as future advances in quantum hardware become available.

TI Quantum neural networks with data re-uploading for urban traffic time
   series forecasting
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Accurate traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as it enables real-time traffic flow management, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks. With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. We observe that, in fully connected network settings, hybrid quantum-classical models consistently underperform, with median scores approximately 10% worse than their purely classical counterparts across different configurations. In contrast, recursive architectures with data re-uploading show the opposite trend: hybrid models achieved up to 5% better median scores under comparable complexity settings. Additionally, these hybrid models converged in fewer training epochs, indicating improved training efficiency. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.

TI Far-field superresolution of thermal sources by double homodyne or
   double array homodyne detection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose two schemes for estimating the separation of two thermal sources via double homodyne and double array homodyne detection considering the joint measurement of conjugate quadratures of the image plane field.By using the Cramer-Rao bound, we demonstrate that the two schemes can estimate the separation well below the Rayleigh limit and have an advantage over direct imaging when the average photon number per source exceeds five.For arbitrary source strengths, double homodyne detection is superior to homodyne detection when the separation is above 2(5/4)sigma/root N-s, sigma is the beam width, N-s is the average photon number per source.A larger separation can be estimated better via double array homodyne detection with the superiority of flexible operation compared with other schemes. High-speed and high-efficiency detection enables the measurement schemes with potential practical applications in fluorescence microscopy, astronomy and quantum imaging.

TI Recognizing beam profiles from silicon photonics gratings using a
   transformer model
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits among the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from gratings using infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles in light from SiPh gratings. The models are trained using two techniques: (1) input patches and (2) input sequence. For the model trained with input patches, the model achieved a recognition accuracy of 0.924. Meanwhile, the model trained with input sequence shows a lower accuracy of 0.892. However, when repeating the model training for 150 cycles, a model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.289 to 0.959, while the model trained with input sequence shows accuracy values between 0.75 to 0.947. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beams and auto-adjustment of the z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.

TI Cost-aware quantum-inspired genetic algorithm for workflow scheduling in
   hybrid clouds
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Cloud computing delivers a desirable environment for users to run their different kinds of applications in a cloud. Numerous of these applications (tasks), such as bioinformatics, astronomy, biodiversity, and image analysis, are deadline -sensitive. Such tasks must be properly allocated to virtual machines (VMs) to avoid deadline violations, and they should reduce their execution time and cost. Due to the contradictory environment, minimizing the application task's completion time and execution cost is extremely difficult. Thus, we propose a Cost -aware Quantum -inspired Genetic Algorithm (CQGA) to minimize the execution time and cost by meeting the deadline constraints. CQGA is motivated by quantum computing and genetic algorithm. It combines quantum operators (measure, interference, and rotation) with genetic operators (selection, crossover, and mutation). Quantum operators are used for better population diversity, quick convergence, time -saving, and robustness. Genetic operators help to produce new individuals, have good fitness values for individuals, and play a significant role in preserving the evolution quality of the population. In addition, CQGA used a quantum bit as a probabilistic representation because it has higher population diversity attributes than other representations. The simulation outcome exhibits that the proposed algorithm can obtain outstanding convergence performance and reduced maximum cost than benchmark algorithms.

TI Ultrathin TaN Damascene Nanowire Structures on 300-mm Si Wafers for
   Quantum Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We report on the development and characterization of superconducting damascene tantalum nitride (TaN) nanowires, 100 nm-3 mu m wide, with TaN thicknesses varying from 5 to 35 nm, using 193-nm optical lithography and chemical mechanical planarization among other 300-mm wafer-scale processes. The TaN film composition chosen for nanowire fabrication was informed by a detailed study of unpatterned TaN films with varying nitrogen to tantalum ratios, formed by reactive sputtering. We also discuss the influence of encapsulation by copper and disordered atomic layer deposited TaN on the critical current of superconducting nanowires. Superconducting critical current density (measured at 12 mK) ranges from 0.12 to 0.85 MA/cm(2) depending on nanowire width and film thickness. The potential of ultrathin TaN nanowires at 300-mm scale is discussed in the context of applications such as on-chip integration for readout of superconducting qubits, in single-photon detection for quantum computing, as well as in large single-photon detecting focal plane arrays for cosmology in a broader range of wavelengths.

TI On the prospects of optical cycling in diatomic cations: effects of
   transition metals, spin-orbit couplings, and multiple bonds
SO MOLECULAR PHYSICS
AB Molecules with optical cycling centres (OCCs) are highly desirable in the context of fundamental studies as well as applications (e.g. quantum computing) because they can be effectively cooled to very low temperatures by repeated absorption and emission (hence, cycling). Charged species offer additional advantages for experimental control and manipulation. We present a systematic computational study of a series of diatomic radical-cations made of a d-block metal and a p-block ligand, that are isoelectronic (in their valence shell) to the successfully laser-cooled neutral molecules. Using high-level electronic structure methods, we characterise state and transition properties of low-lying electronic states and compute Franck-Condon factors. The computed branching ratios and radiative lifetimes reveal that the electronic transitions analogous to those successfully used in the laser cooling of neutral molecules are less than optimal in the cations. We propose alternative transitions suitable for optical cycling and highlight trends that could assist future designs of OCCs in charged or neutral molecules.

TI Light-Controlled Room Temperature Ferromagnetism in Vanadium-Doped
   Tungsten Disulfide Semiconducting Monolayers
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors hold enormous potential for modern optoelectronic devices and quantum computing applications. By inducing long-range ferromagnetism (FM) in these semiconductors through the introduction of small amounts of a magnetic dopant, it is possible to extend their potential in spintronics. Here, light-mediated, room temperature (RT) FM, in V-doped WS2 (V-WS2) monolayers is demonstrated. The authors probe this effect using the principle of magnetic LC resonance, which employs a soft ferromagnetic Co-based microwire coil driven near its resonance in the radio frequency regime, where it is highly sensitive to changes in magnetic flux. They use this to measure the magnetic permeability of the V-WS2 monolayer subject to light illumination. Notably, the magnetic permeability of the monolayer is found to depend on the laser intensity, thus confirming light control of RT magnetism in this material. Guided by density functional theory calculations, they attribute this phenomenon to the presence of excess holes in the conduction and valence bands, as well as carriers trapped in the magnetic doping states, which mediates the magnetization of the V-WS2 monolayer. These findings provide a unique route to exploit light-controlled ferromagnetism at RT and potentially establish a new subfield named photo-spintronics.

TI Benchmarking a wide range of optimisers for solving the Fermi-Hubbard
   model using the variational quantum eigensolver
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best-performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We perform gradient analysis, and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.

TI Evolutionary Neural Network based on Quantum Elephant Herding Algorithm
   for Modulation Recognition in Impulse Noise
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, we proposed a novel modulation recognition method based on quantum elephant herding algorithm (QEHA) evolving neural network under impulse noise environment. We use the adaptive weight myriad filter to preprocess the received digital modulation signals which passing through the impulsive noise channel, and then the instantaneous characteristics and high order cumulant features of digital modulation signals are extracted as classification feature set, finally, the BP neural network (BPNN) model as a classifier for automatic digital modulation recognition. Besides, based on the elephant herding optimization (EHO) algorithm and quantum computing mechanism, we design a quantum elephant herding algorithm (QEHA) to optimize the initial thresholds and weights of the BPNN, which solves the problem that traditional BPNN is easy into local minimum values and poor robustness. The experimental results prove that the adaptive weight myriad filter we used can remove the impulsive noise effectively, and the proposed QEHA-BPNN classifier has better recognition performance than other conventional pattern recognition classifiers. Compared with other global optimization algorithms, the QEHA designed in this paper has a faster convergence speed and higher convergence accuracy. Furthermore, the effect of symbol shape has been considered, which can satisfy the need for engineering.

TI Lensless diffraction imaging using a rotated slit modulation
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Iterative phase retrieval is a computational imaging technique to recover the lost phase information from intensity-only images for lensless diffraction imaging. However, the conventional single-shot phase retrieval is always constrained by the precise selection of support region or sparse assumption. To address it, we propose a multi-rotation phase retrieval (MRPR) algorithm for lensless imaging. In our method, a support-based phase retrieval with total variation is first designed to calculate all illumination patterns, which removes the requirement of rotation angle estimation. Then, the illumination modulation and total variation regularization are combined to restrain the multi-rotation optimization function to iteratively reconstruct the complex-valued image of the sample. In comparison with support-based phase retrieval, our method does not rely on the selection of support region and shows high-fidelity image reconstruction. The simulation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI 50 W low-noise single-frequency thulium-doped fiber amplifier at 1844 nm
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this work, we present a 50 W laser amplifier architecture operating at 1844 nm, encompassing a three-stage amplification architecture. The first two stages rely on core-pumping, while the final stage employs high-power cladding pumping. Core-pumping at 1560 nm enables a tunable output power of 2 W between 1830 nm and 1880 nm at the output of the second preamplifier. An integrated spectral filter comprising a circulator and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) centered at 844 nm is used. Cladding pumping at 793 nm is implemented for power scaling, achieving over 50 W of output power with an optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) exceeding 60 dB. The amplifier exhibits low intensity noise, with an RMS noise of 0.006% in the 1 kHz-10 MHz range, without any sign of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). These results highlight the amplifier's suitability for demanding industrial and scientific applications, including quantum computing, where narrowband emission, low Relative Intensity Noise (RIN), and reliability are critical.

TI Field-Induced Phase Transitions in Cuprate Superconductors for Cryogenic
   in-Memory Computing
SO SMALL
AB Energy-efficient cryogenic memory systems play a critical role in a wide spectrum of applications focused on ultra-energy-efficient information and communication technologies, such as quantum computing or superconducting electronics. Neuromorphic systems, known for their superior energy efficiency, have emerged as a promising approach for in-memory computing. Specifically, strongly correlated oxides that exhibit Mott metal-insulator transitions through field-induced oxygen movement are of great interest for analog memory and neuromorphic computing. Yet, optimizing their performance at low temperatures may prove challenging due to their reliance on ionic motion. In this study, superconducting structures composed of strongly correlated YBa2Cu3O7 - x (YBCO) combined with ferromagnetic La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) are investigated to obtain non-volatile multilevel memristive switching effects with high performance at cryogenic temperatures. This research reveals the presence of two competing switching mechanisms, which are attributed to the movement of oxygen vacancies and electric carriers within these structures. It is determined that a phase transition induced by the movement of holes is the primary factor influencing the switching dynamics at low temperatures. Additionally, a physics-based compact model is proposed that accurately replicates the experimental findings and provides a tool for circuit-level design.

TI Programming universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose
   silicon photonic platform
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB General-purpose programmable photonic processors provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse functionalities on a single chip. Leveraging a two-dimensional hexagonal waveguide mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers, these systems have demonstrated significant potential in microwave photonic applications. Additionally, they are a promising platform for creating unitary linear transformations, which are key elements in quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, a general procedure for implementing these transformations on such systems has not been established yet. This work demonstrates the programming of universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose programmable photonic circuit with a hexagonal topology. We detail the steps to split the light on-chip, demonstrate that an equivalent structure to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one internal and one external phase shifter can be built in the hexagonal mesh, and program both the triangular and rectangular architectures for matrix multiplication. We recalibrate the system to account for passive phase deviations. Experimental programming of 3 x 3 and 4 x 4 random unitary matrices yields fidelities >98% and bit precisions over five bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that random unitary matrices are demonstrated on a general-purpose photonic processor and pave the way for the implementation of programmable photonic circuits in optical computing and signal processing systems.

   automata-based multiplexer/demultiplexer design
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Future global communications will depend heavily on nano-communication networks, which use ultra-low power nano-circuits to transmit data efficiently at very high rates. An essential part of distributed communication networks is the circuit-switched network, which distributes the input signal among several users. For designing nanoscale digital circuits, Quantum Cellular Automata technology (QCA) emerges as a formidable contender against the established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology for low-power devices. The authors endeavour to achieve an efficient design for multiplexer and demultiplexer switching circuits. The designed multiplexer and demultiplexer have 15 cells with an area of 0.02 mu m2 and a latency of 0.5 clock cycles. The authors assess the energy dissipation and temperature impacts for both multiplexer and demultiplexer circuits. The novel design of switch circuits facilitates the sharing of a single communication link across multiple devices at the nano-scale.
   This article has the following contribution: center dot Implementation of a QCA-based Single-Layer 2:1 Multiplexer. center dot Implementation of a QCA-based single layer 1:2 Demultiplexer. center dot Comparative analysis of proposed circuits against existing works. center dot Estimation of energy dissipation and analysis of temperature effects on the proposed switched network. image

   TOOL FOR CAMP DISTRIBUTION CONNECTION BASED ON DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS
SO SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
AB This particular offers a visual logging and automatic modelling apparatus for camp distribution connection employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The gadget that emerged from an interdisciplinary approach inspired by ideas related to data security, quantum computing, and environmental monitoring points to an upward trajectory in increasing the accuracy and efficiency of compassionate coordination in settings for camp distribution. Experiments on the dataset show how successfully connection modelling, anomaly detection, as well as semantic segmentation, are done to generate a more cohesive model. Its reputation is further highlighted by the corresponding study of works from various domains, which finds that it has accuracy, precision, and F1 score measurements above 0.88 per task. As a directed investigation area in non-stipulated regions turns into significant scientific research, it contributes an ever-more significant role in leading authorities through which to make some administrative efforts to optimise such research, as disciplined researchers currently have sufficient knowledge of contemporary trends. Compared to present use, the equipment is more accurate and has superior review values. The research can achieve unprecedented computing efficiency, as seen by its 12-hour setup time and processing velocity measurement of 20 milliseconds per recorded picture.

AB Quantum computing has been rapidly expanding, and many platforms for writing programs that can be compiled and run on quantum hardware (or simulated) are being developed. As with any compiler, transformation correctness is paramount as the machine readable code must maintain program semantics. Quantum programs are challenging to test given a lack of benchmark programs and the difficulty of defining an oracle. MorphQ solves both of these challenges by (1) generating syntactically correct quantum programs and (2) using metamorphic testing to avoid the oracle problem. However, Qiskit, the compiler it was built for, is rapidly evolving. This paper is a reproducibility study of the MorphQ platform, which we call MorphQ++. We have updated the core MorphQ engine to work on a newer version of Qiskit and added new metamorphic transformations. We find that our overall results are similar: we find a portion of the original faults (which were not yet fixed) and the distributions of types are not very different. Our new transformations lead to several new faults, suggesting there is room to expand the core framework. Additionally, we note the lack of power of the metamorphic relations in this context and suggest the need for more sophisticated relations and/or oracle evaluations.

AB Simulating the time evolution of a physical system at quantum mechanical levels of detail - known as Hamiltonian Simulation (HS) - is an important and interesting problem across physics and chemistry. For this task, algorithms that run on quantum computers are known to be exponentially faster than classical algorithms; in fact, this application motivated Feynman to propose the construction of quantum computers. Nonetheless, there are challenges in reaching this performance potential.
   Prior work has focused on compiling circuits (quantum programs) for HS with the goal of maximizing either accuracy or gate cancellation. Our work proposes a compilation strategy that simultaneously advances both goals. At a high level, we use classical optimizations such as graph coloring and travelling salesperson to order the execution of quantum programs. Specifically, we group together mutually commuting terms in the Hamiltonian (a matrix characterizing the quantum mechanical system) to improve the accuracy of the simulation. We then rearrange the terms within each group to maximize gate cancellation in the final quantum circuit. These optimizations work together to improve HS performance and result in an average 40% reduction in circuit depth. This work advances the frontier of HS which in turn can advance physical and chemical modeling in both basic and applied sciences.

AB The blistering appearance of autonomous vehicle networks (AVNs) represents extreme cybersecurity dangers, particularly with the forthcoming danger of quantum computing, which is capable of overcoming traditional defenses on the basis of cryptography. This paper offers a new architecture that integrates quantum-resistant blockchain technology and deep learning to offer excellent cybersecurity in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Three contributions are proposed: (1) a postquantum safe communication scheme, which will secure vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications; (2) a decentralized blockchain-based data-sharing system, which will be utilized to ensure the integrity, privacy, and integrity of vehicular data; and (3) the application of a deep learning model as an anomaly detector and real-time threat mitigation to vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications. The experimental tests demonstrate that the deep learning architectures for detecting cyber threats are 95.2% accurate, 94.1% precise, and 93.5% recall, with blockchain data integrity of 99.9% throughput of 150 transactions per second and a block validation time of 1.5 s. In context, the framework will help improve ITSs by offering safer roads, efficient communication infrastructure, and efficient data exchange, which will establish the road to successful and safe application of autonomous transportation systems in the real world.

TI Influence of Klein edges on Phononic and electronic transport in
   circular graphene devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We study the electron and phonon transport coefficients of graphene disks and rings in the presence of Klein edges. We examine the transport characteristics by changing of the outer and inner radius using the non-equilibrium Green's function approach. We find that the effect of the nanodisk radius is highly influenced by the Klein edges, such that at small radii, armchair Klein edges can help preserve the electronic transport coefficient from suppression, while zigzag Klein edges significantly suppress the transmission spectrum, highlighting the importance of the edge atom sublattice. The behavior is also observed in cases where only one side of the circular disk is preserved, showing that it is not rooted in the symmetric geometry of the circle. The value of the outer radius has a more regular influence on the electronic conductance than the value of the inner one. However, in the examined sizes, the phononic spectrum does not exhibit a clear dependence on the edges. Our results contribute to the understanding of the behavior of Klein edges, which is crucial for the design of high-performance nanoscale electronic devices, the creation of stable qubits for advances in quantum computing.

TI Improved Performance of HfxZnyO-Based RRAM and its
   Switching Characteristics down to 4 K Temperature
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB The search for high-performance resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices is essential to pave the way for highly efficient non-Von Neumann computing architecture. Here, it is reported on an alloying approach using atomic layer deposition for a Zn-doped HfOx-based resistive random-access memory (HfZnO RRAM), with improved performance. As compared with HfOx RRAM, the HfZnO RRAM exhibits reduced switching voltages (>20%) and switching energy (>3x), as well as better uniformity both in voltages and resistance states. Furthermore, the HfZnO RRAM exhibits stable retention exceeding 10 years, as well as write/erase endurance exceeding 10(5) cycles. In addition, excellent linearity and repeatability of conductance tuning can be achieved using the constant voltage pulse scheme, achieving approximate to 90% accuracy in a simulated multi-layer perceptron network for the recognition of modified national institute of standards and technology database handwriting. The HfZnO RRAM is also characterized down to the temperature of 4 K, showing functionality and the elucidation of its carrier conduction mechanism. Hence, a potential pathway for doped-RRAM to be used in a wide range of temperatures including quantum computing and deep-space exploration is shown.

AB Quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problems is a general class of combinatorial optimisation problems, which regained popularity after recent advances in quantum computing. Quantum-inspired technologies like Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA), based on simulated annealing, can solve QUBO problems much faster than traditional computers. Penalty methods can convert constrained optimisation problems into QUBO problems. However, existing exact methods of determining penalty weights are limited to specific QUBO problems and require manual analysis by experts in QUBO. Empirical methods are general but become computationally prohibitive for large problem sizes and do not guarantee that penalty weights preserve the feasibility of global optima. We present a simple, efficient, general method applicable to any QUBO to determine exact penalty weights. Such weights are simple upper-bounds of the smallest penalty weight guaranteeing that unconstrained global optima are the same as the feasible global optima. These bounds can be iteratively improved by sequential penalty methods which we also present. Experimental results with the DA on minimum cut, travelling salesman and multi-dimensional knapsack problems show the viability of the novel methodology hybridising exact and sequential methods. This work contributes towards general, automatic and scalable penalty methods in QUBO.

TI Chiral Materials: Multidisciplinary Progress and Emerging Frontier
   Application Prospects
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Chiral materials have shown promising application prospects across various disciplines in recent years due to their unique structural asymmetry and the resulting chiral dependence in optical, electrical, and biomedical applications. However, the existing literature lacks a unified summary of its applications in different fields. This review systematically introduces the applications of chiral materials in optics, electricity, quantum science, and biomedicine. Based on circular dichroism and chiral inversion aggregation-induced emission, chiral materials enable efficient circularly polarized light emission/detection, advancing chiral perovskite and spin light-emitting diodes. In quantum science, in-depth studies of the chiral-induced spin-selectivity effect and chiral topological superconductors support spintronic devices and quantum computing. They facilitate the development of high-efficiency energy conversion devices and high-performance chiral electrochemical sensors. In biomedicine, they excel in enantioseparation, targeted drug delivery, and theranostics. In the future, chiral materials will develop towards multi-functional integration, intelligent response, and high-performance devices. Their in-depth applications in three-dimensional display technology, low-power spin storage devices, green catalytic systems, and precision medicine will provide innovative solutions to energy, environmental, and health challenges.

TI InSb Nanowire Networks Grown by Groove-Guided Selective Area Epitaxy on
   Ge Substrates
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB InSb is an excellent material for studying topological quantum computing, infrared optoelectronics, and spintronics. Controllable growth of high-quality, large-scale InSb nanowire networks is the basis for these applications. However, the selective growth window and the epitaxial growth window of InSb nanowire networks do not overlap when they are grown by molecular-beam epitaxy. So far, the controlled growth of high-quality large-scale InSb nanowire networks still remains a challenge. Here, a groove-guided selective area growth technique is proposed for InSb nanowire network growth on Ge substrates by molecular-beam epitaxy. Different from the traditional planar selective epitaxial growth technology, in the proposed method, the material is epitaxially grown at the grooves of the substrate, and the selective growth is achieved by utilizing the atomic diffusion of the epitaxial material on the substrate surface: Selective growth is achieved without using any masks. The InSb nanowire networks grown by this manner have continuous morphology with flat top facets, and they are high-quality zinc-blende crystals and exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction. Due to good repeatability and scalability, the work provides a new solution to grow high-quality wafer-scale InSb nanowire networks on Ge substrates.

TI First-principles predictions of ferromagnetism in monolayers of the 2D
   materials Cr2X4Y (X = S, Se; Y = Ga, Ge, In, Sn)
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Research on two-dimensional magnetic materials has gained significant attention in recent years owing to their unique thickness-dependent magnetism, tunable properties, and potential applications in spintronics, quantum computing, and next-generation data storage technologies. This study investigated the intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) properties of Cr2X4Y (X = S, Se; Y = Ga, Ge, In, Sn) monolayers, with emphasis on their potential application in spintronic devices. Comprehensive stability analyses confirmed the feasibility of synthesizing these materials. Our results predict that all of these materials would exhibit robust ferromagnetism with magnetic moments of similar to 4 mu B per Cr atom and high Curie temperatures ( Tc) ranging from 170 K to 691 K, with Cr2S4Ga achieving the highest Tc. The FM behavior, attributed to superexchange interactions, remains stable under biaxial strain (-6% to 6%). Based on their electronic structures, half-metallicity is predicted for Cr2X4Y (Y = Ga, In), which enables 100% spin polarization, whereas Cr2X4Y (Y = Ge, Sn) are semiconductors with sizable band gaps. These findings indicate that the Cr2X4Y monolayers are promising candidates for room-temperature spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties.

AB With the increasing capabilities of quantum systems, the efficient, practical execution of quantum programs is becoming more critical. Each execution includes compilation time, which accounts for substantial overhead of the overall program runtime. To address this challenge, proposals that leverage precompilation techniques have emerged, whereby entire circuits or select components are precompiled to mitigate the compilation time spent during execution. Considering the impact of compilation time on quantum program execution, identifying the contribution of each individual compilation task to the execution time is necessary in directing the community's research efforts towards the development of an efficient compilation and execution pipeline. In this work, we perform a preliminary analysis of the quantum circuit compilation process in Qiskit, examining the cumulative runtime of each individual compilation task and identifying the tasks that most strongly impact the overall compilation time. Our results indicate that, as the desired level of optimization increases, circuit optimization and gate synthesis passes become the dominant tasks in compiling a Quantum Fourier Transform, with individual passes consuming up to 87% of the total compilation time. Mapping passes require the most compilation time for a GHZ state preparation circuit, accounting for over 99% of total compilation time.

TI Increasing the Measured Effective Quantum Volume with Zero Noise
   Extrapolation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum volume is a full-stack benchmark for near-term quantum computers. It quantifies the largest size of a square circuit which can be executed on the target device with reasonable fidelity. Error mitigation is a set of techniques intended to remove the effects of noise present in the computation of noisy quantum computers when computing an expectation value of interest. Effective quantum volume is a proposed metric that applies error mitigation to the quantum volume protocol to evaluate the effectiveness not only of the target device but also of the error mitigation algorithm. Digital zero-noise extrapolation is an error mitigation technique that estimates the noiseless expectation value using circuit folding to amplify errors by known scale factors and then extrapolating computed expectation values to the zero-noise limit. Here we demonstrate that zero-noise extrapolation, with global and local unitary folding with fractional scale factors, in conjunction with dynamical decoupling, can increase the effective quantum volume over the vendor-measured quantum volume. Specifically, we measure the effective quantum volume of four IBM Quantum superconducting processor units, obtaining values that are larger than the vendor-measured quantum volume on each device. This is the first such increase reported.

TI Induced Ferromagnetism in Epitaxial Uranium Dioxide Thin Films
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Actinide materials have various applications that range from nuclear energy to quantum computing. Most current efforts have focused on bulk actinide materials. Tuning functional properties by using strain engineering in epitaxial thin films is largely lacking. Using uranium dioxide (UO2) as a model system, in this work, the authors explore strain engineering in actinide epitaxial thin films and investigate the origin of induced ferromagnetism in an antiferromagnet UO2. It is found that UO2+x thin films are hypostoichiometric (x<0) with in-plane tensile strain, while they are hyperstoichiometric (x>0) with in-plane compressive strain. Different from strain engineering in non-actinide oxide thin films, the epitaxial strain in UO2 is accommodated by point defects such as vacancies and interstitials due to the low formation energy. Both epitaxial strain and strain relaxation induced point defects such as oxygen/uranium vacancies and oxygen/uranium interstitials can distort magnetic structure and result in magnetic moments. This work reveals the correlation among strain, point defects and ferromagnetism in strain engineered UO2+x thin films and the results offer new opportunities to understand the influence of coupled order parameters on the emergent properties of many other actinide thin films.

TI Generation of optical Schrodinger cat states by generalized photon
   subtraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a high-rate generation method of optical Schrodinger cat states. Thus far, photon subtraction from squeezed vacuum states has been a standard method in cat-state generation, but its constraints on experimental parameters limit the generation rate. In this paper, we consider the state generation by photon number measurement in one mode of two-mode Gaussian states, which is a generalization of conventional photon subtraction, and derive the conditions to generate high-fidelity and large-amplitude cat states. Our method relaxes the constraints on experimental parameters, allowing us to optimize them and attain a high generation rate. Supposing realistic experimental conditions, the generation rate of cat states with large amplitudes (vertical bar alpha vertical bar >= 2) can exceed megacounts per second, about 103 to 106 times better than typical rates of conventional photon subtraction. This rate would be improved further by the progress of related technologies. The ability to generate non-Gaussian states at a high rate is important in quantum computing using optical continuous variables, where scalability has been demonstrated but preparation of non-Gaussian states of light remains as a challenging task for universality and fault tolerance. Our proposal reduces the difficulty of the state preparation and opens a way for practical applications in quantum optics.

It was recently shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named QD-encoding transitions. Here we initiate their systematic study in generic, non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions-the distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the z component of a spin-half. We derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD, intermediate, and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be probed by a "coarse-grained" measure of the total spin -z of the fraction, which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must be probed by fined-grained measures and corresponds to a subtler symmetry breaking in the replica space.

TI Guaranteeing completely positive quantum evolution
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In open quantum systems, it is known that if the system and environment are in a product state, the evolution of the system is given by a linear completely positive (CP) Hermitian map. CP maps are a subset of general linear Hermitian maps, which also include non completely positive (NCP) maps. NCP maps can arise in evolutions such as non-Markovian evolution, where the CP divisibility of the map (writing the overall evolution as a composition of CP maps) usually fails. Positive but NCP maps are also useful as entanglement witnesses. In this paper, we focus on transforming an initial NCP map to a CP map through composition with the asymmetric depolarizing map. We use separate asymmetric depolarizing maps acting on the individual subsystems. Previous work have looked at structural physical approximation (SPA), which is a CP approximation of an NCP map using a mixture of the NCP map with a completely depolarizing map. We prove that the composition can always be made CP without completely depolarizing in any direction. It is possible to depolarize less in some directions. We give the general proof by using the Choi matrix and an isomorphism from a maximally entangled two qudit state to a set of qubits. We also give measures that describe the amount of disturbance the depolarization introduces to the original map. Given our measures, we show that asymmetric depolarization has many advantages over SPA in preserving the structure of the original NCP map. Finally, we give some examples. For some measures and examples, completely depolarizing (while not necessary) in some directions can give a better approximation than keeping the depolarizing parameters bounded by the required depolarization if symmetric depolarization is used.

TI Selective Area Epitaxy of Quasi-1-Dimensional Topological Nanostructures
   and Networks
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) topological insulators hold the potential of forming the basis of novel devices in spintronics and quantum computing. While exposure to ambient conditions and conventional fabrication processes are an obstacle to their technological integration, ultra-high vacuum lithography techniques, such as selective area epitaxy (SAE), provide all the necessary ingredients for their refinement into scalable device architectures. In this work, high-quality SAE of quasi-1D topological insulators on templated Si substrates is demonstrated. After identifying the narrow temperature window for selectivity, the flexibility and scalability of this approach is revealed. Compared to planar growth of macroscopic thin films, selectively grown regions are observed to experience enhanced growth rates in the nanostructured templates. Based on these results, a growth model is deduced, which relates device geometry to effective growth rates. After validating the model experimentally for various three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TIs), the crystal quality of selectively grown nanostructures is optimized by tuning the effective growth rates to 5 nm/h. The high quality of selectively grown nanostructures is confirmed through detailed structural characterization via atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

TI Symmetries in Reversible Programming From Symmetric Rig Groupoids to
   Reversible Programming Languages
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB The. family of reversible programming languages for boolean circuits is presented as a syntax of combinators witnessing type isomorphisms of algebraic data types. In this paper, we give a denotational semantics for this language, using weak groupoids a la Homotopy Type Theory, and show how to derive an equational theory for it, presented by 2-combinators witnessing equivalences of type isomorphisms.
   We establish a correspondence between the syntactic groupoid of the language and a formally presented univalent subuniverse of finite types. The correspondence relates 1-combinators to 1-paths, and 2-combinators to 2-paths in the universe, which is shown to be sound and complete for both levels, forming an equivalence of groupoids. We use this to establish a Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence between Reversible Logic, Reversible Programming Languages, and Symmetric Rig Groupoids, by showing that the syntax of. is presented by the free symmetric rig groupoid, given by finite sets and bijections.
   Using the formalisation of our results, we perform normalisation-by-evaluation, verification and synthesis of reversible logic gates, motivated by examples from quantum computing. We also show how to reason about and transfer theorems between different representations of reversible circuits.

TI Quantum spin Hall effect in
   Ta2M3Te5 (M = Pd, Ni)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect with great promise for the potential application in spintronics and quantum computing has attracted extensive research interest from both theoretical and experimental researchers. Here, we predict monolayer Ta2Pd3Te5 can be a QSH insulator based on first-principles calculations. The interlayer binding energy in the layered van der Waals compound Ta2Pd3Te5 is 19.6 meV/angstrom(2); thus, its monolayer/thinfilm structures could be readily obtained by exfoliation. The band inversion near the Fermi level (E F ) is an intrinsic characteristic, which happens between Ta-5d and Pd-4d orbitals without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The SOC effect opens a global gap and makes the system a QSH insulator. With the d-d band-inverted feature, the nontrivial topology in monolayer Ta2Pd3Te5 is characterized by the time-reversal topological invariant Z(2) = 1, which is computed by the one-dimensional (1D) Wilson loop method as implemented in our first-principles calculations. The helical edge modes are also obtained using surface Green's function method. Our calculations show that the QSH state in Ta2M3Te5 (M = Pd, Ni) can be tuned by external strain. These monolayers and thin films provide feasible platforms for realizing QSH effect as well as related devices.

TI Clinical and Operational Applications of Artificial Intelligence and
   Machine Learning in Pharmacy: A Narrative Review of Real-World
   Applications
SO PHARMACY
AB Over the past five years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) including its significant subset, machine learning (ML), has significantly advanced pharmaceutical procedures in community pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, and pharmaceutical industry settings. Numerous notable healthcare institutions, such as Johns Hopkins University, Cleveland Clinic, and Mayo Clinic, have demonstrated measurable advancements in the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare delivery. Community pharmacies have seen a 40% increase in drug adherence and a 55% reduction in missed prescription refills since implementing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. According to reports, hospital implementations have reduced prescription distribution errors by up to 75% and enhanced the detection of adverse medication reactions by up to 65%. Numerous businesses, such as Atomwise and Insilico Medicine, assert that they have made noteworthy progress in the creation of AI-based medical therapies. Emerging technologies like federated learning and quantum computing have the potential to boost the prediction of protein-drug interactions by up to 300%, despite challenges including high implementation costs and regulatory compliance. The significance of upholding patient-centred care while encouraging technology innovation is emphasised in this review.

TI Chiral induction at the nanoscale and spin selectivity in electron
   transmission in chiral methylated BEDT-TTF derivatives
SO NANOSCALE
AB Great efforts have been made in the last few decades to realize electronic devices based on organic molecules. A possible approach in this field is to exploit the chirality of organic molecules for the development of spintronic devices, an applicative way to implement the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. In this work we exploit enantiopure tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives as chiral inducers at the nanoscale. The aim is to make use of TTF's well-known and unique semiconducting properties, to be expressed in the fields of enantio-selectivity and the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. The experimental results shown in this paper further demonstrate how chirality and spin are deeply interrelated, as foreseen within the CISS effect theory, paving the way for the application of TTF derivatives in the field of spintronics. In this work, we demonstrate that tetramethyl-bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene (TM-BEDT-TTF) (1) behaves as an efficient spin filter, as evidenced by magneto-atomic force microscopy (mc-AFM) measurements. Additionally, it is shown to be effective in transferring chirality to CdS/CdSe core-shell nanoparticles, as inferred from the analysis of circularly resolved photoluminescence spectra. This makes 1 a promising candidate for a variety of applications, ranging from plasmonics to quantum computing.

TI Exposing the odd-parity superconductivity in
   CeRh2As2 with hydrostatic pressure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Odd-parity superconductivity is a fundamentally interesting but rare state of matter with a potential for applications in topological quantum computing. Crystals with staggered locally noncentrosymmetric structures have been proposed as platforms where a magnetic field can induce a transition between even- and odd-parity superconducting (SC) states. The strongly correlated superconductor CeRh2As2 with the critical temperature T-c approximate to 0.4K is likely the first example material showing such a phase transition, which occurs at the magnetic field mu H-0(& lowast; )= 4T applied along the crystallographic c axis. CeRh2As2 also undergoes a phase transition of an unknown origin at T-0=0.5K. By subjecting CeRh2As2 to hydrostatic pressure and mapping the resultant changes to the SC phase diagrams we investigated how the lattice compression and changes to the electronic correlations affect the stability and relative balance of the two SC states. The abnormally high in-plane upper critical field becomes even higher close to a quantum critical point of the T-0 order. Remarkably, the SC phase-switching field H-& lowast; is drastically reduced under pressure, dropping to 0.3T at 2.7GPa. This result signals an apparent strengthening of the local noncentrosymmetricity and forecasts a possible stabilization of the putative odd-parity state down to zero field, hitherto not considered by theoretical models.

TI Efficient iNTRU-based public key authentication keyword searchable
   encryption in cloud computing
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
AB With the popularity of cloud computing, a large number of personal and corporate data are outsourced to the cloud. This centralized storage and processing mode not only improves the efficiency of data processing, but also brings challenges to data security and privacy. In view of the development of quantum computing, the traditional public key encryption may no longer be secure in the future. Therefore, it is particularly important to study the public key authenticated keyword searchable encryption (PEAKS) scheme which can resist quantum. This scheme can provide double guarantee for the data in cloud storage: one is to ensure the confidentiality of the data, so that the original content cannot be decrypted even within the cloud service provider; the other is to allow users to perform keyword searches on encrypted data without decrypting the data. This provides a balance of security and efficiency for data search and analysis in cloud computing environment. Recently, Genise et al. designed a Gadget-based iNTRU trapdoor, which has the advantages of small size and high efficiency. Therefore, we design an efficient and secure public key authentication keyword searchable encryption scheme based on iNTRU lattice. The overall running time of this scheme is only more than 300ms.

AB There is today a lack of mature transistor-level compact models for the simulation of integrated circuits at cryogenic temperatures. This is particularly the case for the simulation of the noise behavior which is critical for most applications. In this paper, we aim at an efficient prediction of the white noise behavior of basic amplifying stages working at RF frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. For this, we propose the use of DC measurements that are incorporated in a Look-Up Table (LUT) and fed to a mathematical noise model. We illustrate the approach for the case of a transistor in common source configuration. The results of circuit simulation of the noise parameters in the standard temperature range are very close to the estimation of the same parameters using the LUT with just DC measurements. The approach can be readily extended to the analysis of circuits with multiple components. Next, the LUT approach is used for estimating the noise parameters at cryogenic conditions, considering DC measurements that have been carried out at these temperatures. The paper illustrates the feasibility of carrying out a cryogenic design using a LUT-based approach while accurate compact models are not yet available.

TI QUANTUM GENERALIZATIONS OF THE POLYNOMIAL HIERARCHY WITH APPLICATIONS TO
   QMA(2)
SO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
AB The polynomial-time hierarchy (PH) has proven to be a powerful tool for providing separations in computational complexity theory (modulo standard conjectures such as PH do not collapse). Here, we study whether two quantum generalizations of PH can similarly prove separations in the quantum setting. The first generalization, QCPH, uses classical proofs, and the second, QPH, uses quantum proofs. For the former, we show quantum variants of the Karp-Lipton theorem and Toda's theorem. For the latter, we place its third level, Q Sigma(3), into NEXP using the ellipsoid method for efficiently solving semidefinite programs. These results yield two implications for QMA(2), the variant of Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA) with two unentangled proofs, a complexity class whose characterization has proven difficult. First, if QCPH=QPH (i.e., alternating quantifiers are sufficiently powerful so as to make classical and quantum proofs "equivalent''), then QMA(2) is in the counting hierarchy (specifically, in P-pppp). Second, because QMA(2)subset of Q Sigma(3), QMA(2) is strictly contained in NEXP unless QMA(2)=Q Sigma(3) (i.e., alternating quantifiers do not help in the presence of "unentanglement'').

AB Quantum computers have been at the bleeding edge of computing technology for nearly 40 years and promise to make several classically-difficult problems tractable. However, despite many hardware and algorithm breakthroughs, the software infrastructure that compiles programs for these devices requires further development in order to produce sufficiently scalable code. In this work we present a novel approach to compiling more efficient quantum programs. Rather than mapping individual programs onto quantum hardware, we capture the input as a high-level mathematical transform and generate a multitude of architecture-compliant programs directly from that specification, allowing us to search over a much larger space of implementations to select the best output. Specifically, this is achieved by casting circuit generation as a sparse matrix factorization task and recursively searching over a host of divide-and-conquer decomposition rules. By generating programs from the top-down, we retain high-level information about the program we are compiling and can explore algorithm-specific rewrites that are nearly impossible to recognize given only a program stream. We implement the proposed framework [33] [34] with SPIRAL [18], a code generation platform founded on the GAP [42] computer algebra system; we ultimately demonstrate that SPIRAL is a promising supplemental tool for future quantum frameworks.

AB Polarization-sensitive photodetection plays a critical role in various applications. In this work, we propose a dynamically tunable black phosphorus (BP) photodetector integrated with a Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST225) plasmonic metasurface for mid-infrared polarized light detection. The detector features a chiral gold array within the metasurface, enabling both linear and circular polarization responses. By modulating the crystallization fraction of GST225, the circular dichroism (CD) peak wavelength can be tuned from 3.86 mu m to 4.59 mu m, while adjusting the gold array geometry further extends the tunable CD peak range from 3.42 mu m to 4.71 mu m. Within this range, CD and linear dichroism (LD) values exceed 0.4 and 0.42, respectively, under normal incidence. The detector maintains a stable polarization response across varying incident angles. Electrical analysis confirms that the BP layer exhibits distinct photocur rent responses to different polarization states, including left-handed circularly polarized (LCP), right-handed circularly polarized (RCP), and linearly polarized light along the x-(Lx) and y-axes (Ly). With its tunable polarization selectivity and robust performance, the proposed metasurface photodetector is highly promising for mid-infrared applications in sensing, imaging, and quantum computing and communication.

TI Polymeric Memristors as Entropy Sources for Probabilistic Bit Generation
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Probabilistic bits, or p-bits, represent a novel computational element that bridges the gap between deterministic classical bits and quantum bits (qubits) used in quantum computing. Unlike classical bits that maintain a definite state of 0 or 1, a p-bit fluctuates between these states in a controlled, stochastic manner. This probabilistic behavior allows for the representation and processing of information in a form that leverages inherent randomness. In this study, a unique approach is presented to generating p-bits using a hybrid conjugated polymer, poly-4-((6-(4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrol-4-yl)hexyl)oxy)-N,N-diphenylaniline (pTPADTP), as a memristive material. The polymer's conjugated backbone, combined with pendant triphenylamine groups, enables the creation of p-bits through random resistance switching. The stochasticity of this polymeric memristor makes it particularly suited for p-bit applications in stochastic optimization, probabilistic algorithms, and artificial neural networks. The charge transport in the polymer is facilitated by two synergistic percolation mechanisms: one occurring along the polymer backbone and the other through the pendant triphenylamine groups. The study of p-bits generated from pTPADTP opens new avenues for advancing both the theory and practice of computation, where uncertainty and randomness are harnessed as valuable computational resources.

TI Wafer-Scale Synthesis of Topological Insulator
   Sb2Te3 Thin Films
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Recently, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) has been proven successful to grow topological insulators such as antimony telluride (Sb2Te3), with their use as efficient spin-charge converters at room temperature also being reported. On the other hand, a wafer-scale synthesis of Sb2Te3 thin films showing clear-cut electrical conduction driven by topologically protected surface states is still missing. Within this work, the growth of Sb2Te3 thin films with variable thicknesses over 4-inch (4 '') wafer-scale Si(111) substrates as conducted via MOCVD is reported. By performing magnetoconductance measurements, weak antilocalization phenomena are detected over the whole 4 '' area, thus proving the possibility to produce wafer-scale Sb2Te3 topological insulator thin films. Furthermore, comprehensive information on the variability of the functional properties of Sb2Te3 thin films with their morphological, chemical, and structural properties, as probed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction/reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses is reported. This work provides a breakthrough for the technology scale-up of these novel materials to be employed in future spintronic devices as well as applications in nanoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and quantum computing.

TI Ultraclean two-dimensional hole systems with mobilities exceeding
   107 cm2/Vs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Owing to their large effective mass, strong and tunable spin-orbit coupling, and complex band structure, two-dimensional hole systems (2DHSs) in GaAs quantum wells provide rich platforms to probe exotic many-body physics, while also offering potential applications in ballistic and spintronics devices, and fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. We present here a systematic study of molecular-beam-epitaxy grown, modulation-doped, GaAs (001) 2DHSs where we explore the limits of low-temperature 2DHS mobility by optimizing two parameters, the GaAs quantum well width, and the alloy fraction (x) of the flanking AlxGa1-xAs barriers. We obtain a breakthrough in 2DHS mobility, with a peak value similar or equal to 18 x 10(6) cm(2)/Vs at a density of 3.8 x 10(10) /cm(2), implying a mean free path of similar or equal to 57 mu m. Using transport calculations tailored to our structures, we analyze the operating scattering mechanisms to explain the nonmonotonic evolution of mobility with density. We find it imperative to include the dependence of effective mass on 2DHS density, well width, and x. We observe concomitant improvement in quality as evinced by the appearance of delicate fractional quantum Hall states at very low density.

TI Anonymous Quantum Safe Construction of Three Party Authentication and
   Key Agreement Protocol for Mobile Devices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Once the shared secret key is established, three parties can use it for secure communication using symmetric-key encryption AES (128, 192, 256) algorithms or other cryptographic primitives. Although there are few third-party post-quantum authentication and key agreement protocols exist, but the recent studies in this article show that they are not anonymous or cannot provide forward secrecy. Most of the existing protocols enable adversaries to trace the source of messages. Many of third-party AKA schemes based on conventional public-key cryptosystems are vulnerable to quantum computers. Therefore, this paper contains a forward secure three-party post-quantum authenticated key establishment protocol for mobile devices. The proposed three-party key exchange protocol establishes an authenticated shared key that can be periodically refreshed to maintain forward secrecy. This protocol enables two parties to establish a shared session key even in the presence of quantum adversaries and enables them to communicate confidentially and securely over insecure networks. The protocol is anonymous as both the parties communicate using masked dynamic identities. A contrast study consisting of performance and security assessment is presented, which illustrates the suggested design is more applicable.

TI A Robust Design for Aperture-Level Simultaneous Transmit and Receive
   with Digital Phased Array
SO SENSORS
AB Aperture-level simultaneous transmit and receive (ALSTAR) attempts to utilize adaptive digital transmit and receive beamforming and digital self-interference cancellation methods to establish isolation between the transmit and receive apertures of the single-phase array. However, the existing methods only discuss the isolation of ALSTAR and ignore the radiation efficiency of the transmitter and the sensitivity of the receiver. The ALSTAR array design lacks perfect theoretical support and simplified engineering implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive random group quantum brainstorming optimization (ARGQBSO) algorithm to simplify the array design and improve the overall performance. ARGQBSO is derived from BSO and has been ameliorated in four aspects of the ALSTAR array, including random grouping, initial value presets, dynamic probability functions, and quantum computing. The transmit and receive beamforming carried out by ARGQBSO is robust to all elevation angles, which reduces complexity and is conducive to engineering applications. The simulated results indicate that the ARGQBSO algorithm has an excellent performance, and achieves 166.8 dB of peak EII, 47.1 dBW of peak EIRP, and -94.6 dBm of peak EIS with 1000 W of transmit power in the scenario of an 8-element array.

TI Circularly Polarized Light Detection Through 3D Chiral Metasurface-Based
   Phototransistors
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Distinguishing between different handedness of circularly polarized light can be a useful additional property in photodetector technology. The integration of this functionality can be obtained either using optical media with chiro-optical response, or by the employment of chiral metamaterials. In this work, 3D chiral metasurfaces composed by a 3D helix array, are integrated onto a micrometer-scale silicon-based transistor and act as optical filter for circularly polarized light. The technological process involving focused electron beam induced deposition for helix manufacturing is carefully studied with respect to its effect on the phototransistor response. The integrated system exhibits a photoresponse which is dependent on the circular polarization, with a promising asymmetry factor in the visible spectral range. The proposed technology can pave the way for novel potential applications in diverse areas such as materials science, bioimaging, and quantum computing.
   Three-dimensional (3D) chiral metasurface-based phototransistors are miniature detectors that can distinguish between left- and right-circularly polarized light in the visible spectrum. This capability is enabled by a 3D chiral metasurface, composed of ordered nanohelices, which is integrated onto a micrometer-scale phototransistor using focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID).image

TI Photocatalytic Oxidation in Few-Layer Tellurene for Loss-Invariant
   Integrated Photonic Resonance Trimming
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique physicochemical properties promote photocatalytic activities. As the 2D material composites research studies the statistical average of complex catalytic behaviors, an integrated photonic platform allows for clean and single flake level photo-catalytic investigations with precisely quantified photocatalytic activities. In this paper, fluence-dependent photo-oxidation in two-dimensional Tellurene (2D Te) is tracked by the evanescently coupled micro-resonator. Nearly 32% of oxidation is achieved in approximate to 10 nm 2D Te flake, compared to only 4.5% oxidation in a 30 nm sample, probed by the resonance shift in silicon micro-ring resonators substrate. The wider bandgap in the few layers of 2D Te allows faster charge transfer to adsorbed oxygen for a more efficient photocatalytic redox reaction. The photo-oxidation in hybrid 2D Te results in invariant lineshapes of optical transmission resonance for wavelength trimming (more than 3x resonance bandwidth). The low threshold power, near-infrared, and in-waveguide resonance trimming scheme is compatible with most integrated photonic setups for easy fixing of the nanofabrication-induced random resonance deviation for integrated photonic circuit applications in wavelength-division-multiplexing systems and spin qubits quantum computing.

TI Efficient module learning with errors-based post-quantum
   password-authenticated key exchange
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) is a cryptographic primitive that can establish secure remote communications between the client and the server, especially with the advantage of amplifying memorable passwords into strong session keys. However, the arrival of the quantum computing era has brought new challenges to traditional PAKE protocols. Thus, designing an efficient post-quantum PAKE scheme becomes an open research question. In this paper, the authors construct a quantum-safe PAKE protocol, which is a horizontal extension of the password-authenticated key (PAK) protocol in the field of module lattices. Subsequently, the authors accompany the proposed protocol with a rigorous security proof in the random oracle model with two adaptions: applying the CDF-Zipf model to characterise the ability of the adversary and using the pairing with errors assumption to simplify the proof. Taking the flexibility of the module learning with errors (MLWE) problem, the authors elaborately select three parameter sets to meet different application scenarios. Specifically, the authors' Recommended-PAKE implementation achieves 177-bit post-quantum security with a generous margin to cope with later improvement in cryptanalysis. The performance results indicate that the authors' MLWE-PAKE is quite practical: compared with the latest Yang-PAK, the authors' Recommended-PAK reduces the communication cost and the running time by 36.8% and 13.8%, respectively.

TI Multi-particle quantum walks on 3D integrated photonic chip
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum walks provide a speed-up in computational power for various quantum algorithms and serve as inspiration for the construction of complex graph representations. Many pioneering works have been dedicated to expanding the experimental state space and the complexity of graphs. However, these experiments are mostly limited to small experimental scale, which do not reach a many-body level and fail to reflect the multi-particle quantum interference effects among non-adjacent modes. Here, we present a quantum walk with three photons on a two-dimensional triangular lattice, which is mapped to a 19 x 19 x 19 high-dimensional state space and constructs a complex graph with 6859 nodes and 45,486 edges. By utilizing the statistical signatures of the output combinations and incorporating machine learning techniques, we successfully validate the nonclassical properties of the experiment. Our implementation provides a paradigm for exponentially expanding the state space and graph complexity of quantum walks, paving the way for surmounting the classical regime in large-scale quantum simulations.

TI Manipulating the Spatial Structure of Second-Order Quantum Coherence
   Using Entangled Photons
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB High-order quantum coherence reveals the statistical correlation of quantum particles. Manipulation of quantum coherence of light in the temporal domain enables the production of the single-photon source, which has become one of the most important quantum resources. High-order quantum coherence in the spatial domain plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, such as quantum imaging, holography, and microscopy. However, the active control of second-order spatial quantum coherence remains a challenging task. Here we predict theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the first active manipulation of second-order spatial quantum coherence, which exhibits the capability of switching between bunching and anti-bunching, by mapping the entanglement of spatially structured photons. We also show that signal processing based on quantum coherence exhibits robust resistance to intensity disturbance. Our findings not only enhance existing applications but also pave the way for broader utilization of higher-order spatial quantum coherence.

TI Transport of Majorana bound states in the presence of telegraph noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Majorana bound states (MBSs) have emerged as promising candidates for robust quantum computing due to their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection. In this study, we focus on the dynamical transport of MBSs in the semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure via the piano-key type of setup, wherein each of the keys of the wire can be tuned from topological to trivial phases. We focus on the transport of MBSs under noisy conditions and evaluate the feasibility for realistic scenarios. The central emphasis of our work lies in using both numerical and analytical techniques to understand the effect of noise in inducing diabatic errors during transport and to establish scaling laws that relate these errors to the drive time. To achieve this, we derive an effective model that captures the scaling behavior in both noise-free and noisy scenarios, providing a unified framework for analyzing the transport dynamics. We investigate the optimal number of keys for both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Additionally, we explore the effects of disorder on transport dynamics, highlighting its impact on error scaling and robustness. Our findings provide guiding principles for the design of future MBS-based quantum devices and raise important questions about the interplay between control precision, noise resilience, and scalability in topological quantum architectures.

TI Quantum chimp-enanced SqueezeNet for precise diabetic retinopathy
   classification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Diabetic retinopathy remains a prominent cause of blindness throughout the world, and it is a product of prolonged high blood sugar levels that degrade the retinal blood vessels. This makes early detection of DR critical to stop irreversible blindness from occurring. This paper presents an advanced hybrid approach that utilizes the Quantum Chimp Optimization Algorithm (QCOA) integrated with SqueezeNet to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of DR classification significantly. The novel methodology was divided into two main stages: feature extraction and classification. Firstly, SqueezeNet enables efficient feature extraction from segmented fundus images with minimal computational complexity, ensuring that critical retinal features are captured effectively. The classification process, QCOA optimizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) parameters and performs feature selection. The hybrid system effectively refines the performance of the SVM, consequently increasing the classification accuracies and optimizing the model's performance. By leveraging QCOA's capability to tune SVM parameters precisely, the proposed approach achieves remarkable classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of 99.80%, 99.90%, and 100%, respectively. Fundamentally, the results display the efficiency and practical utility of the proposed approach, and its implementation in real-world clinical settings is likely to significantly improve the rates of early DR reflection and accurate classification for improved patient outcomes.

TI QHopNN: investigating quantum advantage in cryptanalysis using a quantum
   hopfield neural network
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Cryptanalysis is crucial for securing cryptographic systems, particularly with the advent of quantum computing, which threatens traditional encryption methods. Advanced cryptanalytic techniques are essential for developing robust systems that can withstand quantum attacks, ensuring encrypted data remains secure and accessible only to authorized parties. This paper introduces the Quantum Hopfield Neural Network (QHopNN) as a novel approach to enhance key recovery in symmetric ciphers. This research provides valuable insights into integrating quantum principles with neural network architectures, paving the way for more secure and efficient cryptographic systems. By leveraging quantum principles like superposition and entanglement, along with Hopfield networks' pattern recognition and optimization capabilities, QHopNN achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in deciphering encrypted data. Additionally, integrating unitary quantum evolution with dissipative dynamics further enhances the cryptographic robustness and efficiency of QHopNN. The proposed framework is rigorously evaluated using prominent symmetric ciphers, including S-AES and S-DES, and benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate the superiority of QHopNN in key recovery, with a mean Bit Accuracy Probability (BAP) of 0.9706 for S-AES and 0.9815 for S-DES, significantly outperforming current methods. This breakthrough opens new avenues for advancing cryptanalysis and sets the stage for pioneering future research in quantum-inspired cryptographic techniques.

TI Large-Gap Quantum Spin Hall Insulators in Two-Dimensional Hafnium
   Halides: Unraveling the Impact of Strain and Substrate
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators (TIs) or quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators, characterized by insulating 2D electronic band structures and metallic helical edge states protected by time-reversal symmetry, offer a platform for realizing the quantum spin Hall effect, making them promising candidates for future spintronic devices and quantum computing. However, observing a high-temperature quantum spin Hall effect requires large-gap 2D TIs, and only a few 2D systems have been experimentally confirmed to possess this property. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations, combined with a structural search based on an evolutionary algorithm, to predict a class of 2D QSH insulators in hafnium halides, namely, HfF, HfCl, and HfBr with sizable band gaps of 0.12, 0.19, and 0.38 eV. Their topological nontrivial nature is confirmed by a Z2 invariant which equals to 1 and the presence of gapless edge states. Furthermore, the QSH effect in these materials remains robust under biaxial tensile strain of up to 10%, and the use of h-BN as a substrate effectively preserves the QSH states in these materials. Our findings pave the way for future theoretical and experimental investigations of 2D hafnium halides and their potential for realizing the QSH effect.

   Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles: A Comprehensive Review
SO ENERGIES
AB This paper provides a comprehensive review of machine learning strategies and optimization formulations employed in energy management systems (EMS) tailored for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). EMS stands as a pivotal component facilitating optimized power distribution, predictive and adaptive control strategies, component health monitoring, and energy harvesting, thereby enabling the maximal exploitation of resources through optimal operation. Recent advancements have introduced innovative solutions such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), machine learning-based techniques, real-time optimization algorithms, hybrid optimization approaches, and the integration of fuzzy logic with neural networks, significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of EMS. Additionally, multi-objective optimization, stochastic and robust optimization methods, and emerging quantum computing approaches are pushing the boundaries of EMS capabilities. Remarkable advancements have been made in data-driven modeling, decision-making, and real-time adjustments, propelling machine learning and optimization to the forefront of enhanced control systems for vehicular applications. However, despite these strides, there remain unexplored research avenues and challenges awaiting investigation. This review synthesizes existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and underscores the importance of continued inquiry to address unanswered research questions, thereby propelling the field toward further advancements in PHEV EMS design and implementation.

TI Challenges of variational quantum optimization with measurement shot
   noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum enhanced optimization of classical cost functions is a central theme of quantum computing due to its high potential value in science and technology. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are popular variational approaches that are considered the most viable solutions in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Here, we study the scaling of the quantum resources, defined as the required number of circuit repetitions, to reach a fixed success probability as the problem size increases, focusing on the role played by measurement shot noise, which is unavoidable in realistic implementations. Simple and reproducible problem instances are addressed, namely, the ferromagnetic and disordered Ising chains. Our results show that: (1) VQE with the standard heuristic Ansatz scales comparably to direct brute-force search when energy-based optimizers are employed. The performance improves at most quadratically using a gradient-based optimizer. (2) When the parameters are optimized from random guesses, also the scaling of QAOA implies problematically long absolute runtimes for large problem sizes. (3) QAOA becomes practical when supplemented with a physically inspired initialization of the parameters. Our results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical algorithms should possibly avoid a brute force classical outer loop, but focus on smart parameters initialization.

TI Dynamics of Fricke-Painleve VI Surfaces
SO DYNAMICS
AB The symmetries of a Riemann surface Sigma\{a(i)} with n punctures ai are encoded in its fundamental group pi(1)(Sigma). Further structure may be described through representations (homomorphisms) of pi 1 over a Lie group G as globalized by the character variety C=Hom(pi(1),G)/G. Guided by our previous work in the context of topological quantum computing (TQC) and genetics, we specialize on the four-punctured Riemann sphere Sigma=S-2((4)) and the 'space-time-spin' group G=SL2(C). In such a situation, C possesses remarkable properties: (i) a representation is described by a three-dimensional cubic surface V-a,V-b,V-c,V-d(x,y,z) with three variables and four parameters; (ii) the automorphisms of the surface satisfy the dynamical (non-linear and transcendental) Painleve VI equation (or P-VI); and (iii) there exists a finite set of 1 (Cayley-Picard)+3 (continuous platonic)+45 (icosahedral) solutions of PVI. In this paper, we feature the parametric representation of some solutions of P-VI: (a) solutions corresponding to algebraic surfaces such as the Klein quartic and (b) icosahedral solutions. Applications to the character variety of finitely generated groups f(p) encountered in TQC or DNA/RNA sequences are proposed.

AB The Signal protocol is used by billions of people for instant messaging in applications such as Facebook Messenger, Google Messages, Signal, Skype, and WhatsApp. However, advances in quantum computing threaten the security of the cornerstone of this protocol: the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. There actually are resistant alternatives, called post-quantum secure, but replacing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange with these new primitives requires a deep revision of the associated security proof. While the security of the current Signal protocol has been extensively studied with hand-written proofs and computer-verified symbolic analyses, its quantum-resistant variants lack symbolic security analyses.
   In this work, we present the first symbolic security model for post-quantum variants of the Signal protocol. Our model focuses on the core state machines of the two main sub-protocols of Signal: the X3DH handshake, and the so-called double ratchet protocol. Then we show, with an automated proof using the Tamarin prover, that instantiated with the Hashimoto-Katsumata-Kwiatkowski-Prest post-quantum Signal's handshake from PKC'21, and the Alwen-Coretti-Dodis KEM-based double ratchet from EUROCRYPT'19, the resulting post-quantum Signal protocol has equivalent security properties to its current classical counterpart.

AB Quantum computing has been rapidly expanding, and many platforms for writing programs that can be compiled and run on quantum hardware (or simulated) are being developed. As with any compiler, transformation correctness is paramount as the machine readable code must maintain program semantics. Quantum programs are challenging to test given a lack of benchmark programs and the difficulty of defining an oracle. MorphQ solves both of these challenges by (1) generating syntactically correct quantum programs and (2) using metamorphic testing to avoid the oracle problem. However, Qiskit, the compiler it was built for, is rapidly evolving. This paper is a reproducibility study of the MorphQ platform, which we call MorphQ++. We have updated the core MorphQ engine to work on a newer version of Qiskit and added new metamorphic transformations. We find that our overall results are similar: we find a portion of the original faults (which were not yet fixed) and the distributions of types are not very different. Our new transformations lead to several new faults, suggesting there is room to expand the core framework. Additionally, we note the lack of power of the metamorphic relations in this context and suggest the need for more sophisticated relations and/or oracle evaluations.

TI Discovery and construction of surface kagome electronic states induced
   by p-d electronic hybridization in
   Co3Sn2S2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Kagome-lattice materials possess attractive properties for quantum computing applications, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, based on the compelling identification of the two cleavable surfaces of Co3Sn2S2, we show surface kagome electronic states (SKESs) on a Sn-terminated triangular Co3Sn2S2 surface. Such SKESs are imprinted by vertical p-d electronic hybridization between the surface Sn (subsurface S) atoms and the buried Co kagome-lattice network in the Co3Sn layer under the surface. Owing to the subsequent lateral hybridization of the Sn and S atoms in a corner-sharing manner, the kagome symmetry and topological electronic properties of the Co3Sn layer is proximate to the Sn surface. The SKESs and both hybridizations were verified via qPlus non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) and density functional theory calculations. The construction of SKESs with tunable properties can be achieved by the atomic substitution of surface Sn (subsurface S) with other group III-V elements (Se or Te), which was demonstrated theoretically. This work exhibits the powerful capacity of nc-AFM in characterizing localized topological states and reveals the strategy for synthesis of large-area transition-metal-based kagome-lattice materials using conventional surface deposition techniques.

TI Perturbative readout-error mitigation for near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Readout errors on near-term quantum computers can introduce significant error to the empirical probability distribution sampled from the output of a quantum circuit. These errors can be mitigated by classical postprocessing given the access of an experimental response matrix that describes the error associated with the measurement of each computational basis state. However, the resources required to characterize a complete response matrix and to compute the corrected probability distribution scale exponentially with the number of qubits, n. In this work, we modify standard matrix inversion techniques using perturbative approximations with significantly reduced complexity and bounded error when the likelihood of high-order bit-flip events is strongly suppressed. Given a characteristic error rate q, we discuss a method to recover the probability of the all-zeros bit string p0 by sampling only a small subspace of the response matrix before inverting readout error, resulting in a relative speedup of poly[2n/(nw)], which we motivate using a simplified error model for which the approximation incurs only O(qw) error for some integer w. We then provide a generalized technique to efficiently recover full output distributions with O(qw) error in the perturbative limit. These approximate techniques for readout-error correction may greatly accelerate near-term quantum computing applications.

TI Controlling the polarization of chiral dipolar emission with a spherical
   dielectric nanoantenna
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) carrying spin angular momentum is crucial to many applications, such as quantum computing, optical communication, novel displays, and biosensing. Nonetheless, the emission from chiral molecules contains comparable CPL components with opposite handedness, resulting in low levels of CPL overall with a small dissymmetry factor and fixed handedness consistent with the handedness of the molecules. Nanoantennas have proved to be useful tools for controlling the emission properties of quantum emitters. In particular, dielectric resonators support electric and magnetic modes, which implies unparalleled opportunities to interact with chiral molecules whose emission originates from both electric and magnetic dipole transitions. In this work, we theoretically study the effects of a spherical dielectric nanoantenna on the directionality and polarization of emission from a chiral molecule. With exact analytical solutions based on generalized Mie theory, we show that directional chiral light emission and nontrivial polarization modulation, such as handedness reversal or chirality enhancement, can be achieved simultaneously for a chiral dipole tangentially coupled with a silicon nanosphere. The influence of the relative strength and orientation between the electric and magnetic dipole moments is also discussed. Our results suggest a new approach to controlling chiral dipolar emission and could benefit the development of chiral light sources.

TI Quantum confinement of the Dirac surface states in topological-insulator
   nanowires
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The non-trivial topology of three-dimensional topological insulators dictates the appearance of gapless Dirac surface states. Intriguingly, when made into a nanowire, quantum confinement leads to a peculiar gapped Dirac sub-band structure. This gap is useful for, e.g., future Majorana qubits based on TIs. Furthermore, these sub-bands can be manipulated by a magnetic flux and are an ideal platform for generating stable Majorana zero modes, playing a key role in topological quantum computing. However, direct evidence for the Dirac sub-bands in TI nanowires has not been reported so far. Here, using devices fabricated from thin bulk-insulating (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 nanowires we show that non-equidistant resistance peaks, observed upon gate-tuning the chemical potential across the Dirac point, are the unique signatures of the quantized sub-bands. These TI nanowires open the way to address the topological mesoscopic physics, and eventually the Majorana physics when proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. In topological insulator nanowires quantized Dirac sub-bands are expected, but direct evidence is still missing. Here, the authors report signatures of sub-bands in the gate-voltage dependence of the resistance by tuning the chemical potential in (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 nanowires through the Dirac point.

The coupling strengths between different coupling points are considered as complex numbers with phases. For each coupling configuration, the nonreciprocal excitation dynamics and entanglement properties, which results from the phase differences of coupling strength and the phase induced by photon propagation between the two coupling points, are studied both in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The analytical solutions for nonreciprocal entanglement degree are given in the Markovian regime. It shows that the steady entanglement can be reached and strongly depends on the phases. Different from the case of the Markovian regime, the entanglement degree shows oscillating behavior in the non-Markovian regime. This work may find applications in the generation and controlling of entanglement in quantum networks based on waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

TI Discrete optimization: A quantum revolution?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB We develop several quantum procedures and investigate their potential to solve discrete optimization problems. First, we introduce a binary search procedure and illustrate how it can be used to effectively solve the binary knapsack problem. Next, we introduce two other procedures: a hybrid branch-and-bound procedure that allows to exploit the structure of the problem and a random-ascent procedure that can be used to solve problems that have no clear structure and/or are difficult to solve using traditional methods. We explain how to assess the performance of these procedures and perform an elaborate computational experiment. Our results show that we can match the worst-case performance of the best classical algorithms when solving the binary knapsack problem. After improving and generalizing our procedures, we show that they can be used to solve any discrete optimization problem. To illustrate, we show how to solve the quadratic binary knapsack problem. For this problem, our procedures outperform the best classical algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate that our procedures can be used as heuristics to find (near-) optimal solutions in limited time Not only does our work provide the tools required to explore a myriad of future research directions, it also shows that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of discrete optimization.

TI Inverse Design of Unitary Transmission Matrices in Silicon Photonic
   Coupled Waveguide Arrays Using a Neural Adjoint Model
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The development of low-loss reconfigurable integrated optical devices enables further research into technologies including photonic signal processing, analogue quantum computing, and optical neural networks. Here, we introduce digital patterning of coupled waveguide arrays as a platform capable of implementing unitary matrix operations. Determining the required device geometry for a specific optical output is computationally challenging and requires a robust and versatile inverse design protocol. In this work we present an approach using high speed neural network surrogate-based gradient optimization, capable of predicting patterns of refractive index perturbations based on switching of the ultralow loss chalcogenide phase change material, antimony triselinide (Sb2Se3). Results for a 3 x 3 silicon waveguide array are presented, demonstrating control of both amplitude and phase for each transmission matrix element. Network performance is studied using neural network optimization tools such as data set augmentation and supplementation with random noise, resulting in an average fidelity of 0.94 for unitary matrix targets. Our results show that coupled waveguide arrays with perturbation patterns offer new routes for achieving programmable unitary operators, or Hamiltonians for quantum simulators, with a reduced footprint compared to conventional interferometer-mesh technology.

AB Weighted model counting (#SAT) has recently been shown to deliver a promising new method for tackling core problems in quantum circuit analysis. However, the development of weighted model counting tools is currently strongly motivated by applications in the domain of probabilistic computing, where weights consist of positive probabilities. Quantum computing, on the other hand, deals with complex amplitudes, which include the negative domain and are subject to the l(2) norm, contrary to the l(1) norm used for probabilities. The current paper explores reductions from quantum circuit semantics to weighted model counting over the complex, real, natural and integer numbers (e.g., #SAT(C), #SAT(R), etc.), and various sub(semi)rings of those. This study thereby charts tradeoffs between counting over simpler algebras and the costs of the reduction. While previous works recommend the use of different (semi)rings, like those including negative numbers, we can now more precisely state the tradeoff introduced by this change as (polynomial) blowup of the length of the encoding as #SAT formula, the number of variables and the structure of the formula. Moreover, our final encoding to #SAT({0,1}) (unweighted model counting) represents an exact solution, obviating the need for floating-point calculations that could potentially cause numerical instability.

TI Fast electron initiated electron-hole pair creation in semiconductors
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Through Monte Carlo modeling, it is shown that the statistics of electron-hole pair creation in semiconductors (and by extension, presumably, ion-pair creation in gas proportional counters) are substantially different for fast electrons (and by extension, presumably, alpha particles, ions, etc.) cf. x-ray/gamma-ray photons. New variables are introduced to quantify the differences in the statistics: the loss parameter, zeta(E '), which acts on the average e(-)-h(+) pair creation energy; and the broadening factor, B(E '), which acts on the Fano factor. E ' is the initial energy of the fast electron. zeta(E ') and B(E ') are computed for a variety of semiconductor materials. A new equation for the statistically limited energy resolution of a particle counting fast electron spectrometer is established. This new equation supersedes and replaces that for the Fano-limited energy resolution of a particle counting fast electron spectrometer. The implications impact a wide variety of fields wherever fast electrons (or alpha particles, ions, etc.) and/or Fano statistics are used; this includes, inter alia, quantum computing, x-ray excitonics, space science, optoelectronics, nuclear engineering, particle physics, photovoltaics, and even neural response variability in the brain.

TI Electric field-tuneable crossing of hole Zeeman splitting and orbital
   gaps in compressively strained germanium semiconductor on silicon
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB With the emergence of the quantum computing era, the spin physics of engineered semiconductor materials with large and tuneable effective g*-factor, which is a measure of the interaction between the magnetic field and the spin of the particle, has become of great interest because it offers new physics and engineering tools for spin's manipulation and its addressable control. Here we suggest a semi-empirical method to determine out of plane effective g*-factor in high mobility 2D hole heterostructures. We experimentally study the electric-field tuneablity of effective g*-factor of holes in a strained germanium quantum well heterostructure. As a result of the material's engineering, the g*-factor can be tuned in a large range from 13 to 24 that corresponds to the tuneable Zeeman spin splitting of heavy holes in the range from smaller, to equal, and to larger than the orbital Landau level quantization gap.
   Tuning the effective g-factor of semiconductors by a perpendicular electric field is essential for designing controllable spin-based devices such as qubits and spin field-effect transistors. Here, a wide-range g-factor tunability by external electric field is demonstrated in a high-mobility 2D hole heterostructure.

TI Breakdown of conventional winding number calculation in one-dimensional
   lattices with interactions beyond nearest neighbors
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Topological insulators hold promises to realize exotic quantum phenomena in electronic, photonic, and phononic systems. Conventionally, topological indices, such as winding numbers, have been used to predict the number of topologically protected domain-wall states (TPDWSs) in topological insulators, a signature of the topological phenomenon called bulk-edge correspondence. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the number of TPDWSs in a mechanical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model can be higher than the winding number depending on the strengths of beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions, revealing the breakdown of the winding number prediction. Alternatively, we resort to the Berry connection to accurately characterize the number and spatial features of TPDWSs in SSH systems, further confirmed by the Jackiw-Rebbi theory proving that the multiple TPDWSs correspond to the bulk Dirac cones. Our findings deepen the understanding of complex network dynamics and offer a generalized paradigm for precise TPDWS prediction in potential applications involving localized vibrations, such as drug delivery and quantum computing.
   Topological insulators are bulk insulators with conducting zero-energy edge states conventionally predicted by topological indices, such as winding numbers in one-dimensional lattices. Here, the authors use the Jackiw-Rebbi theory to reveal that the number of topologically protected zero-energy states can be higher than the winding number.

TI Exploring Majorana zero modes in iron-based superconductors
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are Majorana-fermion-like quasiparticles existing in crystals or hybrid platforms with topologically non-trivial electronic structures. They obey non-Abelian braiding statistics and are considered promising to realize topological quantum computing. Discovery of MZM in the vortices of the iron-based superconductors (IBSs) has recently fueled the Majorana research in a way which not only removes the material barrier requiring construction of complicated hybrid artificial structures, but also enables observation of pure MZMs under higher temperatures. So far, MZMs have been observed in iron-based superconductors including FeTe0.55Se0.45, (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFeSe, CaKFe4As4, and LiFeAs. In this topical review, we present an overview of the recent STM studies on the MZMs in IBSs. We start with the observation of MZMs in the vortices in FeTe0.55Se0.45 and discuss the pros and cons of FeTe0.55Se0.45 compared with other platforms. We then review the following up discovery of MZMs in vortices of CaKFe4As4, impurity-assisted vortices of LiFeAs, and quantum anomalous vortices in FeTe0.55Se0.45, illustrating the pathway of the developments of MZM research in IBSs. Finally, we give perspective on future experimental works in this field.

TI Dirac lines and loop at the Fermi level in the time-reversal symmetry
   breaking superconductor LaNiGa2
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Unconventional superconductors have Cooper pairs with lower symmetries than in conventional superconductors. In most unconventional superconductors, the additional symmetry breaking occurs in relation to typical ingredients such as strongly correlated Fermi liquid phases, magnetic fluctuations, or strong spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric structures. In this article, we show that the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconductor LaNiGa2 is enabled by its previously unknown topological electronic band structure, with Dirac lines and a Dirac loop at the Fermi level. Two symmetry related Dirac points even remain degenerate under spin-orbit coupling. These unique topological features enable an unconventional superconducting gap in which time-reversal symmetry can be broken in the absence of other typical ingredients. Our findings provide a route to identify a new type of unconventional superconductors based on nonsymmorphic symmetries and will enable future discoveries of topological crystalline superconductors.
   Topological superconducting systems are expected to exhibit a range of exotic physics which are particularly useful for application in quantum computing technologies. Here, the authors report the synthesis of LaNiGa2 which exhibits both topological and superconducting features originating from its nonsymmorphic crystal structure.

TI Tunneling optoelectronic resistance effect in two-dimensional
   optoelectronic superlattices
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We propose and investigate the tunneling optoelectronic resistance effect in planar optoelectronic superlattices based on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. It is found that in the low incident energy regions, the transmission spectra show ideal line-type resonant bands for both identical and different optical helicity configurations of the periodic superlattices. By tuning the helicity of off-resonant circularly polarized light irradiated on adjacent modulated regions, the tunneling optoresistance effect can be realized. We find that this effect can be significantly enhanced by applying a positive gate voltage to the optical superlattices, which is named tunneling optoelectronic resistance (TOER) effect, and the intensity of the gate voltage can also affect the TOER effect greatly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TOER effect can be weakly enhanced by increasing the modulated periods of superlattices. Our results show that the total conductance differences between optoelectronic superlattices with different configurations may be dynamically tuned by the gate voltage and modulated periods, indicating that it has broad application prospects in high-speed storage, quantum computing, and spintronic or valleytronic devices.

TI Advancement in Colloidal Metasurfaces: Approaches for Scalable Photonic
   Devices
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB This perspective article addresses the potential of colloidal metasurfaces composed of emitting and plasmonic nanoparticles to advance applications in nanophotonics. Leveraging the synergy of advanced laser interference lithography (LIL) and template-assisted self-assembly (TASA), the latest advances in directed self-assembly of nanoparticles, enabling precise manipulation of photonic properties, are presented. These methods enable improved photonic responses, such as increased emission intensity, directional enhancement, and tunable photonic bandgaps. Key to this approach is the rational design of nanostructures that optimize the interactions between localized and collective optical modes to achieve synergistic improvements in photonic functionality through mechanisms such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and hybridized guided mode resonances (hGMRs). Developments in metasurface design, supported by theoretical studies and simulations that demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of this hybrid fabrication approach, are emphasized. Key applications include high-efficiency light-emitting devices, low-threshold lasing, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with high sensitivity and large-area uniformity. These advances in the colloidal approach improve low-loss sensing and provide the platform for transformative photonic technologies such as quantum computing, secure communication networks, and advanced optoelectronic systems.

TI The Study of Soliton Mode-Locked and Bound States in Erbium-Doped Fiber
   Lasers Based on Cr2S3 Saturable Absorbers
SO MATERIALS
AB Femtosecond fiber lasers are widely utilized across various fields and also serve as an ideal platform for studying soliton dynamics. Bound-state solitons, as a significant soliton dynamic phenomenon, attract widespread attention and research interest because of their potential applications in high-speed optical communication, all-optical information storage, quantum computing, optical switching, and high-resolution spectroscopy. We investigate the effects of pump power variations on the formation of mode-locked solitons and bound-state solitons in a femtosecond fiber laser with a Cr2S3 saturable absorber (SA) through numerical simulations while observing the transition, formation, and break-up process of bound soliton pulses. By optimizing the cavity structure and adjusting the net dispersion, the mode-locked soliton is obtained based on this SA. This is the narrowest solitons produced by this SA to date, exhibiting the smallest time-bandwidth product. Moreover, stable double-bound solitons and unique (2 + 1) triple-bound solitons are successfully obtained. The diverse bound-state solitons not only demonstrate the excellent nonlinear absorption properties of Cr2S3 as a saturable absorber but also expand the scope of applications for Cr2S3 saturable absorbers in fiber lasers.

TI Quantum search algorithm for binary constant weight codes
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A binary constant weight code is a type of error-correcting code with a wide range of applications. The problem of finding a binary constant weight code has long been studied as a combinatorial optimization problem in coding theory. In this paper, we propose a quantum search algorithm for binary constant weight codes. Specifically, the search problem is formulated as a polynomial binary optimization problem and Grover adaptive search is used for providing the quadratic speedup. Focusing on the inherent structure of the problem, we derive an upper bound on the minimum of the objective function value and a lower bound on the exact number of solutions. By exploiting these two bounds, we successfully reduced the constant overhead of the algorithm, although the overall query complexity remains exponential due to the NP-complete nature of the problem. In our algebraic analysis, it was found that this proposed algorithm is capable of reducing the number of required qubits, thus enhancing the feasibility. Additionally, our simulations demonstrated that it reduces the average number of classical iterations by 63% as well as the average number of total Grover rotations by 31%. The proposed approach may be useful for other quantum search algorithms and optimization problems.

TI Experimental study of TeO2 anomalous acousto-optic deflector
   for manipulating neutral atom arrays
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Neutral atom arrays have emerged as one of the most promising physical platforms for quantum computing and quantum information processing due to their precise single-atom control and tunable strong interactions. The acousto-optic deflector (AOD) is a key device for constructing and manipulating neutral atom arrays, enabling rapid and high-precision atom trapping and arrangement. However, TeO2-based anomalous Bragg AODs still face challenges in practical applications, such as unclear broadband diffraction conditions, polarization sensitivity, and low efficiency, which limit their performance in multi-degree-of-freedom control. This study investigates the acousto-optic effects in AOD and acousto-optic modulator (AOM), and reveals their differences in diffraction efficiency, polarization characteristics, and applications. By adjusting the azimuthal angle of the AOD, we measure the efficiency and RF bandwidth of the +/- 1st-order diffracted beams under horizontal and vertical polarization incident light, and propose an experimental method to determine the broadband diffraction center frequency and diffraction order. Additionally, we systematically characterize the operational parameters of AOM, clarifying their performance mechanisms and application-specific differences compared with those of AOD. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) The beam deflection performance of an AOD is closely related to the ultrasonic mode or acoustic velocity: a lower sound velocity results in a larger deflection angles. For TeO2 crystals, when a shear wave propagates along the [110] axis (sound velocity: 0.617 km/s), the diffraction angle reaches 0.842 mrad/MHz (laser wavelength: 532 nm). In contrast, when TeO2 is used in AOM with a longitudinal wave along the [001] axis (sound velocity: 4.26 km/s), the diffraction angle decreases to 0.133 mrad/MHz under the same wavelength. 2) To achieve high diffraction efficiency and a broad operational frequency range, the AOD must satisfy the phase-matching condition for anomalous Bragg diffraction. Taking the AOD (model: AA DTSX-250) for example, it operates in a unidirectional incident mode: when horizontally polarized light (extro-ordinary light) is incident, only the -1st-order diffracted beam satisfies the anomalous Bragg condition. The beam undergoes polarization conversion to vertically polarized light (ordinary light), enabling high-efficiency broadband deflection (center frequency: 82 MHz, bandwidth: 45 MHz). To support future two-dimensional deflection implementations, the input and output surfaces of the TeO2 crystal are fabricated with slight bevel angles, ensuring collinearity between the -1st-order diffracted beam and the incident beam at the center frequency. In other cases-(i) +1st-order diffraction of horizontally polarized light and (ii) +/- 1st-order diffraction of vertically polarized light-the anomalous Bragg condition is not met. These beams retain their original polarization and allow only narrowband deflection. These results demonstrate that AODs, leveraging anomalous acousto-optic effects, can achieve high diffraction efficiency, wide frequency tuning ranges, and large deflection angles, making them suitable for high-speed, high-precision beam steering applications. In contrast, AOMs utilize normal acousto-optic effects to perform rapid modulation of beam intensity, frequency, and phase, and are widely used in laser communication and optical fiber transmission.
   This study provides a detailed technical reference for understanding the operational principles of AODs and their applications in programmable neutral atom arrays.

TI Fermionic Reduced Density Low-Rank Matrix Completion, Noise Filtering,
   and Measurement Reduction in Quantum Simulations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Fermionic reduced density matrices summarize the key observables in Fermionic systems. In electronic systems, the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) is sufficient to determine the energy and most physical observables of interest. Here, we consider the possibility of using matrix completion to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix to chemical accuracy from partial information. We consider the case of noiseless matrix completion, where the partial information corresponds to a subset of the 2-RDM elements, as well as noisy completion, where the partial information corresponds to both a subset of elements and statistical noise in their values. Through experiments on a set of 24 molecular systems, we find that 2-RDM can be efficiently reconstructed from a reduced amount of information. In the case of noisy completion, this results in a multiple orders of magnitude reduction in the number of measurements needed to determine the 2-RDM with chemical accuracy. These techniques can be readily applied to both classical and quantum algorithms for quantum simulations.

TI Quantum States Imaging of Magnetic Field Contours Based on Autler-Townes
   Effect in Ytterbium Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB An intercombination transition in Yb enables a novel approach for rapidly imaging magnetic field variations with excellent spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. This quantum imaging magnetometer reveals "dark stripes" that are contours of constant magnetic field visible by eye or capturable by standard cameras. These dark lines result from a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and the spatial Hanle effect in the 1S0-3P1 transition of Yb when driven by multiple strong coherent laser fields (carrier and AM/FM modulation sidebands of a single-mode 556 nm laser). We show good agreement between experimental data and our theoretical model for the closed, 4-level Zeeman shifted V system and demonstrate scalar and vector magnetic field measurements at video frame rates over spatial dimensions of 5 cm with 0.1 mm resolution. Additionally, the 1S0-3P1 transition allows for similar to mu s response time and a large dynamic range (from microtesla to many tesla).

TI Two-beam coupling in the production of quantum correlated images by
   four-wave mixing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate the effect of 2-beam coupling in different imaging geometries in generating intensity-difference squeezing from four-wave mixing (4WM) in Rb atomic vapors. A recently-introduced dual-seeding technique can cancel out the classical noise in a seeded four-wave mixing process. This dual-seeding technique, however, can introduce new complications that involve 2-beam coupling between different seeded spatial modes in the atomic vapor and can ruin squeezing at frequencies on the order of the atomic linewidth and below. This complicates some forms of quantum imaging using these systems. Here we show that seeding the 4WM process with skew rays can eliminate the excess noise caused by 2-beam coupling. To avoid 2-beam coupling in bright, seeded images, it is important to re-image the object in the gain medium, instead of focussing through it.

TI Liquid-liquid equilibrium measurements and computational study of
   salt-polymer aqueous two phase system for extraction of analgesic drugs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In recent decades, aqueous two phase systems have gained a lot of attention for extraction of different materials. In this work, an aqueous two phase system was made by polyethylene glycol 600 and potassium hydroxide and phase diagram were determined for this system. The experimental binodal data were described using two empirical nonlinear three parameter expressions developed by Merchuk and Zafarani-Moattar. The consistency of the experimental tie-line data was determined by utilizing the Othmer-Tobias, Bancraft, and Setschenow correlations. Also, the extraction of two analgesic drugs, namely ibuprofen and acetaminophen were investigated by the mentioned ATPS. For this purpose, partition coefficients and extraction efficiencies of each drug were calculated. The trend of extraction efficiencies indicated that the responsibility of extraction of the mentioned drugs into the polymer-rich top phase is related to their hydrophobicity. The Diamond-Hsu equation and its modified version were used to correlate the drugs experimental partition coefficients. Furthermore, the interaction of mentioned drugs with polyethylene glycol was investigated employing quantum computing techniques based upon density functional theory (DFT). These results were in good agreement with the trend of extraction efficiencies of studied drugs.

TI Scanning Probe Lithography: State-of-the-Art and Future Perspectives
SO MICROMACHINES
AB High-throughput and high-accuracy nanofabrication methods are required for the ever-increasing demand for nanoelectronics, high-density data storage devices, nanophotonics, quantum computing, molecular circuitry, and scaffolds in bioengineering used for cell proliferation applications. The scanning probe lithography (SPL) nanofabrication technique is a critical nanofabrication method with great potential to evolve into a disruptive atomic-scale fabrication technology to meet these demands. Through this timely review, we aspire to provide an overview of the SPL fabrication mechanism and the state-the-art research in this area, and detail the applications and characteristics of this technique, including the effects of thermal aspects and chemical aspects, and the influence of electric and magnetic fields in governing the mechanics of the functionalized tip interacting with the substrate during SPL. Alongside this, the review also sheds light on comparing various fabrication capabilities, throughput, and attainable resolution. Finally, the paper alludes to the fact that a majority of the reported literature suggests that SPL has yet to achieve its full commercial potential and is currently largely a laboratory-based nanofabrication technique used for prototyping of nanostructures and nanodevices.

TI Pretrained Quantum-Inspired Deep Neural Network for Natural Language
   Processing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB Natural language processing (NLP) may face the inexplicable "black-box" problem of parameters and unreasonable modeling for lack of embedding of some characteristics of natural language, while the quantum-inspired models based on quantum theory may provide a potential solution. However, the essential prior knowledge and pretrained text features are often ignored at the early stage of the development of quantum-inspired models. To attacking the above challenges, a pretrained quantum-inspired deep neural network is proposed in this work, which is constructed based on quantum theory for carrying out strong performance and great interpretability in related NLP fields. Concretely, a quantum-inspired pretrained feature embedding (QPFE) method is first developed to model superposition states for words to embed more textual features. Then, a QPFE-ERNIE model is designed by merging the semantic features learned from the prevalent pretrained model ERNIE, which is verified with two NLP downstream tasks: 1) sentiment classification and 2) word sense disambiguation (WSD). In addition, schematic quantum circuit diagrams are provided, which has potential impetus for the future realization of quantum NLP with quantum device. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate QPFE-ERNIE is significantly better for sentiment classification than gated recurrent unit (GRU), BiLSTM, and TextCNN on five datasets in all metrics and achieves better results than ERNIE in accuracy, F1-score, and precision on two datasets (CR and SST), and it also has advantage for WSD over the classical models, including BERT (improves F1-score by 5.2 on average) and ERNIE (improves F1-score by 4.2 on average) and improves the F1-score by 8.7 on average compared with a previous quantum-inspired model QWSD. QPFE-ERNIE provides a novel pretrained quantum-inspired model for solving NLP problems, and it lays a foundation for exploring more quantum-inspired models in the future.

TI Research on the application and flux pinning of practical
   high-temperature superconductors
SO MATERIALS TODAY ELECTRONICS
AB Superconducting materials exhibit the zero-resistance effect, the Meissner effect, and the quantum tunneling effect (Josephson effect). Therefore, they possess profound practical significance and immense developmental prospects in diverse domains, such as electric power, healthcare, transportation, quantum computing, energy, national defense and scientific experimentation. The critical current density (Jc) serves as the fundamental metric for evaluating the current carrying performance of superconducting materials in practical applications, which is predominantly influenced by three factors, namely the intrinsic physical properties, intergranular connectivity, and flux pinning performance. Among them, the flux pinning performance is the significant parameter of superconducting materials to determine the current carrying capacity under magnetic field. Therefore, the enhancement of flux pinning properties has become a central focus in contemporary superconducting research. This review briefly introduced the theoretical foundations of flux pinning mechanisms in superconducting materials. Furthermore, a comparative analysis was conducted on the introduction technologies of artificial pinning centers, including particle irradiation, elemental doping and second-phase particle embedding, across high-temperature superconducting material of BSCCO, REBCO, MgB2, and iron-based superconductors. Finally, the prospects for the enhancement strategies of flux pinning in practical high-temperature superconducting materials were discussed.

TI Argon Ion Treatment of Multi-Material Layered Surface-Electrode Traps
   for Noise Mitigation
SO ENTROPY
AB Electric-field noise near ion-trap electrodes limits motional coherence and represents a key obstacle to scaling trapped-ion quantum systems. Here, we investigate how in situ Ar+ sputtering modifies motional heating and dephasing in multi-material surface-electrode traps. Trapped ions serve as local probes of electric-field fluctuations before and after controlled sputtering cycles. The data reveal a non-monotonic dependence of both the dephasing rate and the electric-field noise on the extent of Ar+ sputtering, with coherence initially improving while heating rates increase, followed by a reversal at longer exposures. This behavior highlights the intricate balance between beneficial surface cleaning and detrimental structural modification, driven by changes in surface morphology, redeposition of sputtered material, and diffusion on the surface, underscoring the complex interplay between surface composition and motional stability in multi-material electrode systems. Post-treatment scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm significant modification of the multilayer structure. Technical noise was independently verified to be well below the observed levels. These findings indicate that in situ sputtering modifies surface properties in ways that can either mitigate or enhance electric-field noise, underscoring the need for precise control of material interfaces in next-generation ion-trap architectures.

TI Coexistence of Multiple Topological Phases and High-Order Topology in 2D
   V2CS2, Cr2CS2, and
   Mn2CS2
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This study investigates the topological properties of 2D V2CS2, Cr2CS2, and Mn2CS2 using first-principles calculations. The rare coexistence of different topological fermion types is uncovered within single materials: V2CS2 hosts both type-I and type-II Dirac points, while the spin-down channel of ferromagnetic Cr2CS2 exhibits both type-I and type-II Weyl points. In contrast, Mn2CS2 is identified as an antiferromagnetic insulator (gap similar to 375 meV), and the spin-up channel of Cr2CS2 is insulating (gap similar to 28 meV). We demonstrate that biaxial strain can tune the fermion topology, transforming type-II into type-III fermions, while type-I fermions remain robust. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces gaps at type-I points (similar to 20-24 meV) but leaves type-II fermions gapless, indicating their robustness against SOC. Furthermore, the spin-up channel of Cr2CS2 and Mn2CS2 is identified as magnetic high-order topological insulators (HOTIs). This is confirmed by calculations of quantized fractional corner charges (e/3) protected by C-3 symmetry and the identification of topological corner states using tight-binding models. These findings reveal a rich topological landscape in these materials, offering potential for fundamental research and applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

TI Quantum Safe Multi-Factor User Authentication Protocol for
   Cloud-Assisted Medical IoT
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare by integrating wireless communication and cloud computing to enhance medical practices. However, this framework presents security vulnerabilities, such as the risk of eavesdroppers exploiting public channels to intercept sensitive patient data or impersonate legitimate devices and services. Consequently, authentication between wearable devices and servers is essential before transmitting confidential information through open channels. While several authentication techniques offer protection against quantum attacks, they often incur high communication and computation costs, underscoring the need for further advancement. This paper introduces a multifactor authentication protocol designed to strengthen the integrity of cloud-assisted MIoT systems by incorporating post-quantum security. The proposed protocol utilizes a post-quantum fuzzy commitment (PQFC) scheme to enhance security and is rigorously analyzed under the random oracle model and ProVerif tool. Its functionality and security are thoroughly assessed, demonstrating adherence to key requirements such as memoryless operation, user anonymity, mutual authentication, and resistance to various threats, including biometric tampering, stolen-verifier attacks, and insider attacks. Additionally, a comprehensive comparison with existing schemes highlights a balanced trade-off between security and efficiency.

TI Many-body Majorana-like zero modes without gauge symmetry breaking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Topological superconductors represent one of the key hosts of Majorana-based topological quantum computing. Typical scenarios for one-dimensional (1D) topological superconductivity assume a broken gauge symmetry associated to a superconducting state. However, no interacting 1D many-body system is known to spontaneously break gauge symmetries. Here, we show that zero modes emerge in a many-body system without gauge symmetry breaking and in the absence of superconducting order. In particular, we demonstrate that Majorana zero modes of the symmetry-broken superconducting state are continuously connected to these zero-mode excitations, demonstrating that zero-bias anomalies may emerge in the absence of gauge symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that these many-body zero modes share the robustness features of the Majorana zero modes of symmetry-broken topological superconductors. We further show that the interface between the interacting model and a 1D topological superconductor does not support Majorana modes. We introduce a bosonization formalism to analyze these excitations and show that a ground state analogous to a topological superconducting state can be analytically found in a certain limit. Our results demonstrate that robust Majorana-like zero modes may appear in a many-body system without gauge symmetry breaking, thus introducing a family of protected excitations with no single-particle analogs.

TI Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and the Local Optical Density of
   States in Plasmonic Nanogaps
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a fundamental phenomenon in photosynthesis and is of increasing importance for the development and enhancement of a wide range of optoelectronic devices, including color-tuning LEDs and lasers, light harvesting, sensing systems, and quantum computing. Despite its importance, fundamental questions remain unanswered on the FRET rate dependency on the local density of optical states (LDOS). In this work, we investigate this directly, both theoretically and experimentally, using 30 nm plasmonic nanogaps formed between a silver nanoparticle and an extended silver film, in which the LDOS can be controlled using the size of the silver nanoparticle. Experimentally, uranin-rhodamine 6G donor-acceptor pairs coupled to such nanogaps yielded FRET rate enhancements of 3.6 times. This, combined with a 5-fold enhancement in the emission rate of the acceptor, resulted in an overall 14-fold enhancement in the acceptor's emission intensity. By tuning the nanoparticle size, we also show that the FRET rate in those systems is linearly dependent on the LDOS, a result which is directly supported by our finite difference time domain (FDTD) calculations. Our results provide a simple but powerful method to control FRET rate via a direct LDOS modification.

TI Quantum affective processes for multidimensional decision-making
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In modeling the human affective system and applying lessons learned to human-robot interaction, the challenge is to handle ambiguous emotional states of an agency (whether human or artificial), probabilistic decisions, and freedom of choice in affective and behavioral patterns. Moreover, many cognitive processes seem to run in parallel whereas seriality is the standard in conventional computation. Representation of contextual aspects of behavior and processes and of self-directed neuroplasticity are still wanted and so we attempt a quantum-computational construction of robot affect, which theoretically should be able to account for indefinite and ambiguous states as well as parallelism. Our Quantum Coppelia (Q-Coppelia) is a translation into quantum logics of the fuzzy-based Silicon Coppelia system, which simulates the progression of a robot's attitude towards its user. We show the entire circuitry of the Q-Coppelia framework, aiming at contemporary descriptions of (neuro)psychological processes. Arguably, our work provides a system for simulating and handling affective interactions among various agencies from an understanding of the relations between quantum algorithms and the fundamental nature of psychology.

TI Avoiding Barren Plateaus Using Classical Shadows
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Variational quantum algorithms are promising algorithms for achieving quantum advantage on near term devices. The quantum hardware is used to implement a variational wave function and measure observables, whereas the classical computer is used to store and update the variational parameters. The optimization landscape of expressive variational ansatze is however dominated by large regions in parameter space, known as barren plateaus, with vanishing gradients, which prevents efficient optimization. In this work we propose a general algorithm to avoid barren plateaus in the initialization and throughout the optimization. To this end we define a notion of weak barren plateaus (WBPs) based on the entropies of local reduced density matrices. The presence of WBPs can be efficiently quantified using recently introduced shadow tomography of the quantum state with a classical computer. We demonstrate that avoidance of WBPs suffices to ensure sizable gradients in the initialization. In addition, we demonstrate that decreasing the gradient step size, guided by the entropies allows WBPs to be avoided during the optimization process. This paves the way for efficient barren plateau-free optimization on near-term devices.

TI Number Partitioning With Grover's Algorithm in Central Spin Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Numerous conceptually important quantum algorithms rely on a blackbox device known as an oracle, which is typically difficult to construct without knowing the answer to the problem that the algorithm is intended to solve. A notable example is Grover's search algorithm. Here we propose a Grover search for solutions to a class of NP-complete decision problems known as subset sum problems, including the special case of number partitioning. Each problem instance is encoded in the couplings of a set of qubits to a central spin or boson, which enables a realization of the oracle without knowledge of the solution. The algorithm provides a quantum speedup across a known phase transition in the computational complexity of the partition problem, and we identify signatures of the phase transition in the simulated performance. Whereas the naive implementation of our algorithm requires a spectral resolution that scales exponentially with system size for NP-complete problems, we also present a recursive algorithm that enables scalability. We propose and analyze implementation schemes with cold atoms, including Rydberg-atom and cavity-QED platforms.

TI Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable simulator
SO NATURE
AB Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of non-equilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter(1), fundamental high-energy processes(2), quantum metrology(3,4) and quantum algorithms(5). Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains(6). By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude ('Higgs') mode(7). These observations offer a viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum processes.

TI Photonic quantum metrology with variational quantum optical
   nonlinearities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Photonic quantum metrology harnesses quantum states of light, such as NOON or twin-Fock states, to measure unknown parameters beyond classical precision limits. Current protocols suffer from two severe limitations that preclude their scalability: the exponential decrease in fidelities (or probabilities) when generating states with large photon numbers due to gate errors and the increased sensitivity of such states to noise. Here, we develop a deterministic protocol combining quantum optical nonlinearities and variational quantum algorithms that provides a substantial improvement on both fronts. First, we show how the variational protocol can generate metrologically relevant states with a small number of operations which do not significantly depend on photon number, resulting in exponential improvements in fidelities when gate errors are considered. Second, we show that such states offer a better robustness to noise compared to other states in the literature. Since our protocol harnesses interactions already appearing in state-of-the-art setups, such as cavity QED, we expect that it will lead to more scalable photonic quantum metrology in the near future.

TI Trade-off between gradient measurement efficiency and expressivity in
   deep quantum neural networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum neural networks (QNNs) require an efficient training algorithm to achieve practical quantum advantages. A promising approach is gradient-based optimization, where gradients are estimated by quantum measurements. However, QNNs currently lack general quantum algorithms for efficiently measuring gradients, which limits their scalability. To elucidate the fundamental limits and potentials of efficient gradient estimation, we rigorously prove a trade-off between gradient measurement efficiency (the mean number of simultaneously measurable gradient components) and expressivity in deep QNNs. This trade-off indicates that more expressive QNNs require higher measurement costs per parameter for gradient estimation, while reducing QNN expressivity to suit a given task can increase gradient measurement efficiency. We further propose a general QNN ansatz called the stabilizer-logical product ansatz (SLPA), which achieves the trade-off upper bound by exploiting the symmetric structure of the quantum circuit. Numerical experiments show that the SLPA drastically reduces the sample complexity needed for training while maintaining accuracy and trainability compared to well-designed circuits based on the parameter-shift method.

TI Proof-of-work consensus by quantum sampling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Since its advent in 2011, boson sampling has been a preferred candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage because of its simplicity and near-term requirements compared to other quantum algorithms. We propose to use a variant, called coarse-grained boson-sampling (CGBS), as a quantum proof-of-work (PoW) scheme for blockchain consensus. The miners perform boson sampling using input states that depend on the current block information and commit their samples to the network. Afterwards, CGBS strategies are determined which can be used to both validate samples and reward successful miners. By combining rewards for miners committing honest samples together with penalties for miners committing dishonest samples, a Nash equilibrium is found that incentivises honest miners. We provide numerical evidence that these validation tests are hard to spoof classically without knowing the binning scheme ahead of time and show the robustness of our protocol to small partial distinguishability of photons. The scheme works for both Fock state boson sampling and Gaussian boson sampling and provides dramatic speedup and energy savings relative to computation by classical hardware.

TI Quantum neural networks force fields generation
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Accurate molecular force fields are of paramount importance for the efficient implementation of molecular dynamics techniques at large scales. In the last decade, machine learning (ML) methods have demonstrated impressive performances in predicting accurate values for energy and forces when trained on finite size ensembles generated with ab initio techniques. At the same time, quantum computers have recently started to offer new viable computational paradigms to tackle such problems. On the one hand, quantum algorithms may notably be used to extend the reach of electronic structure calculations. On the other hand, quantum ML is also emerging as an alternative and promising path to quantum advantage. Here we follow this second route and establish a direct connection between classical and quantum solutions for learning neural network (NN) potentials. To this end, we design a quantum NN architecture and apply it successfully to different molecules of growing complexity. The quantum models exhibit larger effective dimension with respect to classical counterparts and can reach competitive performances, thus pointing towards potential quantum advantages in natural science applications via quantum ML.

TI Floquet engineering of continuous-time quantum walks: Toward the
   simulation of complex and next-nearest-neighbor couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The formalism of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs has been widely used in the study of quantum transport of energy and information, as well as in the development of quantum algorithms. In experimental settings, however, there is limited control over the coupling coefficients between the different nodes of the graph (which are usually considered to be real valued), thereby restricting the types of quantum walks that can be implemented. In this paper, we apply the idea of Floquet engineering in the context of continuous-time quantum walks, i.e., we define periodically driven Hamiltonians which can be used to simulate the dynamics of certain target continuous-time quantum walks. We focus on two main applications: (i) simulating quantum walks that break time-reversal symmetry due to complex coupling coefficients and (ii) increasing the connectivity of the graph by simulating the presence of next-nearest-neighbor couplings. Our paper provides explicit simulation protocols that may be used for directing quantum transport, engineering the dispersion relation of one-dimensional quantum walks, or investigating quantum dynamics in highly connected structures.

TI Optimal and nearly optimal simulation of multiperiodic time-dependent
   Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulating Hamiltonian dynamics is one of the most fundamental and significant tasks for characterizing quantum materials. Recently, a series of quantum algorithms employing block encoding of Hamiltonians have succeeded in providing efficient simulation of time-evolution operators on quantum computers. While time-independent Hamiltonians can be simulated by the quantum eigenvalue transformation (QET) or quantum singular value transformation with the optimal query complexity in time t and desirable accuracy & epsilon;, generic time-dependent Hamiltonians face at larger query complexity and more complicated oracles due to the difficulty of handling time-dependency. In this paper, we establish a QET-based approach for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonians with multiple time periodicity. Such time-dependent Hamiltonians involve a variety of nonequilibrium systems such as time-periodic systems (Floquet systems) and time-quasiperiodic systems. Overcoming the difficulty of time dependency, our protocol can simulate the dynamics under multiperiodic time-dependent Hamiltonians with optimal and nearly optimal query complexity both in time t and desirable accuracy & epsilon;, and simple oracles as well as the optimal algorithm for time-independent cases.

TI Optimal Quantum Spatial Search with One-Dimensional Long-Range
   Interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Continuous-time quantum walks can be used to solve the spatial search problem, which is an essential component for many quantum algorithms that run quadratically faster than their classical counterpart, in O(root n) time for n entries. However, the capability of models found in nature is largely unexplored-e.g., in one dimension only nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians have been considered so far, for which the quadratic speedup does not exist. Here, we prove that optimal spatial search, namely with O(root n) run time and high fidelity, is possible in one-dimensional spin chains with long-range interactions that decay as 1/r(a) with distance r. In particular, near unit fidelity is achieved for alpha approximate to 1 and, in the limit n -> infinity, we find a continuous transition from a region where optimal spatial search does exist (alpha < 1.5) to where it does not (alpha > 15). Numerically, we show that spatial search is robust to dephasing noise and that, for reasonable chain lengths, alpha less than or similar to 1.2 should be sufficient to demonstrate optimal spatial search experimentally with near unit fidelity.

TI Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics with Tensor Processing Units:
   Floquet Prethermalization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Tensor processing units (TPUs) are specialized hardware accelerators developed by Google to support large-scale machine-learning tasks but they can also be leveraged to accelerate and scale other linear-algebra-intensive computations. In this paper, we demonstrate the usage of TPUs for massively parallel classical simulations of quantum many-body dynamics on long time scales. We apply our methods to study the phenomenon of Floquet prethermalization, i.e., exponentially slow heating in quantum spin chains subject to high-frequency periodic driving. We simulate the dynamics of L = 34 qubits for over 10(5) Floquet periods, corresponding to circuits with 4 x 10(6) nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates. The circuits simulated have no additional symmetries and represent a pure-state evolution in the full 2(L)-dimensional Hilbert space. This is achieved by distributing the computation over 128 TPU cores. On that size TPU cluster, we find speed-ups in wall-clock run time of 230 times and 15 times when compared to reference CPU and single-graphics-processing-unit (GPU) simulations, respectively, for shorter-time 30-qubit simulations that can be handled by all three platforms. We study the computational cost of the simulations, as a function of both the number of qubits and the number of TPU cores used, up to our maximum capacity of L = 40 qubits, which requires a "full pod" of 2048 TPU cores with tens of terabytes of memory in total. For these simulations, an eight-TPU-core machine is comparable to a single A100 GPU and thus the full TPU pod is comparable to a machine with hundreds of top-of-the-line GPUs. However, the TPU pod is more energy and cost efficient and readily accessible (via Google Cloud), unlike such large many-GPU configurations. We also study the accumulation of numerical error as a function of circuit depth in very deep circuits. Our work demonstrates that TPUs can offer significant advantages for state-of-the-art simulations of quantum many-body dynamics.

TI An Ising Machine Approach to the Personalized Course Selection Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A combinatorial optimization problem is a problem finding an optimal combination of variables that maximizes or minimizes an objective function while satisfying given constraints. Such problems arise in various fields, including transportation and communication. Many combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard, meaning that the number of possible combinations grows exponentially as the number of variables increases. As a result, it is often difficult to solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems for conventional classical computers. Recently, Ising machines, including quantum annealers, have gained attention as a promising architecture for efficiently solving combinatorial optimization problems. One real-world example of a combinatorial optimization problem is university course selection. Many students manually choose their courses, but this process is time consuming and labor intensive due to the large number of available options. To address this, in this paper, we formulate course selection as a combinatorial optimization problem, which we define as a Personalized Course Selection Problem (PCSP). To solve it efficiently, we use an Ising machine, a specialized computer designed for combinatorial optimization. We propose a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation for solving PCSP and solve the problem with an Ising machine. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that, for the largest instance tested, the proposed method solves the problem 20X times faster than the conventional simulated annealing while achieving the same total course cost.

TI Symmetry-informed transferability of optimal parameters in the quantum
   approximate optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB One of the main limitations of variational quantum algorithms is the classical optimization of the highly dimensional nonconvex variational parameter landscape. To simplify this optimization, we can reduce the search space using problem symmetries and typical optimal parameters as initial points if they concentrate. In this article, we consider typical values of optimal parameters of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for the MAXCUT problem with d-regular tree subgraphs and reuse them in different graph instances. We prove symmetries in the optimization landscape of several kinds of weighted and unweighted graphs, which explains the existence of multiple sets of optimal parameters. However, we observe that not all optimal sets can be successfully transferred between problem instances. We find specific transferable domains in the search space and show how to translate an arbitrary set of optimal parameters into the adequate domain using the studied symmetries. Finally, we extend these results to general classical optimization problems described by Ising Hamiltonians, the Hamiltonian variational ansatz for relevant physical models, and the recursive and multiangle quantum approximate optimization algorithms.

TI Optical realization of one-dimensional generalized split-step quantum
   walks
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Quantum walks are more than tools for building quantum algorithms. They have been used effectively to model and simulate quantum dynamics in many complex physical processes. Particularly, a variant of discrete-time quantum walk known as split-step quantum walk is closely related to Dirac cellular automata and topological insulators, whose realizations rely on position-dependent control of evolution operators. Owing to the ease of manipulating multiple degrees of freedom of photons, we provide an optical setup of split-step operators which, in combination with position-dependent coin (PDC) operation, can accomplish a table-top setup of generalized split-step walks. Also, we propose an optical implementation for PDC operation that allows, for instance, realizing electric quantum walks, control localization dynamics, and emulate space-time curvature effects. In addition, we propose a setup to realize any t-step split-step quantum walk involving 2 J-plates, 2 variable waveplates, a half-waveplate, an optical switch, and an optical delay line.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

We also evaluate dECM's impact on cell viability and differentiation potential. Human dermal fibroblasts were decellularized using nonidet P-40, a nonionic detergent (nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol) (NP-40) lysis buffers (1% or 10%) for 1 or 3 h. Decellularization efficacy was assessed via double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) Qubit assay, gel electrophoresis, immunofluorescence, and bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Hydrogels (5 wt% alginate, 3 wt% gelatin) with/without 1% dECM were extrusion bioprinted. Structural and mechanical properties were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy and rheology. Fibroblast viability within bioprinted constructs was monitored over 21 days. Hoechst staining and Qubit assay confirmed residual DNA after 1-h incubations, but complete removal (<50 ng dsDNA) occurred after 3 h with both NP-40 concentrations. The 10% NP-40/3-h protocol yielded the highest protein content. dECM incorporation did not compromise scaffold properties. Significantly enhanced cell viability and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content (up to day 6) were observed in dECM hydrogels versus controls. Mechanical testing showed a 33% increase in Young's modulus in dECM-containing hydrogels. Raman spectroscopy confirmed successful dECM integration via a characteristic GAG peak (895 cm(-1)). We established an optimized decellularization protocol (10% NP-40, 3 h) that effectively eliminates cellular/nuclear material (DNA <50 ng, RNA undetectable) below immunogenic thresholds while preserving essential extracellular matrix components. Fibroblast-derived dECM significantly enhanced alginate-gelatin hydrogel performance, improving cell viability, GAG synthesis, and early osteogenic markers without compromising structural integrity. This protocol provides a robust and standardized source of bioactive dECM, offering a viable alternative to tissue-derived matrices for advanced bone and cartilage tissue engineering bioinks. While the method demonstrates potential for scale-up, further validation following internationally recognized International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards would be necessary before production-level implementation.

TI Tunable molecular interactions near an atomic Feshbach resonance:
   Stability and collapse of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Understanding and controlling interactions of ultracold molecules is a cornerstone of quantum chemistry. While the laboratory creation of degenerate molecular gases comprised of bosonic atoms has unlocked powerful platforms for quantum simulation, progress is limited by the absence of a robust theoretical framework for characterizing intermolecular interactions. This is in stark contrast to the situation for Fermi gases. In this Letter, we present such a framework providing universal expressions for these molecular scattering lengths as functions of experimentally measurable quantities. Our discoveries are crucial for understanding molecular condensate formation. Calculations of the compressibility reveal that a sign change in such molecular scattering lengths is directly correlated with the instability of these condensates. These results offer fresh insight with broad applications for atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics, as well as quantum chemistry.

TI Engineered chirality of one-dimensional nanowires
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The origin and function of chirality in DNA, proteins, and other building blocks of life represent a central question in biology. Observations of spin polarization and magnetization associated with electron transport through chiral molecules, known collectively as the chiral induced spin selectivity effect, suggest that chirality improves electron transfer. Using reconfigurable nanoscale control over conductivity at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, we create chiral electron potentials that explicitly lack mirror symmetry. Quantum transport measurements on these chiral nanowires reveal enhanced electron pairing persisting to high magnetic fields (up to 18 tesla) and oscillatory transmission resonances as functions of both magnetic field and chemical potential. We interpret these resonances as arising from an engineered axial spin-orbit interaction within the chiral region. The ability to create one-dimensional electron waveguides with this specificity creates opportunities to test, via analog quantum simulation, theories about chirality and spin-polarized electron transport in one-dimensional geometries.

TI Forces on alkali Rydberg atoms due to nonlinearly polarized light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Trapped Rydberg atoms are highly promising candidates for quantum science experiments. While several approaches have been put forward to exert (trapping) forces on isolated Rydberg atoms, a widely applicable lossless technique is lacking. This paper proposes a robust versatile alternative technique that avoids lifetime compromising losses. Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by nonlinearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the nS, nP, and nD series with principal quantum number n as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light-Rydbergatom hybrid states, which possess nontrivial position-dependent forces.

TI Analyzing Nonequilibrium Quantum States through Snapshots with
   Artificial Neural Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Current quantum simulation experiments are starting to explore nonequilibrium many-body dynamics in previously inaccessible regimes in terms of system sizes and timescales. Therefore, the question emerges as to which observables are best suited to study the dynamics in such quantum many-body systems. Using machine learning techniques, we investigate the dynamics and, in particular, the thermalization behavior of an interacting quantum system that undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition from an ergodic to a many-body localized phase. We employ supervised and unsupervised training methods to distinguish nonequilibrium from equilibrium data, using the network performance as a probe for the thermalization behavior of the system. We test our methods with experimental snapshots of ultracold atoms taken with a quantum gas microscope. Our results provide a path to analyze highly entangled large-scale quantum states for system sizes where numerical calculations of conventional observables become challenging.

SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present an open-source computer program written in Python language for quantum measurement and related issues. In our program, quantum states and operators, including quantum gates, can be developed into a quantum-object function represented by a matrix. Build into the program are several measurement schemes, including von Neumann measurement and weak measurement. Various numerical simulation methods are used to mimic the real experiment results. We first provide an overview of the program structure and then discuss the numerical simulation of quantum measurement. We illustrate the program's performance via quantum state tomography and quantum metrology. The program is built in a general language of quantum physics and thus is widely adaptable to various physical platforms, such as quantum optics, ion traps, superconducting circuit devices, and others.

AB In this study, we develop and experimentally validate the integration of a localized metallic back-gate into a multi-gate silicon-on-insulator (SOI) field-effect transistor (FET), aimed at enabling front-gate coupling efficiency from room to cryogenic (mK) temperatures. The fabrication was enabled by the so-called Nanomole process, via controlled and localized vapor-phase etching of either the BOX (with vapor-HF) or the silicon substrate (with XeF2) followed by ALD metallization. We report the electrical characterization of front and back gate transistor operation and resulting threshold voltage control at cryogenic temperatures. Additional cryogenic simulations support our data, showing quantum dot formation via front-back coupling. The localized dopant-free multi-gate coupling proposed here unlocks novel possibilities for quantum dots and spin qubit applications including charge and spin noise reduction, volume inversion and tunable spin-valley mixing.

TI A proposal for using molecular spin qudits as quantum simulators of
   light-matter interactions
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB We show that molecular spin qudits provide an ideal platform to simulate the quantum dynamics of photon fields strongly interacting with matter. The basic unit of the proposed molecular quantum simulator could be realized by synthesizing a simple dimer of spin 1/2 and spin S >= 3/2 transition metal ions, solely controlled by microwave pulses. The spin S ion is exploited to encode the photon field in a flexible architecture, which enables the digital simulation of a wide range of spin-boson models much more efficiently than by using a multi-qubit register. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by numerical simulations using realistic molecular parameters for each of the two ions and the prerequisites delineating possible chemical approaches for the synthesis of suitable platforms are also discussed.

TI Electrostatically Doped Junctionless Graphene Nanoribbon Tunnel
   Field-Effect Transistor for High-Performance Gas Sensing Applications:
   Leveraging Doping Gates for Multi-Gas Detection
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this paper, a new junctionless graphene nanoribbon tunnel field-effect transistor (JLGNR TFET) is proposed as a multi-gas nanosensor. The nanosensor has been computationally assessed using a quantum simulation based on the self-consistent solutions of the mode space non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism coupled with the Poisson's equation considering ballistic transport conditions. The proposed multi-gas nanosensor is endowed with two top gates ensuring both reservoirs' doping and multi-gas sensing. The investigations have included the IDS-VGS transfer characteristics, the gas-induced electrostatic modulations, subthreshold swing, and sensitivity. The order of change in drain current has been considered as a sensitivity metric. The underlying physics of the proposed JLGNR TFET-based multi-gas nanosensor has also been studied through the analysis of the band diagrams behavior and the energy-position-resolved current spectrum. It has been found that the gas-induced work function modulation of the source (drain) gate affects the n-type (p-type) conduction branch by modulating the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) while the p-type (n-type) conduction branch still unaffected forming a kind of high selectivity from operating regime point of view. The high sensitivity has been recorded in subthermionic subthreshold swing (SS < 60 mV/dec) regime considering small gas-induced gate work function modulation. In addition, advanced simulations have been performed for the detection of two different types of gases separately and simultaneously, where high-performance has been recorded in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and electrical behavior. The proposed detection approach, which is viable, innovative, simple, and efficient, can be applied using other types of junctionless tunneling field-effect transistors with emerging channel nanomaterials such as the transition metal dichalcogenides materials. The proposed JLGNRTFET-based multi-gas nanosensor is not limited to two specific gases but can also detect other gases by employing appropriate gate materials in terms of selectivity.

TI 3-regular three-XORSAT planted solutions benchmark of classical and
   quantum heuristic optimizers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With current semiconductor technology reaching its physical limits, special-purpose hardware has emerged as an option to tackle specific computing-intensive challenges. Optimization in the form of solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, or equivalently Ising spin glasses, has been the focus of several new dedicated hardware platforms. These platforms come in many different flavors, from highly-efficient hardware implementations on digital-logic of established algorithms to proposals of analog hardware implementing new algorithms. In this work, we use a mapping of a specific class of linear equations whose solutions can be found efficiently, to a hard constraint satisfaction problem (three-regular three-XORSAT, or an Ising spin glass) with a 'golf-course' shaped energy landscape, to benchmark several of these different approaches. We perform a scaling and prefactor analysis of the performance of Fujitsu's digital annealer unit (DAU), the D-Wave advantage quantum annealer, a virtual MemComputing machine, Toshiba's simulated bifurcation machine (SBM), the SATonGPU algorithm from Bernaschi et al, and our implementation of parallel tempering. We identify the SATonGPU and DAU as currently having the smallest scaling exponent for this benchmark, with SATonGPU having a small scaling advantage and in addition having by far the smallest prefactor thanks to its use of massive parallelism. Our work provides an objective assessment and a snapshot of the promise and limitations of dedicated optimization hardware relative to a particular class of optimization problems.

TI Estimating Molecular Thermal Averages with the Quantum Equation of
   Motion and Informationally Complete Measurements
SO ENTROPY
AB By leveraging the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), the "quantum equation of motion" (qEOM) method established itself as a promising tool for quantum chemistry on near-term quantum computers and has been used extensively to estimate molecular excited states. Here, we explore a novel application of this method, employing it to compute thermal averages of quantum systems, specifically molecules like ethylene and butadiene. A drawback of qEOM is that it requires measuring the expectation values of a large number of observables on the ground state of the system, and the number of necessary measurements can become a bottleneck of the method. In this work, we focus on measurements through informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) to achieve a reduction in the measurement overheads by estimating different observables of interest through the measurement of a single set of POVMs. We show with numerical simulations that the qEOM combined with IC-POVM measurements ensures satisfactory accuracy in the reconstruction of the thermal state with a reasonable number of shots.

TI Evaluation of selected parameters of inflammation, coagulation system,
   and formation of extracellular neutrophil traps (NETs) in the
   perioperative period in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of
   thoracoabdominal aneurysm with a branched device (t-Branch)
SO FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB Extracellular Neutrophils Traps (NETs) and their formation, known as NETosis, have become pivotal in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm development. This study investigates the NETosis markers with the assessment of selected parameters of inflammation and coagulation system in patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in the pre-and postop period undergoing t-Branch stent-graft implantation. The study included 20 patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Three markers double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and citrullinated H3 histones (Cit-H3) were tested at three-time points from patients' blood. The parameters of NETosis, inflammation, and coagulation system were examined in the preoperative period (within 24 h before surgery) and in the postoperative period (on the 3rd and 5th postoperative day). Free-circulating DNA (cfDNA) was isolated from the blood using the MagMAXTM Cell-Free DNA Extraction Kit. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were then quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and the Qubit ssDNA Assay Kit. Cit-H3 concentration was determined by enzyme immunoassay ELISA (Cayman). The results revealed the significance of NETs secretion in response to the complex processes after stent-graft implantation. All NET markers increased shortly after surgery, with histones being the first to return to preoperative levels. The lack of normalization of dsDNA and ssDNA levels to preoperative levels by the last postoperative blood collection demonstrates NETs reorganization. The increase in the number of neutrophils was not related to the expansion of postoperative NETosis. The study reveals a new marker of NETosis, ssDNA, that has not been studied so far. The implantation of a stent graft in a patient with TAAA triggers an inflammatory response manifested by an increase in inflammatory parameters. One of the hallmarks of inflammation is the activation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Observations in quantum weak measurements are determined by complex numbers called weak values. We present a geometrical interpretation of the argument of weak values of general Hermitian observables in N-dimensional quantum systems in terms of geometric phases. We formulate an arbitrary weak value in terms of three real vectors on the unit sphere in N-2 - 1 dimensions, SN2-2 . These vectors are linked to the initial and final states, and to the weakly measured observable, respectively. We express pure states in the complex projective space of N - 1 dimensions, CPN-1 , which has a non-trivial representation as a 2N - 2 dimensional submanifold of SN2-2 (a generalization of the Bloch sphere for qudits). The argument of the weak value of a projector on a pure state of an N-level quantum system describes a geometric phase associated to the symplectic area of the geodesic triangle spanned by the vectors representing the pre-selected state, the projector and the post-selected state in CPN-1. We then proceed to show that the argument of the weak value of a general observable is equivalent to the argument of an effective Bargmann invariant. Hence, we extend the geometrical interpretation of projector weak values to weak values of general observables. In particular, we consider the generators of SU(N) given by the generalized Gell-Mann matrices. Finally, we study in detail the case of the argument of weak values of general observables in two-level systems and we illustrate weak measurements in larger dimensional systems by considering projectors on degenerate subspaces, as well as Hermitian quantum gates. To conclude, we discuss the interpretation and usefulness of geometric phases in weak values in connection to weak measurements.

TI Hybrid subQUBO Annealing With a Correction Process for Multi-Day
   Intermodal Trip Planning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The multi-day intermodal trip planning problem (MITPP) is an optimization problem that seeks to create the optimal route to visit Point-of-Interest (POI) and hotels over days. This problem involves coordinating intermodal transportation, such as walking, public transportation, to create a well-crafted travel itinerary. Quantum annealers have recently been explored as a powerful tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems by converting the problems into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). However, current quantum annealers have a small QUBO input size so that they cannot directly solve large-scale MITPPs. In this paper, we address this issue by extracting a subQUBO from the original large QUBO based on variable (spin) deviations and randomness. Then, we iteratively solve the subQUBOs by the quantum annealer and update the (quasi-)optimal solution. As the obtained (quasi-)optimal solution may violate constraints, we apply the correction processing till all constraints are satisfied. According to the experiment results using a real quantum annealer, our proposed method obtained high-quality solutions for large-scale MITPPs in the Tokyo area, and compared to the full QUBO method, we achieve a maximum spin reduction of 98.9%. Especially, compared to the method by a conventional computer and two conventional subQUBO methods, POI satisfaction is improved by 10.2%, and travel costs are improved by 23.2% respectively.

TI Ergotropy-based quantum thermodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce an ergotropy-based formulation of quantum thermodynamics, which provides a strong connection between average heat and von Neumann entropy. By adopting this formulation, we can reinterpret the infinitesimal average heat in terms of the infinitesimal change of the passive state associated with the density operator behind the quantum dynamics. Like entropy, this leads to a heat concept that is invariant under passive state transformations. As an application, the average heat can be used as a general non-Markovianity measure for unital maps. Moreover, apositive-semidefinite temperature naturally emerges in an out-of-equilibrium ergotropybased scenario. Concerning the infinitesimal average work, it arises as an infinitesimal variation of ergotropy, as well as an extra passive work contribution in the case of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. As illustrations, we consider the thermodynamics of a single-qubit open system in the cases of generalized amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels.

TI Quantum-enhanced multiparameter sensing in a single mode
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Precise measurements underpin scientific and technological advancements. Quantum mechanics provides an avenue to enhance precision, but it comes with a restriction: Incompatible observables, such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary accuracy as decreed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This restriction can be bypassed by instead measuring commuting modular observables, which are counterparts to the naturally incompatible observables. Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Further, we examine another pair of incompatible observables-number and phase. We prepare a different resource-number-phase states-and demonstrate a metrological gain over the SQL. These results introduce previously unidentified measurement capabilities unavailable to classical systems and mark a substantial step in quantum metrology.

TI Efficient Entanglement Generation of Two Superconducting Qubits in a
   Circuit QED
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The optimal generation of entangled states is of significance to information processing and state engineering. Here, an efficient scheme is proposed for creating entangled states between two superconducting qubits in a circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). The two qubits that resonantly interact with a common cavity mode of transmission-line resonator (TLR) can be effectively coupled by the data bus of the microwave resonator. By the invariant-based shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA), two types of maximally entangled states can be controllably induced only by adjusting the Rabi drivings. Based on the resonant drivings with constant rates, the shortcut strategy is capable of implementing faster operations when compared with the dispersive approach. The fidelities are highly robust against the decoherence effects and the instabilities of Rabi rates. Thus the proposal could offer a potential route toward the entanglement generations in an optimized manner.

TI Witnessing edge modes in trimerized circuit quantum electrodynamic
   lattice
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a scheme to investigate and witness edge modes of general one-dimensional photonic trimers in a circuit quantum electrodynamic lattice. These in-gap edge modes are strictly and analytically solved and the criteria for their emergence are indicated respectively. Moreover, the energy spectrum of the system shows two different regimes characterized by a discrepancy in the number of edge modes. Specifically, while there are always a couple of edge modes only present at one single boundary in both the regimes, one of the regimes also shows another pair of edge modes localized on the opposite boundary. Furthermore, these edge modes are witnessed with the aid of continuous-time quantum walks and average photon number measurements. Our scheme provides a comprehensive method for studying the edge modes of matter.

TI Hardy-like quantum pigeonhole paradox and the projected-coloring graph
   state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A Hardy-like version of the quantum pigeonhole paradox is proposed, which can also be considered as a special kind of Hardy's paradox. Besides an example induced from the minimal system, a general construction of this paradox from an n-qubit quantum state is also discussed. Moreover, by introducing the projected-coloring graph and the projected-coloring graph state, a pictorial representation of the Hardy-like quantum pigeonhole paradox can be presented. This Hardy-like version of the quantum pigeonhole paradox can be implemented more directly in experiment than the original one, since it does not require some sophisticated techniques such as weak measurements. In addition, from the angle of Hardy's paradox, some Hardy-like quantum pigeonhole paradoxes may be able to set a new record for the success probability of demonstrating Bell nonlocality.

TI Semi-insulating 4H-SiC lateral bulk acoustic wave resonators
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) excels in its outstanding mechanical properties, which are widely studied in microelectromechanical systems. Recently, the mechanical tuning of color centers in 4H-SiC has been demonstrated, broadening its application in quantum spintronics. The strain generated in a mechanical resonator can be used to manipulate the quantum state of the color center qubit. This work reports a lateral overtone mechanical resonator fabricated from a semi-insulating bulk 4H-SiC wafer. An aluminum nitride piezoelectric transducer on SiC is used to drive the resonance. The resonator shows a series of modes with quality factors (Q) above 3000. An acoustic reflector positioned at the anchor shows a 22% improvement in Q at 300MHz resonance and suppresses the overtone modes away from it. This monolithic SiC resonator allows optical access to the SiC color centers from both sides of the wafer, enabling a convenient setup in quantum measurements.

TI Quantum partial coherence measures constructed from Fisher information
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum mechanics gives a new breakthrough to the fi eld of parameter estimation. In the realm of quantum metrology, the precision of parameter estimation is limited by the quantum Fisher information. We introduce the measures of partial coherence based on ( quantum ) Fisher information by taking into account the post-selective non-unitary parametrization process. These partial coherence measures present a clear operational interpretation by directly linking the coherence to the parameter estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the distinctions between our partial coherence measure and the quantum Fisher information within the context of unitary parametrization. We provide an analytical expression for the partial coherence measure of two-qubit states. We elucidate the operational significance of the partial coherence measures by establishing the connections between the partial coherence measures and quantum state discrimination.

TI Topological Transitions in a Kerr Nonlinear Oscillator
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB A Kerr nonlinear oscillator (KNO) supports a pair of steady eigenstates, coherent states with opposite phases, that are good for the encoding of continuous variable qubit basis states. Arbitrary control of the KNO confined within the steady-state subspace allows extraction of the Berry curvature through the linear response of the physical observable to the quench velocity of the system, providing an effective method for the characterization of topology in the KNO. As an alternative, the control adopting the "shortcut to adiabaticity" to the KNO enables the exploration of the topology through accelerated adiabatic eigenstate evolution to measure all 3 physical observables. Topological transitions are revealed by the jump of the first Chern number, obtained respectively from the integral of the Berry curvature and of the new polar angle relation, over the whole parameter space. Our strategy paves the way for measuring topological transitions in continuous variable systems.

TI Coherent electric field control of orbital state of a neutral
   nitrogen-vacancy center
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The coherent control of the orbital state is crucial for realizing the extremely-low power manipulation of the color centers in diamonds. Herein, a neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy center, NV0, is proposed as an ideal system for orbital control using electric fields. The electric susceptibility in the ground state of NV0 is estimated, and found to be comparable to that in the excited state of NV-. Also, the coherent control of the orbital states of NV0 is demonstrated. The required power for orbital control is three orders of magnitude smaller than that for spin control, highlighting the potential for interfacing a superconducting qubit operated in a dilution refrigerator.
   Color centers in diamond have been proposed as a link between remote superconducting units in hybrid quantum systems, where their orbital degree of freedom is utilized. Here the authors report coherent electric-field control of the orbital state of a neutral NV center in diamond.

TI Entanglement witnessing with untrusted detectors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider the problem of entanglement detection in the presence of faulty, potentially malicious detectors. A common-and, as of yet, the only-approach to this problem is to perform a Bell test in order to identify nonlocality of the measured entangled state. However, there are two significant drawbacks in this approach: the requirement to exceed a critical, and often high, detection efficiency, and much lower noise tolerance. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to this problem, which is resilient to the detection loophole and is based on the standard tool of entanglement witness. We discuss how the two main techniques to detection losses, namely the discard and assignment strategies, apply to entanglement witnessing. We demonstrate using the example of a two-qubit Bell state that the critical detection efficiency can be significantly reduced compared to the Bell test approach.

TI Temperature Dependence of Charge Distributions and Carrier Mobility in

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES
AB Capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics and carrier transport properties of 2-D electron gases (2DEGs) in an undoped Si/SiGe heterostructure at T= 4 - 35 K are presented. Two capacitance plateaus due to density saturation of the 2DEG in the buried Si quantum well (QW) are observed and explained by a model of surface tunneling. The peak mobility at 4 K is 4.1 x 10(5); cm(2)/V.s and enhanced by a factor of 1.97 at an even lower carrier density compared to the saturated carrier density, which is attributed to the effect of remote carrier screening. At T = 35 K, the mobility enhancement with a factor of 1.35 is still observed, which suggests the surface tunneling is still dominant.

TI The quantum transition of the two-dimensional Ising spin glass
SO NATURE
AB Quantum annealers are commercial devices that aim to solve very hard computational problems(1), typically those involving spin glasses(2,3). Just as in metallurgic annealing, in which a ferrous metal is slowly cooled(4), quantum annealers seek good solutions by slowly removing the transverse magnetic field at the lowest possible temperature. Removing the field diminishes the quantum fluctuations but forces the system to traverse the critical point that separates the disordered phase (at large fields) from the spin-glass phase (at small fields). A full understanding of this phase transition is still missing. A debated, crucial question regards the closing of the energy gap separating the ground state from the first excited state. All hopes of achieving an exponential speed-up, compared to classical computers, rest on the assumption that the gap will close algebraically with the number of spins(5-9). However, renormalization group calculations predict instead that there is an infinite-randomness fixed point(10). Here we solve this debate through extreme-scale numerical simulations, finding that both parties have grasped parts of the truth. Although the closing of the gap at the critical point is indeed super-algebraic, it remains algebraic if one restricts the symmetry of possible excitations. As this symmetry restriction is experimentally achievable (at least nominally), there is still hope for the quantum annealing paradigm(11-13).

TI Scaling advantage of chaotic amplitude control for high-performance
   combinatorial optimization
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Finding the ground state of a variety of complex systems can be formulated as the minimization of the total interaction energy of Ising machines, posing a challenge as computational cost increases exponentially with system size. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm to find the ground states of Ising-type problems by destabilising non-trivial attractors in combinatorial optimisation solvers through a heuristic modulation of the target amplitude, and show that this provides an improved scaling with respect to several existing methods.
   The development of physical simulators, called Ising machines, that sample from low energy states of the Ising Hamiltonian has the potential to transform our ability to understand and control complex systems. However, most of the physical implementations of such machines have been based on a similar concept that is closely related to relaxational dynamics such as in simulated, mean-field, chaotic, and quantum annealing. Here we show that dynamics that includes a nonrelaxational component and is associated with a finite positive Gibbs entropy production rate can accelerate the sampling of low energy states compared to that of conventional methods. By implementing such dynamics on field programmable gate array, we show that the addition of nonrelaxational dynamics that we propose, called chaotic amplitude control, exhibits exponents of the scaling with problem size of the time to find optimal solutions and its variance that are smaller than those of relaxational schemes recently implemented on Ising machines.

In the quantum regime, restart in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) has been shown to expedite the quantum hitting times [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 050802 (2023)]. Here, we study how restarting monitored discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) affects the quantum hitting times. We show that the restarted DTQWs outperform classical random walks in target searches, benefiting from quantum ballistic propagation, a feature shared with their continuous-time counterparts. Moreover, the explicit coin degree of freedom in DTQWs allows them to surpass even CTQWs in target detection without sacrificing any quantum advantage. Additionally, knowledge of the target's parity or position relative to the origin can be leveraged to tailor DTQWs for even faster searches. Our study paves the way for more efficient use of DTQWs in quantum-walk-based search algorithms, simulations, and modeling of quantum transport towards targeted sites in complex quantum networks.

TI Enhancement and manipulation of nonreciprocity via dissipative coupling
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Classical and quantum nonreciprocity have important applications in information processing due to their special one-way controllability for physical systems. In this paper we investigate the nonreciprocal transmission and quantum correlation by introducing the dissipative coupling into a linear coupling system consisting of two microdisk resonators. Our research results demonstrate that even in the case of a stationary resonator, dissipative coupling can effectively induce nonreciprocity within the system. Moreover, the degree of nonreciprocity increases with the dissipative coupling strength. Importantly, the phase shift between the dissipative coupling and coherent coupling serves as a critical factor for controlling both nonreciprocal transmision and one-way quantum steering. Consequently, the introduction of dissipative coupling not only enhances the nonreciprocal transmission and nonreciprocal quantum correlation but also enables on-demand manipulation of nonreciprocity. This highlights dissipation as an effective means for manipulating classical and quantum nonreciprocity, thus playing a favorable role in chiral quantum networks.

TI Efficient source-independent quantum conference key agreement
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) enables the unconditional secure distribution of conference keys among multiple participants. Due to challenges in high-fidelity preparation and long-distance distribution of multi-photon entanglement, entanglement-based QCKA is facing severe limitations in both key rate and scalability. Here, we propose a source- independent QCKA scheme utilizing the post-matching method, feasible within the entangled photon pair distribution network. We introduce an equivalent distributing virtual multi-photon entanglement protocol for providing unconditional security proof even in the case of coherent attacks. For the symmetry star network, compared with the previous n-photon entanglement protocol, the conference key rate is improved from O ( eta n ) to O ( eta 2 ), where eta is the transmittance from the entanglement source to one participant. Simulation results show that the performance of our protocol has multiple orders of magnitude advantages in the intercity distance. We anticipate that our approach will demonstrate its potential in the implementation of quantum networks.

TI InP-Substrate-Based Quantum Dashes on a DBR as Single-Photon Emitters at
   the Third Telecommunication Window
SO MATERIALS
AB We investigated emission properties of photonic structures with InAs/InGaAlAs/InP quantum dashes grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a distributed Bragg reflector. In high-spatial-resolution photoluminescence experiment, well-resolved sharp spectral lines are observed and single-photon emission is detected in the third telecommunication window characterized by very low multiphoton events probabilities. The photoluminescence spectra measured on simple photonic structures in the form of cylindrical mesas reveal significant intensity enhancement by a factor of 4 when compared to a planar sample. These results are supported by simulations of the electromagnetic field distribution, which show emission extraction efficiencies even above 18% for optimized designs. When combined with relatively simple and undemanding fabrication approach, it makes this kind of structures competitive with the existing solutions in that spectral range and prospective in the context of efficient and practical single-photon sources for fiber-based quantum networks applications.

TI Single-photon circulator by spinning optical resonators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A circulator is one of the crucial devices in quantum networks and simulations. We propose a four-port circulator that regulates the flow of single photons at muti-frequency points by studying the coherent transmission of a single photon in a coupled system of two resonators and two waveguides. When both resonators are static or rotate at the same angular velocity, the single-photon transport demonstrates reciprocity; however, when the angular velocities differ, four distinct frequency points emerge where photon circulation can occur. In particular, when the angular velocities of the two resonators are equal and opposite, there are two different frequency points where photon circulation can be achieved, and there is a frequency point where a single photon input from any waveguide can be completely routed to the other waveguide. Interestingly, by rotating the two resonators, the single-photon circulation suppressed by the internal defect-induced backscattering can be restored.

TI Efficient Quantum Private Comparison with Unitary Operations
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum private comparison (QPC) is a crucial component of quantum multiparty computing (QMPC), allowing parties to compare their private inputs while ensuring that no sensitive information is disclosed. Many existing QPC protocols that utilize Bell states encounter efficiency challenges. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient QPC protocol that capitalizes on the distinct characteristics of Bell states to enable secure comparisons. Our method transforms private inputs into unitary operations on shared Bell states, which are then returned to a third party to obtain the comparison results. This approach enhances efficiency and decreases the reliance on complex quantum resources. A single Bell state can compare two classical bits, achieving a qubit efficiency of 100%. We illustrate the feasibility of the protocol through a simulation on the IBM Quantum Cloud Platform. The security analysis confirms that our protocol is resistant to both eavesdropping and attacks from participants.

TI Trade-off relations of geometric coherence
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum coherence is an important quantum resource and it is intimately related to various research fields. The geometric coherence is a coherence measure both operationally and geometrically. We study the trade-off relation of geometric coherence in qubit systems. We first derive an upper bound for the geometric coherence by the purity of quantum states. Based on this, a complementarity relation between the quantum coherence and the mixedness is established. We then derive the quantum uncertainty relations of the geometric coherence on two and three general measurement bases in terms of the incompatibility respectively, which turn out to be state-independent for pure states. These trade-off relations provide the limit to the amount of quantum coherence. As a byproduct, the complementarity relation between the minimum error probability for discriminating a pure-states ensemble and the mixedness of quantum states is established.

TI Coherence resource power of isocoherent states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We address the problem of comparing quantum states with the same amount of coherence in terms of their coherence resource power given by the preorder of incoherent operations. For any coherence measure, two states with null or maximum value of coherence are equivalent with respect to that preorder. This is no longer true for intermediate values of coherence when pure states of quantum systems with dimension greater than two are considered. In particular, we show that, for any value of coherence (except the extreme values, zero and the maximum), there are infinite incomparable pure states with that value of coherence. These results are not peculiarities of a given coherence measure, but common properties of every well-behaved coherence measure. Furthermore, we show that for qubit mixed states there exist coherence measures, such as the relative entropy of coherence, that admit incomparable isocoherent states.

TI Observation of Thermalization and Information Scrambling in a
   Superconducting Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Understanding various phenomena in nonequilibrium dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems, such as quantum thermalization, information scrambling, and nonergodic dynamics, is crucial for modern physics. Using a ladder-type superconducting quantum processor, we perform analog quantum simulations of both the XX-ladder model and the one-dimensional XX model. By measuring the dynamics of local observables, entanglement entropy, and tripartite mutual information, we signal quantum thermalization and information scrambling in the XX ladder. In contrast, we show that the XX chain, as free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice, fails to thermalize to the Gibbs ensemble, and local information does not scramble in the integrable channel. Our experiments reveal ergodicity and scrambling in the controllable qubit ladder, and open the door to further investigations on the thermodynamics and chaos in quantum manybody systems.

TI Quantum statistics of Schrodinger cat states prepared by logical gate
   with non-Gaussian resource state
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB A measurement-induced continuous-variable logical gate is able to prepare Schrodinger cat states if the gate uses a non-Gaussian resource state, such as cubic phase state (I.V. Sokolov (2020) [21]). Our scheme provides an alternative to hybrid circuits which use photon subtraction and (or) Fock resource states and photon number detectors. We reveal the conditions under which the gate conditionally prepares quantum superposition of two undistorted "copies" of an arbitrary input state that occupies a finite area in phase space. A detailed analysis of the fidelity between the gate output state and high-quality Schrodinger cat state is performed. A clear interpretation of the output state quantum statistics in terms of Wigner function in dependence on the gate parameters and measurement outcome is presented for a representative set of input Fock states.

TI Long-time Bell states of waveguide-mediated qubits via continuous
   measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper we consider a scheme for achieving long-time sustainable Bell states of two distant qubits mediated by a one-dimensional waveguide whose outputs are subjected to time-continuous photon counting or homodyne detection. In both of the detection cases, it is shown that different Bell states can be obtained, for different initial states, in the long-time regime. In particular, we find that, in the case of photon counting, a cyclic jump among Bell states can be formed once the first photon is registered. While in the homodyne-detection case we further reveal that any steady Bell state can be achieved independent of detection efficiency, with a probability of 50% . The underlying physical reason for this is also analyzed. Our scheme is advantageous over previous studies in which only transient or intermittent Bell states can be generated. The long-time Bell states of distant qubits can be used for constructing quantum networks.

TI Experimental Efficient Source-Independent Quantum Conference Key
   Agreement
SO RESEARCH
AB Multipartite entanglement enables secure group key distribution among multiple users while providing immunity against hacking attacks targeting source devices, thereby realizing source-independent quantum conference key agreement (SI-QCKA). However, previous experimental demonstrations of SI-QCKA have encountered substantial technical challenges, primarily due to the low efficiency and scalability limitations inherent in the generation and distribution of multipartite entanglement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable and efficient SI-QCKA protocol using polarization-entangled photon pairs in a 3-user star network, where Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger correlations are realized via a post-matching method. We achieve a secure group key rate of 2.11 x 104 bits/s under the single-user channel transmission of 1.64 x 10-1 in a symmetric channel loss network. Additionally, we conduct 6 sets of experiments to investigate the impact of varying channel transmission and random basis selection probabilities on secure key rates. Our work establishes an efficient pathway for SI-QCKA and demonstrates potential scalability for future large-scale multiuser quantum networks.

TI Polarization and spatial mode dependent four-wave mixing in a 4H-silicon

SO APL PHOTONICS
AB We report four-wave mixing with different polarization and spatial modes in a single 4H-silicon carbide photonic device. Our device shows great potential to perform high-dimensional multiplexing for optical communication and high-dimensional entanglement in quantum networks. We use a polarization-insensitive grating coupler and a multimode microring resonator that supports three polarization and spatial mode resonances. Finally, we show the polarization dependence of the third-order nonlinearity of 4H-silicon carbide. The measured nonlinear refractive index of the light polarized along the extraordinary axis, which is n(2,TM) = (13.1 +/- 0.7) x 10(-19) m(2)/W, is twice as large as that of the light polarized along the ordinary plane, n(2,TE) = (7.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(-19) m(2)/W, indicating that the extraordinary polarization is more efficient for nonlinear experiments in the 4H-silicon carbide integrated platforms as compared to the ordinary polarization.

TI Entanglement-induced violations of the quantum sure-thing principle in
   the quantum prisoners' dilemma
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work we propose a quantum generalization of the sure-thing principle and investigate its behavior within the framework of the quantum prisoners' dilemma. In our formulation, uncertainty arises both from measurement outcomes in pure states and from the lack of purity in mixed states. We first examine a quantum conditional state approach, where only classical correlations are present and no violations of the quantum STP are observed. We then analyze the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme, showing that violations occur only when the quantum state maintains a certain degree of purity and entanglement is nonzero. Finally, we explore the use of perfect entanglers within the EWL framework, finding that the quantum STP can be violated even under maximal uncertainty. These results highlight entanglement as an essential resource for inducing deviations from rational-choice principles in quantum decision-making, opening new perspectives for quantum game theory and strategic behavior in quantum networks.

TI Quantum transport efficiency in noisy random-removal and small-world
   networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We report the results of an in-depth study of the role of graph topology on quantum transport efficiency in random removal and Watts-Strogatz networks. By using four different environmental models-noiseless, driven by classical random telegraph noise (RTN), thermal quantum bath, and bath + RTN-we compare the role of the environment and of the change in network topology in determining the quantum transport efficiency. We find that small and specific changes in network topology is more effective in causing large change in efficiency compared to that achievable by environmental manipulations for both network classes. Furthermore, we have found that noise dependence of transport efficiency in Watts-Strogatz networks can be categorized into six classes. In general, our results highlight the interplay that network topology and environment models play in quantum transport, and pave the way for transport studies for networks of increasing size and complexity-when going beyond so far often used few-site transport systems.

TI Enhanced Phase Estimation in Parity-Detection-Based Mach-Zehnder
   Interferometer using Non-Gaussian Two-Mode Squeezed Thermal Input State
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB While the quantum metrological advantages of performing non-Gaussian operations on two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states have been extensively explored, similar studies in the context of two-mode squeezed thermal (TMST) states are severely lacking. This paper explores the potential advantages of performing non-Gaussian operations on TMST state for phase estimation using parity detection-based Mach-Zehnder interferometry and compares it with the TMSV case. To this end, a realistic photon subtraction, addition, and catalysis model is considered. A unified Wigner function of the photon subtracted, photon added, and photon catalyzed TMST state is derived, which is used to obtain the expression for the phase sensitivity. The results show that performing non-Gaussian operations on TMST states can enhance the phase sensitivity for significant squeezing and transmissivity parameter ranges. Because of the probabilistic nature of these operations, it is of utmost importance to consider their success probability. When the success probability is considered, the photon catalysis operation performed using a high transmissivity beam splitter is the optimal non-Gaussian operation. This contrasts with the TMSV case, where photon addition is observed as the most optimal. Further, the derived Wigner function of the non-Gaussian TMST states will be useful for state characterization and various quantum protocols.

TI Quantum Random Access Codes for Boolean Functions
SO QUANTUM
AB An n ->(p) m random access code (RAC) is an encoding of n bits into m bits such that any initial bit can be recovered with probability at least p, while in a quantum RAC (QRAC), the n bits are encoded into m qubits. Since its proposal, the idea of RACs was generalized in many different ways, e.g. allowing the use of shared entanglement (called entanglement-assisted random access code, or simply EARAC) or recovering multiple bits instead of one. In this paper we generalize the idea of RACs to recovering the value of a given Boolean function f on any subset of fixed size of the initial bits, which we call f-random access codes. We study and give protocols for f-random access codes with classical (f-RAC) and quantum (f-QRAC) encoding, together with many different resources, e.g. private or shared randomness, shared entanglement (f-EARAC) and Popescu-Rohrlich boxes (f-PRRAC). The success probability of our protocols is characterized by the noise stability of the Boolean function f. Moreover, we give an upper bound on the success probability of any f-QRAC with shared randomness that matches its success probability up to a multiplicative constant (and f-RACs by extension), meaning that quantum protocols can only achieve a limited advantage over their classical counterparts.

TI Scanning gradiometry with a single spin quantum magnetometer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensors based on spin defects in diamond have recently enabled detailed imaging of nanoscale magnetic patterns, such as chiral spin textures, two-dimensional ferromagnets, or superconducting vortices, based on a measurement of the static magnetic stray field. Here, we demonstrate a gradiometry technique that significantly enhances the measurement sensitivity of such static fields, leading to new opportunities in the imaging of weakly magnetic systems. Our method relies on the mechanical oscillation of a single nitrogen-vacancy center at the tip of a scanning diamond probe, which up-converts the local spatial gradients into ac magnetic fields enabling the use of sensitive ac quantum protocols. We show that gradiometry provides important advantages over static field imaging: (i) an order-of-magnitude better sensitivity, (ii) a more localized and sharper image, and (iii) a strong suppression of field drifts. We demonstrate the capabilities of gradiometry by imaging the nanotesla fields appearing above topographic defects and atomic steps in an antiferromagnet, direct currents in a graphene device, and para- and diamagnetic metals.
   Scanning NV center magnetometry enables imaging of weak magnetic fields at the nanoscale. Huxter et al. achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity by converting a spatial field gradient into an AC field by mechanical oscillations of the sensor, and image stray fields from atomic steps in an antiferromagnet.

TI Coupler Microwave-Activated Controlled-Phase Gate on Fluxonium Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Tunable couplers have recently become one of the most powerful tools for implementing two-qubit gates between superconducting qubits. A tunable coupler typically includes a nonlinear element, such as a superconducting quantum interference device, which is used to tune the resonance frequency of an LC circuit connecting two qubits. Here we propose a complimentary approach where instead of tuning the resonance frequency of the tunable coupler by applying a quasistatic control signal, we excite by microwave the degree of freedom associated with the coupler itself. Because of strong effective longitudinal coupling between the coupler and the qubits, the frequency of this transition strongly depends on the computational state, leading to different phase accumulations in different states. Using this method, we experimentally demonstrate a controlled-Z gate of 44-ns duration on a fluxonium-based quantum processor, obtaining a fidelity of 97.6% +/- 0.4% characterized by cross-entropy benchmarking.

TI Characterizing correlation within multipartite quantum systems via local
   randomized measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Given a quantum system on many qubits split into a few different parties, how many total correlations are there between these parties? Such a quantity, aimed to measure the deviation of the global quantum state from an uncorrelated state with the same local statistics, plays an important role in understanding multipartite correlations within complex networks of quantum states. Yet, the experimental access of this quantity remains challenging as it tends to be nonlinear, and hence often requires tomography which becomes quickly intractable as dimensions of relevant quantum systems scale. Here, we introduce a much more experimentally accessible quantifier of total correlations, which can be estimated using only single-qubit measurements. It requires far fewer measurements than state tomography, and obviates the need to coherently interfere multiple copies of a given state. Thus we provide a tool for proving multipartite correlations that can be applied to near-term quantum devices.

TI Generalized adiabatic approximation to the asymmetric quantum Rabi
   model: conical intersections and geometric phases
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM), which describes the interaction between a quantum harmonic oscillator and a biased qubit, arises naturally in circuit quantum electrodynamic circuits and devices. The existence of hidden symmetry in the AQRM leads to a rich energy landscape of conical intersections (CIs) and thus to interesting topological properties. However, current approximations to the AQRM fail to reproduce these CIs correctly. To overcome these limitations we propose a generalized adiabatic approximation (GAA) to describe the energy spectrum of the AQRM. This is achieved by combining the perturbative adiabatic approximation and the exact exceptional solutions to the AQRM. The GAA provides substantial improvement to the existing approaches and pushes the limit of the perturbative treatment into non-perturbative regimes. As a preliminary example of the application of the GAA we calculate the geometric phases around CIs associated with the AQRM.

TI Multipole-phase division multiplexing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The control of structured waves has recently opened innovative scenarios in the perspective of radiation propagation, advanced imaging, and light-matter interaction. In information and communication technology, the spatial degrees of freedom offer a wider state space to carry many channels on the same frequency or increase the dimensionality of quantum protocols. However, spatial decomposition is much more arduous than polarization or frequency multiplexing, and very few practical examples exist. Among all, beams carrying orbital angular momentum gained a preeminent role, igniting a variety of methods and techniques to generate, tailor, and measure that property. In a more general insight into structured-phase beams, we introduce here a new family of wave fields having a multipole phase. These beams are devoid of phase singularities and described by two continuous spatial parameters which can be controlled in a practical and compact way via conformal optics. The outlined framework encompasses multiplexing, propagation, and demultiplexing as a whole for the first time, describing the evolution and transformation of wave fields in terms of conformal mappings. With its potentialities, versatility, and ease of implementation, this new paradigm introduces a novel playground for space division multiplexing, suggesting unconventional solutions for light processing and free-space communications.

TI Optical Frequency Comb-Based Continuous-Variable Quantum Secret Sharing
   Scheme
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) faces inherent limitations in scaling to multi-user networks due to excess noise introduced by highly asymmetric beam splitters (HABSs) in chain-structured topologies. To overcome this challenge, we propose an optical frequency comb-based continuous-variable QSS (OFC CV-QSS) scheme that establishes parallel frequency channels between users and the dealer via OFC-generated multi-wavelength carriers. By replacing the chain-structured links with dedicated frequency channels and integrating the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) with a decentralized architecture, our design eliminates excess noise from all users using HABS while providing mathematical- and physical-layer security. Simulation results demonstrate that the scheme achieves a more than 50% improvement in maximum transmission distance compared to chain-based QSS, with significantly slower performance degradation as users scale to 20. Numerical simulations confirm the feasibility of this theoretical framework for multi-user quantum networks, offering dual-layer confidentiality without compromising key rates.

TI Decay dynamics of a giant atom in a structured bath with broken
   time-reversal symmetry
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study in this paper the decay dynamics of a two-level giant atom, which is coupled to a quasi-one-dimensional sawtooth lattice exposed to uniform synthetic magnetic fluxes. In the case where the two sublattices have a large detuning, the giant atom is effectively coupled to a single-band structured bath with flux-controlled energy band and time-reversal symmetry. This feature significantly affects the decay dynamics of the giant atom as well as the propagation of the emitted photon. In particular, the giant atom can exhibit chiral spontaneous emission and allow for nonreciprocal delayed light, which are however unattainable by coupling a small atom to this lattice. Giant atoms with different frequencies can be designed to emit photons towards different directions and with different group velocities. Our results pave the way towards engineering quantum networks and manipulating giant-atom interference effects.

TI Generating T centres in photonic silicon-on-insulator material by
   ion implantation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Global quantum networks will benefit from the reliable fabrication and control of high-performance solid-state telecom photon-spin interfaces. T radiation damage centres in silicon provide a promising photon-spin interface due to their narrow O-band optical transition near 1326 nm and long-lived electron and nuclear spin lifetimes. To date, these defect centres have only been studied as ensembles in bulk silicon. Here, we fabricate high concentration T centre ensembles in the 220 nm device layer of silicon-on-insulator wafers by ion implantation and subsequent annealing. We then develop a method that uses spin-dependent optical transitions to benchmark the characteristic optical spectral diffusion within these T centre ensembles. Using this new technique, we show that with minimal optimization to the fabrication process high densities of implanted T centres localized less than or similar to 100 nm from an interface display similar to 1 GHz characteristic levels of total spectral diffusion.

AB Due to the sparse connectivity of superconducting quantum computers, qubit communication via SWAP gates accounts for the vast majority of overhead in quantum programs. We introduce a method for improving the speed and reliability of SWAPs at the level of the superconducting hardware's native gateset. Our method relies on four techniques: 1) SWAP Orientation, 2) Cross-Gate Pulse Cancellation, 3) Commutation through Cross-Resonance, and 4) Cross-Resonance Polarity. Importantly, our Optimized SWAP is bootstrapped from the pre-calibrated gates, and therefore incurs zero calibration overhead. We experimentally evaluate our optimizations with Qiskit Pulse on IBM hardware. Our Optimized SWAP is 11% faster and 13% more reliable than the Standard SWAP. We also experimentally validate our optimizations on application-level benchmarks. Due to (a) the multiplicatively compounding gains from improved SWAPs and (b) the frequency of SWAPs, we observe typical improvements in success probability of 10-40%. The Optimized SWAP is available through the Superstaq platform.

TI Trap-Filling Magnetoconductance as an Initialization and Readout
   Mechanism of Triplet Exciton Spins
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Photoexcited triplet states are promising candidates for hybrid qubit systems, as they can be used as a controlling gate for nuclear spins. But microwave readout schemes do not generally offer the sensitivity needed to approach the single-molecule limit or the scope to integrate such systems into devices. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of electrical readout of triplet spins at room temperature through a specific mechanism of magnetoconductance (MC) in polycrystalline pentacene. We show that hole-only pentacene devices exhibit a positive photoinduced MC response that is consistent with a trap-filling mechanism. Spin and magnetic-field-dependent quenching of photogenerated triplets by holes quantitatively explains the MC response we observe. These results are distinct in both sign and proposed mechanism compared to previous reports on polyacene materials and provide clear design rules for future spintronic devices based on this spin-sensing mechanism.

TI Microwave-to-optical conversion with a gallium phosphide photonic

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electrically actuated optomechanical resonators provide a route to quantum-coherent, bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons. Such devices could enable optical interconnection of quantum computers based on qubits operating at microwave frequencies. Here we present a platform for microwave-to-optical conversion comprising a photonic crystal cavity made of single-crystal, piezoelectric gallium phosphide integrated on prefabricated niobium circuits on an intrinsic silicon substrate. The devices exploit spatially extended, sideband-resolved mechanical breathing modes at similar to 3.2 GHz, with vacuum opto-mechanical coupling rates of up to g(o)/2 pi approximate to 300 kHz. The mechanical modes are driven by integrated microwave electrodes via the inverse piezoelectric effect. We estimate that the system could achieve an electromechanical coupling rate to a superconducting transmon qubit of similar to 200 kHz. Our work represents a decisive step towards integration of piezoelectro-optomechanical interfaces with superconducting quantum processors.

TI Quantum subspace expansion approach for simulating dynamical response
   functions of Kitaev spin liquids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB We develop a quantum simulation-based approach for studying properties of strongly correlated magnetic materials at increasing scale. We consider a paradigmatic example of a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state hosted by the honeycomb Kitaev model and use a trainable, symmetry-guided ansatz for preparing its ground state. Applying the tools of quantum subspace expansion (QSE), Hamiltonian operator approximation, and overlap measurements, we simulate the QSL at zero temperature and finite magnetic field, thus moving outside of the symmetric subspace. Next, we implement a protocol for quantum subspace expansion-based measurement of spin-spin correlation functions. Finally, we perform QSE-based simulation of the dynamical structure factor obtained from Green's functions of the finite field Kitaev model. Our results show that quantum simulators offer an insight into quasiparticle properties of strongly correlated magnets and can become a valuable tool for studying material science.

TI Observation of Photonic Topological Floquet Time Crystals
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The two main research questions on time crystals are: What is a time crystal? Is there a material that is spontaneously crystalline in time? This study synthesizes a photonic material of topological Floquet time crystals and experimentally observes its indicative period-2T$2T$ beating. A single-particle picture is explicitly reconstructed of discrete time-crystalline phase and is revealed using an appropriately-designed photonic Floquet simulator the rigid period-doubling as a signature of the breakage of the discrete time-translational symmetry. Unlike the requirement of the many-body localization, the photonic Floquet time crystal is derived from a newly defined single-particle topological phase that can be extensively accessed by many pertinent nonequilibrium and periodically-driven platforms. The observation will drive theoretical and technological interests toward condensed matter physics and topological photonics.

AB Fluctuations in electric fields can change the position of a gate-defined quantum dot (QD) in a semiconductor heterostructure. In the presence of magnetic field gradient, these stochastic shifts of electron's wavefunction lead to fluctuations of electron's spin splitting. The resulting spin dephasing due to charge noise limits the coherence times of spin qubits in isotopically purified Si/SiGe quantum dots. We investigate the spin splitting noise caused by such a process due to microscopic motion of charges at the semiconductor-oxide interface. We compare effects of isotropic and planar displacement of the charges and estimate their densities and typical displacement magnitudes that can reproduce experimentally observed spin splitting noise spectra. We predict that for a defect density of 10(10) cm(-2), visible correlations between noises in spin splitting and in energy of electron's ground state in the quantum dot are expected.

TI Laser-free method for creation of two-mode squeezed state and
   beam-splitter transformation with trapped ions
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose a laser-free method for creation of a phonon two-mode squeezed state and a beam-splitter transformation, using time-varying electric fields and non-linear couplings between the normal modes in a linear ion crystal. Such non-linear Coulomb-mediated interactions between the collective vibrational modes arise under specific trap-frequency conditions in an ion trap. We study the quantum metrological capability for parameter estimation of the two quantum states and show that a Heisenberg limit of precision can be achieved when the initial state with n phonons evolves under the action of the beam-splitter transformation. Furthermore, we show that the phonon non-linearity and the spin-dependent force can be used for creation of a three-qubit Fredkin gate.

TI Hybrid photon-phonon blockade
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We describe a novel type of blockade in a hybrid mode generated by linear coupling of photonic and phononic modes. We refer to this effect as hybrid photon-phonon blockade and show how it can be generated and detected in a driven nonlinear optomechanical superconducting system. Thus, we study boson-number correlations in the photon, phonon, and hybrid modes in linearly coupled microwave and mechanical resonators with a superconducting qubit inserted in one of them. We find such system parameters for which we observe eight types of different combinations of either blockade or tunnelling effects (defined via the sub- and super-Poissonian statistics, respectively) for photons, phonons, and hybrid bosons. In particular, we find that the hybrid photon-phonon blockade can be generated by mixing the photonic and phononic modes which do not exhibit blockade.

TI Helical liquids in semiconductors
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB One-dimensional helical liquids can appear at boundaries of certain condensed matter systems. Two prime examples are the edge of a quantum spin Hall insulator and the hinge of a three-dimensional second-order topological insulator. For these materials, the presence of a helical state at the boundary serves as a signature of their nontrivial electronic bulk topology. Additionally, these boundary states are of interest themselves, as a novel class of strongly correlated low-dimensional systems with interesting potential applications. Here, we review existing results on such helical liquids in semiconductors. Our focus is on the theory, though we confront it with existing experiments. We discuss various aspects of the helical liquids, such as their realization, topological protection and stability, or possible experimental characterization. We lay emphasis on the hallmark of these states, being the prediction of a quantized electrical conductance. Since so far reaching a well-quantized conductance has remained challenging experimentally, a large part of the review is a discussion of various backscattering mechanisms which have been invoked to explain this discrepancy. Finally, we include topics related to proximity-induced topological superconductivity in helical states, as an exciting application toward topological quantum computation with the resulting Majorana bound states.

TI Engineering the Kondo impurity problem with alkaline-earth-atom arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations, strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.

TI Dark-State Enhanced Loading of an Optical Tweezer Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Neutral atoms and molecules trapped in optical tweezers have become a prevalent resource for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. However, the maximum achievable system sizes of such arrays are often limited by the stochastic nature of loading into optical tweezers, with a typical loading probability of only 50%. Here we present a species-agnostic method for dark-state enhanced loading (DSEL) based on real-time feedback, long-lived shelving states, and iterated array reloading. We demonstrate this technique with a 95-tweezer array of 88Sr atoms, achieving a maximum loading probability of 84.02(4)% and a maximum array size of 91 atoms in one dimension. Our protocol is complementary to, and compatible with, existing schemes for enhanced loading based on direct control over light-assisted collisions, and we predict it can enable close-to-unity filling for arrays of atoms or molecules.

TI Nanoscale engineering and dynamic stabilization of mesoscopic spin
   textures
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Thermalization, while ubiquitous in physics, has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to be mitigated. In contrast, we demonstrate here the use of thermalization in the generation, control, and readout of "shell-like" spin textures with interacting 13C nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The textures span several nanometers and encompass many hundred spins; they are created and interrogated without manipulating the nuclear spins individually. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-engineered Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field: The texture is therefore metastable and robust against spin diffusion. This enables the state to endure over multiple minutes before it decays. Our work on spin-state engineering paves the way for applications in quantum simulation and nanoscale imaging.

TI Enhancement of microwave to optical spin-based quantum transduction via
   a magnon mode
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a method for converting single microwave photons to single optical sideband photons based on spinful impurities in magnetic materials. This hybrid system is advantageous over previous proposals because (i) the implementation allows much higher transduction rates (103 times faster at the same optical pump Rabi frequency) than state-of-the-art devices, (ii) high-efficiency transduction is found to happen in a significantly larger space of device parameters (in particular, over 1 GHz microwave detuning), and (iii) it does not require mode volume matching between optical and microwave resonators. We identify the needed magnetic interactions as well as potential materials systems to enable this speed up using erbium dopants for telecom compatibility. This is an important step towards realizing high-fidelity entangling operations between remote qubits and will provide additional control of the transduction through perturbation of the magnet.

TI Molecular epidemiology of hepatitis B virus from blood samples obtained

SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health concern, with a high burden in countries like Nigeria. This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of HBV by identifying circulating genotypes and detecting antiviral-resistant mutations in samples from selected communities in Enugu and Nasarawa States, Nigeria. Sample (plasma and serum) quality was evaluated after prolonged storage under freeze-thaw conditions using Qubit 4 fluorometer and Nanodrop One spectrophotometer. High-quality samples underwent molecular characterization and Sanger sequencing for HBV-positive cases. Of the 67 samples analyzed, seven were sequenced: two from Enugu and four from Nasarawa belonged to genotype E, while one from Nasarawa was genotype A. No antiviral resistance mutations were identified. This study provides valuable molecular data contributing to our understanding of HBV epidemiology in Nigeria.

TI Suppressing gauge drift in quantum simulations with gauge
   transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of maintaining gauge invariance because various errors in the simulation push the state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work [Phys. Rev. A 110, 022417 (2024)], that uses gauge transformations in two ways. First, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Second, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure one-dimensional SU(2) toy model.

TI Digital-analog quantum convolutional neural networks for image
   classification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose digital-analog quantum kernels for enhancing the detection of complex features in the classification of images. We consider multipartite-entangled analog blocks, stemming from native Ising interactions in neutral-atom quantum processors, and individual operations as digital steps to implement the protocol. To further improve the detection of complex features, we apply multiple quantum kernels by varying the qubit connectivity according to the hardware constraints. An architecture that combines nontrainable quantum kernels and standard convolutional neural networks is used to classify realistic medical images, from breast cancer and pneumonia diseases, with a significantly reduced number of parameters. Despite this fact, the model exhibits better performance than its classical counterparts and achieves comparable metrics according to public benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of digital-analog quantum convolutions in extracting complex and meaningful features from images, positioning them as a candidate model for addressing challenging classification problems.

TI Parity-conserving Cooper-pair transport and ideal superconducting diode
   in planar germanium
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconductor/semiconductor hybrid devices have attracted increasing interest in the past years. Superconducting electronics aims to complement semiconductor technology, while hybrid architectures are at the forefront of new ideas such as topological superconductivity and protected qubits. In this work, we engineer the induced superconductivity in two-dimensional germanium hole gas by varying the distance between the quantum well and the aluminum. We demonstrate a hard superconducting gap and realize an electrically and flux tunable superconducting diode using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). This allows to tune the current phase relation (CPR), to a regime where single Cooper pair tunneling is suppressed, creating a sin(2 phi) CPR. Shapiro experiments complement this interpretation and the microwave drive allows to create a diode with similar to 100% efficiency. The reported results open up the path towards integration of spin qubit devices, microwave resonators and (protected) superconducting qubits on the same silicon technology compatible platform.

TI Signatures of a sampling quantum advantage in driven quantum many-body
   systems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A crucial milestone in the field of quantum simulation and computation is to demonstrate that a quantum device can perform a computation task that is classically intractable. A key question is to identify setups that can achieve such goal within current technologies. In this work, we provide formal evidence that sampling bit-strings from a periodic evolution of a unitary drawn from the circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) cannot be efficiently simulated with classical computers. As the statistical properties of COE coincide with a large class of driven analog quantum systems thanks to the Floquet eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, our results indicate the possibility that those driven systems could constitute practical candidates for a sampling quantum advantage. To further support this, we give numerical examples of driven disordered Ising chains and 1D driven Bose-Hubbard model.

TI Floquet operator engineering for quantum state stroboscopic
   stabilization
SO COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE
AB Optimal control is a valuable tool for quantum simulation, allowing for the optimized preparation, manipulation, and measurement of quantum states. Through the optimization of a time-dependent control parameter, target states can be prepared to initialize or engineer specific quantum dynamics. In this work, we focus on the tailoring of a unitary evolution leading to the stroboscopic stabilization of quantum states of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice. We show how, for states with space and time symmetries, such an evolution can be derived from the initial state-preparation controls; while for a general target state we make use of quantum optimal control to directly generate a stabilizing Floquet operator. Numerical optimizations highlight the existence of a quantum speed limit for this stabilization process, and our experimental results demonstrate the efficient stabilization of a broad range of quantum states in the lattice.

TI Dynamical Excitation Control and Multimode Emission of an Atom-Photon
   Bound State
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Atom-photon bound states arise from the coupling of quantum emitters to the band edge of dispersion-engineered waveguides. Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter-a transmon-type superconducting circuit-to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multimode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter's frequency. Our Letter offers insight into the dynamic preparation of APBS and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.

TI Engineering Hierarchical Symmetries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder SU(2)-* U(1)-* Z 2-* E. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.

TI Quantum Walk Wave-Particle Coherent Superposition
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Evolution process and properties of wave-particle quantum walk (QW) are studied by theoretical calculation and quantum simulator's simulation. Quantum control can contribute to the realization of QWs in quantum wave-particle superposition state with a relative phase between walkers. The post- selection operation is used to realize the continuous transitions of QW from the state of waves with multi-path coherence to the state of particles without coherence in two different ways: coherence and mixing. Due to quantum interference, there are essential differences between coherence and mixing, and their specific features are characterized by position variance. We also demonstrate the coherent wave-particle QWs in the real quantum simulator. When the walker is in the wave- particle coherent state, two completely different properties can be observed simultaneously through one measurement. By adjusting the relative phase in the wave-particle coherent state, the diffusion rate of the walker can be controlled.

TI Topology vs localization in synthetic dimensions
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation of synthetic dimensions, e.g., in optical lattices of ultracold atoms, we discuss here d-dimensional periodic, gapped quantum systems for d <= 4, with a focus on the topology of the occupied energy states. We perform this analysis by asking whether the spectral subspace below the gap can be spanned by smooth and periodic Bloch functions, corresponding to localized Wannier functions in position space. By constructing these Bloch functions inductively in the dimension, we show that if they are required to be orthonormal, then, in general, their existence is obstructed by the first two Chern classes of the underlying Bloch bundle, with the second Chern class characterizing, in particular, the four-dimensional situation. If the orthonormality constraint is relaxed, we show how m occupied energy bands can be spanned by a Parseval frame comprising at most m + 2 Bloch functions.

TI Phonon-Induced Pairing in Quantum Dot Quantum Simulator
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum simulations can provide new insights into the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems. A well-studied system, but still open in many regards, is the Hubbard-Holstein Hamiltonian, where electronic repulsion is in competition with attraction generated by the electron-phonon coupling. In this context, we study the behavior of four quantum dots in a suspended carbon nanotube and coupled to its flexural degrees of freedom. The system is described by a Hamiltonian of the Hubbard-Holstein class, where electrons on different sites interact with the same phonon. We find that the system presents a transition from the Mott insulating state to a polaronic state, with the appearance of pairing correlations and the breaking of the translational symmetry. These findings will motivate further theoretical and experimental efforts to employ nano-electromechanical systems to simulate strongly correlated systems with electron-phonon interactions.

TI Assembly of a Rovibrational Ground State Molecule in an Optical Tweezer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate the coherent creation of a single NaCs molecule in its rotational, vibrational, and electronic (rovibronic) ground state in an optical tweezer. Starting with a weakly bound Feshbach molecule, we locate a two-photon transition via the vertical bar c(3)Sigma(1), v' = 26 > excited state and drive coherent Rabi oscillations between the Feshbach state and a single hyperfine level of the NaCs rovibronic ground state vertical bar X-1 Sigma; v '' = 0; N '' = 0 > with a binding energy of D-0 = h x 147044.63(11) GHz. We measure a lifetime of 3.4 +/- 1.6 s for the rovibronic ground state molecule, which possesses a large molecule-frame dipole moment of 4.6D and occupies predominantly the motional ground state. These long-lived, fully quantum-state-controlled individual dipolar molecules provide a key resource for molecule-based quantum simulation and information processing.

TI Sampling electronic fock states using determinant quantum Monte Carlo
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinant quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.

TI Gated InAs quantum dots embedded in surface acoustic wave cavities for
   low-noise optomechanics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) are promising optomechanical elements due to their excellent photonic properties and sensitivity to local strain fields. Microwave- frequency modulation of photons scattered from these efficient quantum emitters has been recently demonstrated using surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavities. However, for optimal performance, a gate structure is required to deterministically control the charge state and reduce the charge noise of the QDs. Here, we integrate gated QDs and SAW cavities using molecular beam epitaxy and nanofabrication. We demonstrate that with careful design of the substrate layer structure, integration of the two systems can be accomplished while retaining the optimal performance of each subsystem. These results mark a critical step toward efficient and low-noise optomechanical systems that truly leverage the excellent properties of semiconductor QDs.

TI Low-temperature characteristics of an AlN/Diamond surface acoustic wave
   resonator
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Phonons confined in mechanical resonators can be coupled to a variety of quantum systems and are expected to be applied to hybrid quantum systems. Diamond surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are capable of high efficiency in phonon interaction with color centers in diamond. The temperature dependence of the quality factor is crucial for inferring the governing mechanism of coupling efficiency between phonons and color centers in diamond. In this paper, we report on the temperature dependence of the quality factor of an AlN/diamond SAW device from room temperature to 5 K. The temperature dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency suggests that the mechanism of SAW dissipation in the AlN/diamond SAW resonator at 5 GHz is the phonon-phonon scattering in the Akheiser regime and that further cooling can be expected to improve the quality factor. This result provides a crucial guideline for the future design of AlN/diamond SAW devices.

TI Bias-tailored quantum LDPC codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Bias-tailoring allows quantum error correc-tion codes to exploit qubit noise asymme-try. Recently, it was shown that a modified form of the surface code, the XZZX code, ex-hibits considerably improved performance un-der biased noise. In this work, we demon-strate that quantum low density parity check codes can be similarly bias-tailored. We intro-duce a bias-tailored lifted product code con-struction that provides the framework to ex-pand bias-tailoring methods beyond the fam-ily of 2D topological codes. We present exam-ples of bias-tailored lifted product codes based on classical quasi-cyclic codes and numeri-cally assess their performance using a belief propagation plus ordered statistics decoder. Our Monte Carlo simulations, performed un-der asymmetric noise, show that bias-tailored codes achieve several orders of magnitude im-provement in their error suppression relative to depolarising noise.

TI Coherent Spin-Spin Coupling Mediated by Virtual Microwave Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We report the coherent coupling of two electron spins at a distance via virtual microwave photons. Each spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot at either end of a superconducting resonator, achieving spin-photon couplings up to around g(s)/2 pi = 40 MHz. As the two spins are brought into resonance with each other, but detuned from the photons, an avoided crossing larger than the spin linewidths is observed with an exchange splitting around 2J/2 pi = 20 MHz. In addition, photon-number states are resolved from the shift 2 chi(s)/2 pi = -13 MHz that they induce on the spin frequency. These observations demonstrate that we reach the strong dispersive regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics with spins. Achieving spin-spin coupling without real photons is essential to long-range two-qubit gates between spin qubits and scalable networks of spin qubits on a chip.

TI Topological charge distributions of an interacting two-spin system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum systems are often described by parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. Points in parameter space where two levels are degenerate can carry a topological charge. Here we theoretically study an interacting two-spin system where the degeneracy points form a nodal loop or a nodal surface in the magnetic parameter space, similarly to such structures discovered in the band structure of topological semimetals. Key results of our work are that (1) we determine the topological charge distribution along these degeneracy geometries and (2) we show that these nonpointlike degeneracy patterns can be obtained not only by fine-tuning but they can be stabilized by spatial symmetries. Since simple spin systems such as the one studied here are ubiquitous in condensed-matter setups, we expect that our findings, and the physical consequences of these nontrivial degeneracy geometries, are testable in experiments with quantum dots, molecular magnets, and adatoms on metallic surfaces.

TI Probing the indistinguishability of single photons generated by Rydberg

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the indistinguishability of single photons retrieved from collective Rydberg excitations in cold atomic ensembles. The Rydberg spin waves are created either by off-resonant two-photon excitation to the Rydberg state or by Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency. To assess the indistinguishability of the generated single photons, we perform Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments between the single photons and weak coherent states of light. We analyze the indistinguishability as a function of the detection window, and we infer a high value of indistinguishability going from 89% for the full waveform to 98% for small detection windows, for the case of photons generated by off-resonant excitation. In the same way, we also investigate the indistinguishability of single photons generated by Rydberg EIT, showing values lower than those corresponding to single photons generated by off-resonant excitation. These results are relevant for the use of Rydberg atoms as quantum network nodes.

TI Adaptive sampling-based optimization of quantics tensor trains for noisy
   functions: Applications to quantum simulations
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Tensor cross interpolation (TCI) is a powerful technique for learning a tensor train (TT) by adaptively sampling a target tensor based on an interpolation formula. However, when the tensor evaluations contain random noise, optimizing the TT is more advantageous than interpolating the noise. Here, we propose a new method that starts with an initial guess of TT and optimizes it using non-linear least-squares by fitting it to measured points obtained from TCI. We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting QTT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized QTT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.

TI Improved Precision Scaling for Simulating Coupled Quantum-Classical
   Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this paper, we present a superpolynomial improvement in the precision scaling of quantum simulations for coupled quantum-classical systems. Such systems are found in, e.g., molecular-dynamics simulations within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. By employing a framework based on the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of classical mechanics, we express the Liouville equation of motion as unitary dynamics and utilize phase kickback from a dynamical quantum simulation to calculate the quantum forces acting on classical particles. This approach allows us to simulate the dynamics of these classical particles without the overheads associated with measuring gradients and solving the equations of motion on a classical computer, resulting in a superpolynomial advantage at the price of increased space complexity. We demonstrate that these simulations can be performed in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles, enabling the estimation of thermodynamic properties from the prepared probability density.

TI Observation of chiral-mode domains in a frustrated XY model on optical
   triangular lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigated the relaxation and excitation in a frustrated XY model realized by a Bose gas in Floquetengineered optical triangular lattices. Periodically driving the position of the entire lattice structure enables the sign inversion of tunneling amplitudes, which, in the case of a triangular lattice, results in geometrical frustration of the local phase of wave packets. We revealed that the two spiral phases with chiral modes show significant differences in relaxation time from the initial ferromagnetic phase. While spontaneous symmetry breaking is clearly observed at a slow ramp of the Floquet drive, simultaneous occupation of two ground states often occurs at a fast ramp, which can be attributed to the domain formation of the chiral modes. The interference of the spatially separated chiral modes was observed, using a quantum gas microscope. This work leads to exploring the domain formation mechanism in a system with U(1) x Z2 symmetry.

TI Improving the spectroscopic knowledge of neutral Neodymium
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Laser cooling and trapping of lanthanides has opened the possibility to carry out new experiments with ultracold dipolar gases, for example for quantum simulation of solid state physics. To identify new suitable candidates for laser-cooling, it is important to have a precise spectroscopic knowledge of the atom under consideration. Along this direction, we present here a detailed modeling of the energy levels of neutral neodymium (Nd), an element belonging to the left part of the lanthanide row, which has not yet been considered for laser-cooling. Using the semi-empirical method implemented in the Cowan suite of codes, we are in particular able to interpret more than 200 experimental levels of the NIST database belonging to both parities. The optimal set of atomic parameters obtained after the least-square fitting step can serve to calculate radiative transition probabilities in the future.

TI Atomic Ramsey interferometry with S- and D-band in a triangular optical
   lattice
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Ramsey interferometers have wide applications in science and engineering. Compared with the traditional interferometer based on internal states, the interferometer with external quantum states has advantages in some applications for quantum simulation and precision measurement. Here, we develop a Ramsey interferometry with Bloch states in S- and D-band of a triangular optical lattice for the first time. The key to realizing this interferometer in two-dimensionally coupled lattice is that we use the shortcut method to construct p/2 pulse. We observe clear Ramsey fringes and analyze the decoherence mechanism of fringes. Further, we design an echo pi pulse between S- and D-band, which significantly improves the coherence time. This Ramsey interferometer in the dimensionally coupled lattice has potential applications in the quantum simulations of topological physics, frustrated effects, and motional qubits manipulation.

TI Seconds-Scale Coherence on Nuclear Spin Transitions of Ultracold Polar
   Molecules in 3D Optical Lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Ultracold polar molecules (UPMs) are emerging as a novel and powerful platform for fundamental applications in quantum science. Here, we report characterization of the coherence between nuclear spin levels of ultracold ground-state sodium-rubidium molecules loaded into a 3D optical lattice with a nearly photon scattering limited trapping lifetime of 9(1) seconds. After identifying and compensating the main sources of decoherence, we achieve a maximum nuclear spin coherence time of T???2 = 3.3??6?? s with twophoton Ramsey spectroscopy. Furthermore, based on the understanding of the main factor limiting the coherence of the two-photon Rabi transition, we obtain a Rabi line shape with linewidth below 0.8 Hz. The simultaneous realization of long lifetime and coherence time, and ultrahigh spectroscopic resolution in our system unveils the great potentials of Ultracold polar molecules in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology.

TI Geometric bounds on the power of adiabatic thermal machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We analyze the performance of slowly driven meso-and microscale refrigerators and heat engines that operate between two thermal baths with a small temperature difference. Using a general scaling argument, we show that such devices can work arbitrarily close to their Carnot limit only if heat leaks between the baths are fully suppressed. Their power output is then subject to a universal geometric bound that decays quadratically to zero at the Carnot limit. This bound can be asymptotically saturated in the quasistatic limit if the driving protocols are suitably optimized and the temperature difference between the baths goes to zero with the driving frequency. These results hold under generic conditions for any thermodynamically consistent dynamics admitting a welldefined adiabatic-response regime and a generalized Onsager symmetry. For illustration, we work out models of a qubit-refrigerator and a coherent charge pump operating as a cooling device.

TI Circuit quantization with time-dependent magnetic fields for realistic
   geometries
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum circuit theory has become a powerful and indispensable tool to predict the dynamics of superconducting circuits. Surprisingly however, the question of how to properly account for a time-dependent driving via external magnetic fields has hardly been addressed so far. Here, we derive a general recipe to construct a low-energy Hamiltonian, taking as input only the circuit geometry and the solution of the external magnetic fields. We find that the interplay of geometry and field distribution leads to a much richer circuit dynamics than commonly anticipated, already in devices as simple as the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). These dynamics can be captured by assigning negative, time-dependent or even momentarily singular capacitances to the Josephson junctions. Negative capacitances give rise to a strong enhancement of the qubit relaxation rates, while time-dependent capacitances lead to a finite Berry phase.

TI Microscopic biasing of discrete-time quantum trajectories
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We develop a microscopic theory for biasing the quantum trajectories of an open quantum system, which renders rare trajectories typical. To this end we consider a discrete-time quantum dynamics, where the open system collides sequentially with qubit probes which are then measured. A theoretical framework is built in terms of thermodynamic functionals in order to characterize its quantum trajectories (each embodied by a sequence of measurement outcomes). We show that the desired biasing is achieved by suitably modifying the Kraus operators describing the discrete open system dynamics. From a microscopical viewpoint and for short collision times, this corresponds to adding extra collisions which enforce the system to follow a desired rare trajectory. The above extends the theory of biased quantum trajectories from Lindblad-like dynamics to sequences of arbitrary dynamical maps, providing at once a transparent physical interpretation.

TI RF reflectometry for readout of charge transition in a physically
   defined p-channel MOS silicon quantum dot
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We have embedded a physically defined p-channel MOS silicon quantum dot (QD) device into an impedance transformer RC circuit. To decrease the parasitic capacitance of the device which emerges in MOS devices that have a top gate, we fabricate a new device to reduce the device's top gate area from 400 to 0.09 mu m(2). Having a smaller top gate eliminates parasitic capacitance problem preventing the RF signal from reaching QD. We show that we have fabricated a single QD properly, which is essential for RF single-electron transistor technique. We also analyze and improve the impedance matching condition and show that it is possible to perform readout of charge transition at 4.2 K by RF reflectometry. This will enable fast readout of charge and spin states.

TI Exact thermal properties of free-fermionic spin chains

We focus on spin chain models that admit a description in terms of free fermions, including paradigmatic examples such as the one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising and XY models. The exact partition function is derived and compared with the ubiquitous approximation in which only the positive parity sector of the energy spectrum is considered. Errors stemming from this approximation are identified in the neighborhood of the critical point at low temperatures. We further provide the full counting statistics of a wide class of observables at thermal equilibrium and characterize in detail the thermal distribution of the kink number and transverse magnetization in the transverse-field quantum Ising chain.

TI Mass-assisted local deconfinement in a confined Z2 lattice gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed-matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance but also can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here we show how confinement in a Z2 LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in Z2 LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.

TI Spectral continuum in the Rabi-Stark model [Invited]
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The Rabi-Stark model is a nonlinear generalization of the quantum Rabi model including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of normalizable states is embedded in the continuum, which furnishes an unexpected analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained analytically through two equally justified but different confluence processes of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale numerical checks.

TI Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on

The Ising-type interactions sigma xi sigma xj and sigma yi sigma yj are simultaneously generated by employing two spin-dependent forces operating in parallel on the same set of normal modes. We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with 171Yb+ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.

TI Designer Spin Models in Tunable Two-Dimensional Nanographene Lattices

AB Motivated by recent experimental breakthroughs, we propose a strategy for designing two-dimensional spin-lattices with competing interactions that lead to nontrivial emergent quantum states. We consider S = (1)/(2) nanographenes with C-3 symmetry as building blocks, and we leverage the potential to control both the sign and the strength of exchange with first neighbors to build a family of spin models. Specifically, we consider the case of a Heisenberg model in a triangle-decorated honeycomb lattice with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions whose ratio can be varied in a wide range. On the basis of the exact diagonalization of both Fermionic and spin models, we predict a quantum phase transition between a valence bond crystal of spin singlets with triplon excitations living in a Kagom & eacute; lattice and a N & eacute;el phase of effective S = (3)/(2) in the limit of dominant ferromagnetic interactions.

TI Mixed-symmetry superconductivity and the energy gap
SO PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, or simply the "gap", provides certain constraints on the actual mechanism that gives rise to pairing and ultimately to superconductivity. In this work we show how superconducting phases with mixed singlet-triplet symmetries can arise below T-c for a generic tight-binding model. We first examine the 1D case to better illustrate the prevalence of symmetry-breaking transitions below T, and then the more realistic 2D case. In both cases we illustrate the implication for spectroscopic investigations of the energy gap by calculating the density of states for different temperatures below T. We find that the structure of the density of states near T-c can vary dramatically from its form near T = 0. A complete picture of the superconducting symmetry can only be attained if measurements are made over the entire temperature range.

TI Half Landau-Zener ramp to a quantum phase transition in a dissipative
   single spin model
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB We study the dynamics of a single spin coupled to a bosonic bath at zero temperature driven by a ramp of the bias field. A single spin coupled to a bosonic sub-Ohmic bath exhibits a quantum phase transition at a certain strength of spin-boson coupling. When the bias field is ramped from a large value to zero at this critical coupling strength, the system initialized at the ground state ends up with a finite magnetization due to the critical slowing down near the transition. On the basis of the pulse-impulse approximation, we derive a scaling law between the residual magnetization and the ramp speed. The obtained scaling relation is examined using a numerical simulation based on the tensor network. The data are in favor of the scaling law to hold. We discuss the demonstration of our theoretical results by means of quantum simulation using the quantum annealer.

TI NeuroQ: Quantum-Inspired Brain Emulation

AB Traditional brain emulation approaches often rely on classical computational models that inadequately capture the stochastic, nonlinear, and potentially coherent features of biological neural systems. In this position paper, we introduce NeuroQ a quantum-inspired framework grounded in stochastic mechanics, particularly Nelson's formulation. By reformulating the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model with structured noise, we derive a Schr & ouml;dinger-like equation that encodes membrane dynamics in a quantum-like formalism. This formulation enables the use of quantum simulation strategies-including Hamiltonian encoding, variational eigensolvers, and continuous-variable models-for neural emulation. We outline a conceptual roadmap for implementing NeuroQ on near-term quantum platforms and discuss its broader implications for neuromorphic quantum hardware, artificial consciousness, and time-symmetric cognitive architectures. Rather than demonstrating a working prototype, this work aims to establish a coherent theoretical foundation for future research in quantum brain emulation.

TI Particle production and hadronization temperature in the massive

AB We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.

The behavior of the entropy reveals a non-Fermi-liquid state at sufficiently high interactions near half filling: A maximum in the entropy at nonzero doping develops as the coupling strength is increased, along with an inflection point, evidencing a metal to non-Fermi-liquid crossover. The specific heat exhibits additional distinctive features of a non-Fermi-liquid state. Measurements of the entropy can, therefore, be used as a probe of the state of the system in quantum simulation experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

TI Phonon excitations of Floquet-driven superfluids in a tilted optical
   lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Tilted lattice potentials with periodic driving play a crucial role in the study of artificial gauge fields and topological phases with ultracold quantum gases. However, driving-induced heating and the growth of phonon modes restrict their use for probing interacting many-body states. Here, we experimentally investigate phonon modes and interaction-driven instabilities of superfluids in the lowest band of a shaken optical lattice. We identify stable and unstable parameter regions and provide a general resonance condition. In contrast to the high-frequency approximation of a Floquet description, we use the micromotion of the superfluids to analyze the growth of phonon modes from slow- to fast-driving frequencies. The model describes phonon excitations in both resonantly and nonresonantly driven systems, with or without a tilted potential. Our observations enable the prediction of stable parameter regimes for quantum-simulation experiments aimed at studying driven systems with strong interactions over extended time scales.

TI Photon-mediated correlated hopping in a synthetic ladder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a different direction in quantum simulation that uses multilevel atoms in an optical cavity as a toolbox to engineer different types of bosonic models featuring correlated hopping processes in a synthetic ladder spanned by atomic ground states. The underlying mechanisms responsible for correlated hopping are collective cavity-mediated interactions that dress a manifold of excited levels in the far-detuned limit. By weakly coupling the ground-state levels to these dressed states using two laser drives with appropriate detunings, one can engineer correlated hopping processes while suppressing undesired single-particle and collective shifts of the ground-state levels. We discuss the rich many-body dynamics that can be realized in the synthetic ladder including pair production processes, chiral transport, and light-cone correlation spreading. The latter illustrates that an effective notion of locality can be engineered in a system with fully collective interactions.

TI Collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate of hard-core bosons
   and their mediated interactions: from two-body bound states to mediated
   superfluidity
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The exchange of collective modes has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for inducing superconductivity and superfluidity in various condensed matter and atomic systems. In this article, we study the mediated interactions of collective excitations in an ultracold gas of hard-core bosons. We show that the induced interaction supports two-body states with energies, symmetries, and a number of bound states strongly dependent on the properties of the hard-core boson gas. The ability to control the nature of the two-body bound states motivates the study of superfluid phases, which we address within the BKT theory. We demonstrate how the superfluid parameters and critical temperatures can be tuned in our system. Our findings may pave the way for future theoretical and experimental studies with ultracold gases and solid-state systems.

TI Efficient control of fluxonium qubits via nonadiabatic transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The fluxonium qubit is a promising platform for quantum operations due to its large anharmonicity and long coherence time. However, conventional resonant driving methods often require long operation times and complex implementation. As an alternative, nonadiabatic transitions induced by a time-dependent external flux phi(ext)(t) can enable faster and simpler control by exploiting quantum interference between multiple transition paths. Existing approaches typically impose periodicity or symmetry on phi(ext)(t), which can limit control efficiency. We propose a design strategy for phi(ext)(t) that relaxes these constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in two key scenarios: population inversion and adiabatic passage. Numerical simulations show that our method achieves higher control efficiency than existing schemes, emphasizing the advantage of breaking periodicity and symmetry. Furthermore, by incorporating decoherence effects using the Lindblad master equation, we confirm that the proposed scheme remains robust under realistic conditions.

TI Floquet evolution of the q-deformed SU(3)1 Yang-Mills theory on a
   two-leg ladder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We simulate Floquet time evolution of a truncated SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory on a two-leg ladder geometry under open boundary conditions using IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm_fez. To this end, we derive the quantum spin representation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory and compose a quantum circuit carefully tailored to hardware, reducing the number of controlled-Z gates. Since it is still challenging to simulate Hamiltonian evolution in present noisy quantum processors, we make the step size in the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition very large and simulate thermalization dynamics in Floquet circuit composed of the Suzuki-Trotter evolution. We demonstrate that IBM's Heron quantum processor can simulate, by error mitigation, Floquet thermalization dynamics in a large system consisting of 62 qubits. Our work would be a benchmark for further quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using real devices.

AB Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices suffer from various sources of intrinsic quantum noise. Overcoming the effects of noise is a major challenge, for which different error mitigation and error correction techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we conduct a first study of the performance of quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) in the presence of different types of quantum noise, focusing on a simplified use case in high-energy physics. In particular, we explore the effects of readout and two-qubit gate errors on the qGAN training process. Simulating a noisy quantum device classically with IBM's Qiskit framework, we examine the threshold of error rates up to which a reliable training is possible. In addition, we investigate the importance of various hyperparameters for the training process in the presence of different error rates, and we explore the impact of readout error mitigation on the results.

TI Measured Composite Collision Models: Quantum Trajectory Purities and
   Channel Divisibility
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate a composite quantum collision model with measurements on the memory part, which effectively probe the system. The framework allows us to adjust the measurement strength, thereby tuning the dynamical map of the system. For a two-qubit setup with a symmetric and informationally complete measurement on the memory, we study the divisibility of the resulting dynamics in dependence of the measurement strength. The measurements give rise to quantum trajectories of the system and we show that the average asymptotic purity depends on the specific form of the measurement. With the help of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the different performance of the measurements is generic and holds for almost all interaction gates between the system and the memory in the composite collision model. The discrete model is then extended to a time-continuous limit.

TI Tunneling of fluxons via a Josephson resonant level
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Fluxons in a superconducting loop can be coherently coupled by quantum phase slips occurring at a weak link such as a Josephson junction. If Cooper pair tunneling at the junction occurs through a resonant level, then 2n quantum phase slips are suppressed, and fluxons are predominantly coupled by 4n quantum phase slips. We analyze this scenario by computing the coupling between fluxons as the level is brought into resonance with the superconducting condensate. The results indicate that the 4n-dominated regime can be observed directly in the transition spectrum for circuit parameters typical of a fluxonium qubit. We also show that if the inductive energy of the loop is much smaller than the plasma frequency of the junction, then the low-energy Hamiltonian of the circuit is dual to that of a topological superconducting island. These findings can inform experiments on bifluxon qubits as well as the design of novel types of protected qubits.

TI A Higher radix architecture for quantum carry-lookahead adder
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum carry-lookahead adder based on the higher radix structure. For the addition of two n-bit numbers, our adder uses O(n) - O(n/r) qubits and O(n) + O(n/r) T gates to get the correct answer in T-depth O(r) + O(log n/r), where r is the radix. Quantum carry-lookahead adder has already attracted some attention because of its low T-depth. Our work further reduces the overall cost by introducing a higher radix layer. By analyzing the performance in T-depth, T-count, and qubit count, it is shown that the proposed adder is superior to existing quantum carry-lookahead adders. Even compared to the Draper out-of-place adder which is very compact and efficient, our adder is still better in terms of T-count.

TI O(1) benchmarking of precise rotation in a spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein
   condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Benchmarking a high-precision quantum operation is a big challenge for many quantum systems in the presence of various noises as well as control errors. Here we propose an O(1) benchmarking of a dynamically corrected rotation by taking quantum advantage of a squeezed spin state in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Our analytical and numerical results show that tiny rotation infidelity, defined by 1 - F with F the rotation fidelity, can be calibrated in the order of 1/N2 by only several measurements of the rotation error for N atoms in an optimally squeezed spin state. Such an O(1) benchmarking is possible not only in a spin-1 BEC but also in other many-spin or many-qubit systems if a squeezed or entangled state is available.

TI Subsystem trace-distances of two random states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study two-state discrimination in chaotic quantum systems. Assuming that one of two N-qubit pure states has been randomly selected, the probability to correctly identify the selected state from an optimally chosen experiment involving a subset of N - N-B qubits is given by the trace-distance of the states, with N-B qubits partially traced out. In the thermodynamic limit N -> infinity, the average subsystem trace-distance for random pure states makes a sharp, first order transition from unity to zero at f = 1/2, as the fraction f =N-B/N of unmeasured qubits is increased. We analytically calculate the corresponding crossover for finite numbers N of qubits, study how it is affected by the presence of local conservation laws, and test our predictions against exact diagonalization of models for many-body chaos.

TI Multilevel quantum thermodynamic swap engines

AB We study energetic exchanges and fluctuations in two-stroke quantum thermodynamic engines where the working fluid is represented by two multilevel quantum systems, i.e., qudits, the heat flow is allowed by relaxation with two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, and the work exchange is operated by a partial-swap unitary interaction. We identify three regimes of operation (heat engine, refrigerator, and thermal accelerator), present the thermodynamic uncertainty relations between the entropy production and the signal-to-noise ratio of work and heat, and derive the full joint probability of the stochastic work and heat. Our results bridge the gap between two-qubit and two-mode bosonic swap engines, and show which properties are maintained (e.g., a nonfluctuating Otto efficiency) and which are lost for increasing dimension (e.g., small violations of the standard thermodynamic uncertainty relations or the possibility of beating the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency).

TI Neural-Network Heuristics for Adaptive Bayesian Quantum Estimation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum metrology promises unprecedented measurement precision but suffers in practice from the limited availability of resources such as the number of probes, their coherence time, or nonclassical quantum states. The adaptive Bayesian approach to parameter estimation allows an efficient use of resources because of adaptive experiment design. For its practical success, fast numerical solutions for the Bayesian update and the adaptive experiment design are crucial. Here we show that neural networks can be trained to become fast and strong experiment-design heuristics using a combination of an evolutionary strategy and reinforcement learning. Neural-network heuristics are shown to outperform established heuristics for the technologically important example of frequency estimation of a qubit that suffers from dephasing. Our method of creating neural-network heuristics is very general and complements the well-studied sequential Monte Carlo method for Bayesian updates to form a complete framework for adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation.

TI Quantum Simulations of Vibrational Strong Coupling via Path Integrals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB A quantum simulation of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in the collective regime via thermostated ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD) is reported. For a collection of liquid-phase water molecules resonantly coupled to a single lossless cavity mode, the simulation shows that as compared with a fully classical calculation, the inclusion of nuclear and photonic quantum effects does not lead to a change in the Rabi splitting but does broaden polaritonic line widths roughly by a factor of 2. Moreover, under thermal equilibrium, both quantum and classical simulations predict that the static dielectric constant of liquid water is largely unchanged inside vs outside the cavity. This result disagrees with a recent experiment demonstrating that the static dielectric constant of liquid water can be resonantly enhanced under VSC, suggesting either limitations of our approach or perhaps other experimental factors that have not yet been explored.

TI Multiterminal nonreciprocal routing in an optomechanical plaquette via
   synthetic magnetism
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optomechanical systems with parametric coupling between optical (photon) and mechanical (phonon) modes provide a useful platform to realize various magnetic-free nonreciprocal devices, such as isolators, circulators, and directional amplifiers. However, nonreciprocal router with multiaccess channels has not been extensively studied yet. Here, we propose a nonreciprocal router with one transmitter, one receiver, and two output terminals, based on an optomechanical plaquette composing of two optical modes and two mechanical modes. The time-reversal symmetry of the system is broken via synthetic magnetism induced by driving the two optical modes with phase-correlated laser fields. The prerequisites for nonreciprocal routing are obtained both analytically and numerically, and the robustness of the nonreciprocity is demonstrated numerically. Multiterminal nonreciprocal router in optomechanical plaquette provides a useful quantum node for development of quantum network information security and realization of quantum secure communication.

TI Quantum Interference of Resonance Fluorescence from Germanium-Vacancy
   Color Centers in Diamond
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Resonance fluorescence from a quantum emitter is an ideal source to extract indistinguishable photons. By using the cross-polarization to suppress the laser scattering, we observed resonance fluorescence from GeV color centers in diamond at cryogenic temperature. The Fourier-transform-limited line width emission with T-2/2T(1) similar to 0.86 allows for two-photon interference based on single GeV color center. Under pulsed excitation, the separated photons exhibit a Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference above classical limit, whereas the continuous-wave excitation leads to a coalescence time window of 1.05 radiative lifetime. In addition, we demonstrated a single-shot readout of spin states with a fidelity of 74%. Our experiments lay down the foundation for building a quantum network with GeV color centers in diamond.

TI Simulating quantum Hall physics in ultracold atomic gases: prospects and
   challenges
SO COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE
AB This proceedings presents recent advancements in the realization of topological states of matter using ultracold atomic gases. We focus on the simulation of the quantum Hall effect, originally discovered in two-dimensional electron gases subjected to a magnetic field. Given that ultracold atoms are neutral, simulating the effect of a magnetic field requires an ad-hoc technique. We review various methods developed for this purpose, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we explore the extension of these techniques to interacting quantum gases within topological bands, aiming to create analogs of fractional quantum Hall states. These many-body states are distinguished by their topological order, which is characterized by long-range entanglement among particles and the emergence of low-lying excitations exhibiting fractional quantum statistics. The discussion will encompass the current state of research and potential future directions in the field.

TI The Dirac Equation, Mass and Arithmetic by Permutations of Automaton
   States
SO ENTROPY
AB The cornerstones of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics are its underlying ontological states that evolve by permutations. They do not create would-be quantum mechanical superposition states. We review this with a classical automaton consisting of an Ising spin chain which is then related to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Based on this and generalizing, we construct a new "Necklace of Necklaces" automaton with a torus-like topology that lends itself to represent the Dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions. Special attention has to be paid to its mass term, which necessitates this enlarged structure and a particular scattering operator contributing to the step-wise updates of the automaton. As discussed earlier, such deterministic models of discrete spins or bits unavoidably become quantum mechanical, when only slightly deformed.

TI On-Demand Driven Dissipation for Cavity Reset and Cooling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a superconducting circuit device that provides active, on-demand, tunable dissipation on a target mode of the electromagnetic field. Our device is based on a tunable "dissipator" that can be made lossy when tuned into resonance with a broadband filter mode. When driven parametrically, this dissipator induces loss on any mode coupled to it with energy detuning equal to the drive frequency. We demonstrate the use of this device to reset a superconducting qubit's readout cavity after a measurement, removing photons with a characteristic rate greater than 50 mu s-1. We also demonstrate that the dissipation can be driven constantly to simultaneously damp and cool the cavity, effectively eliminating thermal photon fluctuations as a relevant decoherence channel. Our results demonstrate the utility of our device as a modular tool for environmental engineering and entropy removal in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

TI Spin purity of the quantum dot confined electron and hole in an external
   magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate experimentally and theoretically the temporal evolution of the spin of the conduction band electron and that of the valence band heavy hole, both confined in the same semiconductor quantum dot. We use all-optical pulse techniques to perform complete tomographic measurements of the spin as a function of time after its initialization and study the total spin purity (coherence), measured here. In the important limit of a weak externally applied magnetic field, comparable in strength to the Overhauser field due to fluctuations in the surrounding nuclei spins, the measured spin purity performs complex temporal oscillations. We use a central-spin model encompassing the spin's Zeeman and the hyperfine interactions to reproduce the measured results quantitatively. Our studies are essential for designing and optimizing quantum-dot-spin-based entangled multiphoton sources that set stringent limitations on the magnitude of the externally applied field.

TI Quantum state discrimination using noisy quantum neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Near-term quantum computers are noisy, and therefore must run algorithms with a low circuit depth and qubit count. Here we investigate how noise affects a quantum neural network (QNN) for state discrimination, which is applicable on near-term quantum devices as it fulfils the above criteria. We find that for the required gradient calculation on a noisy device a quantum circuit with a large number of parameters is disadvantageous. By introducing a smaller circuit ansatz we overcome this limitation, and find that the QNN performs well at noise levels of current quantum hardware. We present a model showing that the main effect of the noise is to increase the overlap between the states as circuit gates are applied, hence making discrimination more difficult. Our findings demonstrate that noisy quantum computers can be used for state discrimination and other applications, such as classifiers of the output of quantum generative adversarial networks.

TI Navigation and Ranging Scheme Based on Hybrid Entangled Quantum Signals
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Since the birth of navigation, it has had a huge impact on human life. At present, various navigation and positioning methods based on physical foundations such as sound, light, electricity, magnetism, and force have emerged one after another. Among them, the systems based on radio navigation technology for navigation and detection are the most common, radio navigation is still the main means used in the field of military and civil aviation navigation. Navigation is the process of guiding the safe navigation of the operating body. The main tasks include ranging, angle measurement and positioning, etc. These tasks are premised on obtaining the required navigation parameters. The navigation parameters are mainly divided into four types, namely position, angle, distance and speed. The position is a space-time parameter, including the time and space information of the running body. With the progress of the times and the growth of human needs, although the traditional navigation detection method is still the mainstream application in related fields, the detection accuracy is limited. Besides, it is easy to be interfered, the long- distance weak signal detection ability is not strong, and the safety performance cannot be effectively guaranteed. It has become increasingly prominent that traditional radio navigation methods will gradually fail to meet human needs for navigation. It is of great significance to study new navigation ranging solutions combined with quantum lighting to solve the above problems. Meanwhile, quantum illumination can only interrogate the presence of a target in one polarization-azimuth-elevation- range-Doppler-resolution area array at a time. It sends a signal to a narrow area and judges the presence of a target moving at a fixed speed at a fixed time, while practical navigation systems usually estimate the target's polarization properties, azimuth and elevation, distance and velocity ( via Doppler effect). Therefore, it is of great significance to study new solutions to solve this problem and give full play to its advantages.
   Methods In this paper, combined with the method and principle of quantum lighting, the cavity electro- optical force converter is used to solve the problem of signal detection, and the energy and quantum state transfer between light waves and microwaves are realized, so that the advantages of the two complement each other. The model is transformed into a multi-objective hypothesis testing problem, and the advantages of the proposed scheme are verified by simulating the target identification error probability index and ranging accuracy of the classical ranging scheme and the proposed scheme.
   Results and Discussions Combined with the principle and scheme of quantum lighting, by modeling the ranging task as a multi-target hypothesis testing problem, the limitation of binary hypothesis testing in quantum lighting is broken (Fig. 2). The asymptotic performance of the classical ranging scheme and the entangled ranging scheme is discussed and analyzed, and simulations are carried out. The entanglement upper limit ( dotted line) proves the advantages of entangled ranging, as well as the scale advantage in the error index, while the progressive performance ( dotted solid line) further demonstrates the advantages of entangled ranging. The error index of the QCB simulation results ( dotted solid line in the entangled case and dotted dashed line in the classical case) shows a 6 dB (4- fold) advantage brought by entanglement, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis (Fig. 3). The relationship between the error probability measurement performance of different ranging schemes and the distance accuracy and target reflectivity is simulated and analyzed. When the target reflectivity is constant, there is an inverse relationship between the error probability performance of the entangled ranging scheme and the ranging accuracy. When the error probability is high, the ranging accuracy is low, and when the error probability is low, the ranging accuracy is high. Besides, the solution proposed in this paper is better than the classical ranging solution in terms of ranging accuracy.
   Conclusions In this paper, by modeling the ranging task as a multi- target hypothesis testing problem, a quantum entanglement-based navigation ranging scheme is proposed. The principle and model of the ranging scheme are expounded, and the progressive performance of the classical ranging scheme and entanglement measuring scheme is analyzed. On this basis, a quantitative analysis of the common parameters of different ranging schemes is carried out, the ranging performance is compared, and the relationship between ranging accuracy and ranging error probability is analyzed. The proposed scheme outperforms the classical scheme, providing a 6 dB advantage in determining the error exponent for any number of possible ranges. In addition, this ranging scheme can also be used to realize entanglement- assisted communication of pulse position modulation, and provides an application direction for quantum ranging radar with quantum advantages.

TI Development of Grating for the Optical Addressing of Sr+ Ions
   With Data Analysis Techniques
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB In this study, SiN-based gratings with various radius of curvature (r) are designed and fabricated for the optical addressing of trapped Sr+ ion. The beam width of the light coupled out from the gratings is investigated using a self-developed Python-based data analysis technique. It is found that the r values have insignificant influence on the beam width along x-axis; whereas the beam waist along y-axis reduces from 13.96 to 12.3 mu m as r increases from 15 to 20 mu m, then increases gradually to 20.51 mu m as the r value further increases to 60 mu m. The obtained results can provide a versatile solution on the optical addressing of trapped Sr+ for applications in quantum engineering.

TI Simple master equations for describing driven systems subject to
   classical non-Markovian noise
SO QUANTUM
AB Driven quantum systems subject to non-Markovian noise are typically difficult to model even if the noise is classical. We present a systematic method based on generalized cumulant expansions for deriving a time-local master equation for such systems. This master equation has an intuitive form that directly parallels a standard Lindblad equation, but contains several surprising features: the combination of driving and non-Markovianity results in effective time-dependent dephasing rates that can be negative, and the noise can generate Hamiltonian renormalizations even though it is classical. We analyze in detail the highly relevant case of a Rabi-driven qubit subject to various kinds of non-Markovian noise including $1/f$ fluctuations, finding an excellent agreement between our master equation and numerically-exact simulations over relevant timescales. The approach outlined here is more accurate than commonly employed phenomenological master equations which ignore the interplay between driving and noise.

TI Two-body Wigner molecularization in asymmetric quantum dot spin qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Coulomb interactions strongly influence the spectrum and the wave functions of a few electrons or holes confined in a quantum dot. In particular, when the confinement potential is not too strong, the Coulomb repulsion triggers the formation of a correlated state, the Wigner molecule, where the particles tend to split apart. We show that the anisotropy of the confinement potential strongly enhances the molecularization process and affects the performances of quantum dot systems used as spin qubits. Relying on analytical and numerical solutions of the two-particle problem-both in a simplified single-band approximation and in realistic setups-we highlight the exponential suppression of the singlet-triplet gap with increasing anisotropy. We compare the molecularization effects in different semiconductor materials and discuss how they specifically hamper Pauli spin blockade readout and reduce the exchange interactions in two-qubit gates.

TI Demonstration of Shor's factoring algorithm for N=21 on IBM quantum

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We report a proof-of-concept demonstration of a quantum order-finding algorithm for factoring the integer 21. Our demonstration involves the use of a compiled version of the quantum phase estimation routine, and builds upon a previous demonstration. We go beyond this work by using a configuration of approximate Toffoli gates with residual phase shifts, which preserves the functional correctness and allows us to achieve a complete factoring of N = 21. We implemented the algorithm on IBM quantum processors using only five qubits and successfully verified the presence of entanglement between the control and work register qubits, which is a necessary condition for the algorithm's speedup in general. The techniques we employ may be useful in carrying out Shor's algorithm for larger integers, or other algorithms in systems with a limited number of noisy qubits.

TI Nonperturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multiflavor
   Schwinger Model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Gauge-field configurations with nontrivial topology have profound consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons. Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such fractons is usually restricted to semiclassical argumentation. Here, we show that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example. Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds light on how the nontrivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging nonperturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in tabletop experiments.

TI Gleason's theorem for composite systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Gleason's theorem (Gleason 1957J. Math. Mech.6885) is an important result in the foundations of quantum mechanics, where it justifies the Born rule as a mathematical consequence of the quantum formalism. Formally, it presents a key insight into the projective geometry of Hilbert spaces, showing that finitely additive measures on the projection lattice P(H)extend to positive linear functionals on the algebra of bounded operators B(H). Over many years, and by the effort of various authors, the theorem has been broadened in its scope from type I to arbitrary von Neumann algebras (without type I-2 factors). Here, we prove a generalisation of Gleason's theorem to composite systems. To this end, we strengthen the original result in two ways: first, we extend its scope to dilations in the sense of Naimark (1943Dokl. Akad. Sci. SSSR41359) and Stine spring(1955Proc. Am. Math. Soc.6211) and second, we require consistency with respect to dynamical correspondences on the respective (local) algebras in the composition (Alfsen and Shultz 1998Commun. Math. Phys.19487). We show that neither of these conditions changes the result in the single system case, yet both are necessary to obtain a generalisation to bipartite systems

TI Multi-particle production in proton-nucleus collisions in the color
   glass condensate
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We compute multi-gluon production in the Color Glass Condensate approach in dilute-dense collisions, pA, extending previous calculations up to four gluons. We include the contributions that are leading in the overlap area of the collision but keep all orders in the expansion in the number of colors. We develop a diagrammatic technique to write the numerous color contractions and exploit the symmetries to group the diagrams and simplify the expressions. To proceed further, we use the McLerran-Venugopalan and Golec-Biernat-Wtisthoff models for the projectile and target averages, respectively. We use a form of the Lipatov vertices that leads to the Wigner function approach for the projectile previously employed, that we generalise to take into account quantum correlations in the projectile wave function. We provide analytic expressions for integrated and differential two gluon cumulants and show a smooth dependence on the parameters defining the projectile and target Wigner function and dipole, respectively. For four gluon correlations we find that the second order four particle cumulant is negative, so a sensible second Fourier azimuthal coefficient can be defined. The effect of correlations in the projectile on this result results qualitatively and quantitatively large.

TI Coarse-Graining of Observables
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We first define the coarse-graining of probability measures in terms of stochastic kernels. We define when a probability measure is part of another probability measure and say that two probability measures coexist if they are both parts of a single probability measure. We then show that any two probability measures coexist. We extend these concepts to observables and instruments and mention that two observables need not coexist. We define the discretization of an observable as a special case of coarse-graining and show that these have 0 -1 stochastic kernels. We next consider finite observables and instruments and show that in these cases, stochastic kernels are replaced by stochastic matrices. We also show that coarse-graining is the same as post-processing in this finite case. We then consider sequential products of observables and discuss the sequential product of a post-processed observable with another observable. We briefly discuss SIC observables and the example of qubit observables.

TI First law of quantum thermodynamics in a driven open two-level system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Assigning the variations of internal energy into heat or work contributions is a challenging task due to the fact that these properties are trajectory dependent. A number of proposals have been put forward for open quantum systems following an arbitrary dynamics. We here focus on nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a two-level system and explore in addition to the conventional approach, two definitions motivated by either classical work or heat in which the driving Hamiltonian or the trajectory itself, respectively, are used to set up a reference basis. We first give the thermodynamic properties for an arbitrary dynamics and illustrate the results on the Bloch sphere. Then, we solve the particular example of a periodically driven qubit interacting with a dissipative and decoherence bath. Our results illustrate the trajectory-dependent character of heat and work and how contributions originally assigned to dissipation in the Lindblad equation can become a coherent part assigned to work.

TI Nonreciprocal frequency conversion with chiral Λ-type atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we begin with a model of a Lambda-type atom whose both transitions are chirally coupled to a wave guide and then extend the model to its giant-atom version. We investigate the single-photon scatterings of the giant-atom model in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. It is shown that the chiral atom-waveguide couplings enable nonreciprocal, reflectionless, and efficient frequency conversion, while the giant-atom structure introduces intriguing interference effects to the scattering behaviors, such as ultranarrow scattering windows. The chiral giant-atom model exhibits quite different scattering spectra in the two regimes and, in particular, demonstrates non-Markovicity-induced nonreciprocity under specific conditions. These phenomena can be understood from the effective detuning and decay rate of the giant-atom model. We believe that our results have potential applications in integrated photonics and quantum network engineering.

TI Detection of genetic mutations in patients with breast cancer from Saudi
   Arabia using Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v.2.0
SO BIOMEDICAL REPORTS
AB Next-Generation Sequencing allows for quick and precise sequencing of multiple genes concurrently. Recently, this technology has been employed for the identification of novel gene mutations responsible for disease manifestation among breast cancer (BC) patients, the most common type of cancer amongst Arabian women, and the major cause of disease-associated death in women worldwide. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 32 Saudi Arabian BC patients with histologically confirmed invasive BC stages I-III and IV, as well from 32 healthy Saudi Arabian women using a QIAamp(R) DNA Mini Kit. The isolated DNA was quantified using a Qubit (TM) dsDNA BR Assay Kit with a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Ion semiconductor sequencing technology with an Ion S5 System and AmpliSeq (TM) Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 were utilized to analyze similar to 2,800 mutations described in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer from 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Ion Reporter Software v.5.6 was used to evaluate the genomic alterations in all the samples after alignment to the hg19 human reference genome. The results showed that out of the 50 genes, 26 mutations, including 17 (65%) missense point mutations (single nucleotide variants), and 9 (35%) frameshift (insertion/deletion) mutations, were identified in 11 genes across the cohort in 61 samples (95%). Mutations were predominantly focused on two genes, PIK3CA and TP53, in the BC genomes of the sample set. PIK3CA mutation, c.1173A>G located in exon 9, was identified in 15 patients (46.9%). The TP53 mutations detected were a missense mutation (c.215C>G) in 26 patients (86.70%) and 1 frameshift mutation (c.215_216insG) in 1 patient (3.33%), located within exon 3 and 5, respectively. This study revealed specific mutation profiles for every BC patient, Thus, the results showed that Ion Torrent DNA Sequencing technology may be a possible diagnostic and prognostic method for developing personalized therapy based on the patient's individual BC genome.

TI Enhanced spectral density of a single germanium vacancy center in a
   nanodiamond by cavity integration
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Color centers in diamond, among them the negatively charged germanium vacancy (GeV-), are promising candidates for many applications of quantum optics, such as a quantum network. For efficient implementation, the optical transitions need to be coupled to a single optical mode. Here, we demonstrate the transfer of a nanodiamond containing a single ingrown GeV- center with excellent optical properties to an open Fabry-Perot microcavity by nanomanipulation utilizing an atomic force microscope. Coupling of the GeV- defect to the cavity mode is achieved, while the optical resonator maintains a high finesse of F = 7700, and a 48-fold spectral density enhancement is observed. This article demonstrates the integration of a GeV- defect with a Fabry-Perot microcavity under ambient conditions with the potential to extend the experiments to cryogenic temperatures toward an efficient spin-photon platform.

TI High-resolution imaging of magnetic fields of banknote
   anti-counterfeiting strip using fiber diamond probe
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Counterfeiting of modern banknotes poses a significant challenge, prompting the use of various preventive measures. One such measure is the magnetic anti-counterfeiting strip. However, due to its inherent weak magnetic properties, visualizing its magnetic distribution has been a longstanding challenge. In this work, we introduce an innovative method by using a fiber optic diamond probe, a highly sensitive quantum sensor designed specifically for detecting extremely weak magnetic fields. We employ this probe to achieve high-resolution imaging of the magnetic fields associated with the RMB 50 denomination anti-counterfeiting strip. Additionally, we conduct computer simulations by using COMSOL Multiphysics software to deduce the potential geometric characteristics and material composition of the magnetic region within the anti-counterfeiting strip. The findings and method presented in this study hold broader significance, extending the RMB 50 denomination to various denominations of the Chinese currency and other items that employ magnetic anti-counterfeiting strips. These advances have the potential to significantly improve and promote security measures in order to prevent the banknotes from being counterfeited.

TI Asymptotically independent fluctuations of stabilizer Rényi entropy and
   entanglement in random unitary circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate numerically the joint distribution of magic (as described by the stabilizer 2-R & eacute;nyi entropy M2) and entanglement (as described by the von Neumann entropy S) in N-qubit Haar-random quantum states. The distribution PN (M2, S) and the marginals become exponentially localized, and centered around the typical values, M2 -* N - 2 and S -* N/2 as N -* oc. Magic and entanglement fluctuations are, however, found to become exponentially uncorrelated. While the set of stabilizer states grows exponentially with N, they nevertheless form a measure-zero subset of Haar-random states and thus occur with vanishing probability. Typical quantum states are characterized by large magic and entanglement entropy, and uncorrelated magic and entanglement fluctuations. The mutual information of the joint distribution vanishes exponentially as N -* oc, implying that fluctuations of these two resources are not only uncorrelated but asymptotically independent.

TI Error-mitigated fermionic classical shadows on noisy quantum devices
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Efficiently estimating fermionic Hamiltonian expectation values is vital for simulating various physical systems. Classical shadow (CS) algorithms offer a solution by reducing the number of quantum state copies needed, but noise in quantum devices poses challenges. We propose an error-mitigated CS algorithm assuming gate-independent, time-stationary, and Markovian (GTM) noise. For n-qubit systems, our algorithm, which employs the easily prepared initial state vertical bar 0(n)> < 0(n)vertical bar assumed to be noiseless, efficiently estimates k-RDMs with (O) over tilde (kn(k)) state copies and (O) over tilde(root n) calibration measurements for GTM noise with constant fidelities. We show that our algorithm is robust against noise types like depolarizing, damping, and X-rotation noise with constant strengths, showing scalings akin to prior CS algorithms for fermions but with better noise resilience. Numerical simulations confirm our algorithm's efficacy in noisy settings, suggesting its viability for near-term quantum devices.

TI Parametrized process characterization with reduced resource requirements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a powerful tool to characterize quantum operations, but it requires considerable resources, making it impractical for more than two-qubit systems. This work proposes an alternative approach that requires significantly fewer resources for unitary process characterization with a built-in method for state preparation and measurement error mitigation. By measuring the quantum process as rotated through the X and Y axes on the Bloch sphere, we can acquire enough information to reconstruct the quantum process matrix ?? and measure its fidelity. We test the algorithm???s performance against standard QPT using simulated and physical experiments on several IBM quantum processors and compare the resulting process matrices. We demonstrate with numerical experiments that the method can improve gate fidelity via a noise reduction in the imaginary part of the process matrix, along with a stark decrease in the number of experiments needed to perform the characterization.

TI Linear semi-infinite programming approach for entanglement
   quantification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We explore the dual problem of the convex roof construction by identifying it as a linear semi-infinite programming (LSIP) problem. Using the LSIP theory, we show the absence of a duality gap between primal and dual problems, even if the entanglement quantifier is not continuous, and prove that the set of optimal solutions is nonempty and bounded. In addition, we implement a central cutting-plane algorithm for LSIP to quantify entanglement between three qubits. The algorithm has global convergence property and gives lower bounds on the entanglement measure for nonoptimal feasible points. As an application, we use the algorithm for calculating the convex roof of the three-tangle and pi-tangle measures for families of states with low and high ranks. Since the pi-tangle measure quantifies the entanglement of W states, we apply the values of the two quantifiers to distinguish between the two different types of genuine three-qubit entanglement.

TI Quantum thermal machine as a rectifier
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study a chain of interacting individual quantum systems connected to heat baths at different temperatures on both ends. Starting with the two-system case, we thoroughly investigate the conditions for heat rectification (asymmetric heat transport), compute thermal conductance, and generalize the results to longer chains. We find that heat rectification in the weak coupling regime can be independent of the chain length and that negative differential thermal conductance occurs. We also examine the relationship between heat rectification with entanglement and the entropy production. In the strong coupling regime, the system exhibits an asymmetric Rabi-type splitting in the thermal conductance, leading to enhanced heat transport and improved rectification inaccessible in the weak coupling. This setup represents the simplest quantum thermal machine that consumes incoherent resources and delivers entanglement while acting as a rectifier and heat valve.

TI All-optical switching at the two-photon limit with
   interference-localized states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a single-photon-by-single-photon all-optical switch concept based on interference-localized states on lattices and their delocalization by interaction. In its "open" operation, the switch stops single photons while allows photon pairs to pass the switch. Alternatively, in the "closed" operation, the switch geometrically separates single-photon and two-photon states. We demonstrate the concept using a three-site Stub unit cell and the diamond chain. The systems are modeled by Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, and the dynamics is solved by exact diagonalization with Lindblad master equation. We discuss realization of the switch using photonic lattices with nonlinearities, superconductive qubit arrays, and ultracold atoms. We show that the switch allows arbitrary "ON"/"OFF" contrast while achieving picosecond switching time at the single-photon switching energy with contemporary photonic materials.

TI Model-free readout-error mitigation for quantum expectation values
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Measurements on current quantum processors are subject to hardware imperfections that lead to readout errors. These errors manifest themselves as a bias in quantum expectation values. Here, we consider a very simple method that forces the bias in the expectation value to appear as a multiplicative factor that can be measured directly and removed at the cost of an increase in the sampling complexity for the observable. This method was previously discussed by Karalekas et al. [Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 024003 (2020)] for the product of single-qubit readout-error models. Here, we formally analyze the method and show that it can be applied to general noise models. In particular, we show the method does not need to assume any specific form of the noise model and requires only that the noise is "weak" to avoid excessive sampling overhead. We prove bounds relating the error in the expectation value to the sample complexity.

TI Free-electron qubits and maximum-contrast attosecond pulses via temporal
   Talbot revivals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We use laser light and a transmission electron microscope to modulate a free-electron beam into high-contrast electron pulses and free-electron qubits by using temporal Talbot revivals. At large enough propagation distances, the discrete energy sidebands from a laser modulation acquire special phases and group delays that optimize or cancel their time-domain interference, producing a revival or alternatively a pulse train at close to 100% modulation depth. A sequence of two laser interactions at an optimized propagation distance allows us to coherently control adjacent energy sidebands in amplitude and phase in the way of a qubit. The use of continuous-wave laser light provides these modulations at almost the full brightness of the beam source. Free electrons under large-distance laser control are therefore a promising tool for ultrafast material characterizations or investigations of free-electron quantum mechanics.

TI Wigner negativity in spin-j systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The nonclassicality of simple spin systems as measured by Wigner negativity is studied on a spherical phase space. Several SU(2)-covariant states with common qubit representations are analyzed: spin coherent states, spin cat (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger or N00N) states, and Dicke (W) states. We derive a bound on the Wigner negativity of spin cat states that rapidly approaches the true value as spin increases beyond j greater than or similar to 5. We find that spin cat states are not significantlyWigner negative relative to their Dicke state counterparts of equal dimension. We also find, in contrast to several entanglement measures, that the mostWigner-negative Dicke basis element is spin dependent, and not the equatorial state vertical bar j, 0) (or vertical bar j, +/- 1/2 > for half-integer spins). These results underscore the influence that dynamical symmetry has on nonclassicality and suggest a guiding perspective for finding novel quantum computational applications.

TI Quantum Hall phases emerging from atom-photon interactions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We reveal the emergence of quantum Hall phases, topological edge states, spectral Landau levels, and Hofstadter butterfly spectra in the two-particle Hilbert space of an array of periodically spaced two-level atoms coupled to a waveguide (waveguide quantum electrodynamics). While the topological edge states of photons require fine-tuned spatial or temporal modulations of the parameters to generate synthetic magnetic fields and the quantum Hall effect, here we demonstrate that a synthetic magnetic field can be self-induced solely by atom-photon interactions. The fact that topological order can be self-induced in what is arguably the simplest possible quantum structure shows the richness of these waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems. We believe that our findings will advance several research disciplines including quantum optics, many-body physics, and nonlinear topological photonics, and that it will set an important reference point for the future experiments on qubit arrays and quantum simulators.

TI Double-dot interferometer for quantum measurement of Majorana qubits and
   stabilizers*
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Motivated by the need of quantum measurement of Majorana qubits and surface-code stabilizers, we analyze the performance of a double-dot interferometer under the influence of environment noise. The double-dot setup design allows accounting for the full multiple tunneling process between the dots through the Majorana island, within a master equation approach. In the co-tunneling regime, which results in a Majorana-mediated effective coupling between the dots, the master equation approach allows us to obtain analytic solutions for the measurement currents. The measurement quality, characterized by figures of merit such as the visibility of measurement signals, is carried out in regard to the unusual decoherence effect rather than 'which-path' dephasing. The results obtained in this work are expected to be useful for future experiments of Majorana qubit and stabilizer measurements.

AB The entanglement of photons originating from electron-positron annihilation has not been experimentally proven. owever, the independent experiments performed so far unanimously confirm that the correlation between the linear polarizations of back-to-back photons from electron-positron annihilation is consistent with the assumption that these photons are entangled in the polarization. Yet, unexpectedly, recent experiments differ as regards the correlation of polarization direction of back-to-back photons after the decoherence induced by the scattering of one of these photons on the electron in the scattering material. In one of the experiments, the correlation before and after the decoherence of the photon state is the same, and in the other experiment, the scattering of one photon leads to a significant decrease in this correlation. Here we discuss this puzzle. Decoherent states were ensured provided by forcing one of the annihilation photons to scatter earlier before measuring the polarization correlation based on Compton kinematics. The comparison is made between the experimental setups used for the different measurements, and the results obtained are briefly discussed, highlighting the parameters that are important in performing such measurements. Finally, the main features of the J-PET detector are presented, along with the schemes for performing similar studies, so that the conclusive results can be used as remarks to solve the puzzle in question. Solving the decoherence puzzle will have crucial consequences for basic studies of entanglement, as well as for the proposed application of the photon polarization in positron emission tomography. If the correlation of the polarization of back-to-back photons from the electron-positron annihilation is the same before and after the scattering of these photons, then it will not be useful for the reduction of scatter fraction in positron emission tomography diagnostics.

TI Photonic quantum router with microcavity exciton polaritons
SO EPL
AB We provide a proposal to realize a multiport photon quantum router based on micro-cavity exciton polaritons with a structure consisting of cavity photons, quantum-well excitons and mechanical oscillators. Among the system, we observe optomechanically induced transparency by analyzing the transmission and reflection spectra, and utilize this phenomenon to design a single-photon multiport quantum router. In the device, the intensity and frequency of output signals can be selected by adjusting pump fields and coupling effects of excitons, photons and mechanical oscillators. We also discover that the router performance is not deteriorated by vacuum and thermal noises by means of noise analyses. Therefore, our proposed photon router is a device with a high transmission efficiency. Our results open new possibilities for constructing photon quantum routers, which may be useful for developing quantum network and communication securities.

TI Dynamical Resource Theory of Informational Nonequilibrium Preservability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Information is instrumental in our understanding of thermodynamics. Their interplay has been studied through completely degenerate Hamiltonians whereby the informational contributions to thermodynamic transformations can be isolated. In this setting, all states other than the maximally mixed state are considered to be in informational nonequilibrium. An important yet still open question is how to characterize the ability of quantum dynamics to preserve informational nonequilibrium. Here, the dynamical resource theory of informational nonequilibrium preservability is introduced to begin providing an answer to this question. A characterization of the allowed operations is given for qubit channels and the n -dimensional Weyl-covariant channels-a physically relevant subset of the general channels. An operational interpretation of a state discrimination game with Bell state measurements is given. Finally, an explicit link between a channel's classical capacity and its ability to preserve informational nonequilibrium is made.

TI Randomized Benchmarking as Convolution: Fourier Analysis of Gate
   Dependent Errors
SO QUANTUM
AB We show that the Randomized Benchmarking (RB) protocol is a convolution amenable to Fourier space analysis. By adopting the mathematical framework of Fourier transforms of matrix-valued functions on groups established in recent work from Gowers and Hatami [19], we provide an alternative proof of Wallman's [32] and Proctor's [28] bounds on the effect of gate-dependent noise on randomized benchmarking. We show explicitly that as long as our faulty gate-set is close to the targeted representation of the Clifford group, an RB sequence is described by the exponential decay of a process that has exactly two eigenvalues close to one and the rest close to zero. This framework also allows us to construct a gauge in which the average gate-set error is a depolarizing channel parameterized by the RB decay rates, as well as a gauge which maximizes the fidelity with respect to the ideal gate-set.

TI On the Floquet analysis of commutative periodic Lindbladians in finite
   dimension
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We consider the Markovian Master Equation over matrix algebra M-d, governed by periodic Lindbladian L-t in standard (Kossakowski-Lindblad-Gorini-Sudarshan) form. It is shown that under simplifying assumption of commutativity, i.e. if LtLt, = L-t,L-t for any moments of time t, t' is an element of R+, the Floquet normal form of resulting completely positive dynamical map is not guaranteed to be given by simultaneously globally Markovian maps. In fact, the periodic part of the solution is even shown to be necessarily non-Markovian. Two examples in algebra M-2 are explicitly calculated: a periodically modulated random qubit dynamics, being a generalization of pure decoherence scheme, and a classically perturbed two-level system, coupled to reservoir via standard ladder operators.

TI High-fidelity light-shift gate for clock-state qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB To date, the highest-fidelity quantum logic gates between two qubits have been achieved using the geometric-phase gate in trapped ions, with the two leading variants being the Molmer-Sorensen gate and the light-shift (LS) gate. Both of these approaches have their respective advantages and challenges. For example, the latter is technically simpler and is natively insensitive to optical phases, but it has not been made to work directly on a clock-state qubit. We present a technique for implementing the LS gate that combines the best features of these two approaches: By using a small (similar to MHz) detuning from a narrow (dipole-forbidden) optical transition, we are able to operate an LS gate directly on hyperfine clock states, achieving gate fidelities of 99.74(4)% using modest laser power at visible wavelengths. Current gate infidelities appear to be dominated by technical noise, and theoretical modeling suggests a path toward gate fidelity above 99.99%.

TI Optimizing the Rydberg EIT spectrum in a thermal vapor
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present Rydberg-state electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) measurements examining the effects of laser polarization, magnetic fields, laser intensities, and the optical density of the thermal Rb-87 medium. Two counter-propagating laser beams with wavelengths of 480 nm and 780 nm were employed to sweep the spectrum across the Rydberg states vertical bar 33D(3/2)> and vertical bar 33D(5/2)>. An analytic transmission expression well fits the Rydberg-EIT spectra with multiple transitions under different magnetic fields and laser polarization after accounting for the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, Zeeman splittings, and Doppler shifts. In addition, the high-contrast Rydberg EIT can be optimized with the probe laser intensity and optical density. Rydberg EIT peak height was achieved at 13 degrees 10, which is more than twice as high as the maximum peak height at room temperature. A quantitative theoretical model is employed to represent the spectra properties and to predict well the optimization conditions. A Rydberg EIT spectrum with high contrast in real time can be served as a quantum sensor to detect the electromagnetic field within an environment.

TI Improved Limits on an Exotic Spin- and Velocity-Dependent Interaction at
   the Micrometer Scale with an Ensemble-NV-Diamond Magnetometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Searching for exotic interactions provides a path for exploring new particles beyond the standard model. Here, we used an ensemble-NV-diamond magnetometer to search for an exotic spin-and velocity -dependent interaction between polarized electron spins and unpolarized nucleons at the micrometer scale. A thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy electronic spin ensemble in diamond is utilized as both the solid-state spin quantum sensor and the polarized electron source, and a vibrating lead sphere serves as the moving unpolarized nucleon source. The exotic interaction is searched by detecting the possible effective magnetic field induced by the moving unpolarized nucleon source using the ensemble-NV-diamond magnetometer. Our result establishes new bounds for the coupling parameter f & BOTTOM; within the force range from 5 to 400 & mu;m. The upper limit of the coupling parameter at 100 & mu;m is jf & BOTTOM;j & LE; 1.1 x 10-11, which is 3 orders of magnitude more stringent than the previous constraint. This result shows that NV ensemble can be a promising platform to search for hypothetical particles beyond the standard model.

TI Spin-dependent force and inverted harmonic potential for rapid creation
   of macroscopic quantum superpositions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Creating macroscopic spatial superposition states is crucial for investigating matter-wave interferometry and advancing quantum sensor technology. Currently, two potential methods exist to achieve this objective. The first involves using inverted harmonic potential (IHP) to spatially delocalize quantum states through coherent inflation [New J. Phys. 19, 123029 (2017)]. The second method employs a spin-dependent force to separate two massive wave packets spatially [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 180403 (2013)]. The disadvantage of the former method is the slow initial coherent inflation, while the latter is hindered by the diamagnetism of spin-embedded nanocrystals, which suppresses spatial separation. In this study, we integrate two methods: first, we use the spin-dependent force to generate initial spatial separation, and second, we use IHP to achieve coherent inflating trajectories of the wave packets. This approach enables the attainment of massive large spatial superposition in minimal time. For instance, a spatial superposition with a mass of 10-15 kg and a size of around 50 mu m is realized in 0.1 s. We also calculate the evolution of wave packets in both harmonic potential (HP) and IHP using the path integral approach.

TI Ultrafast coherent excitation of an ytterbium ion with single laser
   pulses
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Experimental realizations of two qubit entangling gates with trapped ions typically rely on addressing spectroscopically resolved motional sidebands, limiting gate speed to the secular frequency. Fast entangling gates using ultrafast pulsed lasers overcome this speed limit. This approach is based on state-dependent photon recoil kicks from a sequence of counter-propagating, resonant, ultrafast pulse pairs, which can allow sub-microsecond gate speeds. Here, we demonstrate a key component of the ultrafast gate protocol, the coherent excitation of a Yb-171(+) ion across the S-2(1/2)-P-2(1/2) transition with a single near-resonant short optical pulse at 369.53 nm. We achieve a maximum population transfer of 94(1)% using a picosecond pulsed laser that can be tuned across the S-2(1/2)-P-2(1/2) transition and 42.5(9)% with 190(7) GHz detuning.

TI Visualizing the emission of a single photon with frequency and time
   resolved spectroscopy
SO QUANTUM
AB At the dawn of Quantum Physics, Wigner and Weisskopf obtained a full analytical description (a photon portrait) of the emission of a single photon by a twolevel system, using the basis of frequency modes [1]. A direct experimental reconstruction of this portrait demands an accurate measurement of a time resolved fluorescence spectrum, with high sensitivity to the off-resonant frequencies and ultrafast dynamics describing the photon creation. In this work we demonstrate such an experimental technique in a superconducting waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (wQED) platform, using single transmon qubit and two coupled transmon qubits as quantum emitters. In both scenarios, the photon portraits agree quantitatively with the predictions of the input-output theory and qualitatively with Wigner-Weisskopf theory. We believe that our technique allows not only for interesting visualization of fundamental principles, but may serve as a tool, e.g. to realize multi-dimensional spectroscopy in waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics.

TI Unraveling Eumelanin Radical Formation by Nanodiamond Optical
   Relaxometry in a Living Cell
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Defect centers in a nanodiamond (ND) allow the detection of tiny magnetic fields in their direct surroundings, rendering them as an emerging tool for nanoscale sensing applications. Eumelanin, an abundant pigment, plays an important role in biology and material science. Here, for the first time, we evaluate the comproportionation reaction in eumelanin by detecting and quantifying semiquinone radicals through the nitrogen-vacancy color center. A thin layer of eumelanin is polymerized on the surface of nanodiamonds (NDs), and depending on the environmental conditions, such as the local pH value, near-infrared, and ultraviolet light irradiation, the radicals form and react in situ. By combining experiments and theoretical simulations, we quantify the local number and kinetics of free radicals in the eumelanin layer. Next, the ND sensor enters the cells via endosomal vesicles. We quantify the number of radicals formed within the eumelanin layer in these acidic compartments by applying optical relaxometry measurements. In the future, we believe that the ND quantum sensor could provide valuable insights into the chemistry of eumelanin, which could contribute to the understanding and treatment of eumelanin- and melanin-related diseases.

TI All-optical and microwave-free detection of Meissner screening using
   nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Microscopic studies on thin film superconductors play an important role for probing non-equilibrium phase transitions and revealing dynamics at the nanoscale. However, magnetic sensors with nanometer scale spatial and picosecond temporal resolution are essential for exploring these. Here, we present an all-optical, microwave-free method that utilizes the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a non-invasive quantum sensor and enables the spatial detection of the Meissner state in a superconducting thin film. We place an NV implanted diamond membrane on a 20 nm thick superconducting La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) thin film with T-c of 34 K. The strong B-field dependence of the NV photoluminescence allows us to investigate the Meissner screening in LSCO under an externally applied magnetic field of 4.2mT in a non-resonant manner. The magnetic field profile along the LSCO thin film can be reproduced using Brandt's analytical model, revealing a critical current density j(c) of 1.4 x 10(8) A/cm(2). Our work can be potentially extended further with a combination of optical pump probe spectroscopy for the local detection of time-resolved dynamical phenomena in nanomagnetic materials.

The nonlinear reflection and transmission of such two-dimensional superatoms are exploited in different interferometric setups for the deterministic generation of tunable single photons and entangling two-photon operations with high fidelities, F greater than or similar to 0.999.

TI Quantum microscopy with van der Waals heterostructures
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Solid-state spin sensors have the capacity to act as quantum microscopes for probing material properties and physical processes. However, so far, these tools have relied on quantum defects hosted in rigid, three-dimensional (3D) crystals such as diamond, limiting their ability to closely interface with the sample. Here we demonstrate a versatile quantum microscope using point defects embedded within a thin layer of the van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride. To showcase the multi-modal capabilities of this platform, we assemble two different heterostructures of a van der Waals material in combination with a quantum-active boron nitride flake. We demonstrate time-resolved, simultaneous temperature and magnetic imaging near the Curie temperature of a van der Waals ferromagnet, as well as map out charge currents and Joule heating in an operating graphene device. The straightforward integration of the hexagonal boron nitride quantum sensor with other van der Waals materials will yield substantial practical benefits for the design and measurement of 2D devices.
   Hexagonal boron nitride is a common component of 2D heterostructures. Defects implanted in boron nitride crystals can be used to perform spatially resolved sensing of properties, including temperature, magnetism and current.

TI Characterization of quantum dot-like emitters in programmable arrays of
   nanowrinkles of 1L-WSe2
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB When combined with nanostructured substrates, two-dimensional semiconductors can be engineered with strain to tailor light-matter interactions on the nanoscale. Recently, room-temperature nanoscale exciton localization with controllable wrinkling in 1L-WSe(2 )was achieved using arrays of gold nanocones. Here, the characterization of quantum dot-like states and single-photon emitters in the 1L-WSe2/nanocone system is reported. The nanocones induce a wide range of strains, and as a result, a diverse ensemble of narrowband, potential single-photon emitters is observed. The distribution of emitter energies reveals that most reside in two spectrally isolated bands, leaving a less populated intermediate band that is spectrally isolated from the ensembles. The spectral isolation is advantageous for high-purity quantum light emitters, and anti-bunched emission from one of these states is confirmed up to 25 K. Although the spatial distribution of strain is expected to influence the orientation of the transition dipoles of the emitters, multimodal emission polarization anisotropy and atomic force microscopy reveal that the macroscopic orientation of the wrinkles is not a good predictor of dipole orientation. Finally, the emission is found to change with thermal cycling from 4 to 290 K and back to 4 K, highlighting the need to control factors such as temperature-induced strain to enhance the robustness of this quantum emitter platform. The initial characterization here shows that controlled nanowrinkles of 1L-WSe2 generate quantum light in addition to uncovering potential challenges that need to be addressed for their adoption into quantum photonic technologies.

TI Telecom single-photon emitters in GaN operating at room temperature:
   embedment into bullseye antennas
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The ideal single-photon source displaying high brightness and purity, emission on-demand, mature integration, practical communication wavelength (i.e., in the telecom range), and operating at room temperature does not exist yet. In 2018, a new single-photon source was discovered in gallium nitride (GaN) showing high potential thanks to its telecom wavelength emission, record-high brightness, good purity, and operation at room temperature. Despite all these assets, its coupling to photonic structures has not been achieved so far. In this article, we make a first step in this direction. First, we analyze whether stacking faults are indeed a necessary condition for obtaining such emitters in GaN layers. Then, we discuss the challenges associated to a low spatial density and to a spectrally wide distribution of emitters, which necessitate their location to be determined beforehand and the photonic structure resonance to be tuned to their emission wavelength. The design and fabrication of bullseye antennas are thoroughly described. Finally, we fabricate such bullseyes around telecom emitters and demonstrate that the embedded emitters are able to sustain the necessary clean-room process and still operate as single-photon emitters after the fabrication steps, with room-temperature purities up to 99% combined with repetition rates in the order of hundreds of kHz. The findings in this work demonstrate that telecom single-photon emitters in GaN operating at room temperature are well adapted for single-photon applications where brightness and purity are the required figures of merit, but highlight the numerous difficulties that still need to be overcome before they can be exploited in actual quantum photonic applications.

TI Reliable quantum advantage in quantum battery charging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum batteries represent one of the most promising applications of quantum thermodynamics, whose goal is not only to store energy inside small quantum systems but also to potentially leverage genuine quantum effects to outperform classical counterparts. In this context, however, energy fluctuations become extremely relevant and have a significant impact on the charging efficiency. In our work, we consider a simple yet paradigmatic model in which a flying qubit (the battery) coherently interacts with a single-mode optical cavity (the charger) through a number conserving Jaynes-Cummings interaction. By making use of full-counting statistics techniques, we fully characterize the average charging power, its fluctuations, and the associated charging efficiency for several different choices of initial states of the optical cavity, demonstrating that preparing the latter in a genuinely quantum non-Gaussian Fock state (rather than a classical or even nonclassical Gaussian state) leads to a definite and in principle measurable advantage in all these figures of merit.

TI Frequency-Resolved Purcell Effect for the Dissipative Generation of
   Steady-State Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report a driven-dissipative mechanism to generate stationary entangled W states among strongly interacting quantum emitters placed within a cavity. Driving the ensemble into the highest energy state- whether coherently or incoherently-enables a subsequent cavity-enhanced decay into an entangled steady state consisting of a single deexcitation shared coherently among all emitters, i.e., a W state, well known for its robustness against qubit loss. The nonharmonic energy structure of the interacting ensemble allows this transition to be resonantly selected by the cavity, while quenching subsequent off-resonant decays. Evidence of this purely dissipative mechanism should be observable in state-of-the-art cavity QED systems in the solid state, enabling new prospects for the scalable stabilization of quantum states in dissipative quantum platforms.

TI Quantum speedup dynamics process in multiqubit-interacting system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the dynamics of an N-qubit interacting system coupled to a common reservoir. In the weak system-environment coupling regime, the crossovers from Markovian to non-Markovian and from no speedup to speedup can be realized by adjusting the controllable parameters (i.e., the coupling strength between qubits and the number of the qubits). However, in the case of strong coupling, the multiple transitions from non-Markovian regime to Markovian regime and from speedup to no speedup can be induced by manipulating controllable parameters. In addition, a phenomenon can be noticed that the number of qubits and the coupling strength between the qubits have the different effect on the non-Markovian dynamics and speedup evolution of the system in the above weak- and strong-coupling regimes. Our results provide an effective theoretical scheme for the realization of non-Markovian speedup dynamic processes.

TI Tunable couplings between location-insensitive emitters mediated by an
   epsilon-near-zero plasmonic waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB This work demonstrates the efficient tuning of incoherent and coherent coupling between emitters embedded in an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) waveguide coated with a multilayer graphene. As a result, a tunable two-qubit quantum phase gate based on the ENZ waveguide is realized at the cutoff frequency. Furthermore, due to the vanishingly small permittivity of the ENZ waveguide, all incoherent coupling between any two identical emitters located in the central area of the slit approaches a maximum, enabling near-ideal bipartite and multipartite entanglement. The coherent coupling between emitters is much larger at an operating frequency far from the ENZ resonance frequency than at the cutoff frequency, and the coherent coupling and resulting energy transfer efficiency can also be effectively tuned by the Fermi level of graphene. These results demonstrate an efficiently tunable electro-optical platform for quantum devices.

TI Functionalizing aromatic compounds with optical cycling centres
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Molecular design principles provide guidelines for augmenting a molecule with a smaller group of atoms to realize a desired property or function. We demonstrate that these concepts can be used to create an optical cycling centre, the Ca(I)-O unit, that can be attached to a number of aromatic ligands, enabling the scattering of many photons from the resulting molecules without changing the molecular vibrational state. Such capability plays a central role in quantum state preparation and measurement, as well as laser cooling and trapping, and is therefore a prerequisite for many quantum science and technology applications. We provide further molecular design principles that indicate the ability to optimize and expand this work to an even broader class of molecules. This represents a great step towards a quantum functional group, which may serve as a generic qubit moiety that can be attached to a wide range of molecular structures and surfaces.

TI Spin-Valley Coupling Anisotropy and Noise in CMOS Quantum Dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB One of the main advantages of silicon spin qubits over other solid-state qubits is their inherent scalability and compatibility with the 300-mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication technology that is already widely used in the semiconductor industry, while maintaining high readout and gate fidelities. We demonstrate the detection of a single electron spin using energy-selective readout in a CMOS-fabricated nanowire device with an integrated charge detector. We measure a valley splitting of 0.3 meV and 0.16 meV in two similar devices. The anisotropy of the spin-valley mixing is measured and shown to follow the dependence expected from the symmetry of the local confinement, indicating low disorder in the region of the quantum dot. Finally the charge noise in the strong spin-valley coupling regime is investigated and found to induce fluctuations in the qubit energy in the range of 0.6 GHz/ root Hz.

TI Analysis of Decoherence in Linear and Cyclic Quantum Walks
SO OPTICS
AB We theoretically analyze the case of noisy Quantum walks (QWs) by introducing four qubit decoherence models into the coin degree of freedom of linear and cyclic QWs. These models include flipping channels (bit flip, phase flip and bit-phase flip), depolarizing channel, phase damping channel and generalized amplitude damping channel. Explicit expressions for the probability distribution of QWs on a line and on a cyclic path are derived under localized and delocalized initial states. We show that QWs which begin from a delocalized state generate mixture probability distributions, which could give rise to useful algorithmic applications related to data encoding schemes. Specifically, we show how the combination of delocalzed initial states and decoherence can be used for computing the binomial transform of a given set of numbers. However, the sensitivity of QWs to noisy environments may negatively affect various other applications based on QWs.

TI Classical communication through quantum causal structures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum mechanics allows operations to be in indefinite causal order, leading to advantages in computational and communication tasks. However, basic notions such as communication capacity have not yet been formalized. In light of this, through the process matrix formalism, we formulate different classical capacities for a bipartite quantum process. For one-way communication, we find that general quantum processes satisfy a generalization of the Holevo bound, i.e., we can send, at most, one bit per qubit. The result also holds for processes with indefinite causal order and with shared entanglement between the sender and the receiver. We further extend known bounds to classical channel capacities, showing that general processes cannot outperform causally separable ones. Next, we study bidirectional communication through a causally separable process. Our result shows that a bidirectional protocol cannot exceed the limit of a one-way communication protocol. Finally, we generalize this result to a multiparty broadcast communication protocol through a definite ordered process.

TI Improved local models and new Bell inequalities via Frank-Wolfe
   algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In Bell scenarios with two outcomes per party, we algorithmically consider the two sides of the membership problem for the local polytope: Constructing local models and deriving separating hyperplanes, that is, Bell inequalities. We take advantage of the recent developments in so-called Frank-Wolfe algorithms to significantly increase the convergence rate of existing methods. First, we study the threshold value for the nonlocality of two-qubit Werner states under projective measurements. Here, we improve on both the upper and lower bounds present in the literature. Importantly, our bounds are entirely analytical; moreover, they yield refined bounds on the value of the Grothendieck constant of order three: 1.4367 <= K-G(3) <= 1.4546. Second, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in multipartite Bell scenarios, and present local models for all projective measurements with visibilities noticeably higher than the entanglement threshold. We make our entire code accessible as a JULIA library called BellPolytopes.jl.

TI Shors Algorithm Using Efficient Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Shor's algorithm solves the integer factoring and discrete logarithm problems in polynomial time. Therefore, the evaluation of Shor's algorithm is essential for evaluating the security of currently used public-key cryptosystems because the integer factoring and discrete logarithm problems are crucial for the security of these cryptosystems. In this article, a new approximate quantum Fourier transform is proposed, and it is applied to Rines and Chuang's implementation. The proposed implementation requires one-third the number of T gates of the original. Moreover, it requires one-fourth of the T-depth of the original. Finally, a T-scheduling method for running the circuit with the smallest KQ (where K is the number of logical qubits and Q is the circuit depth) is presented.

TI Decoding Toric Codes on Three Dimensional Simplical Complexes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Three dimensional (3D) toric codes are a class of stabilizer codes with local checks and come under the umbrella of topological codes. While decoding algorithms have been proposed for the 3D toric code on a cubic lattice, there have been very few studies on the decoding of 3D toric codes over arbitrary lattices. Color codes in 3D can be mapped to toric codes. However, the resulting toric codes are not defined on cubic lattice. They are arbitrary lattices with triangular faces. Decoding toric codes over an arbitrary lattice will help in studying the performance of color codes. Furthermore, gauge color codes can also be decoded via 3D toric codes. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient algorithm to decode 3D toric codes on arbitrary lattices (with and without boundaries).

TI Twin-field quantum digital signatures
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Digital signature is a key technique in information security, especially for identity authentications. Compared to classical correspondence, quantum digital signatures (QDSs) provide a considerably higher level of security. At present, its performance is limited by key generation protocols, which are fundamentally limited in terms of channel capacity. Based on the idea of twin-field quantum key distribution, this Letter presents a twin-field QDS protocol and details a corresponding security analysis. In its distribution stage, a specific key generation protocol, the sending-or-not-sending twin-field protocol, has been adopted. Besides, we present a systematic model to evaluate the performance of a QDS protocol and compare the performance of our protocol to other typical QDS protocols. Numerical simulation results show that the new protocol exhibits outstanding security and practicality compared to other existing protocols. Therefore, our protocol paws the way toward real-world applications of QDSs. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Emergence and control of complex behaviors in driven systems of
   interacting qubits with dissipation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Progress in the creation of large-scale, artificial quantum coherent structures demands the investigation of their nonequilibrium dynamics when strong interactions, even between remote parts, are non-perturbative. Analysis of multiparticle quantum correlations in a large system in the presence of decoherence and external driving is especially topical. Still, the scaling behavior of dynamics and related emergent phenomena are not yet well understood. We investigate how the dynamics of a driven system of several quantum elements (e.g., qubits or Rydberg atoms) changes with increasing number of elements. Surprisingly, a two-element system exhibits chaotic behaviors. For larger system sizes, a highly stochastic, far from equilibrium, hyperchaotic regime emerges. Its complexity systematically scales with the size of the system, proportionally to the number of elements. Finally, we demonstrate that these chaotic dynamics can be efficiently controlled by a periodic driving field. The insights provided by our results indicate the possibility of a reduced description for the behavior of a large quantum system in terms of the transitions between its qualitatively different dynamical regimes. These transitions are controlled by a relatively small number of parameters, which may prove useful in the design, characterization, and control of large artificial quantum structures.

TI On the simulation of quantum multimeters
SO QUANTUM
AB In the quest for robust and universal quantum devices, the notion of simulation plays a crucial role, both from a theoretical and from an applied perspective. In this work, we go beyond the simulation of quantum channels and quantum measurements, studying what it means to simulate a collection of measurements, which we call a multimeter. To this end, we first explicitly characterize the completely positive transformations between multimeters. However, not all of these transformations correspond to valid simulations, as otherwise we could create any resource from nothing. For example, the set of transformations includes maps that always prepare the same multimeter regardless of the input, which we call trash-and-prepare. From the perspective of an experimenter with a given multimeter as part of a complicated setup, having to discard the multimeter and using a different one instead is undesirable. We give a new definition of multimeter simulations as transformations that are triviality-preserving, i.e., when given a multimeter consisting of trivial measurements they can only produce another trivial multimeter. In the absence of a quantum ancilla, we then characterize the transformations that are triviality-preserving and the transformations that are trash-and-prepare. Finally, we use these characterizations to compare our new definition of multimeter simulation to three existing ones: classical simulations, compression of multimeters, and compatibility-preserving simulations.

TI HQMC-CPC: A Hybrid Quantum Multiclass Cardiac Pathologies Classification
   Integrating a Modified Hardware Efficient Ansatz
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Cardiac pathology classification (CPC) based on the volumetric features of three key heart structures can be extracted from segmented cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) sequences. Machine learning models have recently become very effective tools for handling these problems. Hybrid quantum methods can be employed to enhance the capacities of classical machine learning models. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum multiclass cardiac pathologies classification (HQMC-CPC) model. In the proposed model, discriminative features are extracted to characterize the shape and function of the heart, combining the clinical features, patient features, and radiomics features. In the proposed quantum circuits, all variational parameters are trainable, and the enhanced variational quantum circuit is employed for efficient neural network learning. Using only thirty feature values as input, we propose a hybrid quantum multiclass cardiac pathologies classification (HQMC-CPC) model based on the proposed modified hardware efficient ansatz (MHEA). The proposed model achieves promising results in training and testing with the Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC 2017) dataset. Experimental results showed that the proposed HQMC-CPC model is able to classify different cardiac pathologies with an average minimum performance gap of 3.19%. The average maximum improvement in terms of accuracy in cardiac pathology classification is 7.77%. Moreover, the proposed HQMC-CPC speeds up the testing process by around 60% and 40% compared to the classical classifiers and well-established HEA respectively.

TI QOC: Quantum On-Chip Training with Parameter Shift and Gradient Pruning

AB Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) are drawing increasing research interest thanks to its potential to achieve quantum advantages on near-term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. In order to achieve scalable PQC learning, the training process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines instead of using exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to obtain PQC gradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the number of qubits. We present QOC, the first experimental demonstration of practical on-chip PQC training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that due to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients obtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrading the training accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient pruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then remove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than large ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive experiments with the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) benchmarks on 5 classification tasks using 5 real quantum machines. The results demonstrate that our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for 2-class and 4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient pruning brings up to 7% PQC accuracy improvements over no pruning. Overall, we successfully obtain similar on-chip training accuracy compared with noise-free simulation but have much better training scalability. The QOC code is available in the TorchQuantum library.

TI Deterministic single photon subtraction with a cascade of
   waveguide-coupled atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a specialized photon subtraction scheme that allows for the deterministic extraction of single photons from multiphoton states while preserving the input single-photon states unaltered. The proposed device integrates two Lambda-type emitters with transitions selectively coupled to a single chiral waveguide through single photon Raman interaction (SPRINT). We develop a comprehensive theoretical model for the system using the input-output formalism within the SLH framework and conduct numerical simulations to analyze its interaction with traveling few-photon pulses of coherent light. We use these simulations to predict the scheme's operation and highlight how this two-emitter extension improves the original SPRINT-based deterministic single-photon subtraction when it comes to implementing undetectable photon number splitting attack on a quantum key distribution channel.

TI Fractal, Logarithmic, and Volume-Law Entangled Nonthermal Steady States
   via Spacetime Duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The extension of many-body quantum dynamics to the nonunitary domain has led to a series of exciting developments, including new out-of-equilibrium entanglement phases and phase transitions. We show how a duality transformation between space and time, on one hand, and unitarity and nonunitarity, on the other, can be used to realize steady-state phases of nonunitary dynamics that exhibit a rich variety of behavior in their entanglement scaling with subsystem size-from logarithmic to extensive to fractal. We show how these outcomes in nonunitary circuits (that are "spacetime dual" to unitary circuits) relate to the growth of entanglement in time in the corresponding unitary circuits, and how they differ, through an exact mapping to a problem of unitary evolution with boundary decoherence, in which information gets "radiated away" from one edge of the system. In spacetime duals of chaotic unitary circuits, this mapping allows us to analytically derive a nonthermal volume-law entangled phase with a universal logarithmic correction to the entropy, previously observed in unitary-measurement dynamics. Notably, we also find robust steady-state phases with fractal entanglement scaling, S(l) similar to l(alpha) with tunable 0 < alpha < 1 for subsystems of size l in one dimension. We present an experimental protocol for preparing these novel steady states with only a vanishing density of postselected measurements via a type of "teleportation" between spacelike and timelike slices of quantum circuits.

TI Quantum 3D FFT in Tomography
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The Radon transform constitutes the conventional tool for tomosynthesis, i.e., the composition of cross-sections of an object from its projections. It is actually a version of the Fourier Transform, which is accompanied by the appropriate digital high pass filters for correct distribution of energy among the reconstructed frequency components. The Radon transform and its inverse are employed in their 2D and 3D versions, respectively, and the whole procedure is verified by the a priori known cross-sections to be reconstructed (known fandom). Usually, 3D medical image cubes, which are to be reconstructed, require powerful computational tools since the 2D projections are of high-resolution containing millions of pixels. Although the 3D FFT is very fast, the large number of projections will result in a 3D spectrum of very large dimensions. Inverting this spectrum with the inverse 3D FFT is extremely time consuming. In this work, the implementation of the 2D Radon transform using the 2D Quantum Fourier Transform is analytically presented. Simultaneously, its inverse version is realized by means of the Quantum inverse 3D FFT. For this purpose, a review of the necessary quantum computational units is presented for the implementation of the quantum 3D FFT and simultaneously simple examples of tomosynthesis are given by means of the quantum version of the 2D Radon transform and its inverse 3D counterpart. The whole procedure of the quantum tomosynthesis is analytically described.

TI Bidirectional Deep Learning of Polarization Transfer in Liquid Crystals
   with Application to Quantum State Preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Accurate control of light polarization represents a core building block in polarization metrology, imaging, and optical and quantum communications. Voltage-controlled liquid crystals offer an efficient way of polarization transformation. However, common twisted nematic liquid crystals are notorious for lacking an accurate theoretical model linking control voltages and output polarization. An inverse model, which would predict control voltages required to prepare a target polarization, is even more challenging. Here we report both the direct and inverse models based on deep neural networks, radial basis functions, and linear interpolation. We present an inverse-direct compound model solving the problem of control voltages ambiguity. We demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy using deep learning compared to the radial basis function method and 2 orders of magnitude improvement compared to the linear interpolation. Errors of the deep neural network model also decrease faster than the other methods with an increasing number of training data. The best direct and inverse models reach average infidelities of 4 x 10(-4) and 2 x 10(-4), respectively, which are accuracy levels not reported yet. Furthermore, we demonstrate local and remote preparation of an arbitrary single-photon polarization state using deep learning models. The results will impact the application of twisted-nematic liquid crystals, increasing their control accuracy across the board. The presented bidirectional learning can be used for optimal classical control of complex photonic devices and quantum circuits beyond interpolation.

TI Dynamical Coulomb blockade: An all electrical probe of the ultrastrong
   light-matter coupling regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The regime of ultrastrong light-matter coupling (USC) has attracted considerable interest recently, as it predicts fascinating quantum phenomena such as the presence of virtual photons in the ground state. Here we propose theoretically an approach to probe the quantum correlations in USC systems based on an electrical transport experiment. Namely, we consider the case in which the light-matter coupled system constitutes the electromagnetic environment of an ultrasmall tunnel junction operating in the regime of a dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB). Unlike optical spectroscopy, such a probe can be seen as a nondemolition measurement of the USC system ground state. We have developed two approaches in order to evaluate the effect of the light-matter coupled states on the tunneling process. The first is a generalized, multimode Peierls substitution for the tunneling Hamiltonian. The second is based on the P(E) theory describing a DCB, where the USC system is treated as an equivalent circuit. The two approaches are consistent, whereas the second one enables us explicitly to take into account the presence of dissipation. This study has been performed for the zero-temperature case, which is pertinent for the terahertz spectral range where excitation energies are typically much higher compared to the microwave domain, where DCB was first studied.

TI Majorana bound states in semiconducting nanostructures
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB In this Tutorial, we give a pedagogical introduction to Majorana bound states (MBSs) arising in semiconducting nanostructures. We start by briefly reviewing the well-known Kitaev chain toy model in order to introduce some of the basic properties of MBSs before proceeding to describe more experimentally relevant platforms. Here, our focus lies on simple "minimal" models where the Majorana wave functions can be obtained explicitly by standard methods. In the first part, we review the paradigmatic model of a Rashba nanowire with strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) placed in a magnetic field and proximitized by a conventional s-wave superconductor. We identify the topological phase transition separating the trivial phase from the topological phase and demonstrate how the explicit Majorana wave functions can be obtained in the limit of strong SOI. In the second part, we discuss MBSs engineered from proximitized edge states of two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators. We introduce the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism leading to the emergence of bound states at mass domain walls and show how this mechanism can be exploited to construct MBSs. Due to their recent interest, we also include a discussion of Majorana corner states in 2D second-order topological superconductors. This Tutorial is mainly aimed at graduate students-both theorists and experimentalists-seeking to familiarize themselves with some of the basic concepts in the field.

TI A roadmap for universal high-mass matter-wave interferometry
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Creating quantum superposition states of bodies with increasing mass and complexity is an exciting and important challenge. Demonstrating such superpositions is vital for understanding how classical observations arise from the underlying quantum physics. Here, we discuss how recent progress in macromolecule interferometry can be combined with the state of the art in cluster physics to push the mass record for matter-wave interference with wide state separation by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. We show how near-field interferometers in different configurations can achieve this goal for a wide range of particle materials with strongly varying properties. This universality will become important in advanced tests of wave function collapse and of other modifications of quantum mechanics, as well as in the search for light dark matter and in tests of gravity with composite quantum systems.

AB We present the fabrication of strain-free quantum dots in the In0.53Ga0.47As/In0.52Al0.48As-system lattice matched to InP, as future sources for single and entangled photons for long-haul fiber-based quantum communication in the optical C-band. We achieved these quantum dots by local droplet etching via InAl droplets in an In0.52Al0.48As layer and subsequent filling of the holes with In0.53Ga0.47As. Here, we present detailed investigations of the hole morphologies measured by atomic force microscopy. Statistical analysis of a set of nanoholes reveals a high degree of symmetry for nearly half of them when etched at optimized temperatures. Overgrowth with 50-150 nm In0.52Al0.48As increases their diameter and elongates the holes along the [011]-direction. By systematically scanning the parameter space, we were able to fill the holes with In0.53Ga0.47As, and by capping the filled holes and performing photoluminescence measurements, we observe photoluminescence emission in the O-band up into the C-band depending on the filling height of the nanoholes.

AB In order to broaden the adoption of highly demanded quantum functionalities such as QKD, there is a need for having quantum signals coexist with classical traffic over the same physical medium, typically optical fibers in already-deployed networks. Beyond the experimental point-to-point demonstrations of the past few years, efforts are now underway to integrate QKD at the network level: developing interfaces with the software-defined-network ecosystem; but also network planning tools that satisfy physical-layer contraints jointly on the classical and quantum signals. We have found that in certain situations, naive network planning prioritizing quantum traffic drastically degrades classical capacity, whereas a quantum-aware wavelength assignment heuristic allows coexistence with minimal impact on both capacities. More such techniques will be required to enable widespread deployment of QKD and other future quantum functionalities.

TI Optical identification using physical unclonable functions
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB In this work, the concept of optical identification (OI) based on physical unclonable functions is introduced for the first time, to our knowledge, in optical communication systems and networks. The OI assigns an optical fingerprint and the corresponding digital representation to each sub-system of the network and estimates its reliability in different measures. We highlight the large potential applications of OI as a physical layer approach for security, identification, authentication, and monitoring purposes. To identify most of the sub-systems of a network, we propose to use the Rayleigh backscattering pattern, which is an optical physical unclonable function and allows OI to be achieved with a simple procedure and without additional devices. The applications of OI to fiber and path identification in a network and to the authentication of users in a quantum key distribution system are described.

TI Hide and seek with quantum resources: new and modified protocols for
   quantum steganography
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Steganography is the science of hiding and communicating a secret message by embedding it in an innocent looking text such that the eavesdropper is unaware of its existence. Previously, attempts were made to establish steganography using quantum key distribution (QKD). Recently, it has been shown that such protocols are vulnerable to a certain steganalysis attack that can detect the presence of the hidden message and suppress the entire communication. In this work, we elaborate on the vulnerabilities of the original protocol which make it insecure against this detection attack. Further, we propose a novel steganography protocol using discrete modulation continuous variable QKD that eliminates the threat of this detection-based attack. Deriving from the properties of our protocol, we also propose modifications to the original protocol to dispose of its vulnerabilities and make it insusceptible to steganalysis.

TI Gated InGaAs detector characterization with sub-picosecond weak coherent
   pulses
SO OPTIK
AB We demonstrate a method to characterize a gated InGaAs single-photon detector (SPD). Ultrashort weak coherent pulses, from a mode-locked sub-picosecond pulsed laser, were used to measure photon counts, at varying arrival times relative to the start of the SPD gate voltage. The difference of detection probabilities for two gate windows with different widths, and the uneven detection probabilities within a gate window, were used to estimate the afterpulse probability with respect to the detector parameters: excess bias, width of gate window and hold-off time. We estimated an afterpulse decay time of 1.1 to 2.4 mu s using a power-law fit to the decay in afterpulse probability. Finally, we measure the timing jitter of the SPD, as 240 ps, using a time to digital converter with a resolution of 55 ps.

TI Protocols for classically training quantum generative models on
   probability distributions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum generative modeling (QGM) relies on preparing quantum states and generating samples from these states as hidden-or known-probability distributions. As distributions from some classes of quantum states (circuits) are inherently hard to sample classically, QGM represents an excellent test bed for quantum supremacy experiments. Furthermore, generative tasks are increasingly relevant for industrial machine learning applications, and thus QGM is a strong candidate for demonstrating a practical quantum advantage. However, this requires that quantum circuits are trained to represent industrially relevant distributions, and the corresponding training stage has an extensive training cost for current quantum hardware in practice. In this work, we propose protocols for classical training of QGMs based on circuits of the specific type that admit an efficient gradient computation, while remaining hard to sample. In particular, we consider instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits and their extensions. Showing their classical simulability in terms of the time complexity, sparsity, and anticoncentration properties, we develop a classically tractable way of simulating their output probabil-ity distributions, allowing classical training to a target probability distribution. The corresponding quantum sampling from IQPs can be performed efficiently, unlike when using classical sampling. We numerically demonstrate the end-to-end training of IQP circuits using probability distributions for up to 30 qubits on a regular desktop computer. When applied to industrially relevant distributions this combination of classical training with quantum sampling represents an avenue for reaching advantage in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

TI Engineering the microwave to infrared noise photon flux for
   superconducting quantum systems
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Electromagnetic filtering is essential for the coherent control, operation and readout of superconducting quantum circuits at milliKelvin temperatures. The suppression of spurious modes around transition frequencies of a few GHz is well understood and mainly achieved by on-chip and package considerations. Noise photons of higher frequencies - beyond the pair-breaking energies - cause decoherence and require spectral engineering before reaching the packaged quantum chip. The external wires that pass into the refrigerator and go down to the quantum circuit provide a direct path for these photons. This article contains quantitative analysis and experimental data for the noise photon flux through coaxial, filtered wiring. The attenuation of the coaxial cable at room temperature and the noise photon flux estimates for typical wiring configurations are provided. Compact cryogenic microwave low-pass filters with CR-110 and Esorb-230 absorptive dielectric fillings are presented along with experimental data at room and cryogenic temperatures up to 70 GHz. Filter cut-off frequencies between 1 to 10 GHz are set by the filter length, and the roll-off is material dependent. The relative dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability for the Esorb-230 material in the pair-breaking frequency range of 75 to 110 GHz are measured, and the filter properties in this frequency range are calculated. The estimated dramatic suppression of the noise photon flux due to the filter proves its usefulness for experiments with superconducting quantum systems.

TI Correlation-corrected band topology and topological surface states in
   iron-based superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Iron-based superconductors offer an ideal platform for studying topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study of the band topology and topological surface states of a number of iron-based superconductors using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory. We find that the strong electronic correlation of Fe 3d electrons plays a crucial role in determining the band topology and topological surface states of iron-based superconductors. Electronic correlation not only strongly renormalizes the bandwidth of Fe 3d electrons, but also shifts the band positions of both Fe 3d and As/Se p electrons. As a result, electronic correlation moves the DFT-calculated topological surface states of many iron-based superconductors much closer to the Fermi level, which is crucial for realizing topological superconducting surface states and observing Majorana zero modes as well as achieving practical applications, such as quantum computation. More importantly, electronic correlation can change the band topology and make some iron-based superconductors topologically nontrivial with topological surface states whereas they have trivial band topology and no topological surface states in DFT calculations. Our paper demonstrates that it is important to take into account electronic correlation effects in order to accurately determine the band topology and topological surface states of iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated materials.

TI Better Heisenberg Limits, Coherence Bounds, and Energy-Time Tradeoffs
   via Quantum Renyi Information
SO ENTROPY
AB An uncertainty relation for the Renyi entropies of conjugate quantum observables is used to obtain a strong Heisenberg limit of the form RMSE >= f(alpha)/(< N > + 1/2), bounding the root mean square error of any estimate of a random optical phase shift in terms of average photon number, where f(alpha) is maximised for non-Shannon entropies. Related simple yet strong uncertainty relations linking phase uncertainty to the photon number distribution, such as Delta Phi >= max(n) p(n), are also obtained. These results are significantly strengthened via upper and lower bounds on the Renyi mutual information of quantum communication channels, related to asymmetry and convolution, and applied to the estimation (with prior information) of unitary shift parameters such as rotation angle and time, and to obtain strong bounds on measures of coherence. Sharper Renyi entropic uncertainty relations are also obtained, including time-energy uncertainty relations for Hamiltonians with discrete spectra. In the latter case almost-periodic Renyi entropies are introduced for nonperiodic systems.

TI Nonprojective Bell-state measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Bell-state measurement (BSM) is the projection of two qubits onto four orthogonal maximally entangled states. Here we first propose how to appropriately define more general BSMs, which have more than four possible outcomes, and then study whether they exist in quantum theory. We observe that nonprojective BSMs can be defined in a systematic way in terms of equiangular tight frames of maximally entangled states, i.e., a set of maximally entangled states, where every pair is equally, and in a sense maximally, distinguishable. We show that there exists a five-outcome BSM through an explicit construction and find that it admits a simple geometric representation. Then we prove that there exists no larger BSM on two qubits by showing that no six-outcome BSM is possible. We also determine the most distinguishable set of six equiangular maximally entangled states and show that it falls only somewhat short of forming a valid quantum measurement. Finally, we study the nonprojective BSM in the contexts of both local state discrimination and entanglement-assisted quantum communication. Our results put forward natural forms of nonprojective joint measurements and provide insight into the geometry of entangled quantum states.

TI Combining Quantum Dots and Photochromic Molecular Switches:
   Next-Generation Light-Responsive Materials
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Quantum dots (QDs), with the unique merits of narrow and tunable photoluminescence (PL) wavelength, high PL quantum yield, have gained significant interest in fields such as display, solar energy conversion, bioimaging, and encrypted quantum communication. On the other hand, photochromic molecular switches (PMS) can undergo reversible interconversion between (at least) two distinct states at the molecular scale upon light irradiation. When combining QDs and PMS, the resulting hybrid systems exhibit synergistic functionalities and light responsiveness, enabling precise and reversible modulation over PL intensity/color, energy/electron transfer, and motion with high temporal and spatial resolution in a non-invasive manner. This perspective explores the recent advancements in the combination method, light-responsive mechanism, and functions of QD-PMS hybrids. The applications of QD-PMS hybrids are also highlighted as light-responsive materials in bioimaging, information processing, sensing, optoelectrical devices, and discuss future challenges, opportunities, and directions for enhancing performance and exploring applications in next-generation light-responsive materials and smart optoelectronic devices.

TI Multi-Wavelength Polarizer Based on Metal Grating-Assisted
   Microstructured Fiber
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Multi-wavelength polarizers have many essential applications in optics, quantum communication, Q switch and relating research fields. However, polarizing waveband of the traditional polarizer is restricted in the structure of fibers, which results in finite polarizing wavelengths. In this work, a novel D-shaped microstructure fiber polarizer (DMFP) with metal grating was proposed. Utilizing the abundant harmonic vector characteristics on the surface of metal grating, the DMFP can realize the function of multi-band polarization filtering. Numerical results show that it can achieve three bands of polarization filtering in x-polarized mode from 350 nm to 1600 nm and the resonance wavelengths are periodically modulated by grating. In the meanwhile, by optimizing grating parameters, the number of bands of polarization filtering can be further increased, thus, it fulfills the effective adjustment of polarization filtering. It is promising that metal grating based DMFP has great potential values in the fields of optical filter, communication, and functional devices, etc.

We studied the influence of DC bias voltage and AC gate amplitude on the SPD's functional parameters and presented a simple and effective algorithm for its optimization. Such optimization showed practical benefits while SPD was set up on the QKD device. We admitted that the dark count rate decreases with an increase in gating voltage with fixed photon detection efficiency. We observed the charge persistence effect in sine-gated SPDs, which previously had been observed only at square-pulses gated SPDs, and showed that this effect is limiting for infinity increasing gate amplitude.

TI Quantum No-signalling Correlations and Non-local Games
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We introduce and examine three subclasses of the family of quantum no-signalling (QNS) correlations introduced by Duan and Winter: quantum commuting, quantum and local. We formalise the notion of a universal TRO of a block operator isometry, define an operator system, universal for stochastic operator matrices, and realise it as a quotient of a matrix algebra. We describe the classes of QNS correlations in terms of states on the tensor products of two copies of the universal operator system and specialise the correlation classes and their representations to classical-to-quantum correlations. We study various quantum versions of synchronous no-signalling correlations and show that they possess invariance properties for suitable sets of states. We introduce quantum non-local games as a generalisation of non-local games. We define the operation of quantum game composition and show that the perfect strategies belonging to a certain class are closed under channel composition. We specialise to the case of graph colourings, where we exhibit quantum versions of the orthogonal rank of a graph as the optimal output dimension for which perfect classical-to-quantum strategies of the graph colouring game exist, as well as to non-commutative graph homomorphisms, where we identify quantum versions of non-commutative graph homomorphisms introduced by Stahlke.

TI Decorrelated singlet and triplet exciton delocalization in
   acetylene-bridged Zn-porphyrin dimers
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The controlled delocalization of molecular excitons remains an important goal towards the application of organic chromophores in processes ranging from light-initiated chemical transformations to classical and quantum information processing. In this study, we present a methodology to couple optical and magnetic spectroscopic techniques and assess the delocalization of singlet and triplet excitons in model molecular chromophores. By comparing the steady-state and time-resolved optical spectra of Zn-porphyrin monomers and weakly coupled dimers, we show that we can use the identity of substituents bound at specific positions of the macromolecules' rings to control the inter-ring delocalization of singlet excitons stemming from their B states through acetylene bridges. While broadened steady-state absorption spectra suggest the presence of delocalized B state excitons in mesityl-substituted Zn-tetraphenyl porphyrin dimers (Zn2U-D), we confirm this conclusion by measuring an enhanced ultrafast non-radiative relaxation from these inter-ring excitonic states to lower lying electronic states relative to their monomer. In contrast to the delocalized nature of singlet excitons, we use time-resolved EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies to show that the triplet states of the Zn-porphyrin dimers remain localized on one of the two macrocyclic sub-units. We use the analysis of EPR and ENDOR measurements on unmetallated model porphyrin monomers and dimers to support this conclusion. The results of DFT calculations also support the interpretation of localized triplet states. These results demonstrate researchers cannot conclude triplet excitons delocalize in macromolecular based on the presence of spatially extended singlet excitons, which can help in the design of chromophores for application in spin conversion and information processing technologies.
   The controlled delocalization of molecular excitons remains an important goal towards the application of organic chromophores in processes ranging from light-initiated chemical transformations to classical and quantum information processing.

TI Metastructure-enabled scalable multiple mode-order converters:
   conceptual design and demonstration in direct-access add/drop
   multiplexing systems
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The rapid advancement of multimode photonic technologies, optical computing, and quantum circuits, leveraging higher-order modes, necessitates the development of on-chip multiple mode-order converters (MMOCs). However, existing schemes face limitations in traffic capacity, polarization-dependence, and scalability. Herein, we propose a novel highly scalable MMOC design framework enabled by subwavelength grating (SWG) metastructures. By integrating SWG arrays into a taper-tailored multimode waveguide, the design synergizes coherent scattering and beam shaping to achieve efficient target-supermode excitations and precise phase controls, simultaneously. In this way, the target MMOC can be realized according to the functional requirements of mode manipulations by optimizing the metastructures. Experimentally fabricated devices exhibit ILs < 1.85 dB and CTs < -12.5 dB across (22 or 50) nm bandwidths, with a polarization-independent quad-mode operation. Notably, the dual-pair mode exchanging MMOC pioneers simultaneous TE0 <-> TE2 and TE1 <-> TE3, doubling exchange efficiency over conventional single-pair solutions. Integrated into a direct-access mode add/drop system (DAMAD), TE0/TE1 dual-mode add/drop operations achieve ILs < 4.5 dB and CTs < -15.5 dB across 41 nm bandwidth. Thereupon, clear eye diagrams at 32/64 Gbps operations demonstrate the capability for the high-speed optical communication. The proposed concept offers a novel strategy for on-chip multiple mode manipulations, with transformative potential in higher-order modes based optical communications.

TI Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic nonintegrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U(1) and dipole conservation at late times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization-group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry-breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.

TI Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Exactly solvable models in quantum many-body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena and serve as platforms for rigorously investigating fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper, we present a family of exactly solvable unitary circuits that model quantum many-body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of R & eacute;nyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time-evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with a finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long times, which we prove using the underlying C & lowast;-(weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a C & lowast;-weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a Floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars, and more generally, Floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.

TI High-rate 16-node quantum access network based on a passive optical
   network
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution offers information-theoretic security and is advancing toward real-world quantum secure networks. To meet the growing demand for scalable solutions, we present a high-rate quantum access network (QAN) with 16 user nodes based on a passive optical network, where a highly efficient coherent-state point-to-multipoint (PTMP) protocol is designed for concurrent independent secret key generation between one transmitter and multiple receivers. Such accomplishment is attributed to a subtle shot-noise calibration method, advanced digital signal processing algorithms, and a flexible post-processing strategy. Finally, the experimentally estimated average secret key rate is approximately 2.086 Mbps between the transmitter and each user, two orders of magnitude higher than previous demonstrations. With low cost, excellent compatibility, and wide bandwidth, our work paves the way for practical PTMP QANs, representing a key step toward scalable quantum secure networks.

TI Encryption as a Service for IoT: Opportunities, Challenges, and
   Solutions
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has introduced new cybersecurity challenges. Encryption services are being offloaded to cloud and fog platforms to mitigate these risks. Encryption as a Service (EaaS) emerges as a remedy, offering cryptographic solutions tailored to the resource constraints of IoT devices. This study thoroughly examines existing EaaS platforms, categorizing them based on encryption algorithms and service offerings. Additionally, we outline various EaaS architecture types depending on the placement of key components. Practical implementations of these platforms are explored through different testbeds. A key focus lies in dissecting the challenges that EaaS faces, particularly in the context of IoT, while suggesting potential remedies. This work stands out as an all-encompassing exploration, bridging the gap left by previous surveys.

TI Linear and Non-linear Relational Analyses for Quantum Program
   Optimization
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB The phase folding optimization is a circuit optimization used in many quantum compilers as a fast and effective way of reducing the number of high-cost gates in a quantum circuit. However, existing formulations of the optimization rely on an exact, linear algebraic representation of the circuit, restricting the optimization to being performed on straightline quantum circuits or basic blocks in a larger quantum program. We show that the phase folding optimization can be re-cast as an affine relation analysis, which allows the direct application of classical techniques for affine relations to extend phase folding to quantum programs with arbitrarily complicated classical control flow including nested loops and procedure calls. Through the lens of relational analysis, we show that the optimization can be powered-up by substituting other classical relational domains, particularly ones for non-linear relations which are useful in analyzing circuits involving classical arithmetic. To increase the precision of our analysis and infer non-linear relations from gate sets involving only linear operations - such as Clifford+T - we show that the sum-over-paths technique can be used to extract precise symbolic transition relations for straightline circuits. Our experiments show that our methods are able to generate and use non-trivial loop invariants for quantum program optimization, as well as achieve some optimizations of common circuits which were previously attainable only by hand.

TI Characterization of Microwave Loss Using Multimode Superconducting
   Resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Measuring the losses arising from different materials and interfaces is crucial to improving the coherence of superconducting quantum circuits. Although this has been of interest for a long time, current studies can either only provide bounds to those losses, or require several devices for a complete characterization. In this work, we introduce a method to measure the microwave losses of materials and interfaces with a single multimode superconducting resonator. We demonstrate a formalism for analyzing the loss sensitivity of multimode systems and discuss the design strategies of multimode resonators for material loss studies. We present two types of multimode superconducting resonators for the study of bulk superconductors: the forky whispering-gallery-mode resonator and the ellipsoidal cavity. We use these resonators to measure the surface dielectric, conductor, and seam losses of high-purity (5N5) aluminum and aluminum alloy (6061), as well as how they are affected by chemical etching, diamond turning, and thin-film coating. We find that chemical etching and diamond turning reduce both the surface dielectric and conductive losses of high-purity aluminum, but provide no appreciable improvement to the seam. Coating the surfaces of diamond-turned aluminum alloys with electron-beam-evaporated or sputtered aluminum thin films significantly reduces all three losses under study. In addition, we study the effect of chemical etching on the surface of high-purity aluminum using transmission electron microscopy and find that the chemical etching process creates a thinner and more uniform oxide layer, consistent with the observed improvement in the surface dielectric loss.

TI Quantum digital signature with unidimensional continuous-variable
   against the measurement angular error
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The continuous-variable quantum digital signature (CV-QDS) scheme relies on the components of quantum key generation protocol (KGP) to negotiate classical signature, which is more compatible with optical fibers. Nevertheless, the measurement angular error of heterodyne detection or homodyne detection will cause security issues when performing KGP in the distribution stage. For that, we propose to utilize unidimensional modulation in KGP components, which only requires to modulate single quadrature and without the process of basis choice. Numerical simulation results show that the security under collective attack, repudiation attack and forgery attack can be guaranteed. We expect that the unidimensional modulation of KGP components could further simplify the implementation of CV-QDS and circumvent the security issues caused by the measurement angular error.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Coherent dynamics of a nuclear-spin-isomer superposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Preserving quantum coherence with the increase of a system's size and complexity is a major challenge. Molecules, with their diverse sizes and complexities and many degrees of freedom, are an excellent platform for studying the transition from quantum to classical behavior. While most quantum-control studies of molecules focus on vibrations and rotations, we focus here on creating a quantum superposition between two nuclear-spin isomers of the same molecule. We present a scheme that exploits an avoided crossing in the spectrum to create strong coupling between two uncoupled nuclear-spin-isomer states, hence creating an isomeric qubit. We model our scheme using a four-level Hamiltonian and explore the coherent dynamics in the different regimes and parameters of our system. Our four-level model and approach can be applied to other systems with a similar energy-level structure.

TI A pulsar in a binary with a compact object in the mass gap between
   neutron stars and black holes
SO SCIENCE
AB Some compact objects observed in gravitational wave events have masses in the gap between known neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). The nature of these mass gap objects is unknown, as is the formation of their host binary systems. We report pulsar timing observations made with the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT) of PSR J0514-4002E, an eccentric binary millisecond pulsar in the globular cluster NGC 1851. We found a total binary mass of 3.887 +/- 0.004 solar masses (M-circle dot), and multiwavelength observations show that the pulsar's binary companion is also a compact object. The companion's mass (2.09 to 2.71 M-circle dot, 95% confidence interval) is in the mass gap, indicating either a very massive NS or a low-mass BH. We propose that the companion formed in a merger between two earlier NSs.

TI Dynamical simulation of the injection of vortices into a Majorana edge
   mode
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The chiral edge modes of a topological superconductor can transport fermionic quasiparticles with Abelian exchange statistics, but they can also transport non-Abelian anyons: edge vortices bound to a pi-phase domain wall that propagates along the boundary. A pair of such edge vortices is injected by the application of an h/2e flux bias over a Josephson junction. Existing descriptions of the injection process rely on the instantaneous scattering approximation of the adiabatic regime [Beenakker et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 146803 (2019)], where the internal dynamics of the Josephson junction is ignored. Here, we go beyond that approximation in a time-dependent many-body simulation of the injection process, followed by a braiding of mobile edge vortices with a pair of immobile Abrikosov vortices in the bulk of the superconductor. Our simulation sheds light on the properties of the Josephson junction needed for a successful implementation of a flying topological qubit.

TI Certain exact many-body results for Hubbard model ground states testable
   in small quantum dot arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present several interesting phenomena related to flat-band ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model. The first is a mathematical theorem stating certain conditions under which a flat-band ferromagnetic must necessarily be degenerate with a nonferromagnetic state. This theorem is generally applicable and geometry independent but holds only for a small number of holes in an otherwise filled band. The second phenomenon is a peculiar example where the intuition fails that particles prefer to doubly occupy low-energy states before filling higher-energy states. Lastly, we show a pattern of ferromagnetism which appears in small pentagonal and hexagonal plaquettes at filling factors of roughly 3/10 and 1/4. These examples require only a small number of lattice sites and may be observable in quantum dot arrays currently available as laboratory spin qubit arrays.

TI Quantumness and its hierarchies in PT-symmetric down-conversion models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the hierarchy of quantum correlations in a quadratic bosonic parity-time-symmetric system (PTSS) featuring distinct dissipation and amplification channels. The hierarchy includes global nonclassicality, entanglement, asymmetric quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. We elucidate the interplay between the system physical nonlinearity (which serves as a source of quantumness) and the specific dynamics of bosonic PTSSs, which are qualitatively influenced by their damping and amplification characteristics. Using a set of quantifiers (including local and global nonclassicality depths, negativity, steering parameters, and the Bell parameter) we demonstrate that the standard PTSS typically exhibits weaker quantumness than its counterparts affected solely by damping or solely by amplification. Both the maximum values attained by these quantifiers and the speed and duration of their generation are generally lower in the standard PTSS. A comparative analysis of three two-mode PTSSs (standard, passive, and active) with identical eigenvectors and real parts of eigenfrequencies, but differing in their damping and amplification strengths, reveals the crucial role of quantum fluctuations associated with gain and loss. Among them, the passive PTSS yields the most strongly nonclassical states. Nevertheless, under suitable conditions, the standard PTSS can also generate highly nonclassical states. The supremacy of the passive PTSS is further supported by its fundamental advantages in practical realizations.

TI Experimental Implementation of the Optical Fractional Fourier Transform
   in the Time-Frequency Domain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), a fundamental operation in physics that corresponds to a rotation of phase space by any angle, is also an indispensable tool employed in digital signal processing for noise reduction. Processing of optical signals in their time-frequency degree of freedom bypasses the digitization step and presents an opportunity to enhance many protocols in quantum and classical communication, sensing, and computing. In this Letter, we present the experimental realization of the fractional Fourier transform in the time-frequency domain using an atomic quantum-optical memory system with processing capabilities. Our scheme performs the operation by imposing programmable interleaved spectral and temporal phases. We have verified the FrFT by analyses of chroncyclic Wigner functions measured via a shot-noise limited homodyne detector. Our results hold prospects for achieving temporal-mode sorting, processing, and superresolved parameter estimation.

TI Efficient InGaAsP MQW-based polarization controller without
   active-passive integration
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Carrier-injection-based efficient polarization controller with a strained InGaAsP multiple-quantum-well (MQW) layer is demonstrated on a regrowth-free InP platform. We employ a straight-line device configuration by cascading an asymmetric polarization rotator (PR) to provide a fixed polarization conversion and a polarization-dependent phase shifter (PD-PS) to enable tunable polarization rotation. Based on a novel design concept, both the PR and PD-PS sections are integrated monolithically without active-passive integration. Using the fabricated device, we experimentally demonstrate efficient polarization conversion over the entire Poincare sphere with a total current of less than 40 mA. With the capability of monolithically integrating other InP-based active components, the demonstrated scheme should be attractive for various applications, such-as low-cost coherent communication, microwave photonics, and quantum key distribution.

TI Ultrabright, two-color photon pair source basedon thin-film lithium
   niobate for bridging visibleand telecom wavelengths
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB bstract:We present the design and characterization of a guided-wave, bright, and highlyfrequency non-degenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) source in thin-film lithium niobate.The source generates photon pairs with wavelengths of 815 nm and 1550 nm, linking the visiblewavelength regime with telecommunication wavelengths. We confirm the high quality of thegenerated single photons by determining a value for the heralded second-order correlationfunction as low asg(2)h(0)=(6.7 +/- 1.1)<middle dot>10-3. Furthermore, we achieve a high spectral brightnessof 0.44<middle dot>107pairss<middle dot>mW<middle dot>GHzwhich is two orders of magnitude higher than sources based on weaklyguiding waveguides. The shape of the PDC spectrum and the strong agreement between theeffective and nominal bandwidth highlight our high fabrication quality of periodically poledwaveguides. The good agreement between the measured and simulated spectral characteristicsof our source demonstrates our excellent understanding of the PDC process. Our result is avaluable step towards practical and scalable quantum communication networks as well as photonicquantum computing.

TI Integral formula for quantum relative entropy implies data processing
   inequality
SO QUANTUM
AB Integral representations of quantum relative entropy, and of the directional second and higher order derivatives of von Neumann entropy, are established, and used to give simple proofs of fundamental, known data processing inequalities: the Holevo bound on the quantity of information transmitted by a quantum communication channel, and, much more generally, the monotonicity of quantum relative entropy under trace-preserving positive linear maps - complete positivity of the map need not be assumed. The latter result was first proved by Muller-Hermes and Reeb, based on work of Beigi.For a simple application of such monotonicities, we consider any 'divergence' that is non-increasing under quantum measurements, such as the concavity of von Neumann entropy, or various known quantum divergences. An elegant argument due to Hiai, Ohya, and Tsukada is used to show that the infimum of such a 'divergence' on pairs of quantum states with prescribed trace distance is the same as the corresponding infimum on pairs of binary classical states.Applications of the new integral formulae to the general probabilistic model of information theory, and a related integral formula for the classical Renyi divergence, are also discussed.

TI Hiding images in noise
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A limitation of free-space optical communications is the ease with which the information can be intercepted. This limitation can be overcome by hiding the information within background optical noise. We demonstrate the transfer of images over free-space using a photon-pair source emitting two correlated beams. One of these beams contains image information, to which noise is added, and the other correlated beam is used as a heralding trigger so that the intended recipient can differentiate this image signal from the background noise. The system uses spontaneous parametric down-conversion to create photon-pairs with a wide spectral bandwidth and a gated intensified camera to extract the image from the background noise. The high-dimensionality of the image space means that the information content can be many bits per detected photon, whereas the heralding photon can be restricted to a single spatial-mode within a secure fiber which itself could be protected against interception by traditional low-dimensionality quantum key protocols.

TI Entanglement negativity on random spin networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate multipartite entanglement for quantum states of 3D space geometry, described via generalized random spin networks with fixed areas, in the context of background independent approaches to quantum gravity. We focus on entanglement negativity as a well defined witness of quantum correlations for mixed states, in our setting describing generic subregions of the boundary of a quantum 3D region of space. In particular, we consider a generic tripartition of the boundary of an open spin network state and we compute the typical Re ' nyi negativity of two boundary subregions A and B immersed in the environment C, explicitly for a set of simple open random spin network states. We use the random character of the spin network to exploit replica and random average techniques to derive the typical Re ' nyi negativty via a classical generalized Ising model correspondence generally used for random tensor networks in the large bond regime. For trivially correlated random spin network states, with only local entanglement between spins located on the network edges, we find that typical log negativity displays a holographic character, in agreement with the results for random tensor networks, in large spin limit. When nonlocal bulk entanglement between intertwiners at the vertices is considered the negativity increases, while at the same time the holographic scaling is generally perturbed by the bulk contribution.

TI Pancharatnam's connection and geometric phase of partially polarized
   light
SO OPTICA
AB We extend the concepts of Pancharatnam's connection and phase difference of optical beams to cover random, stationary, partially polarized quasimonochromatic light. The geometric and dynamic structures of the phase are assessed within the framework of classical statistical polarization theory when the beam undergoes a cyclic, unitary polarization- state evolution. The existence of the two phase types is confirmed experimentally by conducting an interferometric measurement where the phase changes are found from the variations in the position of an intensity fringe pattern. The formalism also leads to a definition of the geometric phase for partially polarized beams, which is consistent with the results on mixed (qubit) quantum states.

TI Consequences of minimal entanglement in bosonic field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this paper, we study a recently discovered connection between scattering that minimally entangles and emergent symmetries. In a perturbative expansion, we have generalized the constraints of minimal entanglement scattering, beyond qubits, to general qudits of dimension d. Interestingly, projecting on any qubit subspaces, the constraints factorize, so that it is consistent to analyze minimal entanglement by looking at all such subspaces. We start by looking at toy models with two scalar fields, finding that minimal entanglement only allows quartic couplings which have instabilities at large field values and no symmetries. For the two Higgs doublet model, by considering H+H--* H+H- scattering, we show that minimal entanglement in this channel does not allow an interacting parameter point with enhanced symmetries. These results show that the connection between minimal entanglement and symmetries depends strongly on the scattering channels analyzed and we speculate on the potential resolutions.

TI Collisional thermometry for Gaussian systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate a quantum thermometry scheme-based collision model with Gaussian systems. A key open question of these schemes concerns the scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with the number of ancillas. In qubit-based implementations this question is difficult to assess, due to the exponentially growing size of the Hilbert space. Here we focus on Gaussian collision models, which allow for the scaling of the QFI to be evaluated for arbitrarily large sizes. This numerical flexibility enables us to explore the thermometric properties of the model for a wide range of configurations. Despite the infinite Markov order of the stochastic process of the model, we provide a simple phenomenological analysis for the behavior of the QFI, estimating the asymptotic Fisher information density and how the transient effects of correlations for an increasing number of ancillas depend on the physical parameters of the model.

TI Quantifying spatiotemporal patterns in classical and quantum systems out
   of equilibrium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB A rich variety of nonequilibrium dynamical phenomena and processes unambiguously calls for the development of general numerical techniques to probe and estimate a complex interplay between spatial and temporal degrees of freedom in many -body systems of completely different nature. In this work we provide a solution to this problem by adopting a structural complexity measure to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in the time -dependent digital representation of a system. On the basis of very limited amount of data our approach allows us to distinguish different dynamical regimes and define critical parameters in both classical and quantum systems. By the example of the discrete time crystal realized in nonequilibrium quantum systems we provide a complete low-level characterization of this nontrivial dynamical phase with only processing bitstrings, which can be considered as a valuable alternative to previous studies based on the calculations of qubit correlation functions.

TI Robust Quantum Optimal Control with Trajectory Optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ability to engineer high-fidelity gates on quantum processors in the presence of systematic errors remains the primary barrier to achieving quantum advantage. Quantum optimal control methods have proven effective in experimentally realizing high-fidelity gates, but they require exquisite calibration to be performant. We apply robust trajectory optimization techniques to suppress gate errors arising from system parameter uncertainty. We propose a derivative-based approach that maintains computational efficiency by using forward-mode differentiation. Additionally, the effect of depolarization on a gate is typically modeled by integrating the Lindblad master equation, which is computationally expensive. We employ a computationally efficient model and utilize time-optimal control to achieve high-fidelity gates in the presence of depolarization. We apply these techniques to a fluxonium qubit and suppress simulated gate errors due to parameter uncertainty below 10-7 for static parameter deviations of the order of 1%.

SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Approximating a quantum state by the convex mixing of some given states has strong experimental significance and provides alternative understandings of quantum resource theory. It is essentially a complex optimal problem which, up to now, has only partially solved for qubit states. Here, the most general case is focused on that the approximation of a d-dimensional objective quantum state by the given state set consisting of any number of (mixed-) states. The problem is thoroughly solved with a closed solution of the minimal distance in the sense of l(2) norm between the objective state and the set. In particular, the minimal number of states in the given set is presented to achieve the optimal distance. The validity of this closed solution is further verified numerically by several randomly generated quantum states.

TI Direct formation of nitrogen-vacancy centers in nitrogen doped diamond

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report depth-resolved photoluminescence measurements of nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers formed along the tracks of swift heavy ions (SHIs) in type Ib synthetic single crystal diamonds that had been doped with 100ppm nitrogen during crystal growth. Analysis of the spectra shows that NV- centers are formed preferentially within regions where electronic stopping processes dominate and not at the end of the ion range where elastic collisions lead to the formation of vacancies and defects. Thermal annealing further increases NV yields after irradiation with SHIs preferentially in regions with high vacancy densities. NV centers formed along the tracks of single swift heavy ions can be isolated with lift-out techniques for explorations of color center qubits in quasi-1D registers with an average qubit spacing of a few nanometers and of order 100 color centers per micrometer along 10 to 30-mu m-long percolation chains.

TI Time-like Extra Dimensions: Quantum Nonlocality, Spin, and Tsirelson
   Bound
SO UNIVERSE
AB The E8 circle times E8 octonionic theory of unification suggests that our universe is six-dimensional and that the two extra dimensions are time-like. These time-like extra dimensions, in principle, offer an explanation of the quantum nonlocality puzzle, also known as the EPR paradox. Quantum systems access all six dimensions, whereas classical systems such as detectors experience only four dimensions. Therefore, correlated quantum events that are time-like separated in 6D can appear to be space-like separated and, hence, nonlocal, when projected to 4D. Our lack of awareness of the extra time-like dimensions creates the illusion of nonlocality, whereas, in reality, the communication obeys special relativity and is local. Bell inequalities continue to be violated because quantum correlations continue to hold. In principle, this idea can be tested experimentally. We develop our analysis after first constructing the Dirac equation in 6D using quaternions and using the equation to derive spin matrices in 6D and then in 4D. We also show that the Tsirelson bound of the CHSH inequality can in principle be violated in 6D.

TI Review of quantum resource characteristics in three-flavor neutrino
   oscillations
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Studying the quantum resources of neutrino oscillations is a topic worth exploring. This review mainly introduces the use of quantum resource theory to characterize the quantum resource characteristics of three-flavor neutrino oscillations, and the specific evolutionary patterns of different entanglement measures in three-flavor neutrino oscillations. In addition, by comparing the cases of different entanglement evolutions, the optimal method of quantifying entanglement in three-flavor neutrino oscillations can be obtained. Moreover, this review also focuses on the quantifying the quantumness of neutrino oscillation observed experimentally by using the l1-norm of coherence. The maximal coherence is observed in the neutrino source from the KamLAND reactor. Furthermore, we examine the violation of the Mermin inequality and Svetlichny inequality to study the nonlocality in three-flavor neutrino oscillations. It is shown that even though the genuine tripartite nonlocal correlation is usually existent, it can disappear within specific time regions. In addition, this review also presents the trade-off relations in the quantum resource theory of three-flavor neutrino oscillations, mainly based on monogamy relations and complete complementarity relations. It is hoped that this review can bring inspiration to the development of this field.

TI VIBES: Visionary Ingenuity Boosting European Spacecraft. Managing
   microvibrations for the future of spaceflight
SO ARCHIVE OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB Microvibrations are mechanical oscillations caused by components such as the reaction wheels of an attitude control system of a spacecraft. These microvibrations are transferred through the spacecraft structure onto important instruments (e.g., optical instruments), causing those to produce diminished results (e.g., reduced image quality, imprecise geolocation etc.). At the present state, microvibrations in spacecraft cannot be actively controlled because their very high frequencies of up to 1000 Hz are above the control bandwidth a current attitude control system can provide. However, being able to reduce the effects of microvibrations on a space mission is becoming increasingly more critical as the envelope of future optical satellite missions expands. Furthermore, the advancements made in the performance of small satellites as well as the growing interest in laser and quantum communication call for a cost-efficient solution for managing microvibrations. This paper describes how cheap MEMS-based measurement systems have already proven that they are a potential solution. Showing high sensitivity and low-noise performance while allowing fast and easy prototyping.

AB The entanglement improvement is theoretically investigated when applying a single-side quantum scissors (SSQS) with a local squeezing operation and two-asymmetrical beam splitters (BSs) to one mode of an input two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSV). It is found that the gain factor can be significantly enhanced with the increasing of local squeezing parameter at the expense of the success probability. The entanglement can also be further improved adjusting the local-squeezing or the transmissivity of BSs in a small initial squeezing region. In addition, our scheme is robust against the photon loss in TMSV. The improved effect becomes more obvious due to the presence of local squeezing. However, the case is not true for a more realistic SSQS. In both cases, the asymmetric BSs play a positive role for the entanglement improvement. These results suggest that the squeezing-based SSQS at single-photon level is beneficial to effectively improve the entanglement, which may have potential applications in quantum communication.

TI Chiral Light Emission from a Sphere Revealed by Nanoscale Relative-Phase
   Mapping
SO ACS NANO
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) is currently receiving much attention as a key ingredient for next-generation information technologies, such as quantum communication and encryption. CPL photon generation used in those applications is commonly realized by coupling achiral optical quantum emitters to chiral nanoantennas. Here, we explore a different strategy consisting in exciting a nanosphere-the ultimate symmetric structure-to produce CPL emission along an arbitrary direction. Specifically, we demonstrate chiral emission from a silicon nanosphere induced by an electron beam based on two different strategies: either shifting the relative phase of degenerate orthogonal dipole modes or interfering electric and magnetic modes. We prove these concepts both theoretically and experimentally by visualizing the phase and polarization using a fully polarimetric four-dimensional cathodoluminescence method. Besides their fundamental interest, our results support the use of free-electron-induced light emission from spherically symmetric systems as a versatile platform for the generation of chiral light with on-demand control over the phase and degree of polarization.

TI Imaginary spin-orbital coupling in parity-time symmetric systems with
   momentum-dependent gain and loss
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Spin-orbital coupling (SOC) and parity-time (PT) symmetry both have attracted paramount research interest in condensed matter physics, cold atom physics, optics and acoustics to develop spintronics, quantum computation, precise sensors and novel functionalities. Natural SOC is an intrinsic relativistic effect. However, there is an increasing interest in synthesized SOC nowadays. Here, we show that in a PT-symmetric pseudo spin-1/2 system (in other words, two-state system), the momentum-dependent balanced gain and loss can synthesize a new type of SOC, which we call imaginary SOC. The imaginary SOC can substantially change the energy spectrum of the system. Firstly, we show that it can generate a pure real energy spectrum with a double-valleys structure. Therefore, it has the ability to generate supersolid stripe states. Especially, the imaginary SOC stripe state can have a high contrast of one. Moreover, the imaginary SOC can also generate a spectrum with tunable complex energy band, in which the waves are either amplifying or decaying. Thus, the imaginary SOC would also find applications in the engineering of PT-symmetry-based coherent wave amplifiers/absorbers. Potential experimental realizations of imaginary SOC are proposed in cold atomic gases and systems of coupled waveguides constituted of nonlocal gain and loss.

TI Majorana bound states in vortex lattices on iron-based superconductors
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Majorana quasi-particles may arise as zero-energy bound states in vortices on the surface of a topological insulator that is proximitized by a conventional superconductor. Such a system finds its natural realization in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 that combines bulk s-wave pairing with spin helical Dirac surface states, and which thus comprises the ingredients for Majorana modes in absence of an additional proximitizing superconductor. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Majorana vortex modes and lattices in such materials depending on parameters like the magnetic field strength and vortex lattice disorder. A simple 2D square lattice model here allows us to capture the basic physics of the underlying materials system. To address the problem of disordered vortex lattice, which occurs in real systems, we adopt the technique of the singular gauge transformation which we modify such that it can be used in a system with periodic boundary conditions. This approach allows us to go to larger vortex lattices than otherwise accessible, and is successful in replicating several experimental observations of Majorana vortex bound states in the FeTe0.55Se0.45 platform. Finally it can be related to a simple disordered Majorana lattice model that should be useful for further investigations on the role of interactions, and toward topological quantum computation.

TI Generalized binary spiral zone plates with a single focus obtained by
   feedforward neural network
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Traditional spiral zone plates (SZPs) have been widely used to generate optical vortices, but this structure suffers from multiple focuses. To eliminate high-order foci, the current method is to design a binary structure that has a sinusoidal transmittance function along the radial direction. With the rapid development of artificial neural networks, they can provide alternative methods to design novel SZPs with a single focus. In this paper, we first propose the concept of generalized binary spiral zone plates (GBSZPs), and train a feedforward neural network (FNN) to obtain the mapping relationship between the relative intensity of each focus and the structural parameters of GBSZPs. Then the structural parameters of GBSZPs with a single focus were predicted by the trained FNN. It is found by simulations and experiments that the intensities of high-order foci can be as low as 0.2% of the required first order. By analyzing the radial transmittance function, it is found that this structure has a different distribution function from the previous radial sinusoidal function, which reveals that the imperfect radial sinusoidal form also can guide the design of binary zone plates to eliminate high-order foci diffraction. These findings are expected to direct new avenue towards improving the performance of optical image processing and quantum computation.

TI Continuous-time quantum walk based centrality testing on weighted graphs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Centrality measure is an essential tool in network analysis and widely used in the domain of computer science, biology and sociology. Taking advantage of the speedup offered by quantum computation, various quantum centrality measures have been proposed. However, few work of quantum centrality involves weighted graphs, while the weight of edges should be considered in certain real-world networks. In this work, we extend the centrality measure based on continuous-time quantum walk to weighted graphs. We testify the feasibility and reliability of this quantum centrality using an ensemble of 41,675 graphs with various topologies and comparing with the eigenvector centrality measure. The average Vigna's correlation index of all the tested graphs with all edge weights in [1, 10] is as high as 0.967, indicating the pretty good consistency of rankings by the continuous-time quantum walk centrality and the eigenvector centrality. The intuitive consistency of the top-ranked vertices given by this quantum centrality measure and classical centrality measures is also demonstrated on large-scale weighted graphs. Moreover, the range of the continuous-time quantum walk centrality values is much bigger than that of classical centralities, which exhibits better distinguishing ability to pick the important vertices from the ones with less importance. All these results show that the centrality measure based on continuous-time quantum walk still works well on weighted graphs.

TI Reservoir-Engineered Squeezed Lasing through the Parametric Coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report the first experimental demonstration of squeezed lasing in a reservoir-engineered optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO provides a basis of squeezed states and parametric amplification in lasing emission, whose vacuum reservoir is coupled to a squeezed vacuum generated by a second OPO. With a precisely controlled squeezing angle and strong squeezing injection, the parametric interaction in the first OPO is exponentially enhanced. It successfully circumvents the decoherence in the system, and eliminates the undesired noise of spontaneous photon emission in the OPO. As a result, the amplified parametric process simultaneously reserves the coherence and quantum properties in the first OPO, and yields a-6.1 dB squeezed laser in optical domain with a narrow linewidth and high brightness. Our work sheds light on potential applications of squeezed lasing in quantum metrology and quantum optics.

TI Joint Antenna Selection and Power Allocation Method Based on Quantum
   Energy Valley Optimization Algorithm for Massive MIMO IoT Systems
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has emerged as a pivotal technology to address the escalating communication demands of Internet of Things (IoT). To meet the data transmission needs in IoT systems, we propose an antenna selection method of massive MIMO systems and joint power allocation strategy considering IoT user devices grounded in quantum energy valley optimization (QEVO) in this paper. The derivation of a maximum energy efficiency equation has been established to optimize system resources and provide high quality of service meeting the IoT user devices requirements. To tackle the nonlinear, multi- constrained hybrid optimization challenge proposed for massive MIMO resource allocation in IoT systems, we introduce a quantum energy valley optimization algorithm. This algorithm harnesses the strengths of quantum computation and energy valley optimization (EVO) mechanisms. Simulations indicate that our proposed method can efficiently meet real-time user transmission requirements while markedly enhancing system energy efficiency. When compared with existing power allocation strategies and optimization algorithms applied in massive MIMO communication systems, our approach demonstrates superior performance. The proposed method demonstrates the highest performance across various simulation scenarios when applied to both allocation strategies and system energy efficiency. Our proposed method with highest performance can be properly used on massive IoT devices.

TI Experimental and simulation studies on the simultaneous removal of
   methanol and water from dimethyl ether crude gas by choline-based deep
   eutectic solvents
SO FUEL
AB This study examines the viability of utilizing deep eutectic solvents for the separation of methanol and water from crude dimethyl ether. To begin with, the COSMO-SAC model is employed to screen various deep eutectic solvents, The results indicate that deep eutectic solvents formed by choline chloride as the hydrogen bond acceptor and glycerol as the hydrogen bond donor exhibit excellent selectivity. Additionally, the non-ideal nature of the system is initially assessed using the sigma-profile and excess enthalpy. Subsequently, the vapor-liquid equilibrium data for dimethyl ether /methanol/water and deep eutectic solvents are determined through model predictions and saturation vapor pressure experiments. Furthermore, Quantum computation is used to generate the electrostatic potential surfaces and distribution of extremum points of the van der Waals surface of molecules, explaining the interaction sites between molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to analyze the spatial distribution functions and radial distribution functions of multi-molecular systems. Lastly, a process flow for the removal of methanol and water from dimethyl ether is established. Under the optimal operating conditions, the combined concentration of methanol and water in dimethyl ether is successfully reduced to below 50 ppm, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

TI QuantumCumulants.jl: A Julia framework for generalized mean-field
   equations in open quantum systems
SO QUANTUM
AB A full quantum mechanical treatment of open quantum systems via a Master equation is often limited by the size of the underlying Hilbert space. As an alternative, the dynamics can also be formulated in terms of systems of coupled differential equations for operators in the Heisenberg picture. This typically leads to an infinite hierarchy of equations for products of operators. A well-established approach to truncate this infinite set at the level of expectation values is to neglect quantum correlations of high order. This is systematically realized with a so-called cumulant expansion, which decomposes expectation values of operator products into products of a given lower order, leading to a closed set of equations. Here we present an open-source framework that fully automizes this approach: first, the equations of motion of operators up to a desired order are derived symbolically using predefined canonical commutation relations. Next, the resulting equations for the expectation values are expanded employing the cumulant expansion approach, where moments up to a chosen order specified by the user are included. Finally, a numerical solution can be directly obtained from the symbolic equations. After reviewing the theory we present the framework and showcase its usefulness in a few example problems.

TI Enhancement of harvesting vacuum entanglement in Cosmic String Spacetime
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We analyze the entanglement generation in a pair of qubits that experience the vacuum fluctuations of a scalar field in the Cosmic String spacetime. The qubits are modeled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. We introduce a Heisenberg XY -interaction between the qubits that enhances the generation of quantum correlations. It is supposed that the qubits begin at a general mixed state described by a density operator with no entanglement while the field stays at its vacuum state. In this way, we find the general properties and conditions to create entanglement between the qubits by exploiting the field vacuum fluctuations. We quantify the qubits entanglement using the Negativity measure based on the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion. We find that the Cosmic String would increase the entanglement harvesting when both qubits are near the Cosmic String. When the qubits locations are far from the Cosmic String we recover the usual results for Minkowski space. The Heisenberg XY -interaction enhances the entanglement harvesting irrespective of the coupling nature (ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic). When the qubits are far apart from each other we find a maximum entanglement harvesting at the resonance points between the Heisenberg coupling constant and the qubits energy gap.

TI Implementable methods for characterizing single photon avalanche diode
   parameters
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB Single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) is used in quantum detectors. Quantum detectors are widely used in quantum communication. The quality of these detectors strongly affects the optimal performance of the system. The quality of single photon detectors depends on various parameters, which are usually presented in the SPAD specification. If these detectors are made by the manufacturer or evaluated by the user, there is a need for a method to determine and check its main parameters. In this paper, a simple test setup for extracting some of important parameters has been designed and introduced, which can be used practically. These parameters include Dark Count Rate (DCR), Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE), AfterPulse Probability (APP) and Dead time. In the presented design, an FPGA chip is used to measure the parameters. FPGA is responsible for the simultaneous control of the single photon source and the detector. The presented methods specify how to extract the desired parameters. The characterization methods and detailed formulas presented in this paper calculate SPAD parameters.

TI A Multi-Microgrid Thermal Game Model Based on Quantum Blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The electricity transactions of microgrids face several problems: the high platform management cost, the low security, and the untimely consumption of scattered electricity. To solve these problems, this paper presents a multi-microgrid thermal game model based on quantum blockchain. Specifically, a dynamic model was established for the noncooperative game between aggregators, microgrids, and large users to maximize the benefit of each party, and to realize the timely consumption of scattered electricity. Next, a transaction platform was constructed based on the two-round password based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol, which eliminates non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK), aiming to substantially enhance the post-quantum security of transactions. Then, the quantum signature using two-particle entangled Bell states was adopted to safeguard the quantum communication of electricity transactions, and authenticate the nodes. Example analysis shows that our model can realize the timely consumption of scattered electricity and thermal energy, improve the security of transaction data and users, and achieve Pareto optimality. The research provides theoretical support and decision-making basis for electricity transactions in the post-quantum age.

TI Continuous-Variable Quantum Secret Sharing Based on Thermal Terahertz
   Sources in Inter-Satellite Wireless Links
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CVQSS) scheme based on thermal terahertz (THz) sources in inter-satellite wireless links (THz-CVQSS). In this scheme, firstly, each player locally preforms Gaussian modulation to prepare a thermal THz state, and then couples it into a circulating spatiotemporal mode using a highly asymmetric beam splitter. At the end, the dealer measures the quadrature components of the received spatiotemporal mode through performing the heterodyne detection to share secure keys with all the players of a group. This design enables that the key can be recovered only by the whole group players' knowledge in cooperation and neither a single player nor any subset of the players in the group can recover the key correctly. We analyze both the security and the performance of THz-CVQSS in inter-satellite links. Results show that a long-distance inter-satellite THz-CVQSS scheme with multiple players is feasible. This work will provide an effective way for building an inter-satellite quantum communication network.

TI Optimization of crystal length in a pulse-pumped up-conversion
   single-photon detector for decoding femtosecond time-bin qubits
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In advancing ultrafast quantum communication and computing, it is crucial to develop precise time-resolved measurement techniques for single-photon pulses. However, the measurement of photonic qubits, especially time-bin qubits, is limited by the temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, typically around tens of picoseconds. In this study, we developed a pulse-pumped up-conversion single-photon detector (UCSPD) using periodically poled Mg-doped stoichiometric lithium tantalate (PPMg: SLT) crystals of varying lengths to optimize femtosecond up-conversion. We evaluated the UCSPD's efficiency and temporal resolution using a convolution model that accounts for group delay in nonlinear crystals. Our results demonstrate that the model calculations enable the accurate prediction of the crystal length dependence of temporal resolution and up-conversion efficiency without fitting parameters. The UCSPD achieved 415 fs resolution and 10.1 % efficiency with a 2 mm crystal, enabling successful characterization of time-bin qubits with 800 fs pulse intervals.

TI Polarization Scramblers to Solve Practical Limitations of Frequency
   Transfer
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Polarization variations in optical fibers are complex and would severely affect the performances of polarization-sensitive signal distribution systems. Owing to advances in experimental techniques and theoretical tools, we observe the effect of polarization variations in the optical fibers and we demonstrate that polarization mode dispersion (PMD) dominates the free-running fiber noise. Ultrahigh correlation, over 99%, is found between the phase fluctuation induced by polarization variation and the temperature fluctuation impacted on the optical fibers. By means of a polarization scrambling technique, the polarization variations in the optical fiber are averaged and the phase perturbations are minimized. It provides a promising solution for suppressing the random disturbances of polarization in the fiber-based optical frequency transfer system and quantum key distribution (QKD) system.

AB Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease characterized by joint swelling, pain, damage to the cartilage, and disability. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory properties of Quantum Health Accelerator (R) as water enriched with vital bio-quantum information/energy (EW) following complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced RA in rats. Methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats (180-220 g) were divided into five groups. Arthritis was induced on day one using a single subcutaneous injection of CFA into the left hind footpad of the rat. Rats were assigned to receive methotrexate (MTX, 2 mg/kg/week, intraperitoneally), EW (orally, instead of normal water ad libitum), or their combination for 29 days. The anti-RA activities were determined by paw edema, joint diameter, arthritis score, and several nociceptive behavioral tests (thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia). The levels of inflammatory (TNF-alpha, CRP, RF, and anti-CCP), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), and oxidative stress (NO, MDA, and GSH) markers were measured in serum. In addition, the levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-17, and TGF-beta were assessed in the spleen-isolated lymphocytes. Results: We found that treatment with MTX, EW, and their combination remarkably ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia results following CFA-induced RA in rats. In addition, EW also notably attenuated arthritis score, joint diameter, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative markers while propagating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative mediators. Conclusions: We reveal that EW possesses anti-arthritic effects, possibly through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Collectively, EW may be a promising therapeutic agent for treating RA.

TI Density Functional Theory Study of Controllable Optical Absorptions and
   Magneto-Optical Properties of Magnetic CrI3 Nanoribbons: Implications
   for Compact 2D Devices
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB A chromium triiodide (CrI3) monolayer has an interesting ferromagnetic ground state. In this work, we calculate band structures and magnetic moments of tensile-strained and bent zigzag CrI3 nanoribbons with density functional theory. The edge iodine atoms form flat low-lying conduction bands and couple with chromium atoms ferromagnetically, while the non edge iodine atoms weakly couple antiferromagnetically. Narrow CrI3 nanoribbons have two locally stable magnetic moment orientations, namely, out-of-plane and in-plane (along the nanoribbon periodic direction) configurations. This enables four magnetization states in CrI3 nanoribbons, including two out-of plane ones (up and down) and two in-plane ones (forward and backward along the nanoribbon periodical direction), increasing the operating controllability. Based on the one-dimensional Ising spin chain model, the spin correlation length of the narrow CrI3 nanoribbon is estimated to be about 10 & ANGS; at its estimated Curie temperature of 27 K, which is lower than the measured 45 K of the monolayer CrI3. The optical absorption and magneto-optical properties of CrI3 nanoribbons are investigated with many-body perturbation GW-BSE (Bethe-Salpeter equation), including magnetic dichroism and Faraday and magneto-optical Kerr effects. The low-energy dark excitons are mainly from transitions between electrons and holes with unlike spins and are non-Frenkel-like, while the bright excitons have mixed spin configurations. The intrinsic lifetime of excitons can be over one nanosecond, suitable for quantum information processes. Tensile strains and bending manifestly modulate the absorption spectra and magneto-optical properties of CrI3 nanoribbons within a technologically important photon energy range of & SIM;1.0-2.0 eV. The CrI3 nanoribbons can be used in 1D or 2D magnetic storage nanodevices, tunable magnetic optoelectronics, and spin-based quantum information controls.

TI Typical Correlation Length of Sequentially Generated Tensor Network
   States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The complexity of quantum many-body systems is manifested in the vast diversity of their correlations, making it challenging to distinguish the generic from the atypical features. This can be addressed by analyzing correlations through ensembles of random states, chosen to faithfully embody the relevant physical properties. Here, we focus on spins with local interactions, whose correlations are extremely well captured by tensor network states. Adopting an operational perspective, we define ensembles of random tensor network states in one and two spatial dimensions that admit a sequential generation. As such, they directly correspond to outputs of quantum circuits with a sequential architecture and random gates. In one spatial dimension, the ensemble explores the entire family of matrix product states, while in two spatial dimensions, it corresponds to random isometric tensor network states. We extract the scaling behavior of the average correlations between two subsystems as a function of their distance. Using elementary concentration results, we then deduce the typical case for measures of correlation such as the von Neumann mutual information and a measure arising from the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We find for all considered cases that the typical behavior is an exponential decay (for both one and two spatial dimensions). We observe the consistent emergence of a correlation length that depends only on the underlying spatial dimension and not the considered measure. Remarkably, increasing the bond dimension leads to a higher correlation length in one spatial dimension but has the opposite effect in two spatial dimensions.

TI Controllable orbital-to-spin angular momentum conversion in tight
   focusing of spatiotemporal vortex wavepacket
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we investigate the tight focusing of the radially polarized spatiotemporal vortex (STV) wavepackets. We find that, by changing the initial phase of the incident polarization state, the intensity envelope of the tightly focused first-order radially polarized STV wavepacket can be well controlled, yet the intensity envelope just rotates in whole for the tightly focused high-order radially polarized STV wavepacket. Furthermore, we show that, when the initial phase of incident polarization state takes pi/2, the transverse double vortex structure arises in the focal region. More interestingly, when the initial phase takes pi/2, the pure longitudinal spin angular momentum and transverse orbital angular momentum can be obtained in the tight focusing of the first-order radially polarized STV wavepacket. These effects are the manifestation of the spin-orbit interaction determined by the transverse orbital angular momentum and the incident polarization state. Our works present a technique to modulate the optical angular momentum in the tight focusing of the radially polarized STOV wavepacket, have potential application in the fields of optical switches, optical capture, quantum communication and nano-manipulation.

TI Wavelength-Sensitive Superconducting Single-Photon Detectors on Thin
   Film Lithium Niobate Waveguides
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Lithium niobate, because of its nonlinear and electro-optical properties, is one of the materials of choice for photonic applications. The development of nanostructuring capabilities of thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) permits fabrication of small footprint, low-loss optical circuits. With the recent implementation of on-chip single-photon detectors, this architecture is among the most promising for realizing on-chip quantum optics experiments. In this Letter, we report on the implementation of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on NbTiN on 300 nm thick TFLN ridge nano-waveguides. We demonstrate a waveguide-integrated wavelength meter based on the photon energy dependence of the superconducting detectors. The device operates at the telecom C- and L-bands and has a footprint smaller than 300 x 180 mu m(2) and critical currents between similar to 12 and similar to 14 mu A, which ensures operation with minimum heat dissipation. Our results hold promise for future densely packed on-chip wavelength-multiplexed quantum communication systems.

TI High-dimensional frequency conversion in a hot atomic system
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB One of the major difficulties in realizing a high-dimensional frequency converter for conventional optical vortex (COV) modes stems from the difference in ring diameter of the COV modes with different topological charge numbers l. Here, we implement a high-dimensional frequency converter for perfect optical vortex (POV) modes with invariant sizes by way of the four-wave mixing (FWM) process using Bessel-Gaussian beams instead of Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The measured conversion efficiency from 1530 to 795 nm is independent of l at least in subspace l is an element of{-6, . . . , 6}, and the achieved conversion fidelities for two-dimensional (2D) superposed POV states exceed 97%. We further realize the frequency conversion of 3D, 5D, and 7D superposition states with fidelities as high as 96.70%, 89.16%, and 88.68%, respectively. The proposed scheme is implemented in hot atomic vapor. It is also compatible with the cold atomic system and may find applications in high-capacity and long-distance quantum communication.

TI Mode-dependent Far-field Radiation of Circularly Polarized Light by a
   Single Plasmonic Nanohelix
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Chiral plasmonic nanoantennas exhibit unique chiroptical properties in both the near-field and far-field, offering exciting opportunities for applications in chiroptical sensing, circularly polarized luminescence, and quantum communication. Recent advances in chiral plasmonics have facilitated the creation of nanoparticles with intrinsic chirality at the single-particle level. However, the far-field directionality of these chiral nanoantennas is not well understood. In this work, A numerical study is conducted on a single plasmonic nanoantenna that undergoes a size-preserving compression, transitioning from a straight nanorod to left- or right-handed helices with varying pitches. These nanostructures showcase distinct mode-dependent chiroptical far-field properties, encompassing positive or negative dissymmetry factors, 3D power radiation patterns, and angular distribution of circular polarization, under both plane-wave and point-source excitations. The findings provide new insights into angle-resolved spectroscopies of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and the applications of chiral plasmonic nanoantennas for controlling circularly polarized light emission in nanophotonics.

TI Probing the quantum speed limit and entanglement in flavor oscillations
   of neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.

TI Ultrafast and Highly Collimated Radially Polarized Photons at Room
   Temperature from a Colloidal Quantum Dot Coupled to a Hybrid Nanoantenna
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB To harness the potential of radially polarized photons for classical and quantum communication applications, we demonstrate an on-chip, room-temperature device, which generates highly directional radially polarized photons at very high rates. The photons are emitted from a giant CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dot (gQD) accurately positioned at the tip of a metal nanocone centered inside a hybrid metal-dielectric bullseye antenna. We show that due to the large and selective Purcell enhancement specifically for the out-of-plane optical dipole of the gQD, the emitted photons can have a very high degree of radial polarization (>93%), based on a quantitative metric. Our study emphasizes the importance of accurate gQD positioning for optimal radial polarization purity through extensive experiments and simulations, which contribute to the fundamental understanding of radial polarization in nanostructured devices and pave the way for implementation of such systems in practical applications using structured quantum light.

TI Compact Design for Bi-Polarization Quantum Routers on SOI Platform
SO PHOTONICS
AB An ultra-compact optical quantum router (QR) consisting of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and waveguide tapers is proposed and numerically simulated, using silicon-on-insulator (SOI). The interferometer is designed to work at the center wavelength of 1550 nm with visibilities of 99.65% and 98.80% for TE and TM polarizations, respectively. Using the principle of phase compensation and self-image, the length of the waveguide tapers is shortened by an order of magnitude with the transmission above 95% for both TE and TM polarizations. Furthermore, polarization beam splitters (PBS) with an ultra-compact footprint of 1.4 x 10.4 mu m(2) with transmissions of 98% for bi-polarizations are achieved by introducing anisotropic metamaterials. The simulated results indicate that the interferometer facilitates low loss, a broad operating spectral range, and a large tolerance to size variation in fabrications. The optical switch possesses the routing function while maintaining the polarization states, which promises to pave the point-to-point BB84 protocol into applications of network-based quantum communication.

TI Covariant Quantum Combinatorics with Applications to Zero-Error
   Communication
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We develop the theory of quantum (a.k.a. noncommutative) relations and quantum (a.k.a. noncommutative) graphs in the finite-dimensional covariant setting, where all systems (finite-dimensionalC *-algebras) carry an action of a compact quantum group G, and all channels (completely positive maps preserving a certain G-invariant functional) are covariant with respect to the G-actions. We motivate our definitions by applications to zero-error quantum communication theory with a symmetry constraint. Some key results are the following: (1) We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a covariant quantum relation to be the underlying relation of a covariant channel. (2) We show that every quantum confusability graph with a G-action (which we call a quantum G-graph) arises as the confusability graph of a covariant channel. (3) We show that a covariant channel is reversible precisely when its confusability G-graph is discrete. (4) When G is quasitriangular (this includes all compact groups), we show that covariant zero-error source-channel coding schemes are classified by covariant homomorphisms between confusability G-graphs.

TI Biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, ELC waves and soliton-fermion duality
   in non-Hermitian sl(2) affine Toda coupled to fermions
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study a non-Hermitian (NH) sl(2) affine Toda model coupled to fermions through soliton theory techniques and the realizations of the pseudo-chiral and pseudo- Hermitian symmetries. The interplay of non-Hermiticity, integrability, nonlinearity, and topology significantly influence the formation and behavior of a continuum of bound state modes (CBM) and extended waves in the localized continuum (ELC). The non-Hermitian soliton-fermion duality, the complex scalar field topological charges and winding numbers in the spectral topology are uncovered. The biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, dual to the NH Toda solitons with topological charges 2/pi arg (z = +/- i=+/- 1) = +/- 1, appear at the complex-energy point gap and are pinned at zero energy. The zero eigenvalue lambda(z = +/- i) = 0, besides being a zero mode, plays the role of exceptional points (EPs), and each EP separates a real eigenvalue A-symmetric and A-symmetry broken regimes for an antilinear symmetry A is an element of {PT, gamma 5PT}. Our findings improve the understanding of exotic quantum states, but also paves the way for future research in harnessing non-Hermitian phenomena for topological quantum computation, as well as the exploration of integrability and NH solitons in the theory of topological phases of matter.

TI Exchange coupling in Bi2Se3/EuSe heterostructures and evidence of
   interfacial antiferromagnetic order formation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spatial confinement of electronic topological surface states (TSSs) in topological insulators poses a formidable challenge because TSSs are protected by time-reversal symmetry. In previous works formation of a gap in the electronic spectrum of TSSs has been successfully demonstrated in topological insulator/magnetic material heterostructures, where ferromagnetic exchange interactions locally lift the time-reversal symmetry. Here we report experimental evidence of exchange interaction between a topological insulator Bi2Se3 and a magnetic insulator EuSe. Spin-polarized neutron reflectometry reveals a reduction of the in-plane magnetic susceptibility within a 2 nm interfacial layer of EuSe, and the combination of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry and Hall measurements points to the formation of an interfacial layer with a suppressed net magnetic moment. This suppressed magnetization survives up to temperatures five times higher than the Neel temperature of EuSe. Its origin is attributed to the formation of an interfacial antiferromagnetic state. Abrupt resistance changes observed in high magnetic fields are consistent with antiferromagnetic domain reconstruction affecting transport in a TSS via exchange coupling. The high-temperature local control of TSSs with zero net magnetization unlocks new opportunities for the design of electronic, spintronic, and quantum computation devices, ranging from quantization of Hall conductance in zero fields to spatial localization of non-Abelian excitations in superconducting topological qubits.

We describe the general operation principles of a Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectrometer with a high-power laser and a scanning tandem Fabry-Perot interferometer (TFPI) for material characterization. Various uncertainty components have been analyzed for the BLS spectrometer following the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). The expanded relative uncertainty in the measured Brillouin frequency shift of 15.70 GHz for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was estimated to be 0.26%. The calculated Brillouin frequency shift (based on material properties of PMMA) was determined to be 15.44 GHz with expanded relative uncertainty of 2.13%. It was shown that the measured and calculated Brillouin frequency shifts for PMMA agree within their expanded uncertainties. The TFPI-based BLS spectrometer can be used to measure the longitudinal modulus of materials with an expanded uncertainty of 1.9%, which is smaller than that of the ultrasonic velocity-based method (estimated to be 2.9%).

TI Experimental vulnerability analysis of QKD based on attack ratings
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Inspired by the methodology used for classical cryptographic hardware, we consider the use of attack ratings in the context of QKD security evaluation. To illustrate the relevance of this approach, we conduct an experimental vulnerability assessment of CV-QKD against saturation attacks, for two different attack strategies. The first strategy relies on inducing detector saturation by performing a large coherent displacement. This strategy is experimentally challenging and therefore translates into a high attack rating. We also propose and experimentally demonstrate a second attack strategy that simply consists in saturating the detector with an external laser. The low rating we obtain indicates that this attack constitutes a primary threat for practical CV-QKD systems. These results highlight the benefits of combining theoretical security considerations with vulnerability analysis based on attack ratings, in order to guide the design and engineering of practical QKD systems towards the highest possible security standards.

TI Integrated gallium phosphide-waveguide polarization rotator based on
   rotating a horizontal slot by 45 degree for 700 nm wavelength
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS-INDIA
AB Polarization manipulation elements operating at visible wavelengths represent a critical component of quantum communication sub-systems, equivalent to their telecom wavelength counterparts. The method proposed involves rotating the optic axis of the polarized input light by an angle of 45 degree, thereby converting the fundamental transverse electric (TE0) mode to the fundamental transverse magnetic (TM0) mode. This paper outlines an integrated gallium phosphide-waveguide polarization rotator, which relies on the rotation of a horizontal slot by 45 degree at a wavelength of 700 nm. This will ultimately lead to the conception of a mode hybridization phenomenon in the waveguide. The simulation results demonstrate a polarization conversion efficiency of 99.99% (99.98%) for TE0-to-TM0 (TM0-to-TE0) mode conversion, with an extinction ratio of 46.14 (39.62) dB and insertion loss below 1.6 dB at the specified wavelength. Additionally, the fabrication tolerance with regard to the width, height, and half-beat length of the proposed structure is investigated.

TI Non-Fermi liquid and antiferromagnetic correlations with hole doping in
   the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model of La3Ni2O7 at zero temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB High-Tc superconductivity (SC) was recently found in the bilayer material La3Ni2O7 (La327) under high pressures. We study the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model derived from the band structure of the La327. The model is solved by cluster dynamical mean-field theory with natural orbitals renormalization group as impurity solver at zero temperature, considering only normal states. With hole doping, we have observed sequentially the Mott insulator, pseudogap (PG), non-Fermi liquid (NFL), and Fermi liquid phases, with quantum correlations decreasing. The ground state of the La327 is in the NFL phase with Hund spin correlation, which transmits the Ni-3dz2 (z) orbital interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation to the Ni-3dx2-y2 orbitals. When the sigma-bonding state of the z orbitals (z+) is no longer fully filled, the interlayer AFM correlations weaken rapidly. At low pressures, the fully filled z + band supports strong interlayer AFM correlations, potentially suppressing SC and favoring short-range spin density wave (SDW). Hole doping at low pressures may achieve a similar effect to high pressures, under which the z + band intersects with the Fermi level, and consequently the spin correlations weaken remarkably, potentially suppressing the possible short-range SDW and favoring SC.

TI Log to log-log crossover of entanglement in a (1+1)-dimensional massive
   scalar field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study three different measures of quantum correlations-entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and logarithmic negativity-for a (1 + 1)-dimensional massive scalar field in a flat space-time. The entanglement spectrum for the discretized scalar field in the ground state indicates a crossover in the zero-mode regime, which is further substantiated by an analytical treatment of both entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity. The exact nature of this crossover depends on the boundary conditions used-the leading order term switches from a log to log-log behavior for the periodic and Neumann boundary conditions. In contrast, for Dirichlet, it is the parameters within the leading log-log term that are switched. We show that this crossover manifests as a change in the behavior of the leading order divergent term for entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity close to the zero-mode limit. We thus show that the two regimes have fundamentally different information content. Furthermore, an analysis of the ground-state fidelity shows us that the region between critical point Lambda = 0 and the crossover point is dominated by zero-mode effects, featuring an explicit dependence on the IR cutoff of the system. For the reduced state of a single oscillator, we show that this crossover occurs in the region Nam(f) similar to O(1).

TI Enhancing detection of topological order by local error correction
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The exploration of topologically-ordered states of matter is a long-standing goal at the interface of several subfields of the physical sciences. Such states feature intriguing physical properties such as long-range entanglement, emergent gauge fields and non-local correlations, and can aid in realization of scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, these same features also make creation, detection, and characterization of topologically-ordered states particularly challenging. Motivated by recent experimental demonstrations, we introduce a paradigm for quantifying topological states-locally error-corrected decoration (LED)-by combining methods of error correction with ideas of renormalization-group flow. Our approach allows for efficient and robust identification of topological order, and is applicable in the presence of incoherent noise sources, making it particularly suitable for realistic experiments. We demonstrate the power of LED using numerical simulations of the toric code under a variety of perturbations. We subsequently apply it to an experimental realization, providing new insights into a quantum spin liquid created on a Rydberg-atom simulator. Finally, we extend LED to generic topological phases, including those with non-abelian order.
   Detection of topological phases in experiments is challenging, especially in the presence of incoherent noise. Cong et al. introduce a novel method combining error correction and renormalization-group flow and apply it to characterization of quantum spin liquid phases realized in a Rydberg-atom simulator.

TI From Uncertainty Relations to Quantum Acceleration Limits
SO AXIOMS
AB The concept of quantum acceleration limit has been recently introduced for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems under arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. While Alsing and Cafaro used the Robertson uncertainty relation in their derivation, employed the Robertson-Schr & ouml;dinger uncertainty relation to find the upper bound on the temporal rate of change of the speed of quantum evolutions. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of these two alternative derivations for quantum systems specified by an arbitrary finite-dimensional projective Hilbert space. Furthermore, focusing on a geometric description of the quantum evolution of two-level quantum systems on a Bloch sphere under general time-dependent Hamiltonians, we find the most general conditions needed to attain the maximal upper bounds on the acceleration of the quantum evolution. In particular, these conditions are expressed explicitly in terms of two three-dimensional real vectors, the Bloch vector that corresponds to the evolving quantum state and the magnetic field vector that specifies the Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system. For pedagogical reasons, we illustrate our general findings for two-level quantum systems in explicit physical examples characterized by specific time-varying magnetic field configurations. Finally, we briefly comment on the extension of our considerations to higher-dimensional physical systems in both pure and mixed quantum states.

TI Metasurface-enabled quantum holograms with hybrid entanglement
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Metasurfaces, with their capability to control all possible dimensions of light, have become integral to quantum optical applications, including quantum state generation, operation, and tomography. We utilize a metasurface to generate polarization-hologram hybrid entanglement between a signal-idler photon pair to construct a quantum hologram. The properties of the quantum hologram can be revealed by collapsing the polarization degree of freedom of the idler photon, inducing interference between two holographic states of the signal photon as a meaningful and selective erasure of the holographic content. On the contrary, interference disappears when the idler photon is detected without observing polarization. This process can be further interpreted as a quantum holographic eraser, where the erasing action is visualized with erased contents in holograms. Our construction of a polarization-hologram hybrid entangled state with metasurfaces will be useful for quantum communication with enhanced robustness, anticounterfeiting applications through the additional quantum degrees of freedom or phase difference between two holographic states, and as an emerging platform for exploring fundamental quantum concepts for entanglement and nonlocality.

TI Experimental coherent-state quantum secret sharing with finite pulses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a significant role in multiparty quantum communication and is a crucial component of future quantum multiparty computing networks. Therefore, it is highly valuable to develop a QSS protocol that offers both information-theoretic security and validation in real optical systems under a finite-key regime. In this work, we propose a three-user QSS protocol based on phaseencoding technology. By adopting symmetric procedures for the two players, our protocol resolves the security loopholes introduced by asymmetric basis choice without prior knowledge of the identity of the malicious player. Kato's concentration inequality is exploited to provide security against coherent attacks with the finite-key effect. Moreover, the practicality of our protocol has been validated under a 30-dB channel loss with a transmission distance of 5-km fiber. Our protocol achieves secure key rates ranging from 432 to 192 bps by choosing different pulse intensities and basis selection probabilities. Offering enhanced security and practicality, our protocol stands as an essential element for the realization of quantum multiparty computing networks.

Proposed fibers exhibit a record low loss of 6.7 x 10(-4) dB km(-1) at 630 nm with less than 1 dB km(-1) over a broad 330 nm bandwidth, achieved by the incorporation and optimization of nested elements in the primary cladding tubes. A comprehensive analysis, utilizing finite difference algorithm, to study the role of structural parameters of the hollow core fiber viz. tube thickness and gaps between the tubes on the loss spectrum is also presented. A comparative analysis of NARF designs using tube thickness in different anti-resonant bands is also included. The bend robustness, polarization analysis, dispersion, and fabrication tolerances are investigated. Proposed low-loss fibers in the visible wavelength regime can drastically bring down the cost and complexity of quantum communication systems.

TI Bipartite mutual information in classical many-body dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Information theoretic measures have helped to sharpen our understanding of many-body quantum states. As perhaps the most well-known example, the entanglement entropy (or more generally, the bipartite mutual information) has become a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamical growth of quantum correlations. By contrast, although computable, the bipartite mutual information (MI) is almost never explored in classical many particle systems; this owes in part to the fact that computing the MI requires keeping track of the evolution of the full probability distribution, a feat which is rarely done (or thought to be needed) in classical many-body simulations. Here, we utilize the MI to analyze the spreading of information in 1D elementary cellular automata (CA). Broadly speaking, we find that the behavior of the MI in these dynamical systems exhibits a few different types of scaling that roughly correspond to known CA universality classes. Of particular note is that we observe a set of automata for which the MI converges parametrically slowly to its thermodynamic value. We develop a microscopic understanding of this behavior by analyzing a two-species model of annihilating particles moving in opposite directions. Our work suggests the possibility that information theoretic tools such as the MI might enable a more fine-grained characterization of classical many-body states and dynamics.

TI Genuine entanglement detection via projection map in multipartite
   systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We present a formalism to detect genuine multipartite entanglement by considering projection map which is a positive but not completely positive map. Projection map has been motivated by the no-pancake theorem which repudiates the existence of a quantum operation that maps the Bloch sphere onto a disk along its equator. The not-complete positivity feature of projection map is explored to investigate genuine multipartite entanglement in arbitrary N-qubit quantum systems. Our proposed framework can detect some important classes of genuinely entangled states in tripartite and quadripartite scenarios. We provide illustrative example to show the efficacy of our formalism to detect a class of tripartite PPT bound entangled states. Finally, we construct a suitable witness operator based on projection map to certify genuine tripartite entanglement, which is likely to be feasible experimentally.

TI Quantum-Classical Computational Molecular Design of Deuterated
   High-Efficiency OLED Emitters
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB This paper describes a hybrid quantum-classical computational approach to designing synthesizable deuterated tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum (Alq3) emitters with desirable emission quantum efficiency (QE). This multi-pronged approach first uses classical quantum chemistry to create a machine learning dataset, which is then used to construct an Ising Hamiltonian by a factorization-machine-based model to predict the QEs of Alq3 emitters. Finally, the Ising Hamiltonian is applied to perform simulations using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on a quantum device to discover molecules with optimal QE. Moreover, to improve the simulations on the noisy quantum device, we developed the recursive probabilistic variable elimination method, which recursively eliminates qubits depending on the probability that each qubit has a binary value. We demonstrated that the accuracy of VQE and QAOA optimized for a noisy device can be improved from a probability of 0.075 to 0.97.

AB We discuss the thermodynamic aspects of a single qubit based device, powered by weak quantum measure-ments, and feedback controlled by a quantum Maxwell's demon. We discuss both discrete and time-continuous operation of the measurement based device at finite temperature of the reservoir. In the discrete example where a demon acquires information via discrete weak measurements, we find that the thermodynamic variables includ-ing the heat exchanged, extractable work, and the entropy produced are completely determined by an information theoretic measure of the demon's perceived arrow of time. We also discuss a realistic time-continuous operation of the device where the feedback is applied after a sequence of weak measurements. In the time-continuous limit, we derive the exact finite-time statistics of work, heat, and entropy changes along individual quantum trajectories of the quantum measurement process, and relate them to the demon's arrow of time.

TI Squashed entanglement in one-dimensional quantum matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Squashed entanglement and its universal upper bound, the quantum conditional mutual information, are faithful measures of bipartite quantum correlations defined in terms of multipartitions. As such, they are sensitive to the fine-grain structure of quantum systems. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of quantum conditional mutual information between the edges of quantum many-body systems. We show that this quantity characterizes unambiguously one-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors, being equal to Bell-state entanglement in the former and to half Bell-state entanglement in the latter, mirroring the different statistics of the edge modes in the two systems. The edge-to-edge quantum conditional mutual information is robust in the presence of disorder or local perturbations, converges exponentially with the system size to a quantized topological invariant, even in the presence of interactions, and vanishes in the trivial phase. We thus conjecture that it coincides with the edge-to-edge squashed entanglement in the entire ground-state phase diagram of symmetry-protected topological systems, and we provide some analytical evidence supporting the claim. By comparing them with the entanglement negativity, we collect further indications that the quantum conditional mutual information and the squashed entanglement provide a very accurate characterization of nonlocal correlation patterns in one-dimensional quantum matter.

TI Dark-state and loss-induced phenomena in the quantum-optical regime of
   Λ-type three-level systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The interaction of matter with quantum light leads to phenomena which cannot be explained by semiclassical approaches. Of particular interest are states with broad photon-number distributions which allow processes with high-order Fock states. Here, we analyze a Jaynes-Cummings-type model with three electronic levels which is excited by quantum light. As quantum light we consider coherent and squeezed states. In our simulations we include several loss mechanisms, namely, dephasing, cavity, and radiative losses which are relevant in real systems. We demonstrate that losses allow one to control the population of electronic levels and may induce coherent population trapping, as well as lead to a redistribution of the photon statistics among the quantum fields and even to a transfer of the photon statistics from one field to another. Moreover, we introduce and analyze a quantity, the quantum polarization, and demonstrate its fundamental difference compared to the classical polarization. Using the quantum polarization and the third-level population, we investigate electromagnetically induced transparency in the presence of quantum light and show its special features for the case of squeezed light. Finally, quantum correlations between fields are studied and analyzed in the presence of different types of losses.

TI Majorana-like end states in one-dimensional dimerized Kitaev
   topolectrical circuit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter and materials physics communities due to the implications in topological quantum computation. One-dimensional (1D) dimerized Kitaev chain is a prototype model for MZMs, but its realization remains a challenge in material systems. Here, we develop a distinctive approach to achieve Majorana-like end states (MESs) by implementing practical dimerized Kitaev topolectrical circuits. Specifically, two arrays of inductors are arranged to simulate particles and antiparticles, while intra- and inter-array capacitive connections are used to model hopping and superconducting pairing. Three topological phases can be achieved by tuning the capacitance, i.e. the trivial phase, Su-Schrieffer-Heeger topological phase and Kitaev phase, with distinct field strength distributions in real space. Majorana splitting is observed around a domain wall in the circuit, and we propose an efficient experimental observable-edge distance-to characterize the process as premonition of topological phase transition. Remarkably, dynamics of the Gaussian wave packet in time domain provide an excellent signal to detect MESs in experiments, as only MESs allow nonlocal propagation in circuit network. Our results not only manifest the superiorities of topolectrical circuits for exotic topological states, but also pave the way for possible applications in electrical engineering and signal processing.

TI Efficient Quantum Private Comparison without Sharing a Key
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum private comparison (QPC) allows at least two users to compare the equality of their secret information, for which the security is based on the properties of quantum mechanics. To improve the use of quantum resources and the efficiency of private comparison, a new QPC protocol based on GHZ-like states is proposed. The protocol adopts unitary operations to encode the secret information instead of performing quantum key distribution (QKD), which can reduce the amount of computation required to perform QKD and improve the utilization of quantum resources. The decoy photon technique used to detect channel eavesdropping ensures that the protocol is resistant to external attacks. The quantum efficiency of the protocol reaches 66%. Compared with many previous QPC schemes, the proposed protocol does not need to share a key and has advantages in quantum efficiency and quantum resources.

TI Illuminating Advances in Materials: Optical Physical Unclonable
   Functions for Security Applications
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB A physical unclonable function (PUF) device leverages manufacturing randomness to generate a unique fingerprint for secure authentication, encryption, and counterfeit prevention. Optical PUFs (OPUFs) have gained prominence due to their strong security, light-based challenge-response mechanisms, and potential for quantum-secure encryption. These devices have promising applications for hardware security, authentication, cryptographic key generation, and anti-counterfeiting measures across multiple industries. This review enlightens the diverse material platforms used for OPUFs, ranging from fiber optics and liquid crystals to advanced semiconductor nanocrystals and plasmonic metasurfaces, each offering distinct optical characteristics that impact security strength. While no single material system dominates the field, hybrid and multi-model approaches integrating low-dimensional materials are being explored to enhance reliability and scalability. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives are outlined, including adaptive OPUFs architectures, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for challenge-response generation, and their integration into quantum communication networks, highlighting how next-generation semiconductor materials can further advance OPUFs technologies.

TI A bright polarization-entangled photon pair source based on silicon
   photonics integration
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Developing a high-quality, bright source of polarization-entangled photon pairs on CMOS-compatible integrated platforms, such as silicon or silicon nitride, remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel silicon chip-based nonlinear Sagnac interferometer, which mainly integrates a bidirectionally pumped microring resonator with a polarization-splitting rotator, was proposed to generate polarization-entangled photon pairs. By pumping the system with a pulsed laser at 1550 nm and a power of 78 mu W, polarization-entangled photon pairs in the telecom C-band were produced through spontaneous four-wave mixing, achieving a state-of-the-art brightness of 1.6 x 10(7) pairs s(-1) GHz(-1) mW(-2). Using an off-chip polarization analyzer, the visibility of polarization-correlation interference fringe was measured to be 96.6%. Quantum state tomography revealed a fidelity of 0.958 for the maximally entangled state produced by the source. These exceptional performance metrics, combined with the integrability of the device, make it highly suitable for advanced quantum applications, particularly in multi-user entanglement-based quantum communication networks.

TI Foliated order parameter in a fracton phase transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Finding suitable indicators for characterizing quantum phase transitions plays an important role in understanding different phases of matter. It is especially important for fracton phases where a combination of topology and fractionalization leads to exotic features not seen in other known quantum phases. In this paper, we consider the above problem by studying phase transition in the X-cube model in the presence of a nonlinear perturbation. Using an analysis of the ground state fidelity and identifying a discontinuity in the global entanglement, we show there is a first-order quantum phase transition from a type-I fracton phase with a highly entangled nature to a magnetized phase. Accordingly, we conclude that the global entanglement, as a measure of the total quantum correlations in the ground state, can well capture certain features of fracton phase transitions. Then, we introduce a nonlocal order parameter in the form of a foliated operator which can characterize the above phase transition. We particularly show that such an order parameter has a geometric nature which captures specific differences of fracton phases with topological phases. Our study is specifically based on a well-known dual mapping to the classical plaquette Ising model where it shows the importance of such dualities in studying different quantum phases of matter.

TI Scrambling and quantum feedback in a nanomechanical system
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB The question of how swiftly entanglement spreads over a system has attracted vital interest. In this regard, the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a quantitative measure of the entanglement spreading process. Particular interest concerns the propagation of quantum correlations in the lattice systems, e.g., spin chains. In a seminal paper of Roberts et al. (J. High Energy Phys. 03:051, 2015), the concept of the OTOC's radius was introduced. The radius of the OTOC defines the front line reached by the spread of entanglement. Beyond this radius operators commute. In the present work, we propose a model of two nanomechanical systems coupled with two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spins. Oscillators are coupled to each other directly, while NV spins are not. Therefore, the correlation between the NV spins may arise only through the quantum feedback exerted from the first NV spin to the first oscillator and transferred from the first oscillator to the second oscillator via the direct coupling. Thus, nonzero OTOC between NV spins quantifies the strength of the quantum feedback. We show that NV spins cannot exert quantum feedback on classical nonlinear oscillators. We also discuss inherently quantum case with a linear quantum harmonic oscillator indirectly coupling the two spins and verify that in the classical limit of the oscillator, the OTOC vanishes.

TI Temperature measurements in deployed optical fiber networks using single
   photon optical time domain reflectometry
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate an approach to measure average temperature changes in deployed optical fiber networks using Optical Time Domain Reflectometry, OTDR, at the single photon level. In this article we derive a model relating the change in temperature of an optical fiber to the change in time of flight of reflected photons in the fiber in the range -50 -> 400 degrees C. A setup is constructed to validate this model utilizing a pulsed 1550 nm laser and a Superconducing Nanowire Single Photon Detector, SNSPD. With this setup we show that we can measure temperature changes with 0.08 degrees C accuracy over km distances and we demonstrate temperature measurements in a dark optical fiber network deployed across the Stockholm metropolitan area. This approach will enable in-situ characterization for both quantum and classical optical fiber networks.

TI Spacetime effects on wavepackets of coherent light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the interplay between gravity and the quantum coherence present in the state of a pulse of light propagating in curved spacetime. We first introduce an operational way to distinguish between the overall shift in the pulse wave packet and its genuine deformation after propagation. We then apply our technique to quantum states of photons that are coherent in the frequency degree of freedom, as well as to states of completely incoherent light. We focus on Gaussian profiles and frequency combs and find that the quantum coherence initially present can enhance the deformation induced by propagation in a curved background. These results further support the claim that genuine quantum features, such as quantum coherence, can be used to probe the gravitational properties of physical systems. We specialize our techniques to Earth-to-satellite communication setups, where the effects of gravity are weak but can be tested with current satellite technologies.

TI Experimental verification of superconducting metamaterial
   quarter-wavelength transmission line resonators with non-uniform mode

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Superconducting transmission line resonators (TLRs) have been widely applied to circuit quantum electrodynamical systems for superconducting quantum computation and single-photon detections. Recently, such a right-handed TLR has been generalized to electromagnetic metamaterials (MTMs), and its unconventional mode structure has been experimentally characterized (Wang et al. in Phys Rev Appl 11:054062, 2019). Here, we demonstrate another kind of MTM TLR, i.e., the superconducting quarter-wavelength composite right/left-handed (CRLH) TLRs composed of lumped elements. We design the devices and analyze their transport properties by developing a real-space approach, wherein the physical parameters at the device boundaries are utilized conveniently. Superconducting MTM TLRs with typical three unit cells were experimentally prepared by etching a superconducting aluminum film on a SiO\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_2$$\end{document} substrate, and their microwave transport properties were measured at low temperatures of 50 mK. The results show that the modes spacing in such a quarter-wavelength CRLH-TLR is non-uniform, due to the nonlinear dispersion relation. This implies that it could be utilized to encode the superconducting qubits, analogously to the usual ones encoded by using the Josephson devices.

TI Self-Consistent Determination of Single-Impurity Anderson Model Using
   Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach on a Spin Quantum Simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The accurate determination of the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials using first principle methods is of paramount importance in condensed matter physics, computational chemistry, and material science. However, due to the exponential scaling of computational resources, incorporating such materials into classical computation frameworks becomes prohibitively expensive. In 2016, Bauer et al. proposed a hybrid quantum-classical approach to correlated materials [B. Bauer et al., Hybrid quantumclassical approach to correlated materials, Phys. Rev. X 6, 031045 (2016).] that can efficiently tackle the electronic structure of complex correlated materials. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that approach to tackle the computational challenges associated with strongly correlated materials. By seamlessly integrating quantum computation into classical computers, we address the most computationally demanding aspect of the calculation, namely the computation of the Green's function, using a spin quantum processor. Furthermore, we realize a self-consistent determination of the single impurity Anderson model through a feedback loop between quantum and classical computations. A quantum phase transition in the Hubbard model from the metallic phase to the Mott insulator is observed as the strength of electron correlation increases. As the number of qubits with high control fidelity continues to grow, our experimental findings pave the way for solving even more complex models, such as strongly correlated crystalline materials or intricate molecules.

TI Can NSI affect non-local correlations in neutrino oscillations?
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Non-local correlations in entangled systems are usually captured by measures such as Bell's inequality violation. It was recently shown that in neutrino systems, a measure of non-local advantage of quantum coherence (NAQC) can be considered as a stronger measure of non-local correlations as compared to the Bell's inequality violation. In this work, we analyze the effects of non standard interaction (NSI) on these measures in the context of two flavour neutrino oscillations for DUNE, MINOS, T2K, KamLAND, JUNO and Daya Bay experimental set-ups. We find that even in the presence of NSI, Bell's inequality violation occurs in the entire energy range whereas the NAQC violation is observed only in some specific energy range justifying the more elementary feature of NAQC. Further, we find that NSI can enhance the violation of NAQC and Bell's inequality parameter in the higher energy range of a given experimental set-up; these enhancements being maximal for the KamLAND experiment. However, the possible enhancement in the violation of the Bell's inequality parameter over the standard model prediction can be up to 11% whereas for NAQC it is 7%. Thus although NAQC is a comparatively stronger witness of nonclassicality, it shows lesser sensitivity to NSI effects in comparison to the Bell's inequality parameter.

TI Improved genetic algorithm-based optimization of filler rod design in
   photonic crystal fiber packaging with an antagonism balance criterion
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The use of the stack-and-draw method to fabricate photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) depends on the precise optimization of filler rod parameters, such as the size, positional accuracy, and tolerance. Traditional manual design methods employing tools such as AutoCAD rely on manual effort and experience, often resulting in inconsistencies and limited precision. In this study, we propose an automated design framework based on an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) incorporating what we beleive to be a novel antagonism balance criterion, which systematically addresses these limitations by autonomously determining the optimal parameters of the filler rods. The framework generates 1:1 stacked diagrams within minutes and, via finite element analysis, validates that the structural configuration significantly mitigates collapse risks during fabrication. The proposed method not only provides a universal and scalable paradigm for high-precision microstructured optical fiber design, but also demonstrates strong potential for broader applications in precision manufacturing and assembly systems, such as automated micro-assembly, quantum communication systems, and advanced semiconductor packaging.

TI Deep learning-based vortex decomposition and switching based on fiber
   vector eigenmodes
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Structured optical fields, such as cylindrical vector (CV) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, have attracted considerable attention due to their polarization singularities and helical phase wavefront structure. However, one of the most critical challenges is still the intelligent generation or precise control of these modes. Here, we demonstrate the first simulation and experimental realization of decomposing the CV and OAM modes by reconstructing the multi-view images of projected intensity distribution. Assisted by the deep learning-based stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) algorithm, the modal coefficients and optical field distributions can be retrieved in 1.32 s within an average error of 0.416 % showing high efficiency and accuracy. Especially, the interference pattern and quarter-wave plate are exploited to confirm the phase and distinguish elliptical or circular polarization direction, respectively. The generated donut modes are experimentally decomposed in the CV and OAM modes, where purity of CV modes reaches 99.5 %. Finally, fast switching vortex modes is achieved by electrically driving the polarization controller to deliver diverse CV modes. Our findings may provide a convenient way to characterize and deepen the understanding of CV or OAM modes in view of modal proportions, which is expected of latent applied value on information coding and quantum computation.

TI Matrix product state simulations of quantum quenches and transport in
   Coulomb blockaded superconducting devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superconducting devices subject to strong charging energy interactions and Coulomb blockade are one of the key elements for the development of nanoelectronics and constitute common building blocks of quantum computation platforms and topological superconducting setups. The study of their transport properties is nontrivial and some of their nonperturbative aspects are hard to capture with the most ordinary techniques. Here we present a matrix product state approach to simulate the real-time dynamics of these systems. We propose a study of their transport based on the analysis of the currents after quantum quenches connecting such devices with external leads. Our method is based on the combination of a Wilson chain construction for the leads and a mean-field BCS description for the superconducting scatterers. In particular, we employ a quasiparticle energy eigenbasis which greatly reduces their entanglement growth and we introduce an auxiliary degree of freedom to encode the device's total charge. This approach allows us to treat nonperturbatively both their charging energy and coupling with external electrodes. We show that our construction is able to describe the Coulomb diamond structure of a superconducting dot with subgap states, including its sequential tunneling and cotunneling features. We also study the conductance zero-bias peaks caused by Majorana modes in a blockaded Kitaev chain and compare our results with common Breit-Wigner predictions.

TI Dimension-adaptive machine learning-based quantum state reconstruction
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We introduce an approach for performing quantum state reconstruction on systems of n qubits using a machine learning-based reconstruction system trained exclusively on m qubits, where m & GE; n. This approach removes the necessity of exactly matching the dimensionality of a system under consideration with the dimension of a model used for training. We demonstrate our technique by performing quantum state reconstruction on randomly sampled systems of one, two, and three qubits using machine learning-based methods trained exclusively on systems containing at least one additional qubit. The reconstruction time required for machine learning-based methods scales significantly more favorably than the training time; hence this technique can offer an overall saving of resources by leveraging a single neural network for dimension-variable state reconstruction, obviating the need to train dedicated machine learning systems for each Hilbert space.

TI Dislocation-position fluctuations in solid 4He as collective
   variables in a quantum crystal
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Quantum behavior at mesoscopic length scales is of significant interest, both from a fundamental-physics standpoint, as well as in the context of technological advances. In this light, the description of collective variables comprising large numbers of atoms, but nevertheless displaying non-classical behavior, is a fundamental problem. Here, we show that an effective-Hamiltonian approach for such variables, as has been applied to describe the quantum behavior of coupled qubit/oscillator systems, can also be very useful in understanding intrinsic behavior of quantum materials. We consider lattice dislocations - naturally occurring mesoscopic line defects in crystals - in the prototypical bosonic quantum crystal, solid He-4. For this purpose, we map fully atomistic quantum simulations onto effective one-dimensional Hamiltonians in which the collective dislocation-position variables are represented as interacting, massive quantum particles. The results provide quantitative understanding of several experimental observations in solid He-4.

TI Detecting Heat Leaks with Trapped Ion Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The concept of passivity has been conceived to set bounds on the evolution of microscopic systems initialized in thermal states. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of two frameworks, global passivity and passivity deformation, for the detection of coupling to a hidden environment. We employ a trapped-ion quantum processor, where system qubits undergoing unitary evolution may optionally be coupled to an unobserved environment qubit, resulting in a heat leak. Evaluating the measurement data from the system qubits only, we show that global passivity can verify the presence of a heat leak, which is not detectable by a microscopic equivalent of the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we experimentally show that passivity deformation allows for even more sensitive detection of heat leaks, as compared to global passivity, and detect a heat leak with an error margin of 5.3 standard deviations, in a scenario where other tests fail.

TI Phonon-assisted entanglement between two quantum dots coupled to a
   plasmonic nanocavity
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We theoretically investigate the influence of a phonon bath on entangled generation between two semiconductor quantum dots coupled to a plasmonic nanocavity and coherently driven by an external optical field. Our study reveals that phonons could be useful in a certain range of system parameters where a subradian state preparation is possible. We point out that this behavior is due to the fact that phonon environment modify the radiative properties of the two-qubit inducing different decay rates between the collective states of the system. The influence of the factors characteristic of quantum dot systems and plasmonic nanocavity such as energy mismatch in different dots, different plasmonic cavity losses as well as coupling to phonons is analyzed. The entanglement can be controlled via different external parameters such as the cavity detuning, the Rabi frequency of the driving field and the resonance frequency of the QDs.

TI Color codes with twists: Construction and universal-gate-set
   implementation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Twists are defects in a lattice that can be used to perform encoded computations. Three basic types of twists can be introduced in color codes: twists that permute color, charge of anyons, and domino twists that permute the charge label of an anyon with a color label. In this paper, we study a subset these twists from a coding theoretic viewpoint. Specifically, we discuss systematic construction of charge permuting and color permuting twists in color codes. We show that by braiding alone, Clifford gates can be realized in color codes with charge permuting twists. We also discuss implementing single-qubit Clifford gates by a Pauli frame update and CNOT gate by braiding holes around twists in color codes with color permuting twists. Finally, we also discuss implementing a non-Clifford gate by state injection, thus completing the realization of a universal gate set.

TI Optimised domain-engineered crystals for pure telecom photon sources
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The ideal photon-pair source for building up multi-qubit states needs to produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency. Indistinguishability is crucial for minimising errors in two-photon interference, central to building larger states, while high heralding rates will be needed to overcome unfavourable loss scaling. Domain engineering in parametric down-conversion sources negates the need for lossy spectral filtering allowing one to satisfy these conditions inherently within the source design. Here, we present a telecom-wavelength parametric down-conversion photon source that operates on the achievable limit of domain engineering. We generate photons from independent sources which achieve two-photon interference visibilities of up to 98.6 +/- 1.1% without narrow-band filtering. As a consequence, we reach net heralding efficiencies of up to 67.5%, which corresponds to collection efficiencies exceeding 90%.

TI Circulator function in a Josephson junction circuit and braiding of
   Majorana zero modes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a scheme for the circulator function in a superconducting circuit consisting of a three-Josephson junction loop and a trijunction. In this study we obtain the exact Lagrangian of the system by deriving the effective potential from the fundamental boundary conditions. We subsequently show that we can selectively choose the direction of current flowing through the branches connected at the trijunction, which performs a circulator function. Further, we use this circulator function for a non-Abelian braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). In the branches of the system we introduce pairs of MZMs which interact with each other through the phases of trijunction. The circulator function determines the phases of the trijunction and thus the coupling between the MZMs to gives rise to the braiding operation. We modify the system so that MZMs might be coupled to the external ones to perform qubit operations in a scalable design.

TI HoloTile light engine: new digital holographic modalities and
   applications
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB HoloTile is a patented computer generated holography approach with the aim of reducing the speckle noise caused by the overlap of the non-trivial physical extent of the point spread function in Fourier holographic systems from adjacent frequency components. By combining tiling of phase-only of rapidly generated sub-holograms with a PSF-shaping phase profile, each frequency component-or output 'pixel'- in the Fourier domain is shaped to a desired non-overlapping profile. In this paper, we show the high-resolution, speckle-reduced reconstructions that can be achieved with HoloTile, as well as present new HoloTile modalities, including an expanded list of PSF options with new key properties. In addition, we discuss numerous applications for which HoloTile, its rapid hologram generation, and the new PSF options may be an ideal fit, including optical trapping and manipulation of particles, volumetric additive printing, information transfer and quantum communication.

TI Efficient quantum secure multi-party greatest common divisor protocol
   and its applications in private set operations
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Private set intersection (PSI) has important application value, however, current quantum PSI protocols are either unsuitable for multi-party scenarios or inefficient. Recently, Imran (arXiv:2303.17196v3, 2023) proposed two quantum secure multi-party greatest common divisor (GCD) protocols that can be used for PSI, but with the downside of information leakage and resource consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum secure multi-party GCD protocol that has higher security and lower complexity. To hide privacy, each party randomly selects a coefficient within a range determined by his input integer, and with the assistance of a semi-honest third party TP, all parties secretly calculate the linear combination of their inputs under these coefficients. Once enough linear combinations are collected, TP calculates the GCD of these combinations, which is equal to the GCD of all input integers. To verify the honesty of participants, a quantum zero-knowledge proof sub-protocol is designed. Analysis shows that our GCD protocol is correct and has security against malicious attacks. Moreover, its complexity is polynomial level and lower than Imran's. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our GCD protocol in private set operations, such as private set intersection, private set intersection cardinality, private multi-set intersection, etc.

TI Quantum Representations and Scaling Up Algorithms of Adaptive
   Sampled-Data in Log-Polar Coordinates
SO ENTROPY
AB In log-polar coordinates, the conventional data sampling method is to sample uniformly in the log-polar radius and polar angle directions, which makes the sample at the fovea of the data denser than that of the peripheral. The central oversampling phenomenon of the conventional sampling method gives no more efficient information and results in computational waste. Fortunately, the adaptive sampling method is a powerful tool to solve this problem in practice, so the paper introduces it to quantum data processing. In the paper, the quantum representation model of adaptive sampled data is proposed first, in which the upper limit of the sampling number of the polar angles is related to the log-polar radius. Owing to this characteristic, its preparation process has become relatively complicated. Then, in order to demonstrate the practicality of the model given in the paper, the scaling up algorithm with an integer scaling ratio based on biarcuate interpolation and its circuit implementation of quantum adaptive sampled data is given. However, due to the special properties of the adaptive sampling method in log-polar coordinates, the interpolation process of adaptive sampled data becomes quite complicated as well. At the end of this paper, the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by a numerical example.

TI Projected state ensemble of a generic model of many-body quantum chaos
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The projected ensemble is based on the study of the quantum state of a subsystem A conditioned on projective measurements in its complement. Recent studies have observed that a more refined measure of the thermalization of a chaotic quantum system can be defined on the basis of convergence of the projected ensemble to a quantum state design, i.e. a system thermalizes when it becomes indistinguishable, up to the kth moment, from a Haar ensemble of uniformly distributed pure states. Here we consider a random unitary circuit with the brick-wall geometry and analyze its convergence to the Haar ensemble through the frame potential and its mapping to a statistical mechanical problem. This approach allows us to highlight a geometric interpretation of the frame potential based on the existence of a fluctuating membrane, similar to those appearing in the study of entanglement entropies. At large local Hilbert space dimension q, we find that all moments converge simultaneously with a time scaling linearly in the size of region A, a feature previously observed in dual unitary models. However, based on the geometric interpretation, we argue that the scaling at finite q on the basis of rare membrane fluctuations, finding the logarithmic scaling of design times t(k)=O(log k). Our results are supported with numerical simulations performed at q = 2.

TI Analytical Energy Gradient for State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized
   Variational Quantum Eigensolvers and Its Application to a Photochemical
   Reaction
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Elucidating photochemical reactions is vital to understanding various biochemical phenomena and developing functional materials such as artificial photosynthesis and organic solar cells, albeit with notorious difficulty in both experiments and theories. The best theoretical way so far to analyze photochemical reactions at the level of ab initio electronic structure is the state-averaged multiconfigurational self-consistent field (SA-MCSCF) method. However, the exponential computational cost of classical computers with the increasing number of molecular orbitals hinders applications of SA-MCSCF for large systems we are interested in. Utilizing quantum computers was recently proposed as a promising approach to overcome such computational cost, dubbed as state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE). Here, we extend a theory of SA-OO-VQE so that analytical gradients of energy can be evaluated by standard techniques that are feasible with near-term quantum computers. The analytical gradients, known only for the state-specific OO-VQE in previous studies, allow us to determine various characteristics of photochemical reactions such as the conical intersection (CI) points. We perform a proof-of-principle calculation of our methods by applying it to the photochemical cis-trans isomerization of 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene. Numerical simulations of quantum circuits and measurements can correctly capture the photochemical reaction pathway of this model system, including the CI points. Our results illustrate the possibility of leveraging quantum computers for studying photochemical reactions.

TI Morphing Quantum Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a morphing procedure that can be used to generate new quantum codes from existing quantum codes. In particular, we morph the 15-qubit Reed-Muller code to obtain a [[10,1,2]] code that is the smallest-known stabilizer code with a fault-tolerant logical T gate. In addition, we construct a family of hybrid color-toric codes by morphing the color code. Our code family inherits the fault-tolerant gates of the original color code, implemented via constant-depth local unitaries. As a special case of this construction, we obtain toric codes with fault-tolerant multiqubit control-Z gates. We also provide an efficient decoding algorithm for hybrid color-toric codes in two dimensions and numerically benchmark its performance for phase-flip noise. We expect that morphing may also be a useful technique for modifying other code families such as triorthogonal codes.

TI Quantum measurement incompatibility in subspaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the question of characterizing the incompatibility of sets of high-dimensional quantum measurements. We introduce the concept of measurement incompatibility in subspaces. That is, starting from a set of measurements that is incompatible, one considers the set of measurements obtained by projection onto any strict subspace of fixed dimension. We identify three possible forms of incompatibility in subspaces: (i) incompressible incompatibility-measurements that become compatible in every subspace, (ii) fully compressible incompatibility-measurements that remain incompatible in every subspace, and (iii) partly compressible incompatibility-measurements that are compatible in some subspace and incompatible in another. For each class, we discuss explicit examples. Finally, we present some applications of these ideas. First, we show that joint measurability and coexistence are two inequivalent notions of incompatibility in the simplest case of qubit systems. Second, we highlight the implications of our results for tests of quantum steering.

TI Ultrafast dynamics of cold Fermi gas after a local quench
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider nonequilibrium dynamics of two initially independent reservoirs A and B filled with a cold Fermi gas coupled and decoupled by two quantum quenches following one another. We find that the von Neumann entropy production induced by the quench is faster than thermal transport between the reservoirs and defines the short-time dynamics of the system. We analyze the energy change in the system which adds up the heat transferred between A and B and the work done by the quench to uncouple the reservoirs. In the case when A and B interact for a short time, we notice an energy increase in both reservoirs upon decoupling. This energy gain results from the quench's work and does not depend on the initial temperature imbalance between the reservoirs. We relate the quench's work to the mutual correlations of A and B expressed through their von Neumann entropies. Utilizing this relation, we show that once A and B become coupled, their entropies grow (on a timescale of the Fermi time) faster than the heat flow within the system. This result may provide a track of quantum correlations' generation at finite temperatures which one may probe in ultracold atoms, where we expect the characteristic timescale of correlations' growth to be -0.1 ms.

TI Non-Pauli errors in the three-dimensional surface code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A powerful feature of stabilizer error correcting codes is the fact that stabilizer measurement projects arbitrary errors to Pauli errors, greatly simplifying the physical error correction process as well as classical simulations of code performance. However, logical non-Clifford operations can map Pauli errors to non-Pauli (Clifford) errors, and while subsequent stabilizer measurements will project the Clifford errors back to Pauli errors the resulting distributions will possess additional correlations that depend on both the nature of the logical operation and the structure of the code. Previous work has studied these effects when applying a transversal T gate to the three-dimensional color code and shown the existence of a nonlocal "linking charge" phenomenon between membranes of intersecting errors. In this paper we generalise these results to the case of a CCZ gate in the three-dimensional surface code and find that many aspects of the problem are much more easily understood in this setting. In particular, the emergence of linking charge is a local effect rather than a nonlocal one. We use the relative simplicity of Clifford errors in this setting to simulate their effect on the performance of a single-shot magic state preparation process and find that their effect on the threshold is largely determined by probability of X errors occurring immediately prior to the application of the gate, after the most recent stabilizer measurement.

TI Self-Assembling Families of LC Ladder Circuits With Frequency-Controlled
   Growth
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A family of LC ladder circuits is analyzed with an abstract model for growth in a diverse set of systems, with possible applications to biological organisms, self-assembly of nanostructures, models of topological insulators, and classical simulation of quantum circuits. In the LC circuit tile assembly model (lc-CTAM), tiles of inductors and capacitors attach to a growing assembly if the magnitude of the electric node potential at the tip is greater than a threshold. The frequency response, including poles and zeros, and time and space behavior of the node potentials are characterized as a function of length and the circuit parameters. When a resistance is present, growth is always bounded. As the resistance goes to zero, growth is bounded for low frequencies. At higher frequencies, growth can be both bounded or unbounded, depending on frequency and circuit parameters. In some instances, the distribution of node potentials as a function of length exhibits complex, aperiodic behavior. Both the lc-CTAM model and the methods used to analyze it, including Chebyshev polynomials, are a novel application of lumped circuit analysis. Through exact mathematical characterization, the lc-CTAM demonstrates how complex behavior can arise from simple systems, has the potential to inform investigations of biological growth, and may assist in the design of new materials and computational paradigms.

TI Graphene-Enhanced Single Ion Detectors for Deterministic Near-Surface
   Dopant Implantation in Diamond
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Diamond color centers with applications to single photon sources, quantum computation, and magnetic field sensing down to the nanoscale have been investigated using ensembles of near-surface implanted atoms. Deterministic ion implantation for ions stopping between 30 and 130 nm deep is demonstrated by configuring an electronic-grade diamond substrate with a biased surface graphene electrode connected to charge sensitive electronics. The thin graphene electrode has a negligible surface dead layer, so implantation events are signaled from the drift of electron-hole pairs induced by the dissipation of ion kinetic energy in the substrate. Ion beam induced charge maps from a scanned 1 MeV He microbeam show the graphene electrode is highly effective with a charge collection efficiency up to 86% compared to an O-terminated diamond surface of 30%. For lower energy ions, applicable to near surface implantation, single ion detection confidence is >99(1)% for 19.5 keV H and 85(2)% for 24 keV N ions to allow maps of device surface features by employing a focused ion beam microscope or an atomic force microscope cantilever incorporating a nanostencil beam collimator. In the near-term, this system can be used to investigate the annealing dynamics for the conversion of single implanted ions into diamond color centers.

TI Simulation of Circular Dichroism in a Three-Layer Complementary Chiral
   Metasurface
SO PHOTONICS
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection sensors have significant potential for applications in quantum communication and biosensing. In this work, we propose a three-layer complementary chiral metasurface (TCCM) for on-chip integration in the mid-infrared range (2-6 mu m). The TCCM consists of an Al nanorod layer, a SiO2 dielectric layer, and an Al nanoslit layer, with strong circular dichroism (CD) achieved through the symmetry breaking of the inclined rectangular rods. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation results demonstrate that the electric fields excited by left circularly polarized (LCP) light and right circularly polarized (RCP) light exhibit different bonding and antibonding modes, which explains the CD mechanism. The CD response and spectral tunability are influenced by the angle and length of the inclined rectangular rods. Through simulation optimization of structural parameters, a maximum CD value of 0.72 is achieved. Compared to traditional multilayer chiral metasurfaces, the TCCM simplifies the fabrication process. These findings provide valuable insights and practical strategies for the development of compact infrared devices, particularly in optical communication, chiral sensing, and full-Stokes polarization detection.

TI Enhancing dark excitons in monolayer WSe2 via strain-induced
   hybridization with defect states
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Dark excitons in group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have garnered significant interest due to their extended charge lifetime, spin lifetime, and diffusion length compared to bright excitons, presenting exciting opportunities for quantum communication and optoelectronic devices. However, their optical insensitivity poses challenges for investigation and manipulation. Here, we employ a strain engineering approach to introduce localized strain in monolayer WSe2 using a substrate with prepatterned holes, resulting in the hybridization of dark excitons with bright defect states. This hybridization significantly enhances photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduces the linewidths of dark excitons by orders of magnitude. Additionally, the hybridized states exhibit unique features in temperature-dependent and linearly polarized PL spectra, with stable localization across a broad excitation power range (up to 0.4 mW) and tunable circular polarization under a magnetic field (87% at -9 T). These findings underscore strain engineering as an effective method for enhancing dark excitons and provide new insights into exciton physics in TMDCs, paving the way for advanced optoelectronic technologies.

TI Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide
   QED
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We study the generation and control of genuine tripartite entanglement among quantum emitters (QEs) that are side-coupled to one-dimensional spin-momentum locked (or chiral) waveguides. By applying the machinery of Fock state master equations along with the recently proposed concurrence fill measure of tripartite entanglement [S. Xie and J. H. Eberly, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 040403 (2021)], we analyze how three-photon Gaussian wavepackets can distribute entanglement among two and three QEs. We show that with a five times larger waveguide decay rate in the right direction as compared to the left direction, the maximum value of tripartite entanglement can be elevated by 35% as compared to the symmetric scenario where both left, and right direction decay rates are equal. Additionally, chirality can maintain the tripartite entanglement for longer than the corresponding symmetric decay rate. Finally, we study the influence of detunings and spontaneous emission on the resulting entanglement. We envision quantum networking and long-distance quantum communication as two main areas of applications of this work.

TI Gatemonium: A Voltage-Tunable Fluxonium
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a new style of fluxonium qubit, gatemonium, based on an all-superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platform. The linear inductance is achieved using 600 planar Al-InAs Josephson junctions (JJs) in series. By tuning the single junction with a gate voltage, we demonstrate electrostatic control of the effective Josephson energy, tuning the weight of the fictitious phase particle. One- and two-tone spectroscopy of the gatemonium transitions further reveal details of the hybrid plasmon-fluxon spectrum. Accounting for the nonsinusoidal current-phase relation of the single junction, we fit the measured spectra to extract charging and inductive energies. We conduct time-domain characterization of the plasmon modes and find that energy-relaxation times are limited by inductive loss, possibly in the thin aluminum film. We discuss future directions for this platform in gate-voltage-tunable high-plasma-frequency enhanced-impedance junction arrays, and enhanced coherence times for voltage-tunable architectures.

TI Unveiling the Markovian to non-Markovian transition with quantum
   collision models
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB The concept of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems is traditionally associated with the existence of information backflows from the environment to the system. Meanwhile, the mechanisms through which such backflows emerge are still a subject of debate. In this work, we use collision models to study memory effects in the dynamics of a qubit system in contact with a thermal bath made up of few ancillas, in which system-ancilla and ancilla-ancilla interactions are considered. In the single-ancilla limit case, we show that the system-bath information flow exhibits an interesting mixture of chaotic and regular oscillatory behavior, which depends on the interaction probabilities. In parallel, our results clearly indicate that the information backflows decrease when new ancillas are added to the bath, which sheds light on the nature of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition.

We assess the effects of temperature as a dynamic knob for the transition from the insulating to the metallic phase on the TM SP modes in single-band (SB) and two-band (TB) transitions. We show that a VO2 substrate leads to TM SP modes in both SB and TB transitions. In addition, we observe that the SP modes have a lower frequency than those for a substrate of constant permittivity. In addition, we study the influence of the substrate-induced band gap delta ' on SP modes in TB transitions for the insulating and metallic phases of VO2.

TI Efficient bond-adaptive approach for finite-temperature open quantum
   dynamics using the one-site time-dependent variational principle for
   matrix product states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recent tensor network techniques for simulating system-environment wave functions have provided profound insights into non-Markovian dissipation and decoherence in open quantum systems. Here, we propose a dynamically adaptive one-site time-dependent-variational-principle (A1TDVP) method for matrix product states in which local bond dimensions grow to capture developing system-bath entanglement. This avoids the need for multiple convergence runs with respect to bond dimensions and the unfavorable local Hilbert space scaling of two-site methods. A1TDVP is thus ideally suited for open quantum dynamics in finite-temperature bosonic environments, as the initial states typically have low bond dimension but require very large local physical dimensions. We demonstrate this with simulations of nonequilibrium heat flows through a qubit spin, finding a 30 x and 10 x speed-up over 2TDVP and 1TDVP, respectively.

TI Bounds on fluctuations for finite-time quantum Otto cycle
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB For quantum Otto engine driven quasistatically, we provide exact full statistics of heat and work for a class of working fluids that follow a scale-invariant energy eigenspectra under driving. Equipped with the full statistics we go on to derive a universal expression for the ratio of nth cumulant of output work and input heat in terms of the mean Otto efficiency. Furthermore, for nonadiabatic driving of quantum Otto engine with working fluid consisting of either a (i) qubit or (ii) a harmonic oscillator, we show that the relative fluctuation of output work is always greater than the corresponding relative fluctuation of input heat absorbed from the hot bath. As a result, the ratio between the work fluctuation and the input heat fluctuation receives a lower bound in terms of the square value of the average efficiency of the engine. The saturation of the lower bound is received in the quasistatic limit of the engine.

TI Pressure-Dependent Superconductivity in Topological Dirac Semimetal
   SrCuBi
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The discovery of superconducting states in diverse topological materials generates a burgeoning interest to explore a topological superconductor and to realize a fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. A variety of routes to realize topological superconductors are proposed, and many types of topological materials are developed. However, a pristine topological material with a natural superconducting state is relatively rare as compared to topological materials with artificially induced superconductivity. Here, it is reported that the planar honeycomb structured 3D topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) SrCuBi, which is the Zintl phase, shows a natural surface superconductivity at 2.1 K under ambient pressure. It is clearly identified from theoretical calculations that a topologically nontrivial state exists on the (100) surface. Further, its superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases by applying pressure, exhibiting a maximal Tc of 4.8 K under 6.2 GPa. It is believed that this discovery opens up a new possibility of exploring exotic Majorana fermions at the surface of 3D TDS superconductors.
   Superconductivity of topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) SrCuBi with planar honeycomb layer structure is reported. The surface superconductivity at the edge of SrCuBi TDS is induced by the symmetry breaking of the honeycomb layered structure. High pressure enhances the superconducting transition temperature up to 4.8 K under 6.2 GPa, where the non-s-wave unconventional superconductivity emerges. image

TI Operation of distribution network: Challenges and opportunities in the
   era of peer-to-peer trading
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB In recent years, the attention of researchers has been drawn to identifying and investigating new optimal approaches for operation of the distribution networks (ODNs) and the role of various players including distribution system operators in ODNs. This attention is due to the expansion of distributed resources changes in the role of end consumers and the expansion of local markets such as peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. Therefore, the challenges related to ODN seem important now, taking into account the changes in the current distribution networks compared to the past, the most important of which is the change in the role of consumers to prosumers and the creation of P2P trading. Hence, in the paper, a review of the effective features in ODNs such as network reconfiguration, mobile energy storage systems, and energy markets is presented, and then the new role of players in ODNs is explored, focusing on P2P trading features. Also, in this paper, we have categorized the challenges of ODN optimization with P2P trading and we have identified the limit behavior modeling of prosumers and policy schedule as research opportunities, and we have given sufficient insights to the researchers by examining them more deeply.

TI Telecom O-Band Quantum Dots Fabricated by Droplet Etching
SO CRYSTALS
AB We present a novel growth technique for fabricating low-density InAs/GaAs quantum dots that emit in the telecom O-band. This method combines local droplet etching on GaAs surfaces using gallium with Stranski-Krastanov growth initiated by InAs deposition. Quantum dots nucleate directly within nanoholes, avoiding the critical layer thickness typical of standard InAs Stranski-Krastanov growth, resulting in larger, low-density quantum dots. InGaAs strain reduction layers further redshift the emission into and beyond the telecom O-band. Photoluminescence spectra show a small energy difference between ground and excited states, while capacitance-voltage spectroscopy reveal small Coulomb blockade energy. Atomic force microscopy analysis indicates that quantum dots formed within nanoholes exhibit a larger volume compared to standard quantum dots. Additionally, these nanohole nucleated quantum dots require less indium to achieve O-band emission and demonstrate comparable or even better homogeneity, as indicated by the full-width at half-maximum. This improved homogeneity, low density, and increased size make these quantum dots particularly suitable for single-photon sources in quantum communication applications.

TI Superconducting Nanostrip Photon-Number-Resolving Detector as an
   Unbiased Random Number Generator
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Detectors capable of resolving the number of photons are essential in many applications, ranging from classic photonics to quantum optics and quantum communication. In particular, photon-number-resolving detectors based on arrays of superconducting nanostrips can offer a high detection efficiency, a low dark count rate, and a recovery time of a few nanoseconds. In this work, we use a detector of this kind for the unbiased generation of random numbers by following two different methods based on the detection of photons. In the former, we exploit the property that the light is equally distributed on each strip of the entire detector, whereas in the latter, we exploit the fact that, for a high average number of photons, the parity of the Poisson distribution of the number of photons emitted by the laser tends to be zero. In addition, since these two methods are independent, it is possible to use them at the same time.

SO ENERGIES
AB Smart cities can be made into super-smart cities through IoT devices' implication of energy-efficient 6G. IoT devices are expected to reach fifty billion, but limited information is available regarding the energy-efficient 6G wireless communication standard. This article highlights the key technologies, applications, and trends in the Internet of Things (IoT) for energy-efficient 6G wireless communication in smart cities. The systematic review helped to achieve the aim of the study by considering the 20 articles extracted from databases and Google that fell between 2015 and 2021 and are written in English. The findings identified that quantum communication, blockchain, visible light communication (VLC), 6G brain-computer interface (BCI), symbiotic radio, and others are the key technologies. The applications of IoT technologies and energy-efficient 6G are found in 15 Minute City, Industrial Town, Intelligent Transport systems and others. Furthermore, the trend of using 6G through IoT devices in smart cities is promising.

TI Surface science motivated by heating of trapped ions from the quantum
   ground state
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB For the past two and a half decades, anomalous heating of trapped ions from nearby electrode surfaces has continued to demonstrate unexpected results. Caused by electric-field noise, this heating of the ions' motional modes remains an obstacle for scalable quantum computation with trapped ions. One of the anomalous features of this electric-field noise is the reported nonmonotonic behavior in the heating rate when a trap is incrementally cleaned by ion bombardment. Motivated by this result, the present work reports on a surface analysis of a sample ion-trap electrode treated similarly with incremental doses of Ar+ ion bombardment. Kelvin probe force microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to investigate how the work functions on the electrode surface vary depending on the residual contaminant coverage between each treatment. It is shown that the as-fabricated Au electrode is covered with a hydrocarbon film that is modified after the first treatment, resulting in work functions and core-level binding energies that resemble that of atomic-like carbon on Au. Changes in the spatial distribution of work functions with each treatment, combined with a suggested phenomenological coverage and surface-potential roughness dependence to the heating, appear to be related to the nonmonotonic behavior previously reported.

TI Interference Measurements of Non-Abelian e/4 & Abelian e/2 Quasiparticle
   Braiding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The quantum Hall states at filling factors v = 5/2 and 7/2 are expected to have Abelian charge-e/2 quasiparticles and non-Abelian charge-e/4 quasiparticles. The non-Abelian statistics of the latter is predicted to display a striking interferometric signature, the even-odd effect. By measuring resistance oscillations as a function of the magnetic field in Fabry-Pcrot interferometers using new high-purity heterostructures, we for the first time report experimental evidence for the non-Abelian nature of excitations at v = 7/2. At both v = 5/2 and 7/2, we also examine, for the first time, the fermion parity, a topological quantum number of an even number of non-Abelian quasiparticles. The phase of observed e/4 oscillations is reproducible and stable over long times (hours) near both filling factors, indicating stability of the fermion parity. At both fractions, when phase fluctuations are observed, they are predominantly pi phase flips, consistent with either fermion parity change or change in the number of the enclosed e/4 quasiparticles. We also examine lower-frequency oscillations attributable to Abelian interference processes in both states. Taken together, these results constitute new evidence for the non-Abelian nature of e/4 quasiparticles; the observed lifetime of their combined fermion parity further strengthens the case for their utility for topological quantum computation.

TI Third-harmonic generation of spatially structured light in a
   quasi-periodically poled crystal
SO OPTICA
AB Nonlinear optical processes of spatially structured light such as optical vortices and vector optical fields have exhibited many interesting physical effects and found a variety of important applications from classical to quantum regimes. However, high-harmonic generation of a vector optical field with a space-varying polarization state is still a challenge. Here we present a solution to realize third-harmonic generation of spatially structured light including vector optical fields in a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer containing only one carefully designed quasi-periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate, for the first time, to our knowledge. The experimental results well confirm our theoretical predictions. Our results will enable to manipulate spatially structured light or photons carrying higher orbital angular momentum at new wavelengths. Our scheme has potential applications such as in optical skyrmions and may open up new opportunities to produce spatially structured entangled photons for quantum communication and computation.

TI Entanglement-assisted capacity regions and protocol designs for quantum
   multiple-access channels
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We solve the entanglement-assisted (EA) classical capacity region of quantum multiple-access channels (MACs) with an arbitrary number of senders. As an example, we consider the bosonic thermal-loss MAC and solve the one-shot capacity region enabled by an entanglement source composed of sender-receiver pairwise two-mode squeezed vacuum states. The EA capacity region is strictly larger than the capacity region without entanglement-assistance. With two-mode squeezed vacuum states as the source and phase modulation as the encoding, we also design practical receiver protocols to realize the entanglement advantages. Four practical receiver designs, based on optical parametric amplifiers, are given and analyzed. In the parameter region of a large noise background, the receivers can enable a simultaneous rate advantage of 82.0% for each sender. Due to teleportation and superdense coding, our results for EA classical communication can be directly extended to EA quantum communication at half of the rates. Our work provides a unique and practical network communication scenario where entanglement can be beneficial.

TI High-Fidelity Artificial Quantum Thermal State Generation Using Encoded
   Coherent States
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum steganography is a powerful method for information security where communication between a sender and receiver is disguised as naturally occurring noise in a channel. A candidate resource state required for implementing quantum steganography is a weak coherent state engineered with modulated phase and amplitude values drawn from probability distributions that result in a mixed state indistinguishable from a thermal state. We experimentally demonstrate the construction of this resource state by encoding the phase and amplitude of weak coherent laser states such that a third party monitoring the communication channel, measuring the flow of optical states through the channel, would see an amalgamation of states indistinguishable from thermal noise light such as that from spontaneous emission. Using quantum state tomography, we experimentally reconstructed the density matrices for the artificially engineered thermal states and spontaneous emission from an optical amplifier and verified a mean state fidelity $F=0.98$ when compared with theoretical thermal states.

TI Band gap engineering and controlling transport properties of single
   photons in periodic and disordered Jaynes-Cummings arrays
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We theoretically study the single-photon transport properties in periodic and position-disordered Jaynes- Cummings (or JC) arrays of waveguide-coupled microtoroidal ring resonators, each interacting with a single two-level quantum emitter. Employing the real-space formalism of quantum optics, we focus on various parameter regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to gain better control of single-photon propagation in such a many-body quantum optical setting. As for some of the key findings, we observe that the periodic setting leads to the formation of the band structure in the photon transmission spectra, which is most evident in the strong coupling regime of cQED. However, under resonant conditions with no losses, the application of Bloch's theorem indicates that the width of forbidden gaps can be altered by tuning the emitter-cavity coupling to small values. Moreover, in the disordered case, we find that the single-photon transmission curves show the disappearance of band formation. However, spectral features originating from cQED interactions observed for the single atomcavity problem remain robust against weak-disordered conditions. The results of this work may find application in the study of quantum many-body effects in the optical domain as well as in different areas of quantum computation and quantum networking.

TI Epitaxial Pb on InAs nanowires for quantum devices
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Semiconductor-superconductor hybrids are used for realizing complex quantum phenomena but are limited in the accessible magnetic field and temperature range. Now, hybrid devices made from InAs nanowires and epitaxially matched, single-crystal, atomically flat Pb films present superior characteristics, doubling the available parameter space.
   Semiconductor-superconductor hybrids are widely used to realize complex quantum phenomena, such as topological superconductivity and spins coupled to Cooper pairs. Accessing new, exotic regimes at high magnetic fields and increasing operating temperatures beyond the state-of-the-art requires new, epitaxially matched semiconductor-superconductor materials. One challenge is the generation of favourable conditions for heterostructural formation between materials with the desired properties. Here we harness an increased knowledge of metal-on-semiconductor growth to develop InAs nanowires with epitaxially matched, single-crystal, atomically flat Pb films with no axial grain boundaries. These highly ordered heterostructures have a critical temperature of 7 K and a superconducting gap of 1.25 meV, which remains hard at 8.5 T, and therefore they offer a parameter space more than twice as large as those of alternative semiconductor-superconductor hybrids. Additionally, InAs/Pb island devices exhibit magnetic field-driven transitions from a Cooper pair to single-electron charging, a prerequisite for use in topological quantum computation. Semiconductor-Pb hybrids potentially enable access to entirely new regimes for a number of different quantum systems.

TI Micro-transfer printing of InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiode on Si
   substrate
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We report on the fabrication and micro-transfer printing (mu -TP) of InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes (APDs) onto silicon substrates. A process flow was developed to suspend the devices using semiconductor tethers. The developed process reduces the number of fabrication steps required compared to methods based on the use of photoresist tethers. Furthermore, our process is compatible with devices that may be susceptible to damage induced by the photoresist removal process. APDs were characterised in linear mode operation both before suspension and after printing. Despite the additional fabrication steps required to suspend the APD membranes and the physical nature of the mu -TP process, the electrical characteristics of the devices were preserved. No degradation in the optical performance of the devices was measured. Our work represents the first demonstration of mu -TP of InGaAs/InP APDs onto silicon substrates. The results highlight the viability of mu -TP for effective heterogeneous integration of InGaAs/InP APDs with silicon photonic integrated circuits for optical and quantum communication and other light detection applications.

TI Remotely Pumped GHz Antibunched Emission from Single Exciton Centers in
   GaAs
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Quantum communication networks require on-chip transfer and manipulation of single particles as well as their interconversion to single photons for long-range information exchange. Flying excitons propelled by GHz surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are outstanding messengers to fulfill these requirements. Here, we demonstrate the acoustic manipulation of single exciton centers consisting of individual excitons bound to shallow impurity centers embedded in a semiconductor quantum well. Time-resolved photoluminescence studies show that the emission intensity and energy from these centers oscillate at the SAW frequency of 3.5 GHz. Furthermore, these centers can be remotely pumped via acoustic transport of flying excitons along a quantum well channel over several microns. Time correlation studies reveal that the centers emit antibunched light, thus acting as single-photon sources operating at GHz frequencies. Our results pave the way for the exciton-based on-demand manipulation and on-chip transfer of single excitons at microwave frequencies with a natural photonic interface.

TI On-Surface Synthesis of Chiral Graphene Nanoribbon Segments via the
   Quarter-Anthryl on Au(111) Surface
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Quarteranthene is predicted to manifest nontrivial edge states as the competition from the hybridization of localized frontier states and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons, which hosts much research potential in memory, spintronic devices fabrication, and quantum computation. The fabrication of ribbon-like structures with up-mentioned edge states, such as chiral graphene nanoribbon, possesses a high significance in the topological phase transition investigation. However, the synthesis of chiral graphene nanoribbon is limited in reactive substrate or with the edge-brominated precursor. Here, the fabrication of quarteranthene and its chiral graphene nanoribbon segment on Au(111) substrate is reported. A combined bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy characterization, and corresponding density functional theory calculations confirm the chemical structure of fabricated products on the Au(111) substrate. The detailed analysis of the laterally extended products reveals that the lateral-extended structures are acquired via the linkage of the hydrocarbon quarter-anthryl. In addition, several strategies are used to modulate the yield of quarteranthene and its lateral-extended products. These findings provide a new insight into the lateral extension strategy on metal substrates and provide another possible fabrication strategy of chiral graphene nanoribbons on the relative inert Au(111) substrate.

TI Constraints on magic state protocols from the statistical mechanics of
   Wigner negativity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Magic states are key ingredients in schemes to realize universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. Theories of magic states attempt to quantify this computational element via monotones and determine how these states may be efficiently transformed into useful forms. Here, we develop a statistical mechanical framework based on majorization to describe Wigner negative magic states for qudits of odd prime dimension processed under Clifford circuits. We show that majorization allows us to both quantify disorder in the Wigner representation and derive upper bounds for magic distillation. These bounds are shown to be tighter than other bounds, such as from mana and thauma, and can be used to incorporate hardware physics, such as temperature dependence and system Hamiltonians. We also show that a subset of single-shot Renyi entropies remain well-defined on quasi-distributions, are fully meaningful in terms of data processing and can acquire negative values that signal magic. We find that the mana of a magic state is the measure of divergence of these Renyi entropies as one approaches the Shannon entropy for Wigner distributions, and discuss how distillation lower bounds could be obtained in this setting. This use of majorization for quasi-distributions could find application in other studies of non-classicality, and raises nontrivial questions in the context of classical statistical mechanics.

TI Observation of robust edge superconductivity in Fe(Se,Te) under strong
   magnetic perturbation
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB The iron-chalcogenide high temperature superconductor Fe(Se,Te) (FST) has been reported to exhibit complex magnetic ordering and nontrivial band topology which may lead to novel superconducting phenomena. However, the recent studies have so far been largely concentrated on its band and spin structures while its mesoscopic electronic and magnetic response, crucial for future device applications, has not been explored experimentally. Here, we used scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy for its sensitivity to both local diamagnetic susceptibility and current distribution in order to image the superfluid density and supercurrent in FST. We found that in FST with 10% interstitial Fe, whose magnetic structure was heavily disrupted, bulk superconductivity was significantly suppressed whereas edge still preserved strong superconducting diamagnetism. The edge dominantly carried super current despite of a very long magnetic penetration depth. The temperature dependences of the super fluid density and supercurrent distribution were distinctively different between the edge and the bulk. Our Heisenberg modeling showed that magnetic dopants stabilize anti-ferromagnetic spin correlation along the edge, which may contribute towards its robust superconductivity. Our observations hold implication for FST as potential platforms for topological quantum computation and superconducting spintronics.

TI Absolute Dimensionality of Quantum Ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The dimension of a quantum state is traditionally seen as the number of superposed distinguishable states in a given basis. We propose an absolute, i.e., basis-independent, notion of dimensionality for ensembles of quantum states. It is based on whether a quantum ensemble can be simulated with states confined to arbitrary lower-dimensional subspaces and classical postprocessing. In order to determine the absolute dimension of quantum ensembles, we develop both analytical witness criteria and a semidefinite programming criterion based on the ensemble's information capacity. Furthermore, we construct explicit simulation models for arbitrary ensembles of pure quantum states subject to white noise, and in natural cases we prove their optimality. Also, efficient numerical methods are provided for simulating generic ensembles. Finally, we discuss the role of absolute dimensionality in high-dimensional quantum information processing.

TI Entropic uncertainty principle for mixed states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The entropic uncertainty principle in the form proven by Maassen and Uffink yields a fundamental inequality that is prominently used in many places all over the field of quantum information theory. In this paper, we provide a family of versatile generalizations of this relation. Our proof methods build on a deep connection between entropic uncertainties and interpolation inequalities for the doubly stochastic map that links probability distributions in two measurement bases. In contrast to the original relation, our generalization also incorporates the von Neumann entropy of the underlying quantum state. These results can be directly used to bound the extractable randomness of a source-independent quantum random number generator in the presence of fully quantum attacks, to certify entanglement between trusted parties, or to bound the entanglement of a system with an untrusted environment.

TI Characterization of two-photon interference between a weak coherent
   state and a heralded single photon state
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We experimentally investigate two-photon interference between a weak coherent state and a heralded single-photon state, producing from a spontaneous parametric down conversion. Both the unequal spectrum linewidth and average photon number ratio in a given time interval are considered in our model. We obtained excellent agreement between our experimental data and prediction from our model. Furthermore, the range of observing high visibility two -photon interference is significantly extended by isolating coincidence events from two-photon contributions in the weak coherent state. These results may throw some new light on quantum information technology when the two-photon interference with independent sources is required.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Deterministic N-photon state generation using lithium niobate on
   insulator device
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB The large-photon-number quantum state is a fundamental but nonresolved request for practical quantum information applications. We propose an N-photon state generation scheme that is feasible and scalable, using lithium niobate on insulator circuits. Such a scheme is based on the integration of a common building block called photon-number doubling unit (PDU) for deterministic single-photon parametric downconversion and upconversion. The PDU relies on a 10(7)-optical-quality-factor resonator and mW-level on-chip power, which is within the current fabrication and experimental limits. N-photon state generation schemes, with cluster and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state as examples, are shown for different quantum tasks.

TI The Role of Biophysical Factors in Organ Development: Insights from
   Current Organoid Models
SO BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB Biophysical factors play a fundamental role in human embryonic development. Traditional in vitro models of organogenesis focused on the biochemical environment and did not consider the effects of mechanical forces on developing tissue. While most human tissue has a Young's modulus in the low kilopascal range, the standard cell culture substrate, plasma-treated polystyrene, has a Young's modulus of 3 gigapascals, making it 10,000-100,000 times stiffer than native tissues. Modern in vitro approaches attempt to recapitulate the biophysical niche of native organs and have yielded more clinically relevant models of human tissues. Since Clevers' conception of intestinal organoids in 2009, the field has expanded rapidly, generating stem-cell derived structures, which are transcriptionally similar to fetal tissues, for nearly every organ system in the human body. For this reason, we conjecture that organoids will make their first clinical impact in fetal regenerative medicine as the structures generated ex vivo will better match native fetal tissues. Moreover, autologously sourced transplanted tissues would be able to grow with the developing embryo in a dynamic, fetal environment. As organoid technologies evolve, the resultant tissues will approach the structure and function of adult human organs and may help bridge the gap between preclinical drug candidates and clinically approved therapeutics. In this review, we discuss roles of tissue stiffness, viscoelasticity, and shear forces in organ formation and disease development, suggesting that these physical parameters should be further integrated into organoid models to improve their physiological relevance and therapeutic applicability. It also points to the mechanotransductive Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway as a key player in the interplay between extracellular matrix stiffness, cellular mechanics, and biochemical pathways. We conclude by highlighting how frontiers in physics can be applied to biology, for example, how quantum entanglement may be applied to better predict spontaneous DNA mutations. In the future, contemporary physical theories may be leveraged to better understand seemingly stochastic events during organogenesis.

TI On the Dual Structure of the Schrödinger Dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB This paper elucidates the dual structure of the Schr & ouml;dinger dynamics in two correlated stages; one for the dynamics of "distribution function" and the other for path dynamics. In particular, (1) we derive the real-valued Schr & ouml;dinger equation from scratch in a universal manner without referring to classical mechanics, wave mechanics, nor optics. Also, a realvalued path-integral is formulated as the Green function of the real-valued Schr & ouml;dinger equation, which bears a class of the Wiener measure in contrast to the Feynman path integrals. These derivations naturally lead us to a clear interpretation of the Schr & ouml;dinger equation and function. (2) We then study a quantum stochastic path dynamics in a manner compatible with the Schr & ouml;dinger equation. The relation between them is like the Langevin dynamics and the diffusion equation. Each quantum path describes a "trajectory" in configuration space, representing, for instance, a singly launched electron in the double-slit experiment that leaves a spot one by one at the measurement board. Meanwhile the accumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern as predicted by the absolute square of the Schr & ouml;dinger function. In an analogy to stochastic dynamics, we thus see the global picture of quantum dynamics in a triangle relation between the real-valued Schr & ouml;dinger equation as a pair of coupled diffusion equations, the real-valued path integrals as the quantum mechanical extension of the Feynman-Kac formula, and the quantum stochastic path dynamics represented in the Ito stochastic differential equation. The physical significance of the quantum stochasticity such as the origin of the uncertainty relations, the indirect correlation among the quantum paths, quantum entanglement and detanglement, and so on, are discussed. The self-referential nonlinear interrelationship between the Schr & ouml;dinger functions (regarded as a whole) and the quantum paths (as its parts) is identified to be the ultimate mystery in quantum dynamics.

TI Quantum Congestion Game for Overcrowding Prevention Within Airport
   Common Areas
SO COMPUTERS
AB Quantum game theory merges principles from quantum mechanics with game theory, exploring how quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement can influence strategic decision making. It offers a novel approach to analyzing and optimizing complex systems where traditional game theory may fall short. Congestion of passengers, if considered as a network, may fall into the categories of optimization cases of quantum games. This paper explores the application of quantum potential games to minimize congestion in common areas at airports. The players/passengers of the airport have identical interests and they share the same utility function. A metric is introduced that considers a passenger's visit to a common area by setting their preferences, in order to avoid congestion. Passengers can decide whether to visit a specific common area or choose an alternative. This study demonstrates that the proposed game is a quantum potential game for tackling congestion, with identical interests, ensuring the existence of a Nash equilibrium. We consider passengers to be players that want to ensure their interests. Quantum entanglement is utilized to validate the concept, and the results highlight the effectiveness of this approach. The objective is to ensure that not all passengers select the same common place of the airport to reduce getting crowded; hence, the airborne disease infection probability increases due to overcrowding. Our findings provide a promising framework for optimizing passenger flow and reducing congestion in airport common areas through quantum game theory. We showed that the proposed system is stable by encapsulating the Lyapunov stability. We compared it to a simulated annealing approach to show the efficacy of the quantum game approach. We acknowledge that this framework can be utilized in other disciplines as well. For our future work, we will research different strategies than binary ones to investigate the efficacy of the approach.

TI Parts and Composites of Quantum Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We consider three types of entities for quantum measurements. In order of generality, these types are observables, instruments and measurement models. If alpha and beta are entities, we define what it means for alpha to be a part of beta. This relationship is essentially equivalent to alpha being a function of beta and in this case beta can be employed to measure alpha. We then use the concept to define the coexistence of entities and study its properties. A crucial role is played by a map (alpha) over cap which takes an entity of a certain type to one of a lower type. For example, if I is an instrument, then (I) over cap is the unique observable measured by I. Composite systems are discussed next. These are constructed by taking the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the systems being combined. Composites of the three types of measurements and their parts are studied. Reductions in types to their local components are discussed. We also consider sequential products of measurements. Specific examples of Luders, Kraus and trivial instruments are used to illustrate various concepts. We only consider finite-dimensional systems in this article. Finally, we mention the role of symmetry representations for groups using quantum channels.

TI Entanglement Dynamics of Coupled Quantum Oscillators in Independent
   NonMarkovian Baths
SO ENTROPY
AB This work strives to better understand how the entanglement in an open quantum system, here represented by two coupled Brownian oscillators, is affected by a nonMarkovian environment (with memories), here represented by two independent baths each oscillator separately interacts with. We consider two settings, a 'symmetric' configuration wherein the parameters of both oscillators and their baths are identical, and an 'asymmetric' configuration wherein they are different, in particular, a 'hybrid' configuration, where one of the two coupled oscillators interacts with a nonMarkovian bath and the other with a Markovian bath. Upon finding the solutions to the Langevin equations governing the system dynamics and the evolution of the covariance matrix elements entering into its entanglement dynamics, we ask two groups of questions: (Q1) Which time regime does the bath's nonMarkovianity benefit the system's entanglement most? The answers we get from detailed numerical studies suggest that (A1) For an initially entangled pair of oscillators, we see that in the intermediate time range, the duration of entanglement is proportional to the memory time, and it lasts a fraction of the relaxation time, but at late times when the dynamics reaches a steady state, the value of the symplectic eigenvalue of the partially transposed covariance matrix barely benefit from the bath nonMarkovianity. For the second group of questions: (Q2) Can the memory of one nonMarkovian bath be passed on to another Markovian bath? And if so, does this memory transfer help to sustain the system's entanglement dynamics? Our results from numerical studies of the asymmetric hybrid configuration indicate that (A2) A system with a short memory time can acquire improvement when it is coupled to another system with a long memory time, but, at a cost of the latter. The sustainability of the bipartite entanglement is determined by the party which breaks off entanglement most easily.

TI Dynamics of pseudoentanglement
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure, and can in fact be "forged": recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles - a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement, thus deviating from the "maximum-entropy principle" that underpins thermodynamics. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.

TI A universal constraint for relaxation rates for quantum Markov
   generators: complete positivity and beyond*
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Relaxation rates are key characteristics of quantum processes, as they determine how quickly a quantum system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres, and dissipates. While they play a crucial role in theoretical analyses, relaxation rates are also often directly accessible through experimental measurements. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint: the maximal rate is upper-bounded by the sum of all rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. In this work, we present a new, purely algebraic proof of this constraint. Remarkably, our approach is not only more direct but also allows for a natural generalization beyond completely positive semigroups. We show that complete positivity can be relaxed to two-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint. This reveals that the bound is more subtle than previously understood: two-positivity is necessary, but even when further relaxed to Schwarz maps, a slightly weaker-yet still non-trivial-universal constraint still holds. Finally, we explore the connection between these bounds and the number of steady states in quantum processes, uncovering a deeper structure underlying their behavior.
