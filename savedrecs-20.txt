TI Quantumness beyond entanglement: The case of symmetric states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nowadays, it is accepted that truly quantum correlations can exist even in the absence of entanglement. For the case of symmetric states, a physically trivial unitary transformation can alter a state from entangled to separable, and vice versa. We propose to certify the presence of quantumness via an average of a state's bipartite entanglement properties over all physically relevant modal decompositions. We investigate extremal states for such a measure: SU(2)-coherent states possess the least quantumness, whereas the opposite extreme is inhabited by states with maximally spread Majorana constellations.

TI Search Space Reduction for Efficient Quantum Compilation

AB Quantum computers have demonstrated exponential speedup for certain computational tasks like integer factorization, molecular simulation, and machine learning, compared to the classical computers. One of the most challenging problems in quantum computing is quantum compilation, which involves the translation of a quantum circuit into a representation that adheres to the constraints imposed by the quantum hardware. However, this process of mapping the logical qubits to physical qubits incurs a significantly large search space, which needs to be analyzed to obtain the optimal mapping. A non-optimal mapping or compilation strategy introduces additional hardware overhead, thereby rendering inefficiency. Recently, researchers have proposed a technique to reduce the search space for efficient quantum compilation. However, this approach focuses on a generic solution involving only the physical architecture, and hence, as shown in our paper, often fails to incorporate the optimal solution in the reduced search space. To this end, we propose PERM and SGO (PAS), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first quantum compilation strategy that facilitates a reduced search space comprising a more optimal solution in terms of additional CNOT gates compared to the existing technique. Our experimental evaluation using the MQT benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of our approach, which furnishes up to 428x reduction compared to the unoptimized search space, and 57.1x reduction compared to existing research, while providing savings in terms of additional CNOT gates by up to 53.85%.

TI Entangling quantum logic gates in neutral atoms via the microwave-driven
   spin-flip blockade
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Rydberg dipole blockade has emerged as the standard mechanism to induce entanglement between neutral-atom qubits. In these protocols, laser fields that couple qubit states to Rydberg states are modulated to implement entangling gates. Here we present an alternative protocol to implement entangling gates via Rydberg dressing and a microwave-field-driven spin-flip blockade [Y.-Y. Jau et al., Nat. Phys. 12, 71 (2016)]. We consider the specific example of qubits encoded in the clock states of cesium. An auxiliary hyperfine state is optically dressed so that it acquires partial Rydberg character. It thus acts as a proxy Rydberg state, with a nonlinear light shift that plays the role of blockade strength. A microwave-frequency field coupling a qubit state to this dressed auxiliary state can be modulated to implement entangling gates. Logic gate protocols designed for the optical regime can be imported to this microwave regime, for which experimental control methods are more robust. We show that unlike the strong dipole-blockade regime usually employed in Rydberg experiments, going to a moderate-spin-flip-blockade regime results in faster gates and smaller Rydberg decay. We study various regimes of operations that can yield high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates and characterize their analytical behavior. In addition to the inherent robustness of microwave control, we can design these gates to be more robust to laser amplitude and frequency noises at the cost of a small increase in Rydberg decay.

TI Intermodulation spectroscopy and the nonlinear response of two-level
   systems in superconducting coplanar-waveguide resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Two-level system (TLS) loss typically limits the coherence of superconducting quantum circuits. The loss induced by TLS defects is nonlinear, resulting in quality factors with a strong dependence on the circulating microwave power. We observe frequency mixing due to this nonlinearity by applying a two-tone drive to a coplanar waveguide resonator and measuring the intermodulation products using a multifrequency lock-in technique. This intermodulation spectroscopy method provides an efficient approach to characterizing TLS loss in superconducting circuits. Using harmonic balance reconstruction, we recover the nonlinear parameters of the device-TLS interaction, which are in good agreement with the standard tunneling model for TLSs.

TI High-performance chiral all-optical OR logic gate based on topological
   edge states of valley photonic crystal
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB For all-optical communication and information processing, it is necessary to develop all-optical logic gates based on photonic structures that can directly perform logic operations. All-optical logic gates have been demonstrated based on conventional waveguides and interferometry, as well as photonic crystal structures. Nonetheless, any defects in those structures will introduce high scattering loss, which compromises the fidelity and contrast ratio of the information process. Based on the spin-valley locking effect that can achieve defect-immune unidirectional transmission of topological edge states in valley photonic crystals (VPCs), we propose a high-performance all-optical logic OR gate based on a VPC structure. By tuning the working bandwidth of the two input channels, we prevent interference between the two channels to achieve a stable and high-fidelity output. The transmittance of both channels is higher than 0.8, and a high contrast ratio of 28.8 dB is achieved. Moreover, the chirality of the logic gate originated from the spin-valley locking effect allows using different circularly polarized light as inputs, representing "1" or "0", which is highly desired in quantum computing. The device's footprint is 18 & mu;m x 12 & mu;m, allowing high-density on-chip integration. In addition, this design can be experimentally fabricated using current nanofabrication techniques and will have potential applications in optical communication, information processing, and quantum computing.

TI Quantum-enhanced digital twin IoT for efficient healthcare task
   offloading
SO DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Task offloading frameworks play a crucial role in modern healthcare by optimizing resource utilization, reducing computational burdens, and enabling real-time medical decision-making. However, existing Digital Twin (DT)-based healthcare models suffer from high latency, inefficient resource allocation, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and computational limitations when processing large-scale patient data. These constraints pose significant risks in time-sensitive applications such as ICU monitoring, robotic-assisted surgeries, and telemedicine. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a Quantum-Enhanced DT-IoT framework, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), Quantum Computing (QC), DT, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time, secure, and efficient healthcare task offloading. The proposed system introduces two key optimization algorithms: (1) DTH-ATB-MAPPO, which dynamically adjusts task scheduling and resource distribution, and (2) AQDT-IoT, which enhances computational efficiency and cybersecurity compliance in 6 G-enabled IoT networks. By leveraging Approximate Amplitude Encoding (AAE) and Grover's search, the framework enhances task offloading efficiency, enabling faster decision-making and optimized resource distribution across 6 G-enabled IoT networks. Empirical evaluations show that quantum preprocessing improved Task Offloading Success Rate (TOSR) by 32% and reduced the Error Rate (ER) by 80%, significantly outperforming traditional DT-based healthcare models. These enhancements enable. Additionally, theoretical analysis demonstrates computational speed enhancements, adaptive cybersecurity mechanisms, and improved system scalability, positioning this framework as a viable candidate for future cloud-based quantum healthcare infrastructures, even in resource-constrained hospital environments.

TI A Review of Quantum-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for Automatic
   Clustering
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In real-world scenarios, identifying the optimal number of clusters in a dataset is a difficult task due to insufficient knowledge. Therefore, the indispensability of sophisticated automatic clustering algorithms for this purpose has been contemplated by some researchers. Several automatic clustering algorithms assisted by quantum-inspired metaheuristics have been developed in recent years. However, the literature lacks definitive documentation of the state-of-the-art quantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms for automatically clustering datasets. This article presents a brief overview of the automatic clustering process to establish the importance of making the clustering process automatic. The fundamental concepts of the quantum computing paradigm are also presented to highlight the utility of quantum-inspired algorithms. This article thoroughly analyses some algorithms employed to address the automatic clustering of various datasets. The reviewed algorithms were classified according to their main sources of inspiration. In addition, some representative works of each classification were chosen from the existing works. Thirty-six such prominent algorithms were further critically analysed based on their aims, used mechanisms, data specifications, merits and demerits. Comparative results based on the performance and optimal computational time are also presented to critically analyse the reviewed algorithms. As such, this article promises to provide a detailed analysis of the state-of-the-art quantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, while highlighting their merits and demerits.

In the present review, we introduce the concept of these electron flying qubits, discuss their most promising realisations and show how numerical simulations are applicable to accelerate experimental development cycles. Addressing the technological challenges of flying qubits that are currently faced by academia and quantum enterprises, we underline the relevance of interdisciplinary cooperation to move emerging quantum industry forward. The review consists of two main sections: Pathways towards the electron flying qubit: We address three routes of single-electron transport in GaAs-based devices focusing on surface acoustic waves, hot-electron emission from quantum dot pumps and Levitons. For each approach, we discuss latest experimental results and point out how numerical simulations facilitate engineering the electron flying qubit. Numerical modelling of quantum devices: We review the full stack of numerical simulations needed for fabrication of the flying qubits. Choosing appropriate models, examples of basic quantum mechanical simulations are explained in detail. We discuss applications of open-source (KWANT) and the commercial (nextnano) platforms for modelling the flying qubits. The discussion points out the large relevance of software tools to design quantum devices tailored for efficient operation.

TI Financial fraud detection using a hybrid deep belief network and quantum
   optimization approach
SO DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES
AB In the contemporary global economic landscape, financial fraud represents a significant challenge, resulting in substantial losses for market participants, including business enterprises and financial institutions. This phenomenon has a profound impact on market stability, significantly affecting the management of the economy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel financial fraud detection algorithm that integrates deep belief networks (DBN) with quantum optimisation algorithms. The proposed model employs a hybrid model optimisation strategy that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs).Conventional detection methods depend on manual rules and statistical analyses, which are inadequate for handling large-scale, high-density and complex financial market data. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated potential in addressing these challenges; however, they are often hindered by issues related to computational efficiency and training time. The proposed integrated approach in this paper combines deep learning with quantum computing to overcome these limitations. The hybrid model utilises the parallel processing power of quantum computing to improve the training efficiency of DBNs, while CNNs, LSTMs and GNNs extract features from multiple dimensions of financial market data. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed model's advantages in terms of accuracy, training speed and robustness, providing a promising solution for financial fraud detection.

However, the large amount of medical data involved in BIoMT has also raised concerns about data security and personal privacy protection. To alleviate these concerns, blind signature technology has emerged as an effective method to solve blindness and unforgeability. Unfortunately, most existing blind signature schemes suffer from the security risk of key leakage. In addition, traditional blind signature schemes are also vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Therefore, it remains a crucial and ongoing challenge to explore the construction of key-secure, quantum-resistant blind signatures. In this paper, we introduce lattice- based forward-secure blind signature (LFSBS), a lattice-based forward-secure blind signature scheme for medical privacy preservation in BIoMT. LFSBS achieves forward security by constructing a key evolution mechanism using a binary tree structure. This mechanism ensures that even if future encryption keys are leaked, past data can still remain secure. Meanwhile, LFSBS realizes post-quantum security based on the hardness assumption of small integer solution (SIS), making it resistant to potential quantum computing attacks. In addition, we formally define and prove the security of LFSBS in a random oracle model, including blindness and forward-secure unforgeability. Comprehensive performance evaluation shows that LFSBS performs well in terms of computational overhead, with a reduction of 22%-73% compared to previous schemes.

TI Thermodynamics of General Heisenberg Spin Tetramers Composed of Coupled
   Quantum Dimers
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB Advances in quantum computing technology have been made in recent years due to the evolution of spin clusters. Recent studies have tended towards spin cluster subgeometries to understand more complex structures better. These molecular magnets provide a multitude of phenomena via exchange interactions that allow for advancements in spintronics and other magnetic system applications due to the possibility of increasing speed, data storage, memory, and stability of quantum computing systems. Using the Heisenberg spin-spin exchange Hamiltonian and exact diagonalization, we examine the evolution of quantum energy levels and thermodynamic properties for various spin configurations and exchange interactions. The XXYY quantum spin tetramer considered in this study consists of two coupled dimers with exchange interactions alpha 1J and alpha 1 ' J and a dimer-dimer exchange interaction alpha 2J. By varying spin values and interaction strengths, we determine the exact energy eigenstates that are used to determine closed-form analytic solutions for the heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility of the system and further analyze the evolution of the properties of the system based on the parameter values chosen. Furthermore, this study shows that the Schottky anomaly shifts towards zero as the ground-state of the system approaches a quantum phase transition between spin states. Additionally, we investigate the development of phase transitions produced by the convergence of the Schottky anomaly with both variable exchange interactions and external magnetic field.

TI Micro-Transfer Printed Continuous-Wave and Mode-Locked Laser Integration
   at 800 nm on a Silicon Nitride Platform
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Applications such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), optical atomic clocks, and quantum computing require photonic integration of (near-)visible laser sources to enable commercialization at scale. The heterogeneous integration of III-V optical gain materials with low-loss silicon nitride waveguides enables complex photonic circuits with low-noise lasers on a single chip. Previous such demonstrations are mostly geared toward telecommunication wavelengths. At shorter wavelengths, limited options exist for efficient light coupling between III-V and silicon nitride waveguides. Recent advances in wafer-bonded devices at these wavelengths require complex coupling structures and suffer from poor heat dissipation. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate a wafer-scale micro-transfer printing method integrating functional III-V devices directly onto the silicon substrate of a commercial silicon nitride platform. We show butt-coupling of efficient GaAs-based amplifiers operating at 800 nm with integrated saturable absorbers to silicon nitride cavities. This resulted in extended-cavity continuous-wave and mode-locked lasers generating pulse trains with repetition rates ranging from 3.2 to 9.2 GHz and excellent passive stability with a fundamental radio-frequency linewidth of 519 Hz. These results show the potential to build complex, high-performance, fully-integrated laser systems at 800 nm using scalable manufacturing, promising advances for AR/VR, nonlinear photonics, timekeeping, quantum computing, and beyond.

TI Next Generation Computers Warrant Next Generation Groundwater Models
SO GROUNDWATER
AB Modern hydrologic models have extraordinary capabilities for representing complex process in surface-subsurface systems. These capabilities have revolutionized the way we conceptualize flow systems, but how to represent uncertainty in simulated flow systems is not as well developed. Currently, characterizing model uncertainty can be computationally expensive, in part, because the techniques are appended to the numerical methods rather than seamlessly integrated. The next generation of computers, however, presents opportunities to reformulate the modeling problem so that the uncertainty components are handled more directly within the flow system simulation. Misconceptions about quantum computing abound and they will not be a "silver bullet" for solving all complex problems, but they might be leveraged for certain kinds of highly uncertain problems, such as groundwater (GW). The point of this issue paper is that the GW community could try to revise the foundations of our models so that the governing equations being solved are tailored specifically for quantum computers. The goal moving forward should not just be to accelerate the models we have, but also to address their deficiencies. Embedding uncertainty into the models by evolving distribution functions will make predictive GW modeling more complicated, but doing so places the problem into a complexity class that is highly efficient on quantum computing hardware. Next generation GW models could put uncertainty into the problem at the very beginning of a simulation and leave it there throughout, providing a completely new way of simulating subsurface flows.

TI Magnetic Steganography Based on Wide-Field Diamond Quantum Microscopy
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Magnetic steganography using wide-field quantum microscopy based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is experimentally demonstrated. The method offers magnetic imaging capable of revealing concealed information otherwise invisible with conventional optical measurements. For a proof-of-principle demonstration of magnetic steganography, micrometer structures designed as pixel arts, barcodes, and QR codes are fabricated using mixtures of magnetic and non-magnetic materials: Ni and Au. Three different imaging modes based on the changes in frequency, linewidth, and contrast of the NV's electron spin resonance are compared and find that the last mode offers the best quality for reconstructing hidden magnetic images. By simultaneous driving of the NV's qutrit states with two independent microwave fields, the imaging time is expedited by a factor of three. This work shows potential applications of quantum magnetic imaging in the field of image steganography.

TI Noise-tolerant Grover's algorithm via success-probability prediction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present theoretical and experimental studies on efficient quantum search with noise. We propose a noisetolerant method that significantly reduces the running time and exponentially improves the error threshold with number of qubits for Grover's search. Experiments are implemented on different quantum computing setups, with all results clearly confirming the advantage of our noise-tolerant method to the original Grover's search. In one setup, our method produces quantum advantages while the original Grover's search does not. In another setup with smaller noise, our method produces a larger quantum advantage than the original Grover's search does.

TI Quantum behaved binary gravitational search algorithm with random forest
   for twitter spammer detection
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB The emergence of social media platforms like Twitter has significantly changed the landscape of communication by increasing accessibility for widely disseminating official announcements, professional interactions, and important news in real-time. Despite these advantages, the prevalence of spammers and their spamming activities is increasing regularly. To mitigate the growing number of spammers, it is essential to develop an efficient and robust method for Twitter spammer detection. This research presents a novel QBGSRF method by combining the quantum-behaved binary gravitational search algorithm (QBGSA) with random forest (RF) for timely detection of Twitter spammers. The QBGSA algorithm adds the characteristics of quantum computing (QC) and binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA), which enables the quantum agents to quickly determine solutions using the superposition attributes of QC and the position update via bit-flipping based on velocity probabilities of the BGSA algorithm. In the proposed QBGSRF method, the quantum agents utilize the aforementioned attributes and the principles of the RF algorithm to construct the decision trees for effectively detecting Twitter spammers. The proposed method is assessed for the datasets of 1KS-10KN and Social Honeypot. In order to access the efficacy of the proposed method, the results are also evaluated using the BGSRF method (a combination of BGSA and RF algorithm) and RF algorithm. The experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the aforementioned and state-of-the-art methods.

TI Modern computing: Vision and challenges
SO TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS REPORTS
AB Over the past six decades, the computing systems field has experienced significant transformations, profoundly impacting society with transformational developments, such as the Internet and the commodification of computing. Underpinned by technological advancements, computer systems, far from being static, have been continuously evolving and adapting to cover multifaceted societal niches. This has led to new paradigms such as cloud, fog, edge computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), which offer fresh economic and creative opportunities. Nevertheless, this rapid change poses complex research challenges, especially in maximizing potential and enhancing functionality. As such, to maintain an economical level of performance that meets ever-tighter requirements, one must understand the drivers of new model emergence and expansion, and how contemporary challenges differ from past ones. To that end, this article investigates and assesses the factors influencing the evolution of computing systems, covering established systems and architectures as well as newer developments, such as serverless computing, quantum computing, and on-device AI on edge devices. Trends emerge when one traces technological trajectory, which includes the rapid obsolescence of frameworks due to business and technical constraints, a move towards specialized systems and models, and varying approaches to centralized and decentralized control. This comprehensive review of modern computing systems looks ahead to the future of research in the field, highlighting key challenges and emerging trends, and underscoring their importance in cost-effectively driving technological progress.

TI Blockchain and quantum blind signature-based hybrid scheme for
   healthcare 5.0 applications
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Insurance agencies and digitally recorded healthcare databases can help society to decrease the high-level complexity and the cost of the entire healthcare ecosystem. The general data protection regulation provides the right to its data owner's to know how data is stored, and for which purpose his/her data is being used. However, the healthcare data flow through an open channel, i.e., the Internet, which opens the doors for intruders to perform some malicious activities, such as breach of confidential data, modification in the stored data, etc. So it is a challenging task for the traditional healthcare systems to maintain the security and privacy of the stakeholders. Blockchain is emerged as a technology that improves the efficiency of today's healthcare system and also helps to maintain the security and privacy of all the stakeholders. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we analyse various security architectures used to secure electronic health records (EHRs) and apply Quantum Computing (QC) to the traditional encryption system. Then, we propose a blockchain-based architecture for Healthcare, which allows users to access the data from the database with their defined role. Further, to protect the traditional encryption system from the quantum attacks, the Quantum blind signature is used during the block creation using hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Results show the efficacy of the proposed scheme compared to the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of transaction throughput, resource consumption, and network traffic.

TI Increasing the quantum tunneling probability through a learned
   ancilla-assisted protocol
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Increasing the probability of quantum tunneling between two states, while keeping constant the resources of the underlying physical system, is a task of key importance in several physical contexts and platforms, including ultracold atoms confined by double-well potentials and superconducting qubits. We propose a novel ancillary assisted protocol showing that when a quantum system-such as a qubit-is coupled to an ancilla, one can learn the optimal ancillary component and its coupling, to increase the tunneling probability. As a case study, we consider a quantum system that, due to the presence of an energy detuning between two modes, cannot transfer by tunneling the particles from one mode to the other. However, it does it through a learned coupling with an ancillary system characterized by a detuning not smaller than the one of the primary system. We provide several illustrative examples for the paradigmatic case of a two-mode system and a two-mode ancilla in the presence of interacting particles. This reduces to a qubit coupled to an ancillary qubit in the case of one particle in the system and one in the ancilla. Our proposal provides an effective method to increase the tunneling probability in all those physical situations where no direct improvement of the system parameters, such as tunneling coefficient or energy detuning, is either possible or resource efficient. Finally, we also argue that the proposed strategy is not hampered by weak coupling to noisy environments.

TI Randomizing multi-product formulas for Hamiltonian simulation
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulation, the simulation of quantum processes on quantum computers, suggests a path forward for the efficient simulation of problems in condensed-matter physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. While the majority of quantum simulation algorithms are deterministic, a recent surge of ideas has shown that randomization can greatly benefit algorithmic performance. In this work, we introduce a scheme for quantum simulation that unites the advantages of randomized compiling on the one hand and higher-order multi-product formulas, as they are used for example in linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) algorithms or quantum error mitigation, on the other hand. In doing so, we propose a framework of randomized sampling that is expected to be useful for programmable quantum simulators and present two new multi-product formula algorithms tailored to it. Our framework reduces the circuit depth by circumventing the need for oblivious amplitude amplification required by the implementation of multi-product formulas using standard LCU methods, rendering it especially useful for early quantum computers used to estimate the dynamics of quantum systems instead of performing full-fledged quantum phase estimation. Our algorithms achieve a simulation error that shrinks exponentially with the circuit depth. To corroborate their functioning, we prove rigorous performance bounds as well as the concentration of the randomized sampling procedure. We demonstrate the functioning of the approach for several physically meaningful examples of Hamiltonians, including fermionic systems and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, for which the method provides a favorable scaling in the effort.

TI Strong quantum nonlocality without entanglement in every (n- 1
   )-partition
SO ISCIENCE
AB The orthogonal product set with quantum nonlocality can enhance the confidentiality of information without consuming entanglement resources. The confidentiality increases with the reinforcement of its nonlocality. However, the orthogonal product sets with the strongest nonlocality need an enormous number of quantum states. In this paper, we propose a sufficient condition for orthogonal product set being strongly nonlocal and construct some strongly nonlocal sets in every (n- 1)-partition on n-qudit systems, where n is greater than 3. These newly constructed sets possess stronger properties than nonlocality and reduce the exponential number of required quantum states compared with the strongest nonlocal sets. Our results not only partially answer the open question "how to construct different strength nonlocality of orthogonal product states for general multipartite and high- dimensional quantum systems"but also provide significant theoretical fundamental for quantum secure communication.

TI NISQ-Ready Community Detection Based on Separation-Node Identification
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The analysis of network structure is essential to many scientific areas ranging from biology to sociology. As the computational task of clustering these networks into partitions, i.e., solving the community detection problem, is generally NP-hard, heuristic solutions are indispensable. The exploration of expedient heuristics has led to the development of particularly promising approaches in the emerging technology of quantum computing. Motivated by the substantial hardware demands for all established quantum community detection approaches, we introduce a novel QUBO-based approach that only needs number-of-nodes qubits and is represented by a QUBO matrix as sparse as the input graph's adjacency matrix. The substantial improvement in the sparsity of the QUBO matrix, which is typically very dense in related work, is achieved through the novel concept of separation nodes. Instead of assigning every node to a community directly, this approach relies on the identification of a separation-node set, which, upon its removal from the graph, yields a set of connected components, representing the core components of the communities. Employing a greedy heuristic to assign the nodes from the separation-node sets to the identified community cores, subsequent experimental results yield a proof of concept by achieving an up to 95% optimal solution quality on three established real-world benchmark datasets. This work hence displays a promising approach to NISQ-ready quantum community detection, catalyzing the application of quantum computers for the network structure analysis of large-scale, real-world problem instances.

TI Split-ring polariton condensates as macroscopic two-level quantum
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Superposition states of circular currents of exciton-polaritons mimic the superconducting flux qubits. The phase of a polariton fluid must change by an integer number of 2 pi when going around the ring. If one introduces a pi-phase delay line in the ring, the fluid is obliged to propagate a clockwise or anticlockwise circular current to reduce the total phase gained over one round trip to zero or to build it up to 2 pi. We show that such a pi-delay line can be provided by a dark soliton pinned to a potential well created by a C-shape nonresonant pump spot. The resulting split-ring polariton condensates exhibit pronounced coherent oscillations passing periodically through clockwise and anticlockwise current states. These oscillations may persist far beyond the coherence time of polariton condensates. The qubits based on split-ring polariton condensates are expected to possess very high figures of merit that makes them a valuable alternative to superconducting qubits. The use of the dipole-polarized polaritons allows one to control coherently the state of the qubit with the external electric field. This is shown to be one of the tools for realization of single-qubit logic operations. We propose the design of an iSWAP gate based on a pair of coupled polariton qubits. To demonstrate the capacity of the polariton platform for quantum computations, we propose a protocol for the realization of Deutsch's algorithm with polariton qubit networks.

TI Single-electron spin resonance detection by microwave photon counting
SO NATURE
AB Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is the method of choice for characterizing paramagnetic impurities, with applications ranging from chemistry to quantum computing(1,2), but it gives access only to ensemble-averaged quantities owing to its limited signal-to-noise ratio. Single-electron spin sensitivity has, however, been reached using spin-dependent photoluminescence(3-5), transport measurements(6-9) and scanning-probe techniques(10-12). These methods are system-specific or sensitive only in a small detection volume(13,14), so that practical single-spin detection remains an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate single-electron magnetic resonance by spin fluorescence detection(15), using a microwave photon counter at millikelvin temperatures(16). We detect individual paramagnetic erbium ions in a scheelite crystal coupled to a high-quality-factor planar superconducting resonator to enhance their radiative decay rate(17), with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.9 in one second integration time. The fluorescence signal shows anti-bunching, proving that it comes from individual emitters. Coherence times up to 3 ms are measured, limited by the spin radiative lifetime. The method has the potential to be applied to arbitrary paramagnetic species with long enough non-radiative relaxation times, and allows single-spin detection in a volume as large as the resonator magnetic mode volume (approximately 10 mu m(3) in the present experiment), orders of magnitude larger than other single-spin detection techniques. As such, it may find applications in magnetic resonance and quantum computing.

TI Quantum-Accelerated Feature Selection for Edge-Enabled Perception in
   Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The growing complexity and volume of traffic and sensory data in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) make it crucial to develop more effective methods for selecting and extracting features from high-dimensional images and videos. This paper proposes a novel quantum-accelerated feature selection framework utilising the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to enhance perception tasks in CAV environments. By decomposing high-dimensional traffic images into compact patches encoded as quantum Hamiltonians, the proposed design aims to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) tasks such as object detection, vehicle classification, and traffic monitoring in CAVs. The quantum hybrid method serves as a pipeline for extracting selective features that have been optimised using gradient-aware parameter pruning and conditional principal component analysis (PCA). The implementation of this quantum hybrid approach facilitates addressing computational challenges at the edge in embedded vehicular systems, reducing data dimensionality while preserving key discriminative spatial patterns necessary for object detection and traffic monitoring. Although the quantum method currently underperforms in certain clustering and separability metrics, it demonstrates potential as a viable alternative for advanced perception in CAVs. This work lays a foundation for integrating quantum computing into edge-based autonomous vehicle perception, highlighting both opportunities and challenges with near-term quantum hardware.

TI Coherence, purity and correlation for superconducting charge qubits
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In a model consisting of two superconducting charge qubits (SC-Qs), we study how the Josephson energy (JE) and temperature have an influence on the coherence, the degree of mixedness, and the nonclassical correlation. In this example, we show how the quantumness metrics change depending on the JE and the temperature. We also show that the number of quantifiers can be controlled by appropriate selection of the JE of the SC-Q and temperature effect. Additionally, we determine the optimal conditions required to enhance and preserve the coherence and maintain the level of coherence in the existence of temperature variations. We observe important quantum phenomena, i.e., coherence trapping and the quantum correlation trapping. Furthermore, we explain the variations in the coherence based on the degree of mixedness in the superconducting qubit state.

TI Nonlocal correlations in noisy multiqubit systems simulated using matrix
   product operators
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB We introduce an open-source solver for the Lindblad master equation, based on matrix product states and matrix product operators. Using this solver we study the dynamics of tens of interacting qubits with different connectivities, focusing on a problem where an edge qubit is being continuously driven on resonance, which is a fundamental operation in quantum devices. Because of the driving, induced excitations propagate through the qubits until the system reaches a steady state due to the incoherent terms. We find that with alternating-frequency qubits whose interactions with their off-resonant neighbors appear weak, the tunneling excitations lead to large correlations between distant qubits in the system. Some two-qubit correlation functions are found to increase as a function of distance in the system (in contrast to the typical decay with distance), peaking on the two edge qubits farthest apart from each other.

TI Ghost factors in Gauss-sum factorization with transmon qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A challenge in the Gauss-sum factorization scheme is the presence of ghost factors, nonfactors that behave similarly to actual factors of an integer, which might lead to the misidentification of nonfactors as factors or vice versa, especially in the presence of noise. We investigate type II ghost factors, which are the class of ghost factors that cannot be suppressed with techniques previously laid out in the literature. The presence of type II ghost factors and the coherence time of the qubit set an upper limit for the total experiment time, and hence the largest factorizable number with this scheme. Discernibility is a figure of merit introduced to characterize this behavior. We introduce preprocessing as a strategy to increase the discernibility of a system, and demonstrate the technique with a transmon qubit. This can bring the total experiment time of the system closer to its decoherence limit, and increase the largest factorizable number.

AB Aluminum oxide offers an excellent platform for integrated photonics in the visible and ultraviolet ranges, combining low propagation losses, high index contrast with silica, and strong compatibility with rare earth dopants. This work reports a comprehensive study of 460 nm microring resonators in various configurations. The reported devices, obtained through a commercial multi-project wafer service, exhibit a record intrinsic quality factor of 3.6 x 105 on the aluminum oxide platform. Thermal tuning of the resonances is achieved via integrated metallic heaters, with a tuning efficiency of 1.63 pm/mW over a 500 pm range. These results demonstrate fully integrated photonic functionalities in the visible range, opening new prospects for sensing, spectroscopy, and quantum photonic applications.

TI Quantum Mechanics in Drug Discovery: A Comprehensive Review of Methods,
   Applications, and Future Directions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Quantum mechanics (QM) revolutionizes drug discovery by providing precise molecular insights unattainable with classical methods. This review explores QM's role in computational drug design, detailing key methods like density functional theory (DFT), Hartree-Fock (HF), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), and fragment molecular orbital (FMO). These methods model electronic structures, binding affinities, and reaction mechanisms, enhancing structure-based and fragment-based drug design. This article highlights the applicability of QM to various drug classes, including small-molecule kinase inhibitors, metalloenzyme inhibitors, covalent inhibitors, and fragment-based leads. Quantum computing's potential to accelerate quantum mechanical (QM) calculations is discussed alongside novel applications in biological drugs (e.g., gene therapies, monoclonal antibodies, biosimilars), protein-receptor dynamics, and new therapeutic indications. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation exercise is included to teach QM/MM applications. Future projections for 2030-2035 emphasize QM's transformative impact on personalized medicine and undruggable targets. The qualifications and tools required for researchers, including advanced degrees, programming skills, and software such as Gaussian and Qiskit, are outlined, along with sources for training and resources. Specific publications on quantum mechanics (QM) in drug discovery relevant to QM and molecular dynamics (MD) studies are incorporated. Challenges, such as computational cost and expertise requirements, are addressed, offering a roadmap for educators and researchers to leverage quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular dynamics (MD) in drug discovery.

TI Experimental relative entanglement potentials of single-photon states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement potentials (EPs) enable the characterization and quantification of the nonclassicality of singlemode optical fields by measuring the entanglement generated through beam splitting. We experimentally generated single-photon states and tomographically reconstructed the corresponding two-qubit states to determine EPs defined via popular two-qubit measures of entanglement. These include the potentials for the relative entropy of entanglement (REEP), concurrence, and negativity. Among our experimental states, we found those that are very close (at least for some ranges of parameters) to the theoretical upper and lower bounds on relative EPs (or relative nonclassicality), i.e., when one EP is maximized or minimized for a given value of another EP. We experimentally confirmed the counterintuitive theoretical result of Miranowicz et al. [Phys. Rev. A 92, 062314 (2015)] that the relative nonclassicality (specifically, the negativity potential for given values of the REEP) of single-photon states can be increased by dissipation.

TI Multiqubit state learning with entangling quantum generative adversarial
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The increasing success of classical generative adversarial networks (GANs) has inspired several quantum versions of GANs. Fully quantum mechanical applications of such quantum GANs have been limited to one -and two-qubit systems. In this paper, we investigate the entangling quantum GAN (EQ-GAN) for multiqubit learning. We show that the EQ-GAN can learn a circuit more efficiently compared with a SWAP test. We also consider the EQ-GAN for learning eigenstates that are variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approximated and find that it generates excellent overlap matrix elements when learning VQE states of small molecules. However, this does not directly translate into a good estimate of the energy due to a lack of phase estimation. Finally, we consider random state learning with the EQ-GAN for up to six qubits, using different two-qubit gates, and show that it is capable of learning completely random quantum states, something which could be useful in quantum state loading.

TI On the construction of a post-quantum blockchain for smart city
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Owing to some special characteristics and features, blockchain is a very useful technique that can securely organize diverse devices in a smart city. It finds wide applications, especially in distributed environments, where entities such as wireless sensors need to be certain of the authenticity of the server. As contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have not been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the post-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from quantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction capacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded. Thus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm for security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used to not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to existing classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining. Meanwhile, an identity-based post-quantum signature is embedded into a transaction process to construct lightweight transactions. Subsequently, we provide a detailed description on the execution of the post-quantum lightweight transaction in a blockchain. Overall, this work can help enrich the research on future post-quantum blockchain and support the construction or architecture of emerging blockchain-based smart cities.

TI Enhanced efficiency of correlated photon pairs generation in silicon
   nitride with a low-loss 3D edge coupler
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB We demonstrate the generation of correlated photon pairs by using a hybrid integrated quantum photonic platform, where the dual-layer platform consists of a high-index doped silica glass (HDSG) layer to accommodate low-loss linear components and an SiN-based layer to accommodate the photon source. Leveraging the low-loss fiber coupling to the HDSG waveguide and the high nonlinearity of the SiN waveguide, we experimentally realize integrated source of photon pairs with high heralding efficiency. The directly measured photon pair rate is up to 87 KHz (corresponding to 1.74 x 10(-3) pairs per pulse) when the coincidence-to-accidental ratio is greater than 10. The raw heralding efficiency can reach 18%. If the filtering loss is excluded, the heralding efficiency can further reach 29%.

TI Entanglement-Enhanced Quantum Metrology in Colored Noise by Quantum Zeno
   Effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In open quantum systems, the precision of metrology inevitably suffers from the noise. In Markovian open quantum dynamics, the precision can not be improved by using entangled probes although the measurement time is effectively shortened. However, it was predicted over one decade ago that in a non-Markovian one, the error can be significantly reduced by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE) [Chin, Huelga, and Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 233601 (2012)]. In this work, we apply a recently developed quantum simulation approach to experimentally verify that entangled probes can improve the precision of metrology by the QZE. Up to n = 7 qubits, we demonstrate that the precision has been improved by a factor of n(1/4), which is consistent with the theoretical prediction. Our quantum simulation approach may provide an intriguing platform for experimental verification of various quantum metrology schemes.

TI Probing resonating valence bonds on a programmable germanium quantum
   simulator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Simulations using highly tunable quantum systems may enable investigations of condensed matter systems beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Quantum dots and donors in semiconductor technology define a natural approach to implement quantum simulation. Several material platforms have been used to study interacting charge states, while gallium arsenide has also been used to investigate spin evolution. However, decoherence remains a key challenge in simulating coherent quantum dynamics. Here, we introduce quantum simulation using hole spins in germanium quantum dots. We demonstrate extensive and coherent control enabling the tuning of multi-spin states in isolated, paired, and fully coupled quantum dots. We then focus on the simulation of resonating valence bonds and measure the evolution between singlet product states which remains coherent over many periods. Finally, we realize four-spin states with s-wave and d-wave symmetry. These results provide means to perform non-trivial and coherent simulations of correlated electron systems.

TI Multi-party quantum private size comparison protocol with
   d-dimensional Bell states
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB A feasible multi-party quantum private comparison (MQPC) protocol based on d -dimensional Bell states was proposed. In the protocol, all participants can independently encrypt their privacies and send them to a semi-honest quantum third party (TP) through authenticated channels. Then, the TP can determine the size relationship among all participants' privacies without gaining access to the private information. We verified correctness and effectiveness of the proposed protocol with some examples. In addition, compared with other similar protocols, it is not necessary to perform unitary operation on particles and only single-particle measurement is required. Furthermore, the relatively high qubit efficiency is promised. The security analysis verifies that the proposed protocol can counteract external and internal attacks in theory.

TI Quantum data encoding: a comparative analysis of classical-to-quantum
   mapping techniques and their impact on machine learning accuracy
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This study explores the integration of quantum data embedding techniques into classical machine learning (ML) algorithms; to assess performance enhancements and computational implications across a spectrum of models. We explored various classical-to-quantum mapping methods; ranging from basis encoding and angle encoding to amplitude encoding; for encoding classical data. We conducted an extensive empirical study encompassing popular ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and ensemble methods like Random Forest, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and CatBoost. Our findings reveal that quantum data embedding contributes to improved classification accuracy and F1 scores, particularly notable in models that inherently benefit from enhanced feature representation. We observed nuanced effects on running time, with low-complexity models exhibiting moderate increases and more computationally intensive models experiencing discernible changes. Notably, ensemble methods demonstrated a favorable balance between performance gains and computational overhead.This study underscores the potential of quantum data embedding to enhance classical ML models and emphasizes the importance of weighing performance improvements against computational costs. Future research may involve refining quantum encoding processes to optimize computational efficiency and explore scalability for real-world applications. Our work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness the advantages of quantum-inspired techniques in practical scenarios.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale
   quantum era and beyond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are central to much of the current research in quantum computing, particularly when considering the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, with a number of experimental demonstrations having already been performed. In this perspective, we discuss in a very broad sense what it means for an algorithm to be hybrid quantum-classical. We first explore this concept very directly, by building a definition based on previous work in abstraction-representation theory, arguing that what makes an algorithm hybrid is not directly how it is run (or how many classical resources it consumes), but whether classical components are crucial to an underlying model of the computation. We then take a broader view of this question, reviewing a number of hybrid algorithms and discussing what makes them hybrid, as well as the history of how they emerged and considerations related to hardware. This leads into a natural discussion of what the future holds for these algorithms. To answer this question, we turn to the use of specialized processors in classical computing. The classical trend is not for new technology to completely replace the old, but to augment it. We argue that the evolution of quantum computing is unlikely to be different: Hybrid algorithms are likely here to stay well past the NISQ era and even into full fault tolerance, with the quantum processors augmenting the already powerful classical processors which exist by performing specialized tasks.

TI Memory effect of a dephasing channel on measurement uncertainty, dense
   coding, teleportation, and quantum Fisher information
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We investigate measurement uncertainty of two incompatible observables, dense coding capacity, teleportation fidelity, and quantum Fisher information for two qubits traversing sequentially a dephasing channel modeled by the multimode bosonic field. Using a memory factor determined by the time separation between two channel uses and the transmit time of each qubit, it is shown that the memory effect of this channel on these four quantum characteristics is state-dependent. It is beneficial for some initial states and detrimental for the other states. There is also circumstance in which the memory effects with different origins have different influences on these quantum characteristics. These results may enrich our comprehension on the interplay between memory effect of a channel and decoherence process of a multi-qubit system.

TI Cyclic Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a form of quantum correlation that exhibits a fundamental asymmetry in the properties of quantum systems. Given two observers, Alice and Bob, there are known to exist bipartite entangled states which are one-way steerable in the sense that Alice can steer Bob's state, but Bob cannot steer Alice's state. Here, we generalize this phenomenon to three parties and find a cyclic property of tripartite EPR steering. In particular, we identify a three-qubit state whose reduced bipartite states are one-way steerable for arbitrary projective measurements. Moreover, the three-qubit state has a cyclic steering property in the sense that by arranging the system in a triangular configuration the neighboring parties can steer each other's states only in the same (e.g., clockwise) direction. That is, Alice can steer Bob's state, Bob can steer Charlie's state, and Charlie can steer Alice's state, but not the other way around.

TI Implementation of efficient quantum search algorithms on NISQ computers
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Despite the advent of Grover's algorithm for the unstructured search, its successful implementation on near-term quantum devices is still limited. We apply three strategies to reduce the errors associated with implementing quantum search algorithms. Our improved search algorithms have been implemented on the IBM quantum processors. Using them, we demonstrate three- and four-qubit search algorithm with higher average success probabilities compared to previous works. We present the successful execution of the five-qubit search on the IBM quantum processor for the first time. The results have been benchmarked using degraded ratio, which is the ratio between the experimental and the theoretical success probabilities. The fast decay of the degraded ratio supports our divide-and-conquer strategy. Our proposed strategies are also useful for implementation of quantum search algorithms in the post-NISQ era.

TI Critical slowing down in circuit quantum electrodynamics
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Critical slowing down of the time it takes a system to reach equilibrium is a key signature of bistability in dissipative first-order phase transitions. Understanding and characterizing this process can shed light on the underlying many-body dynamics that occur close to such a transition. Here, we explore the rich quantum activation dynamics and the appearance of critical slowing down in an engineered superconducting quantum circuit. Specifically, we investigate the intermediate bistable regime of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (GJC), realized by a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to a microwave cavity. We find a previously unidentified regime of quantum activation in which the critical slowing down reaches saturation and, by comparing our experimental results with a range of models, we shed light on the fundamental role played by the qubit in this regime.

TI Nanotube spin defects for omnidirectional magnetic field sensing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically addressable spin defects in three-dimensional (3D) crystals and two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials are revolutionizing nanoscale quantum sensing. Spin defects in one-dimensional (1D) vdW nanotubes will provide unique opportunities due to their small sizes in two dimensions and absence of dangling bonds on side walls. However, optically detected magnetic resonance of localized spin defects in a nanotube has not been observed. Here, we report the observation of single spin color centers in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) at room temperature. Our findings suggest that these BNNT spin defects possess a spin S = 1/2 ground state without an intrinsic quantization axis, leading to orientation-independent magnetic field sensing. We harness this unique feature to observe anisotropic magnetization of a 2D magnet in magnetic fields along orthogonal directions, a challenge for conventional spin S = 1 defects such as diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Additionally, we develop a method to deterministically transfer a BNNT onto a cantilever and use it to demonstrate scanning probe magnetometry. Further refinement of our approach will enable atomic scale quantum sensing of magnetic fields in any direction.
   Optically addressable spin defects, such as the NV centre in diamond, have enabled the nanoscale measurement of external stimuli. Here, Gao, Vaidya and coauthors observe a single spin colour centres in boron nitride nanotubes, which, due to their spin S = 1/2 ground state, allow for omnidirectional magnetic field sensing. '

TI Toward Subcellular Action Potential Detection with Nanodiamond Quantum
   Magnetometry
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Quantum sensing with nitrogen vacancy (NV) defects in diamond enables detection of extremely small changes in temperature, host material strain, and magnetic and electric fields. Action potential detection has previously been demonstrated with cardiac tissue and whole organisms using NV defects in bulk diamond crystals. Nanodiamonds (NDs) with NV defects were previously used as effective fluorescent markers, as they do not bleach under laser illumination like conventional fluorescent dyes. Subcellular-level action potential recording with NDs is yet to be demonstrated. Here, we report our results on the confocal imaging of NDs and the feasibility of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments with Cath.-a-differentiated (CAD) mouse brain cells. 10 nm and 60 nm NDs were shown to diffuse into cells within 30 min with no additional surface modification, as confirmed with confocal imaging. In contrast, 100 nm and 140 nm NDs were observed to remain localized on the cell surface. ND photoluminescence (PL) signals did not bleach over the course of 5 h long imaging studies. ODMR technique was used to detect externally applied millitesla-level magnetic fields with NDs in cell solutions. In summary, NDs were shown to be effective, non-bleaching fluorescent markers in mouse brain cells, with further potential for use in action potential recording at the subcellular level.

AB In this theoretical work, we describe a mechanism for the coupling between a plane structure consisting of four quantum dots and a resonator. We systematically study the dependence of the quadruple coupling strength and the qubit decoherence rate and point out the optimized operating position of the hybrid system. According to the transmission given by the input-output theory, the signatures in the resonator spectrum are predicted. Furthermore, based on the parameters already achieved in previous works, we prove that the device described in this paper can achieve the strong coupling limit, i.e., this approach can be used for system extension under the existing technical conditions. Our results show an effective and promotable approach to couple quantum dot structures in plane with the resonator and propose a meaningful extension method.

TI Slowing Down a Coherent Superposition of Circular Rydberg States of
   Strontium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Rydberg alkaline earth atoms are promising tools for quantum simulation and metrology. When one of the two valence electrons is promoted to long-lived circular states, the second valence electron can be optically manipulated without significant autoionization. We harness this feature to demonstrate laser slowing of a thermal atomic beam of circular strontium atoms. By driving the main ion core 422 nm wavelength resonance, we observe a velocity reduction of 50 m/s without significant autoionization. We also show that a superposition of circular states undergoes very weak decoherence during the cooling process, up to the scattering of more than 1000 photons. This robustness opens new perspectives for quantum simulations over long timescales with circular atoms, while simultaneously cooling their motional state. It makes it possible to mitigate the harmful effects of unavoidable heating due to spin-motion coupling during a quantum simulation.

TI A Simulation Study on the Theoretical Potential of Quantum-Enhanced
   Federated Security Operations
SO SENSORS
AB This paper makes two distinct contributions to the security and federated learning communities. First, we identify and empirically demonstrate a critical vulnerability in Krum, a widely deployed Byzantine-resilient aggregation algorithm, showing catastrophic failure (44.7% accuracy degradation) when applied to high-dimensional neural networks. We provide comprehensive analysis of five alternative algorithms and validate FLTrust as a more resilient solution, though requiring trusted infrastructure. This finding has immediate implications for production federated learning systems. Second, we present a rigorous feasibility analysis of quantum-enhanced security operations through simulation-based exploration. We document fundamental deployment barriers including (1) environmental electromagnetic interference exceeding sensor capabilities by 6-9 orders of magnitude, (2) infrastructure costs of USD 3-5M with unproven benefits, (3) an absence of validated correlation mechanisms between quantum measurements and cyber threats, and (4) O(n2) scalability constraints limiting deployments to 20 nodes. This is purely theoretical research using simulated data without physical quantum sensors. Physical validation through empirical noise characterization and sensor deployment in operational environments represents the critical next step, though faces significant challenges from EMI shielding requirements and calibration procedures. Together, these contributions provide actionable insights for current federated learning deployments while preventing premature investment in quantum sensing for cybersecurity.

TI Simulating hadronic physics on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices
   using basis light-front quantization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The analogy between quantum chemistry and light-front quantum field theory, first noted byWilson, serves as motivation to develop light-front quantum simulation of quantum field theory. We demonstrate how calculations of hadron structure can be performed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices within the basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) framework. Within BLFQ, relativistic quantum field theories take a form that permits direct application of methods for digital quantum simulation of quantum chemistry, which can be readily scaled into the quantum advantage regime. We calculate the light-front wave functions of pions using an effective light-front Hamiltonian in a basis representation on a current quantum processor. We use the variational quantum eigensolver to find the ground-state energy and the corresponding wave function, which is subsequently used to calculate pion mass radius, decay constant, elastic form factor, and charge radius.

TI Neuronal growth on high-aspect-ratio diamond nanopillar arrays for
   biosensing applications
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Monitoring neuronal activity with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution in living cell cultures is crucial to advance understanding of the development and functioning of our brain, and to gain further insights in the origin of brain disorders. While it has been demonstrated that the quantum sensing capabilities of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond allow real time detection of action potentials from large neurons in marine invertebrates, quantum monitoring of mammalian neurons (presenting much smaller dimensions and thus producing much lower signal and requiring higher spatial resolution) has hitherto remained elusive. In this context, diamond nanostructuring can offer the opportunity to boost the diamond platform sensitivity to the required level. However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of a nanostructured diamond surface on the neuronal viability and growth was lacking. Here, we pattern a single crystal diamond surface with large-scale nanopillar arrays and we successfully demonstrate growth of a network of living and functional primary mouse hippocampal neurons on it. Our study on geometrical parameters reveals preferential growth along the nanopillar grid axes with excellent physical contact between cell membrane and nanopillar apex. Our results suggest that neuron growth can be tailored on diamond nanopillars to realize a nanophotonic quantum sensing platform for wide-field and label-free neuronal activity recording with sub-cellular resolution.

TI Nitrogen-vacancy color centers in nanodiamonds as reference
   single-photon emitters
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantitative and reproducible optical characterization of single quantum emitters is crucial for quantum photonic materials research, yet accounting for measurement conditions remains challenging due to a lack of an established reference standard. We propose nanodiamonds containing single nitrogen vacancy (NV-) color centers as reliable, stable, and robust reference sources of single-photon emission. We select 4 potential reference emitter candidates from a study of thousands of NV(-)centers. Candidates were remeasured at a second laboratory, correlating optical pump power and NV(-)center emission intensity at saturation in addition to corresponding g g( g(2 g((2)) g((2))(0) values. A reference nanodiamond is demonstrated to account for experimental conditions, with reproducible and reliable single-photon emission, as a model for a new, to our knowledge, single-photon emitter reference standard.

TI Effect of Helium Surface Fluctuations on the Rydberg Transition of
   Trapped Electrons
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium is an extremely clean system which holds promise for a scalable qubit platform. However, the superfluid surface is not free from fluctuations which might cause the decay and dephasing of the electron's quantized states. Understanding and mitigating these fluctuations is essential for the advancement of electrons-on-helium qubit technology. Some work has been recently done to investigate surface oscillations due to the mechanical vibration of the cryostat using a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. In the present work, we focus on a sub-hertz frequency range and observe a strong effect of surface oscillations on the temporal dynamics of the Rydberg transition of electrons confined in a microchannel trapping device. We suggest possible origin of such oscillations and find a reasonable agreement between the corresponding estimation of the oscillation frequency and the observed result.

TI Continuous quantum clock with high precision and long recurrence time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous clocks, i.e., clocks that measure time in a continuous manner, are regarded as an essential component of sensing technology. Precision and recurrence time are two basic features of continuous clocks. In this paper, in the framework of quantum estimation theory various models for continuous quantum clocks are proposed, and all tools of quantum estimation theory are employed to seek the characteristics of clocks with high precision and long recurrence time. Then, in a resource-based approach, the performances of the proposed models are compared. It is shown that quantum clocks based on an n two-qubit system not only can have better precision than quantum clocks based on a 2n one-qubit system but also support long recurrence time. Finally, it is shown that while employing n entangled qubits improves the precision of clocks by a factor of 1/,/n, it inevitably worsens the recurrence time of the clock.

TI Measurement of Tunnel Coupling in a Si Double Quantum dot Based on
   Charge Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In Si quantum dots, the valley degree of freedom, in particular the generally small valley splitting and the dot-dependent valley-orbit phase, adds complexities to the low-energy electron dynamics. In particular, tunnel coupling, a key knob in charge and spin qubit manipulations, is strongly dependent on the valleyorbit coupling in a Si double dot. Here we propose a four-level model that incorporates excited valley states to extract ground-state tunnel coupling information for a Si double quantum dot. This scheme is based on a charge-sensing measurement on a double dot in equilibrium, as proposed in the widely used protocol for a GaAs double dot [DiCarlo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 226801 (2004)]. Our theory helps determine both intra- and intervalley tunnel coupling with high accuracy, and is robust against uncertainties in system parameters such as valley splittings in the individual quantum dots.

TI Fiber laser-pumped Ti:sapphire laser with ultra-low-intensity noise and
   frequency stabilization for quantum precision measurement applications
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We developed a fiber-laser-pumped Ti:sapphire laser system designed for quantum precision measurement applications. By employing a 35 W single-frequency 532 nm fiber laser as the pump source, the system delivered continuous-wave output powers of 4.12 W at 770.108 nm (D1 line, K), 4.72 W at 780.244 nm (D2 line, Rb), and 5.29 W at 794.982 nm (D1 line, Rb), thereby fulfilling the requirements for optical pumping and probing of alkali atoms. To enhance frequency stability, saturated absorption spectroscopy was used to lock the laser frequency, resulting in frequency drifts below 1 MHz over two hours. Furthermore, since low-frequency intensity noise (DC-100 Hz) critically affects spin-relaxation-free quantum sensing, we carried out a theoretical analysis which identified the pump laser as the dominant noise source. By implementing feedback control to the pump source as well as an external noise suppression, both methods achieved over 30 dB of intensity noise suppression within the DC-4kHz frequency range. In addition, improved beam pointing stability further reduced noise below 3 Hz. These results collectively demonstrate the system's strong potential for quantum sensing applications.

TI Engineering generalized Gibbs ensembles with trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The concept of generalized Gibbs ensembles (GGEs) has been introduced to describe steady states of integrable models. Recent advances show that GGEs can also be stabilized in nearly integrable quantum systems when driven by external fields and open. Here, we present a weakly dissipative dynamics that drives towards a steady-state GGE and is realistic to implement in systems of trapped ions. We outline the engineering of the desired dissipation by a combination of couplings which can be realized with ion-trap setups and discuss the experimental observables needed to detect a deviation from a thermal state. We present a mixed-species motional mode engineering technique in an array of microtraps and demonstrate the possibility to use sympathetic cooling to constructmany-body dissipators. Our paper provides a blueprint for experimental observation of GGEs in open systems and opens an avenue for quantum simulation of driven-dissipative quantum many-body problems.

TI Metasurface-integrated atomic magnetometer using single-frequency dual
   beams
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Quantum sensing is rapidly advancing, creating new opportunities in fields such as fundamental science and advanced manufacturing. The optically pumped atomic magnetometer (OPM), known for its high sensitivity and compact form factor, has become a promising candidate for a range of applications. However, traditional OPM systems relying on bulky optical components and phase accumulation often face limitations in modulation precision and miniaturization. In this study, we introduce a miniaturized OPM design that incorporates a polarized metasurface and uses a single laser source for both pumping and detection. The polarized metasurface enables the transformation of linearly polarized light with arbitrary polarization azimuths into circularly polarized light, allowing for subwavelength-scale optical field manipulation and integrated beam splitting. In the developed system, both the circularly polarized pump beam and the zeroth-order linearly polarized probe beam are generated from the same metasurface device, forming a dual-path magnetometer architecture. This design significantly reduces the optical system size while achieving a sensitivity of 4.91 pT/Hz1/2 in the 2-10 Hz frequency range, exceeding the performance of conventional dual-beam OPMs with comparable configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OPM effectively utilizes the metasurface's optical properties to balance high sensitivity and system miniaturization. This work offers a practical approach for the integrated design of compact quantum sensing systems.

TI Delocalization Transition of a Disordered Axion Insulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The axion insulator is a higher-order topological insulator protected by inversion symmetry. We show that, under quenched disorder respecting inversion symmetry on average, the topology of the axion insulator stays robust, and an intermediate metallic phase in which states are delocalized is unavoidable at the transition from an axion insulator to a trivial insulator. We derive this conclusion from general arguments, from classical percolation theory, and from the numerical study of a 3D quantum network model simulating a disordered axion insulator through a layer construction. We find the localization length critical exponent near the delocalization transition to be nu = 1.42 +/- 0.12. We further show that this delocalization transition is stable even to weak breaking of the average inversion symmetry, up to a critical strength. We also quantitatively map our quantum network model to an effective Hamiltonian and we find its low-energy k . p expansion.

AB We propose a new scheme for optical quantum simulation of topological systems: by using optical systems to simulate the variation of eigenstates of topological systems in momentum space, we can obtain the information of topological numbers. In this paper the scheme is applied to the one-dimensional (1D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the two-dimensional (2D) Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. In addition, in order to apply our scheme to 2D topological systems, we design a method of calculating topological numbers by line integral. Furthermore, we propose a more effective optical simulation scheme for the 2D topological system: we do the optical simulation around discontinuity points to obtain the vorticity of every discontinuity points and the topological number is just the sum of the vorticity of all discontinuity points.

TI Verifying the cytotoxicity of a biodegradable zinc alloy with
   nanodiamond sensors
SO BIOMATERIALS ADVANCES
AB Metals are widely utilized as implant materials for bone fixtures as well as stents. Biodegradable versions of these implants are highly desirable since patients do not have to undergo a second surgery for the materials to be removed. Attractive options for such materials are zinc silver alloys since they also offer the benefit of being antibacterial. However, it is important to investigate the effect of the degradation products of such alloys on the surrounding cells, taking into account silver cytotoxicity. Here we investigated zinc alloyed with 1 % of silver (Zn-1Ag) and how differently concentrated extracts (1 %-100 %) of this material impact human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). More specifically, we focused on free radical generation and oxidative stress as well as the impact on cell viability. To determine free radical production we used diamond-based quantum sensing as well as conventional fluorescent assays. The viability was assessed by observing cell morphology and the metabolic activity via the MTT assay. We found that 1 % and 10 % extracts are well tolerated by the cells. However, at higher extract concentrations we observed severe impact on cell viability and oxidative stress. We were also able to show that quantum sensing was able to detect significant free radical generation even at the lowest tested concentrations.

TI Embedded nano spin sensor for in situ probing of gas adsorption inside
   porous organic frameworks
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-based sensors have attracted considerable attention owing to their high sensitivities. Herein, we developed a metallofullerene-based nano spin sensor to probe gas adsorption within porous organic frameworks. For this, spin-active metallofullerene, Sc3C2@C-80,C- was selected and embedded into a nanopore of a pyrene-based covalent organic framework (Py-COF). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy recorded the EPR signals of Sc3C2@C-80 within Py-COF after adsorbing N-2, CO, CH4, CO2, C3H6, and C3H8. Results indicated that the regularly changing EPR signals of embedded Sc3C2@C-80 were associated with the gas adsorption performance of Py-COF. In contrast to traditional adsorption isotherm measurements, this implantable nano spin sensor could probe gas adsorption and desorption with in situ, real-time monitoring. The proposed nano spin sensor was also employed to probe the gas adsorption performance of a metal-organic framework (MOF-177), demonstrating its versatility. The nano spin sensor is thus applicable for quantum sensing and precision measurements.
   Spin-based sensors have attracted attention due to their high sensitivities. Here authors present a fullerene-based nano spin sensor for in-situ sensing of gas adsorption in porous organic frameworks, demonstrating the potential applications of molecular spin systems in quantum sensing.

TI Unified diagrammatic approach to quantum transport in few-level
   junctions for bosonic and fermionic reservoirs: Application to the
   quantum Rabi model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We apply the Nakajima-Zwanzig approach to open quantum systems to study steady-state transport across generic multilevel junctions coupled to bosonic or fermionic reservoirs. The method allows for a unified diagrammatic formulation in Liouville space, with diagrams being classified according to an expansion in the coupling strength between the reservoirs and the junction. Analytical, approximate expressions are provided up to the fourth order for the steady-state boson transport that generalizes to multilevel systems the known results for the low-temperature thermal conductance in the spin-boson model. The formalism is applied to the problem of heat transport in a qubit-resonator junction modeled by the quantum Rabi model. Nontrivial transport features emerge as a result of the interplay between the qubit-oscillator detuning and coupling strength. For quasidegenerate spectra, nonvanishing steady-state coherences cause a suppression of the thermal conductance.

TI Bright and dark solitons in a photonic nonlinear quantum walk: lessons
   from the continuum
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a nonlinear quantum walk model inspired in a photonic implementation in which the polarization state of the light field plays the role of the coin-qubit. In particular, we take profit of the nonlinear polarization rotation occurring in optical media with Kerr nonlinearity, which allows to implement a nonlinear coin operator, one that depends on the state of the coin-qubit. We consider the space-time continuum limit of the evolution equation, which takes the form of a nonlinear Dirac equation. The analysis of this continuum limit allows us to gain some insight into the existence of different solitonic structures, such as bright and dark solitons. We illustrate several properties of these solitons with numerical calculations, including the effect on them of an additional phase simulating an external electric field.

TI Possibilities and Challenges of Superconducting Qubits in the Intrinsic
   Josephson Junctions
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRONICS
AB Intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) in the high-Tc cuprate superconductors have several fascinating properties, which are superior to the usual Josephson junctions obtained from conventional superconductors with low Tc, as follows; (1) a very thin thickness of the superconducting layers, (2) a strong interaction between junctions since neighboring junc-tions are closely connected in an atomic scale, (3) a clean interface between the superconducting and insulating layers, realized in a single crystal with few disorders. These unique properties of IJJs can enlarge the applicable ar-eas of the superconducting qubits, not only the increase of qubit-operation temperature but the novel application of qubits including the macroscopic quantum states with internal degree of freedom. I present a comprehensive review of the phase dynamics in current-biased IJJs and argue the chal-lenges of superconducting qubits utilizing IJJs.

We systematically analyze the dependence of spontaneous emission on the quantum emitter position, polarization, and the grating strength (number of periods). We show that coupling efficiencies as high as 87% and 83% can be realized for a dipole emitter placed at the center of the nanofiber with polarization perpendicular (x-pol) and parallel (y-pol) to the hole-axis, respectively. This system may attract various quantum photonic applications based on single-photon sources.

TI Fluorescent Nanodiamonds for Detecting Free-Radical Generation in Real
   Time during Shear Stress in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells
SO ACS SENSORS
AB Free-radical generation is suspected to play a key role in cardiovascular diseases. Another crucial factor is shear stress. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS), which form the lining of blood vessels, require a physiological shear stress to activate many vasoactive factors. These are needed for maintaining vascular cell functions such as nonthrombogenicity, regulation of blood flow, and vascular tone. Additionally, blood clots form at regions of high shear stress within a blood vessel. Here, we use a new method called diamond magnetometry which allows us to measure the dynamics of free-radical generation in real time under shear stress. This quantum sensing technique allows free-radical detection with nanoscale resolution at the single-cell level. We investigate radical formation in HUVECs in a microfluidic environment under different flow conditions typically found in veins and arteries. Here, we looked into free-radical formation before, during, and after flow. We found that the free-radical production varied depending on the flow conditions. To confirm the magnetometry results and to differentiate between radicals, we performed conventional fluorescent reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays specific for superoxide, nitric oxide, and overall ROS.

TI Diamond surface engineering for molecular sensing with nitrogen-vacancy
   centers
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Quantum sensing using optically addressable atomic-scale defects, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, provides new opportunities for sensitive and highly localized characterization of chemical functionality. Notably, near-surface defects facilitate detection of the minute magnetic fields generated by nuclear or electron spins outside of the diamond crystal, such as those in chemisorbed and physisorbed molecules. However, the promise of NV centers is hindered by a severe degradation of critical sensor properties, namely charge stability and spin coherence, near surfaces (< ca. 10 nm deep). Moreover, applications in the chemical sciences require methods for covalent bonding of target molecules to diamond with robust control over density, orientation, and binding configuration. This forward-looking Review provides a survey of the rapidly converging fields of diamond surface science and NV-center physics, highlighting their combined potential for quantum sensing of molecules. We outline the diamond surface properties that are advantageous for NV-sensing applications, and discuss strategies to mitigate deleterious effects while simultaneously providing avenues for chemical attachment. Finally, we present an outlook on emerging applications in which the unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution of NV-based sensing could provide unique insight into chemically functionalized surfaces at the single-molecule level.

TI Permutationally invariant processes in open multiqudit systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We establish the comprehensive theoretical framework for an exact description of the open system dynamics of permutationally invariant (PI) states in arbitrary N-qudit systems when this dynamics preserves the PI symmetry over time. Thanks to the powerful Schur-Weyl duality formalism, we unveil the internal links between the canonical time-local Lindblad-like master equation and the Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics of each PI degree of freedom (Schur subspaces). Our approach does not require one to compute the Schur transform as it operates directly within the restricted PI operator subspace of the Liouville space, whose dimension only scales polynomially with the number of qudits. We introduce the concept of 3 nu-symbol matrix, where nu here denotes an integer partition, that proves to be very useful in this context.

TI Statistics of topological defects across a phase transition in a digital
   superconducting quantum processor
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB When a quantum phase transition is crossed within a finite time, critical slowing down disrupts adiabatic dynamics, resulting in the formation of topological defects. The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on multiple quantum processing units up to 100 qubits, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.

TI Two-level quantum walkers on directed graphs. II. Application to quantum
   random access memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This is the second paper in a series of two. Using a multiparticle continuous-time quantum walk with two internal states, which was formulated in the first paper [R. Asaka et al., preceding paper, Phys. Rev. A 107, 022415 (2023)], we physically implement a quantum random access memory (QRAM). Data with address information are dual-rail encoded into quantum walkers. The walkers pass through perfect binary trees to access the designated memory cells and copy the data stored in the cells. A roundabout gate allocated at each node serves as a router to move the walker from the parent node to one of two child nodes, depending on the internal state of the walker. In this process, the address information is sequentially encoded into the internal states so that the walkers are adequately delivered to the target cells. The present QRAM, which processes 2n m-qubit data, is implemented in a quantum circuit of depth O(n log(n + m)) and requires O(n + m) qubit resources. This is more efficient than the conventional bucket-brigade QRAM that requires O(n2 + nm) steps and O(2n + m) qubit resources for processing. Moreover, since the walkers are not entangled with any device on the binary trees, the cost of maintaining coherence can be reduced. Notably, by simply passing quantum walkers through binary trees, data can be automatically extracted in a quantum superposition state. In other words, any time-dependent control is not required.

TI Multiqubit parity gates for Rydberg atoms in various configurations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a native approach for realizing multiqubit parity phase gates in neutral-atom systems through global phase modulation of a Rydberg excitation laser. By shaping the temporal profile of the laser's phase, we enable high-fidelity, time efficient entangling operations between multiple qubits without requiring individual qubit addressing. To mitigate intrinsic noise sources including spontaneous decay and motional effects, we develop a noise-aware optimal control framework that reduces gate errors under the presence of noise while maintaining smooth pulse profiles suitable for experimental implementation. In addition to equidistant qubit arrangements, we explore the impact of nonequidistant atomic configurations, where interaction inhomogeneity becomes significant. In these cases, the flexibility of our control approach helps to compensate for such variations, supporting reliable gate performance across different spatial layouts. These results facilitate the practical implementation of complex, multiqubit quantum operations in near-term neutral-atom quantum processors.

TI Spiking neuromorphic chip learns entangled quantum states
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The approximation of quantum states with artificial neural networks has gained a lot of attention during the last years. Meanwhile, analog neuromorphic chips, inspired by structural and dynamical properties of the biological brain, show a high energy efficiency in running artificial neural-network architectures for the profit of generative applications. This encourages employing such hardware systems as platforms for simulations of quantum systems. Here we report on the realization of a prototype using the latest spike-based BrainScaleS hardware allowing us to represent few-qubit maximally entangled quantum states with high fidelities. Bell correlations of pure and mixed two-qubit states are well captured by the analog hardware, demonstrating an important building block for simulating quantum systems with spiking neuromorphic chips.

The phase shifter is based on a slot waveguide, whose slot width can be controlled by electrostatic forces, enabling a large effective refractive index change Delta n(eff) >0.1. We observe up to 3 pi phase modulation with 10.6 V applied bias, and a figure of merit V pi L =5.7 x10(-3) V cm. Integration with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer further allows routing of single photons with an extinction ratio of up to 24 dB at cryogenic temperatures. This device enables advanced manipulation of quantum emitters and the realization of reconfigurable quantum photonic integrated circuits.

TI Long-range optical coupling with epsilon-near-zero materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Long-range resonant quantum tunneling of electrons happens across potential barriers when the wavefunction interferes constructively outside the barrier. Here we demonstrate an analogy in optical systems based on epsilon-near-zero materials, achieving phase-modulated, long-range optical interactions between transparent semiconducting oxide layers beyond the evanescent photonic coupling. Distinct from weak thin-film interference, intense electromagnetic fields confined within the epsilon-near-zero thin films show anti-correlated intensity oscillations as a function of interlayer separation up to hundreds of microns. The oscillatory, anti-correlated electromagnetic field intensities were probed by second harmonic generation from wedged indium tin oxide multilayers. Such a system that hosts subwavelength mode footprint and simultaneously long-range radiative coupling offers prospects for long-distance optical communication, large-scale photonic circuits, and hybrid quantum photonic systems.

TI Quasiparticles in Superconducting Qubits with Asymmetric Junctions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Designing the spatial profile of the superconducting gap-gap engineering-has long been recognized as an effective way of controlling quasiparticles in superconducting devices. In aluminum films, their thickness modulates the gap; therefore, standard fabrication of Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junctions, which relies on overlapping a thicker film on top of a thinner one, always results in gap-engineered devices. Here, we reconsider quasiparticle effects in superconducting qubits to explicitly account for the unavoidable asymmetry in the gap on the two sides of a Josephson junction. We find that different regimes can be encountered in which the quasiparticles have either similar densities in the two junction leads or are largely confined to the lower-gap lead. Qualitatively, for similar densities the qubit excited-state population is lower but its relaxation rate is higher than when the quasiparticles are confined; therefore, there is a potential trade-off between two desirable properties in a qubit.

TI Interacting defects generate stochastic fluctuations in superconducting
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Amorphous dielectric materials have been known to host two-level systems (TLSs) for more than four decades. Recent developments on superconducting resonators and qubits enable detailed studies on the physics of TLSs. In particular, measuring the loss of a device over long time periods (a few days) allows us to investigate stochastic fluctuations due to the interaction between TLSs. We measure the energy relaxation time of a frequency-tunable planar superconducting qubit over time and frequency. The experiments show a variety of stochastic patterns that we are able to explain by means of extensive simulations. The model used in our simulations assumes a qubit interacting with high-frequency TLSs, which, in turn, interact with thermally activated low-frequency TLSs. Our simulations match the experiments and suggest the density of low-frequency TLSs is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of high-frequency ones.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Security Framework for Next-Generation
   Space-Terrestrial Networks
SO PHOTONICS
AB Advancements in Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) technology facilitate ubiquitous network access for users, whereas satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a viable solution for long-distance quantum key exchange in scenarios lacking terrestrial network infrastructure. This study explores the feasibility and practical utility of integrating NTN technology with satellite-based QKD and proposes a novel quantum-enhanced security framework for next-generation space-terrestrial networks. We have developed and deployed the first-of-its-kind 5G-enabled (fifth generation mobile communication) NTN prototype system leveraging satellite-based QKD key encryption. This system comprises a quantum satellite system, a communication satellite system, a 5G network infrastructure, and end-to-end encryption/decryption modules, aiming to validate the feasibility and usability of the proposed quantum-encrypted NTN security framework. Comprehensive tests and performance evaluations were carried out on the testbed constructed based on this prototype system, which collected critical Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics, including Round-Trip Time (RTT) and jitter, during user-plane ping measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of quantum encryption capabilities incurs an RTT overhead of 5 ms (0.75%), a necessary trade-off for systems incorporating supplementary quantum-encrypted transmission. Concurrently, the deployment of Virtual Private Network (VPN) infrastructure mitigates network jitter by 50%. These results hold critical theoretical and practical implications for the development of next-generation NTN security frameworks enabled by satellite-based QKD.

TI Axion search with quantum nondemolition detection of magnons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The axion provides a solution for the strong CP problem and is one of the leading candidates for dark matter. This paper proposes an axion detection scheme based on quantum nondemolition detection of magnon, i.e., quanta of collective spin excitations in solid, which is expected to be excited by the axion-electron interaction predicted by the Dine-Fischer-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky model. The prototype detector is composed of a ferrimagnetic sphere as an electronic spin target and a superconducting qubit. Both of these are embedded inside a microwave cavity, which leads to a coherent effective interaction between the uniform magnetostatic mode in the ferrimagnetic crystal and the qubit. An upper limit for the coupling constant between an axion and an electron is obtained as g(aee) < 2.6 x 10(-6) at the 95% confidence level for the axion mass of 33.117 mu eV < m(a) < 33.130 mu eV.

TI Device-independent bounds from Cabello's nonlocality argument
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hardy-type arguments manifest Bell nonlocality in one of the simplest possible ways. Except for demonstrating nonclassical signature of entangled states in question, they can also serve for device-independent self-testing of states, as shown, e.g., in Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 180401 (2012). Here we develop and broaden these results to an extended version of Hardy's argument, often referred to as Cabello's nonlocality argument. We show that, as in the simpler case of Hardy's nonlocality argument, the maximum quantum value for Cabello's nonlocality is achieved by a pure two-qubit state and projective measurements that are unique up to local isometries. We also examine the properties of a more realistic case when small errors in the ideal constraints are accepted within the probabilities obtained and prove that also in this case the two-qubit state and measurements are sufficient for obtaining the maximum quantum violation of the classical bound.

TI Temporal fusion of entangled resource states from a quantum emitter
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Fusion-based photonic quantum computing architectures rely on two primitives: i) near-deterministic generation and control of constant-size entangled states and ii) probabilistic entangling measurements (photonic fusion gates) between entangled states. Here, we demonstrate these key functionalities by temporally fusing resource states deterministically generated using a solid-state spin-photon interface. Repetitive operation of the source leads to sequential entanglement generation, whereby curiously entanglement is created between the quantum states of the same spin at two different instances in time. Such temporal multiplexing of photonic entanglement provides a resource-efficient route to scaling many-body entangled systems with photons.

TI Studies of decoherence in strongly anisotropic spin triangles with
   toroidal or general noncollinear easy axes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Magnetic molecules are investigated with respect to their usability as units in future quantum devices. In view of quantum computing, a necessary prerequisite is a long coherence time of superpositions of low-lying levels. In this article, we investigate by means of numerical simulations whether a toroidal structure of single-ion easy anisotropy axes is advantageous as often conjectured. Our results demonstrate that there is no general advantage of toroidal magnetic molecules, but that arrangements of tilted anisotropy axes perform best in many cases.

AB The Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (DMDGP) aims to determine the three-dimensional protein structure using distance information from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The DMDGP has a finite number of candidate solutions and can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe a quantum approach to the DMDGP by using Grover's algorithm with an appropriate oracle function, which is more efficient than classical methods that use brute force. We show computational results by implementing our scheme on IBM quantum computers with a small number of noisy qubits.

TI Resource-optimized fault-tolerant simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model
   and high-temperature superconductor models
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Exploring low-cost applications is paramount to creating value in early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that are far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Resilient Growth of a Highly Crystalline Topological
   Insulator-Superconductor Heterostructure Enabled by an Ex Situ
   Nitride Film
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Highly crystalline and easily feasible topological insulator-superconductor (TI-SC) heterostructures are crucial for the development of practical topological qubit devices. The optimal superconducting layer for TI-SC heterostructures should be highly resilient against external contamination and structurally compatible with TIs. In this study, we provide a solution to this challenge by showcasing the growth of a highly crystalline TI-SC heterostructure using refractory TiN (111) as the superconducting layer. This approach can eliminate the need for in situ cleavage or growth. More importantly, the TiN surface shows high resilience against contaminations during air exposure, as demonstrated by the successful recyclable growth of Bi2Se3. Our findings indicate that TI-SC heterostructures based on nitride films are compatible with device fabrication techniques, paving the way to the realization of practical topological qubit devices in the future.

TI All-magnonic repeater based on bistability
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bistability, a universal phenomenon found in diverse fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics, describes a scenario in which a system has two stable equilibrium states and resets to one of the two states. The ability to switch between these two states is the basis for a wide range of applications, particularly in memory and logic operations. Here, we present a universal approach to achieve bistable switching in magnonics, the field processing data using spin waves. A pronounced bistable window is observed in a 1 mu m wide magnonic conduit under an external rf drive. The system is characterized by two magnonic stable states defined as low and high spin-wave amplitude states. The switching between these two states is realized by another propagating spin wave sent into the rf driven region. This magnonic bistable switching is used to design a magnonic repeater, which receives the original decayed and distorted spin wave and regenerates a new spin wave with amplified amplitude and normalized phase. Our magnonic repeater can be installed at the inputs of each magnonic logic gate to overcome the spin-wave amplitude degradation and phase distortion during previous propagation and achieve integrated magnonic circuits or magnonic neuromorphic networks.
   A repeater takes an input signal and retransmits is, and a vital component for extending the range of signals. Here, Wang et al. demonstrate a magnon repeater, based on the bistable switching between low and high amplitude spin-waves.

TI Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo for computing observables
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The recent development of logical quantum processors marks a pivotal transition from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. These devices have the potential to address classically challenging problems with polynomial computational time using quantum properties. However, they remain susceptible to noise, necessitating noise resilient algorithms. We introduce Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo (QZMC), a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm that demonstrates resilience to device noise and Trotter errors while showing polynomial computational cost for a gapped system. QZMC computes static and dynamic properties without requiring initial state overlap or variational parameters, offering reduced quantum circuit depth.

AB We conducted quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems using the quantum flow (QFlow) approach, which enables sampling large subspaces of the Hilbert space through coupled variational problems in reduced dimensionality active spaces. Our QFlow algorithms significantly reduce circuit complexity and pave the way for scalable and constant-circuit-depth quantum computing. Our simulations show that QFlow can optimize the collective number of wave function parameters without increasing the required qubits using active spaces having an order of magnitude fewer number of parameters.

TI Site-Selective Enhancement of Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon
   Detectors via Local Helium Ion Irradiation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Achieving homogeneous performance metrics between nominally identical pixels is challenging for the operation of arrays of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). Here, local helium ion irradiation is utilized to post-process and tune single-photon detection efficiency, switching current, and critical temperature of individual devices on the same chip. For 12 nm thick highly absorptive SNSPDs, which are barely sensitive to single photons with a wavelength of 780 nm prior to He ion irradiation, an increase of the system detection efficiency from <0.05% to (55.3 +/- 1.1)% is observed following irradiation. Moreover, the internal detection efficiency saturates at a temperature of 4.5 K after irradiation with 1800 ions nm(-2). Compared to 8 nm SNSPDs of similar detection efficiency, a doubling of the switching current (to 20 <mu>A) is observed for irradiated 10 nm thick detectors, increasing the amplitude of detection voltage pulses. Investigations of the scaling of superconducting thin film properties with irradiation up to a fluence of 2600 ions nm(-2) revealed an increase of sheet resistance and a decrease of critical temperature towards high fluences. A physical model accounting for defect generation and sputtering during helium ion irradiation is presented and shows good qualitative agreement with experiments.

AB With the ever-growing interest in quantum computing, understanding the behavior of excitons in monolayer quantum dots has become a topic of great relevance. In this paper, we consider a Wannier exciton confined in a triangular quantum dot of hexagonal boron nitride. We begin by outlining the adequate basis functions to describe a particle in a triangular enclosure, analyzing their degeneracy and symmetries. Afterwards, we discuss the excitonic Hamiltonian inside the quantum dot and study the influence of the quantum dot dimensions on the excitonic states.

TI Topological transitions of the generalized Pancharatnam-Berry phase
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Distinct from the dynamical phase, in a cyclic evolution, a system's state may acquire an additional component, a.k.a. geometric phase. Recently, it has been demonstrated that geometric phases can be induced by a sequence of generalized measurements implemented on a single qubit. Furthermore, it has been predicted that these geometric phases may exhibit a topological transition as a function of the measurement strength. We demonstrate and study this transition experimentally by using an optical platform where the qubit is represented by the polarization of light and the weak measurement is performed by means of coupling with the spatial degree of freedom. Our protocol can be interpreted in terms of environment-induced geometric phases, whose values are topologically determined by the environment-system coupling strength. Our results show that the two limits of geometric phase induced by sequences of either weak or projective measurements are topologically distinct.

TI Distillation of genuine tripartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that a perfectly genuine tripartite steerable assemblage can be distilled from partially genuine tripartite EPR steerable assemblages. In particular, we consider two types of hybrid scenarios: one-sided device-independent scenario (where one observer is untrusted, and other two observers are trusted) and two-sided device-independent scenario (where two observers are untrusted, and one observer is trusted). In both scenarios, we show distillation of perfectly genuine steerable assemblage of three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states or three-qubit W states from many copies of initial partially genuine steerable assemblages of the corresponding states. In each of these cases, we demonstrate that at least one copy of a perfectly genuine steerable assemblage can be distilled with certainty from infinitely many copies of initial assemblages. In case of practical scenarios employing finite copies, we show that the efficiency of our distillation protocols reaches near perfect levels using only a few number of initial assemblages.

TI Average quantum coherence of pure-state decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the average quantum coherence over the pure state decompositions of a mixed quantum state. An upper bound of the average quantum coherence is provided, and sufficient conditions for the saturation of the upper bound are shown. These sufficient conditions always hold for two- and three-dimensional systems. This provides a tool to estimate the average coherence experimentally by measuring only the diagonal elements, which remarkably requires less measurements compared with state tomography. We then describe the pure state decompositions of the qubit state in the Bloch sphere geometrically. For any given qubit state, the optimal pure state decomposition achieving the maximal average quantum coherence as well as three other pure state decompositions are shown in the Bloch sphere. The order relations among their average quantum coherence are invariant for any coherence measure. The results presented in this paper are universal and suitable for all coherence measures.

TI Listening for new physics with quantum acoustics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a novel application of a qubit-coupled phonon detector to search for new physics, e.g., ultralight dark matter (DM) and high-frequency gravitational waves. The detector, motivated by recent advances in quantum acoustics, is composed of superconducting transmon qubits coupled to high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators (hBARs) and operates in the GHz - 10 GHz frequency range. New physics can excite O(10 mu eV) phonons within the hBAR, which are then converted to qubit excitations via a transducer. We detail the design, operation, backgrounds, and expected sensitivity of a prototype detector, as well as a next-generation detector optimized for new physics signals. We find that a future detector can complement current haloscope experiments in the search for both dark photon DM and high-frequency gravitational waves. Lastly, we comment on such a detector's ability to operate as a O(10 mu eV) athermal phonon sensor for sub-GeV DM detection.

TI Towards the Co-Simulation of Charge Qubits: A Methodology Grounding on
   an Equivalent Circuit Representation
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents a methodology to describe quantum mechanical states of charge qubits, realized as coupled quantum dots occupied by single electrons, using equivalent electrical circuits. We explain how to construct all equations starting from low-level simulations of wave functions and interpret the relationship between the parameters appearing in the resulting model and the parameters of the physical system. An efficient methodology to obtain 2D wave functions is presented. Results obtained in this study using a circuit simulator correspond to quantum dot arrays fabricated in a CMOS technology and recently published in the literature. The generalization of quantum mechanical equations, their conversion to equivalent circuits, and numerical examples are discussed.

TI Clock transitions guard against spin decoherence in singlet fission
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Short coherence times present a primary obstacle in quantum computing and sensing applications. In atomic systems, clock transitions (CTs), formed from avoided crossings in an applied Zeeman field, can substantially increase coherence times. We show how CTs can dampen intrinsic and extrinsic sources of quantum noise in molecules. Conical intersections between two periodic potentials form CTs in electron paramagnetic resonance experiments of the spin-polarized singlet fission photoproduct. We report on a pair of CTs for a two-chromophore molecule in terms of the Zeeman field strength, molecular orientation relative to the field, and molecular geometry.

AB While we expect quantum computers to surpass their classical counterparts in the future, current devices are prone to high error rates and techniques to minimise the impact of these errors are indispensable. There already exists a variety of error mitigation methods addressing this quantum noise that differ in effectiveness, and scalability. But for a more systematic and comprehensible approach we propose the introduction of modelling, in particular for representing cause-effect relations as well as for evaluating methods or combinations thereof with respect to a selection of relevant criteria.

AB Electromagnetic absorbers are widely used in multiple applications. However, depending on the specific application they maybe subjected to a set of constraints. Taking into account that their characteristics are well known, their design is a textbook example for the application of evolutionary optimization techniques. In this paper, a hybrid classical-quantum evolutionary optimization algorithm is applied for the design of a multilayer electromagnetic absorber aiming to minimize the reflection coefficient and the absorber's thickness. It is found that the hybrid optimization has an increased performance over traditional techniques in convergence speed and repeatability.

TI A New Method of Kronecker Product Decomposition
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
AB Kronecker product decomposition is often applied in various fields such as particle physics, signal processing, image processing, semidefinite programming, quantum computing, and matrix time series analysis. In the paper, a new method of Kronecker product decomposition is proposed. Theoretical results ensure that the new method is convergent and stable. The simulation results show that the new method is far faster than the known method. In fact, the new method is very applicable for exact decomposition, fast decomposition, big matrix decomposition, and online decomposition of Kronecker products. At last, the extension direction of the new method is discussed.

TI A Quantum-Safe Software-Defined Deterministic Internet of Things (IoT)
   with Hardware-Enforced Cyber-Security for Critical Infrastructures
SO INFORMATION
AB The next-generation "Industrial Internet of Things" (IIoT) will support "Machine-to-Machine" (M2M) communications for smart Cyber-Physical-Systems and Industry 4.0, and require guaranteed cyber-security. This paper explores hardware-enforced cyber-security for critical infrastructures. It examines a quantum-safe "Software-Defined-Deterministic IIoT" (SDD-IIoT), with a new forwarding-plane (sub-layer-3a) for deterministic M2M traffic flows. A "Software-Defined Networking" (SDN) control plane controls many "Software-Defined-Deterministic Wide-Area Networks" (SDD-WANs), realized with FPGAs. The SDN control plane provides an "Admission-Control/Access-Control" system for network-bandwidth, using collaborating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based "Zero Trust Architectures" (ZTAs). Hardware-enforced access-control eliminates all congestion, BufferBloat, and DoS/DDoS attacks, significantly reduces buffer-sizes, and supports ultra-reliable-low-latency communications in the forwarding-plane. The forwarding-plane can: (i) Encrypt/Authenticate M2M flows using quantum-safe ciphers, to withstand attacks by Quantum Computers; (ii) Implement "guaranteed intrusion detection systems" in FPGAs, to detect cyber-attacks embedded within billions of IIoT packets; (iii) Provide guaranteed immunity to external cyber-attacks, and exceptionally strong immunity to internal cyber-attacks; (iv) Save USD 100s of billions annually by exploiting FPGAs; and (v) Enable hybrid Classical-Quantum networks, by integrating a "quantum key distribution" (QKD) network with a classical forwarding plane with exceptionally strong cyber-security, determined by the computational hardness of cracking Symmetric Key Cryptography. Extensive experimental results for an SDD-WAN over the European Union are reported.

The authors argue that the law does more than just respond to these innovations; it actively creates and reshapes the narratives that define their paths. They claim that lawyers act as storytellers, using the law to legitimise specific technological paths while challenging or reinforcing existing power structures; as a result, the law both reflects and creates cultural anxieties. The authors hope that this symposium helps clarify the dynamic relationship between storytelling, legal regulation, and technological progress.

TI Fidelity bounds for device-independent advantage distillation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB It is known that advantage distillation (that is, information reconciliation using two-way communication) improves noise tolerances for quantum key distribution (QKD) setups. Two-way communication is hence also of interest in the device-independent case, where noise tolerance bounds for one-way error correction are currently too low to be experimentally feasible. Existing security proofs for the device-independent repetition-code protocol (the most prominent form of advantage distillation) rely on fidelity-related security conditions, but previous bounds on the fidelity were not tight. We improve on those results by developing an algorithm that returns arbitrarily tight lower bounds on the fidelity. Our results give insight on how strong the fidelity-related security conditions are, and could also be used to compute some lower bounds on one-way protocol keyrates. Finally, we conjecture a necessary security condition for the protocol studied in this work, that naturally complements the existing sufficient conditions.

By integrating classical definitions within this broader perspective, the paper rigorously recontextualizes what constitutes physical computing devices and processes. It demonstrates how the compositional nature and relational structures of physical computing systems can be coherently formalized using category theory. This approach not only encapsulates recent formalisms in physical computing but also offers a structured method to explore the dynamic interactions within these systems.

AB We report that the birefringence of the polarization convertor in silicon-on-Insulator channel waveguide could be enlarged using photonic crystals. The photonic crystals consist of etched air holes shifted to the center of the waveguide. The polarization rotation due to the asymmetric modes in the shifted photonic crystal structure is investigated. The result shows that the length to convert 100% input light to the orthogonal polarization could be as short as 3.4 mu m. The device can be used in the integrated optical quantum computing system.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and symmetric informationally complete projectors (SICs) are crucial to many conceptual and practical aspects of quantum theory. Here, we develop their role in quantum nonlocality by (i) introducing families of Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by d-dimensional MUBs and SICs, respectively, (ii) proving device-independent certification of natural operational notions of MUBs and SICs, and (iii) using MUBs and SICs to develop optimal-rate and nearly optimal-rate protocols for device-independent quantum key distribution and device-independent quantum random number generation, respectively. Moreover, we also present the first example of an extremal point of the quantum set of correlations that admits physically inequivalent quantum realizations. Our results elaborately demonstrate the foundational and practical relevance of the two most important discrete Hilbert space structures to the field of quantum nonlocality.

The method processes real-time optical data from the optical service unit (OSU) using a series of tunable Fabry-Perot cavities (FPCs), synchronized and updated with a running key. Experimental validation demonstrates secure communication within the optical network's physical layer during standard OTU2 data transmission (10.709 Gbps), achieving an online transmission distance exceeding 100 km over typical single-mode fiber with a power loss of approximately 1.77 dB. The results indicate that this integrated approach significantly enhances the security of the optical physical layer in M-OTNs.

TI Quantum Nondemolition Measurements of Moving Target States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a protocol for probing the state of a quantum system by its resonant coupling and entanglement with a meter system. By continuous measurement of a time evolving meter observable, we infer the evolution of the entangled systems and, ultimately, the state and dynamics of the system of interest. The photon number in a cavity field is thus resolved by simulated monitoring of the Rabi oscillations of a resonantly coupled two-level system, and we propose to regard this as a practical extension of quantum nondemolition measurements with applications in quantum metrology and quantum computing.

TI QKD protected fiber-based infrastructure for time dissemination
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this study, we demonstrate the possibility to protect, with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a critical infrastructure as the fiber-based one used for time and frequency (TF) dissemination service. The proposed technique allows to disseminate secure and precise TF signals between two fiber-optic-connected locations, on a critical infrastructure, using both QKD and White Rabbit technique. This secure exchange enables the secret sharing of time information between two parties, allowing the synchronization of distant clocks with a stability of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$10<^>{-10}$$\end{document} at 1 s, traceable to the Italian time scale. When encrypted, the time signals provide no useful information to a third party regarding the synchronization status, resulting in a time stability degraded by two orders of magnitude.

TI Experimental validation of a reversal operator-based QKD polarization
   control method
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The ability to efficiently align the transmitter and receiver of a polarization-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system at initialization and during the exchange of qubits is critical for its correct operation, otherwise resulting in a reduction of the secret key rate. We address this issue by implementing a deterministic polarization compensation method based on the reversal operator of polarization variations. The working principle of this reversal operator is based on Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) measurements and their mapping on the Poincar & eacute; sphere, enabling fast tracking and compensation of polarization misalignments. Our experimental implementation demonstrates that this method allows for an accurate alignment of the polarization coding and measurement basis using only three QBER measurements. The results confirm that the reversal operator method is exceptionally time-efficient when compared to the widely used compensation methods, such as gradient-based algorithms, requiring at least 5x fewer QBER measurements.

TI Advantage of the Key Relay Protocol Over Secure Network Coding
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The key relay protocol (KRP) plays an important role in improving the performance and the security of quantum key distribution networks. On the other hand, there is also an existing research field called secure network coding (SNC), which has similar goal and structure. In this article, we analyze differences and similarities between KRPs in general and key relay using SNC schemes (KRPs-by-SNC) rigorously. We found, rather surprisingly, that there is a definite gap in security between KRPs in general and KRPs-by-SNC; that is, certain KRPs achieve better security than any SNC schemes on the same graph. We also found that this gap can be closed if we generalize the notion of SNC by adding authenticated public channels; that is, KRPs are equivalent to KRPs-by-SNC schemes augmented with authenticated public channels.

TI Secure and efficient quantum signature scheme based on the controlled
   unitary operations encryption
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS) protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP). Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In contrast with existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future investigations into the development of AQS protocols .

TI Locality, Realism, Ergodicity and Randomness in Bell's Experiment
SO ENTROPY
AB Assuming that there is no way of sending signals propagating faster than light and that free will exists, the loophole-free observed violation of Bell's inequalities demonstrates that at least one of three fundamental hypotheses involved in the derivation and observation of the inequalities is false: Locality, Realism, or Ergodicity. An experiment is proposed to obtain some evidence about which one is the false one. It is based on recording the time evolution of the rate of non-random series of outcomes that are generated in a specially designed Bell's setup. The results of such experiment would be important not only to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, but they would also have immediate practical impact on the efficient use of quantum-based random number generators and the security of Quantum Key Distribution using entangled states.

TI Analysis of phase noise effects in a coupled Mach-Zehnder interferometer
   for a much stabilized free-space optical link
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recently, new physics for unconditional security in a classical key distribution (USCKD) has been proposed and demonstrated in a frame of a double Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) as a proof of principle, where the unconditional security is rooted in MZI channel superposition. Due to environmental phase noise caused by temperature variations, atmospheric turbulences, and mechanical vibrations, free-space optical links have been severely challenged for both classical and quantum communications. Here, the double MZI scheme of USCKD is analyzed for greatly subdued environment-caused phase noise via double unitary transformation, resulting in potential applications of free-space optical links, where the free-space optical link has been a major research area from fundamental physics of atomic clock and quantum key distribution to potential applications of geodesy, navigation, and MIMO technologies in mobile communications systems.

TI Stable electroluminescence in ambipolar dopant-free lateral p-n
   junctions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Dopant-free lateral p-n junctions in the GaAs/AlGaAs material system have attracted interest due to their potential use in quantum optoelectronics (e.g., optical quantum computers or quantum repeaters) and ease of integration with other components, such as single electron pumps and spin qubits. A major obstacle to integration has been the unwanted charge accumulation at the p-n junction gap that suppresses light emission, either due to enhanced non-radiative recombination or due to inhibition of p-n current. Typically, samples must frequently be warmed to room temperature to dissipate this built-up charge and restore light emission in a subsequent cooldown. Here, we introduce a practical gate voltage protocol that clears this parasitic charge accumulation, in situ at low temperature, enabling the indefinite cryogenic operation of devices. This reset protocol enabled the optical characterization of stable, bright, dopant-free lateral p-n junctions with electroluminescence linewidths among the narrowest (<1meV; <0.5nm) reported in this type of device. It also enabled the unambiguous identification of the ground state of neutral free excitons (heavy and light holes) as well as charged excitons (trions). The free exciton emission energies for both photoluminescence and electroluminescence are found to be nearly identical (within 0.2meV or 0.1nm). The binding and dissociation energies for free and charged excitons are reported. A free exciton lifetime of 237 ps was measured by time-resolved electroluminescence, compared to 419 ps with time-resolved photoluminescence.

In most cases, our algorithms generate circuits with lower CNOT count and CNOT depth than the state of the art or have a significantly smaller running time for similar performances. We also provide methods that can be applied to our algorithms in order to trade an increase in the CNOT count for a decrease in execution time, thereby filling the gap between our algorithms and faster ones.

TI Entanglement-controlled vectorial meta-holography
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Metasurfaces can precisely manipulate the amplitude, phase, and polarization of incident light through subwavelength structures, greatly advancing the quantum meta-holographic imaging. However, the current methods of using quantum holography only control either the amplitude or the phase on the imaging plane, so the resulted scalar holography without the polarization distribution has limited imaging channels. Here, the vectorial meta-holography using entangled signal-idler photon pairs is experimentally demonstrated to realize remotely controlled multi-channel quantum imaging. By simultaneous control of the amplitude ratio between two cross-polarization holographic images and their phase difference on the image plane, the polarization distribution accordingly changes with the incident polarization state. The accurate correspondence ensures the correct reconstruction of 32 incident polarization states with an average fidelity up to 94.78%. This enables entangled idler photons to remotely control the holographic images reconstructed by the entangled signal photons, where the signal-to-noise ratio is as high as 10.78 dB, even for maximally mixed quantum states. This vectorial meta-holography using entangled states has a larger polarization state information capacity and will facilitate miniaturized quantum imaging and efficient quantum state tomography.

TI Two Novel Quantum Steganography Algorithms Based on LSB for Multichannel
   Floating-Point Quantum Representation of Digital Signals
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Currently, quantum steganography schemes utilizing the least significant bit (LSB) approach are primarily optimized for fixed-point data processing, yet they encounter precision limitations when handling extended floating-point data structures owing to quantization error accumulation. To overcome precision constraints in quantum data hiding, the EPlsb-MFQS and MVlsb-MFQS quantum steganography algorithms are constructed based on the LSB approach in this study. The multichannel floating-point quantum representation of digital signals (MFQS) model enhances information hiding by augmenting the number of available channels, thereby increasing the embedding capacity of the LSB approach. Firstly, we analyze the limitations of fixed-point signals steganography schemes and propose the conventional quantum steganography scheme based on the LSB approach for the MFQS model, achieving enhanced embedding capacity. Moreover, the enhanced embedding efficiency of the EPlsb-MFQS algorithm primarily stems from the superposition probability adjustment of the LSB approach. Then, to prevent an unauthorized person easily extracting secret messages, we utilize channel qubits and position qubits as novel carriers during quantum message encoding. The secret message is encoded into the signal's qubits of the transmission using a particular modulo value rather than through sequential embedding, thereby enhancing the security and reducing the time complexity in the MVlsb-MFQS algorithm. However, this algorithm in the spatial domain has low robustness and security. Therefore, an improved method of transferring the steganographic process to the quantum Fourier transformed domain to further enhance security is also proposed. This scheme establishes the essential building blocks for quantum signal processing, paving the way for advanced quantum algorithms. Compared with available quantum steganography schemes, the proposed steganography schemes achieve significant improvements in embedding efficiency and security. Finally, we theoretically delineate, in detail, the quantum circuit design and operation process.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Given a narrow signal over the real line, there is a limit to the localisation of its Fourier transform. In spaces of prime dimensions, Tao derived a sharp state-independent uncertainty relation which holds for the support sizes of a pure qudit state in two bases related by a discrete Fourier transform. We generalise Tao's uncertainty relation to complete sets of mutually unbiased (MU) bases in spaces of prime dimensions. The bound we obtain appears to be sharp for dimension three only. Analytic and numerical results for prime dimensions up to nineteen suggest that the bound cannot be saturated in general. For prime dimensions two to seven we construct sharp bounds on the support sizes in (d+1)

TI A 2 x 2 Quantum Dot Array in Silicon with Fully Tunable Pairwise
   Interdot Coupling
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have enabled linear arrays with more than 10 qubits. Scaling to two-dimensional (2D) arrays is essential for fault-tolerant implementations but introduces significant fabrication challenges due to the increased density of the gate electrodes. Moreover, implementing two-qubit entanglement control requires the addition of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in this dense gate structure. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all neighboring dots. Characterized at 4.2 K, the device exhibits exceptional tunability, supports the formation and isolation of both double- and triple-dot configurations, and achieves tunnel coupling control spanning up to 30 decades per volt. These results provide critical technical feedback and a foundational benchmark for advancing MOS spin qubit technology into the 2D regime.

TI Simultaneous estimation of three parameters with Heisenberg scaling

AB This work presents a quantum sensing interferometric scheme for the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters at the ultimate quantum scaling precision in a two-mode optical network. This scheme is experimentally feasible because it employs input Gaussian states such as squeezed and coherent states and a relatively low number of experimental runs. We focus on the precise and simultaneous measurement of two unknown phase shifts and an unknown beam splitter reflectivity, achieving Heisenberg scaling sensitivity in all three parameters without any constraints on the parameter values.

TI Deterministic controlled enhancement of local quantum coherence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate assisted enhancement of quantum coherence in a bipartite setting with control and target systems, which converts the coherence of the control qubit into the enhanced coherence of the target qubit. We assume that only incoherent operations and measurements can be applied locally and classical information can be exchanged. In addition, the two subsystems are also coupled by a fixed Hamiltonian whose interaction strength can be controlled. This coupling does not generate any local coherence from incoherent input states. We show that in this setting a measurement and feed-forward based protocol can deterministically enhance the coherence of the target system while fully preserving its purity. The protocol can be iterated and several copies of the control state can be consumed to drive the target system arbitrarily close to a maximally coherent state. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol with a photonic setup and observe the enhancement of coherence for up to five iterations of the protocol.

TI Non-local quantum interference of deterministically separated photons
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB Quantum entanglement enables a wide range of fundamental studies and practical applications in quantum optics, computing, and communication. In this work, we investigate two-photon interference using position-momentum entangled photons generated via Type-II Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). By employing a double-slit setup, we explore two distinct quantum interference phenomena: the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, where the photons pass through different slits, and NOON-state interference, where both photons traverse the same slit. We deterministically separate the two photons based on their orthogonal polarizations and demonstrate that both interference effects persist despite their distinguishability at the detectors. This result goes beyond the conventional understanding of two-photon interference and reveals a novel nonlocal HBT effect, where interference occurs even in the absence of spatial overlap, and is rooted in entanglement. Our findings deepen the understanding of quantum interference and open new avenues for applications in quantum optics and precision measurement.

TI The frustration-free fully packed loop model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider a quantum fully packed loop model on the square lattice with a frustration-free projector Hamiltonian and ring-exchange interactions acting on plaquettes. A boundary Hamiltonian is added to favor domain-wall boundary conditions and link ground state properties to the combinatorics and six-vertex model literature. We discuss how the boundary term fractures the Hilbert space into Krylov subspaces, and we prove that the Hamiltonian is ergodic within each subspace, leading to a series of energy-equidistant exact eigenstates in the lower end of the spectrum. Among them we systematically classify both finitely entangled eigenstates and product eigenstates. Using a recursion relation for enumerating half-plane configurations, we compute numerically the exact entanglement entropy of the ground state, confirming area law scaling. Finally, the spectrum is shown to be gapless in the thermodynamic limit with a trial state constructed by adding a twist to the ground state superposition.

TI Boiling Quantum Vacuum: Thermal Subsystems from Ground-State
   Entanglement
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In certain special circumstances, such as in the vicinity of a black hole or in a uniformly accelerating frame, vacuum fluctuations appear to give rise to a finite-temperature environment. This effect, currently without experimental confirmation, can be interpreted as a manifestation of quantum entanglement after tracing out vacuum modes in an unobserved region. In this work, we identify a class of experimentally accessible quantum systems where thermal density matrices emerge from vacuum entanglement. We show that reduced density matrices of lower-dimensional subsystems embedded in D-dimensional gapped Dirac fermion vacuum, either on a lattice or continuum, have a thermal form with respect to a lower-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian. Strikingly, we show that vacuum entanglement can even conspire to make a subsystem of a gapped system at zero temperature appear as a hot gapless system. We propose concrete experiments in cold-atom quantum simulators to observe the vacuum-entanglement-induced thermal states.

TI Characterizing the superposition of arbitrary random quantum states and
   a known quantum state
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The superposition of states is one of the most fundamental issues in the quantum world. Generally there do not exist physical operations to superpose two unknown random states with nonzero probability. We investigate the superposition problem of unknown qubit states with respect to a known qubit state. It is shown that under trace-nonincreasing completely positive operations the superposable state sets are located in some circles on the Bloch sphere. Meanwhile, we prove that the quantum states in a circle on the Bloch sphere are superposable with respect to a known state. Finally, for the high-dimensional case, we illustrate that any superposition transformation protocols will violate the no-cloning principle for almost all the states. Our results also promote the understanding and applications of the superposition principle in view of quantum no-go theorems.

AB A system consisting of two identical qubits not-resonantly interacting with a thermal quantum field of a lossless resonator with a Kerr media via degenerate two-photon transition is considered. An exact solution of the quantum Liouville equation for the total density matrix of the considered system is obtained. To solve the quantum evolution equation we used the dressed states representation. The complete set of dressed states is found. The exact solution of the quantum Liouville equation is used to calculate the time dependencies of qubit-qubit entanglement parameter (negativity) for Bell type entangled qubits states. The results showed that Kerr nonlinearity can diminish the amplitudes of the Rabi oscillations of entanglement parameter and suppress the effect of sudden death of entanglement.

TI Fully Tunable Hyperfine Interactions of Hole Spin Qubits in Si and Ge
   Quantum Dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Hole spin qubits are frontrunner platforms for scalable quantum computers, but state-of-the-art devices suffer from noise originating from the hyperfine interactions with nuclear defects. We show that these interactions have a highly tunable anisotropy that is controlled by device design and external electric fields. This tunability enables sweet spots where the hyperfine noise is suppressed by an order of magnitude and is comparable to isotopically purified materials. We identify surprisingly simple designs where the qubits are highly coherent and are largely unaffected by both charge and hyperfine noise. We find that the large spin-orbit interaction typical of elongated quantum dots not only speeds up qubit operations, but also dramatically renormalizes the hyperfine noise, altering qualitatively the dynamics of driven qubits and enhancing the fidelity of qubit gates. Our findings serve as guidelines to design high performance qubits for scaling up quantum computers.

TI Quantum supremacy through Fock state q-boson sampling with

AB Transmon qubits have traditionally been regarded as limited to random circuit sampling, incapable of performing Fock state boson sampling-a problem known to be classically intractable. This work challenges that assumption by introducing q-boson Fock state sampling, a variant in which transmon qubits can operate effectively. Through direct mapping to the q-boson formalism, we demonstrate that transmons possess the capability to achieve quantum supremacy in q-boson sampling tasks. This finding expands the potential applications of transmon-based quantum processors and paves the way for new avenues in quantum computation.

TI Quantum Maxwell's demon assisted by non-Markovian effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Maxwell???s demon is the quintessential example of information control, which is necessary for designing quantum devices. In thermodynamics, the demon is an intelligent being who utilizes the entropic nature of information to sort excitations between reservoirs, thus lowering the total entropy. So far, implementations of Maxwell???s demon have largely been limited to Markovian baths. In our work, we study the degree to which such a demon may be assisted by non-Markovian effects using a superconducting circuit platform. The setup is two baths connected by a demon-controlled qutrit interface, allowing the transfer of excitations only if the overall entropy of the two baths is lowered. The largest entropy reduction is achieved in a non-Markovian regime and, importantly, due to non-Markovian effects, the demon performance can be optimized through proper timing. Our results demonstrate that non-Markovian effects can be exploited to boost the information transfer rate in quantum Maxwell demons.

TI Tripartite entanglement in mixed-spin triangle trimmer
SO CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB Heisenberg model spin systems offer favourable and manageable physical settings for generating and manipulating entangled quantum states. In this work mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) Heisenberg spin trimmer with two different but isotropic Lande g-factors and two different exchange constants is considered. The study undertakes the task of finding the optimal parameters to create entangled states and control them by external magnetic field. The primary objective of this work is to examine the tripartite entanglement of a system and the dependence of the tripartite entanglement on various system parameters. Particularly, the effects of non-conserving magnetization are in the focus of our research. The source of non-commutativity between the magnetic moment operator and the Hamiltonian is non-uniformity of g-factors. To quantify the tripartite entanglement, an entanglement measure refered to as "tripartite negativity" has been used in this work.

TI Entanglement dynamics of spins using a few complex trajectories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we consider two spins initially prepared in a product of coherent states and study their entanglement dynamics due to a general interacting Hamiltonian. We adopt an approach that allowed the derivation of a semiclassical formula for the linear entropy of the reduced density operator, assumed as an entanglement quantifier. The resulting expression depends on sets of four trajectories, originated from the underlying classical description, and having mutually connected final phase-space points. Such classical elements, which are capable to reproduce the quantum entanglement even for long values of propagation time, arise when we assume a proper analytical continuation of the classical phase space onto a complex domain. We apply this theory to a particular physical system, showing that taking into account only a few sets of complex trajectories is enough to get an excellent agreement between the semiclassical linear entropy of the reduced density operator and its quantum counterpart.

TI Harvesting asymmetric steering via non-identical detectors
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We investigate asymmetric steering harvesting phenomenon involving two non-identical inertial detectors with different energy gaps, which interact locally with vacuum massless scalar fields. Our study assumes that the energy gap of detector B exceeds that of detector A. It is shown that A -> B steerability is bigger that B -> A steerability, implying that the observer with a small energy gap has more stronger steerability than the other one. We find that the energy gap difference can enlarge the harvesting-achievable range of A -> B steering, while it can also narrow the harvesting-achievable range of B -> A steering at the same time. In addition, the maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transformation between two-way steering and one-way steering in some cases, showing that B -> A steering suffers "sudden death" at the point of this parameter. These results suggest that asymmetric steering exhibits richer and more interesting properties than quantum entanglement harvested from vacuum quantum field.

TI Gaussian states of continuous-variable quantum systems provide universal
   and versatile reservoir computing
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum reservoir computing aims at harnessing the rich dynamics of quantum systems for machine-learning purposes. It can be used for online time series processing while having a remarkably low training cost. Here, we establish the potential of continuous-variable Gaussian states of linear dynamical systems for quantum reservoir computing. We prove that Gaussian resources are enough for universal reservoir computing. We find that encoding the input into Gaussian states is both a source and a means to tune the nonlinearity of the overall input-output map. We further show that the full potential of the proposed model can be reached by encoding to quantum fluctuations, such as squeezed vacuum, instead of classical fields or thermal fluctuations. Our results introduce a research paradigm for reservoir computing harnessing quantum systems and engineered Gaussian quantum states.
   Most attempts to delineate quantum machine-learning-related computing capabilities of continuous variables states have relied on non-Gaussian resources. Here, the authors show that linear systems with continuous-variable Gaussian states are a promising platform for the implementation of quantum reservoir computers with universal approximation capabilities

TI Advanced Optimization for Big Data Streams with Quantum Insights for
   Real-time Big Data Analytics
SO ADCAIJ-ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
   JOURNAL
AB Big data analytics encounters scalability, latency, and privacy challenges, especially within real-time streaming contexts. We propose the Privacy-Aware Quantum Stream (PAQS), a distributed framework inspired by quantum principles, to overcome these obstacles. PAQS utilizes quantum superposition to effectively represent high-dimensional data, quantum entanglement for sophisticated correlation analysis and anomaly detection, and federated learning combined with homomorphic encryption to maintain privacy without compromising performance. The adaptive switching mechanism balances quantum-inspired and classical processing according to sensitivity and dimensionality criteria. Experiments are conducted on three datasets-OpenStreetMap, MIMIC-III, and KITTI, which show significant improvements: a throughput of 2.53 TB/sec, a 60 % reduction in latency, an anomaly detection accuracy of 92.3 %, and an 85.4 % decrease in privacy violations when compared to baselines. These findings validate that PAQS provides consistent, secure, and scalable real-time analytics, positioning it as a strong solution for smart cities, healthcare, and autonomous transportation applications.

TI Machine learning statistical gravity from multi-region entanglement
   entropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Ryu-Takayanagi formula directly connects quantum entanglement and geometry. Yet the assumption of static geometry lead to an exponentially small mutual information between far-separated disjoint regions, which does not hold in many systems such as free fermion conformal field theories. In this paper, we proposed a microscopic model by superimposing entanglement features of an ensemble of random tensor networks of different bond dimensions, which can be mapped to a statistical gravity model consisting of a massive scalar field on a fluctuating background geometry. We propose a machine-learning algorithm that recovers the underlying geometry fluctuation from multi-region entanglement entropy data by modeling the bulk geometry distribution via a generative neural network. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we tested the model on a free fermion system and showed mutual information can be mediated effectively by geometric fluctuation. Remarkably, locality emerged from the learned distribution of bulk geometries, pointing to a local statistical gravity theory in the holographic bulk.

TI Product of random states and spatial (half-)wormholes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study how coarse-graining procedure of an underlying UV-complete quantum gravity gives rise to a connected geometry. It has been shown, quantum entanglement plays a key role in the emergence of such a geometric structure, namely a smooth Einstein-Rosen bridge. In this paper, we explore the possibility of the emergence of similar geometric structure from classical correlation, in the AdS/CFT setup. To this end, we consider a setup where we have two decoupled CFT Hilbert spaces, then choose a random typical state in one of the Hilbert spaces and the same state in the other. The total state in the fine-grained picture is of course a tensor product state, but averaging over the states sharing the same random coefficients creates a geometric connection for simple probes. Then, the apparent spatial wormhole causes a factorization puzzle. We argue that there is a spatial analog of half-wormholes, which resolves the puzzle in the similar way as the spacetime half-wormholes.

TI Fingerprinting Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride via Multi-Phonon
   Excitation
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gathered a lot of attention due to their favorable emission properties and the manifold of possible applications. Despite extensive scientific effort, the exact atomic origin of these emitters has remained unknown thus far. Recently, several studies have tied the emission in the yellow spectral region to carbon-related defects, but the exact atomic structure of the defects remains elusive. In this study, photoluminescence emission and excitation spectroscopy is performed on a large number of emitters within this region. By comparing the experimental data with theoretical predictions, the origin of yellow single photon emission in hexagonal boron nitride is determined. Knowledge of this atomic structure and its optical properties is crucial for the reliable implementation of these emitters in quantum technologies.
   Phonon-assisted excitation is conducted on a large number of single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride. For the majority of emitters in the yellow emission region a predominant coupling to a single phonon mode can be observed. This observation prevails at large detunings from the zero-phonon line of up to four phonon energies, allowing for conclusions about the underlying atomic defect. image

TI Dual-frequency Doppler-free spectroscopy for simultaneous laser
   stabilization in compact atomic physics experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Vapor-cell spectroscopy is an essential technique in many fields and is particularly relevant for quantum technologies. Most atom- and ion-trapping experiments rely on simultaneous spectroscopy of two atomic transitions, employing a separate apparatus for each transition. We demonstrate simultaneous spectroscopy on two atomic transitions, within a single apparatus, using spatially overlapped beams from two independent lasers. This method enables compact setups and offers superior spectroscopic performance, leading to sharper spectroscopy peaks, stronger absorption signals, and superior laser stability. Doppler-free locking features become accessible over a frequency range several hundred megahertz wider than for standard saturated absorption spectroscopy. Exploring the full parameter space associated with dual-frequency spectroscopy reveals a latticelike structure of sharp resonance features, which enhances experimental versatility by allowing laser frequency stabilization within a wide manifold of locations in two-dimensional frequency space. We present data for 133Cs and 85Rb and compare our results to a theoretical model. Employing the technique for frequency stabilization close to the D2 line of 85Rb results in an improvement in frequency stability by a factor typically between 2 and 3 for averaging times of up to 1 s. The technique will advance portable quantum technologies and facilitate high-precision measurements.

TI Performance advantage of discriminating one-versus-two incoherent
   sources based on quantum hypothesis testing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Detecting the presence of multiple incoherent sources is a fundamental and challenging task for quantum imaging, especially within sub-Rayleigh region. In this paper, the discrimination of one-versus-two point-like incoherent sources in symmetric and asymmetric scenarios is studied. We calculate the quantum lower bounds on error probabilities of making a decision after one-shot and multishot tests. The results are compared with the error probability of prior-based direct guess, and the minimal number of tests required to make a decision outperforming direct guess is discussed. We also show the asymptotic quantum lower bound for a large number of tests. For practical purposes, we propose a specific strategy along with decision rule of which can work without any prior knowledge. With respect to each of two scenarios, the error probability can approach the quantum lower bound in one-shot tests as well as multishot tests. In addition, the potential challenges and solutions in a realistic scenario are analyzed. Our results may contribute to real-world quantum imaging such as microscopy and astronomy.

TI Managing the Strategic Transformation of Higher Education through
   Artificial Intelligence
SO ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Considering the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and their potential implications for the higher education sector, this article seeks to critically evaluate the strategic adoption of AI in the framework of "smart universities". We envisage these innovative institutions as the imminent evolution in higher education, harnessing AI and quantum technologies to reshape academic and administrative processes. The core presumption is that through such integration, universities can achieve personalized learning trajectories, enhanced accessibility, economic efficiency, and a boost in overall operational performance. However, venturing into this new educational paradigm necessitates a thorough exploration of potential pitfalls, including questions surrounding educational quality, potential job losses, risks of bias, privacy breaches, and safety concerns. Our primary objective is to offer a balanced assessment to aid stakeholders in making informed strategic decisions about endorsing and advancing the smart university model. A pivotal factor in this discourse is the acceptance of qualifications from AI-enriched institutions by employers, a variable that may drastically redefine the education sector's trajectory. Within the context of a comprehensive analysis of its broader societal impact, this article also delves into the ramifications of AI-driven innovations for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

TI Room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance of single defects
   in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically active spins in solid-state materials hold promise for future quantum technologies. Here, the authors demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance at room temperature for single defects in a two-dimensional material, hexagonal boron nitride.
   Optically addressable solid-state spins are important platforms for quantum technologies, such as repeaters and sensors. Spins in two-dimensional materials offer an advantage, as the reduced dimensionality enables feasible on-chip integration into devices. Here, we report room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from single carbon-related defects in hexagonal boron nitride with up to 100 times stronger contrast than the ensemble average. We identify two distinct bunching timescales in the second-order intensity-correlation measurements for ODMR-active defects, but only one for those without an ODMR response. We also observe either positive or negative ODMR signal for each defect. Based on kinematic models, we relate this bipolarity to highly tuneable internal optical rates. Finally, we resolve an ODMR fine structure in the form of an angle-dependent doublet resonance, indicative of weak but finite zero-field splitting. Our results offer a promising route towards realising a room-temperature spin-photon quantum interface in hexagonal boron nitride.

TI Quantum Ghost Imaging by Sparse Spatial Mode Reconstruction
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In a conventional quantum imaging experiment, the image of the object is retrieved directly with single photon camera technology, or computationally with a single-pixel detector and pixelated projective masks. In all these approaches, the resolution of the image is dictated by the pixel resolution of the detection devices. In this paper, the traditional spatial basis of pixels is replaced with spatial modes, exploiting their unique features to enhance image fidelity and resolution and improve reconstruction accuracy through modal sparsity. This approach can be used even when the modes are not orthogonal, demonstrating the principle with highly efficient phase-only approximations to the modal basis. By numerical simulation and experimental analysis, the advantages of this approach are illustrated, which include faster convergence to the object, with higher signals and fidelity, which are demonstrated with an order of magnitude less masks than conventional approaches for the same fidelity in outcome. Unlike the basis of pixels, the resolution of the image is not dictated by the resolution of the detectors, opening a path to high-resolution quantum imaging of complex objects.

TI Quantum heat engines with Carnot efficiency at maximum power
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Heat engines constitute the major building blocks of modern technologies. However, conventional heat engines with higher power yield lesser efficiency and vice versa and respect various power-efficiency trade-off relations. This is also assumed to be true for the engines operating in the quantum regime. Here we show that these relations are not fundamental. We introduce quantum heat engines that deliver maximum power with Carnot efficiency in the one-shot finite-size regime. These engines are composed of working systems with a finite number of quantum particles and are restricted to one-shot measurements. The engines operate in a one-step cycle by letting the working system simultaneously interact with hot and cold baths via semilocal thermal operations. By allowing quantum entanglement between its constituents and, thereby, a coherent transfer of heat from hot to cold baths, the engine implements the fastest possible reversible state transformation in each cycle, resulting in maximum power and Carnot efficiency. Finally, we propose a physically realizable engine using quantum optical systems.

TI Magic state distillation from entangled states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Magic can be distributed nonlocally in many-body entangled states, such as the low energy states of condensed matter systems. Using the Bravyi-Kitaev magic state distillation protocol, we find that nonlocal magic is distillable and can improve the distillation outcome. We analyze a few explicit examples and show that spin squeezing can be used to convert nondistillable states into distillable ones. Our analysis also suggests that the conventional product input states assumed by magic distillation protocols are extremely atypical among general states with distillable magic. It further justifies the need for studying a diverse range of entangled inputs that yield magic states with high probability.

TI Semiclassical backreaction: A qualitative assessment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.

TI Cooperative-effect-induced one-way steering in open cavity magnonics
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose to generate and control stationary one-way steering with strong entanglement between photon and magnon modes by the cooperative effect of coherent coupling and dissipative coupling. Due to the combination of two couplings, the system becomes a parity-time-like symmetric non-Hermitian system, and two exceptional points (EPs)-like appear in the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues. We demonstrate that the especially obvious quantum entanglement and perfect one-way steering can be obtained around two EPs-like. The continuous variable entanglement and steering produced by this cooperative effect show stronger robustness to environment temperature and system dissipation than that induced by nonlinearity. The one-way steering directivity can be controlled by the relative phase of cooperative dissipation and the frequency detuning of the magnon mode. Our work shows the controllability advantage of the open cavity magnonic system and may open up a platform for the generation of stationary one-way steering.

TI Entanglement enhancement in cavity magnomechanics by an optical
   parametric amplifier
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method to enhance bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity magnomechanics using an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We analyze this system and identified parametric regimes where different types of entanglement are enhanced. We show that a proper choice of phase of the parametric amplifier leads to the enhancement of the bipartite entanglements. Moreover, the tripartite entanglement is also significantly enhanced in the presence of the OPA. The OPA not only enhances the strength of entanglement but also increases the domain of entanglement over a wider space of detunings as compared to the system when no OPA is present. Similarly, the robustness of entanglement against temperature is also enhanced. Another important consequence of the OPA is the fact that it relaxes the requirement of strong magnon-phonon coupling to generate cavity-magnon entanglement which is necessary for the case when the OPA is not present. We believe that the presented scheme is a step forward to realize robust quantum entanglement using current technology.

TI A semi exact solution for a metallic phase in a Holstein-Hubbard chain

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The nature of phase transition from an antiferromagnetic SDW polaronic Mott insulator to the paramagnetic bipolaronic CDW Peierls insulator is studied for the half-filled Holstein-Hubbard model in one dimension in the presence of Gaussian phonon anharmonicity. A number of unitary transformations performed in succession on the Hamiltonian followed by a general many-phonon averaging leads to an effective electronic Hamiltonian which is then treated exactly by using the Bethe-Ansatz technique of Lieb and Wu to determine the energy of the ground state of the system. Next using the Mott-Hubbard metallicity condition, local spin-moment calculation, and the concept of quantum entanglement entropy and double occupancy, it is shown that in a plane spanned by the electron-phonon coupling coefficient and onsite Coulomb correlation energy, there exists a window in which the SDW and CDW phases are separated by an intermediate phase that is metallic.

In particular, we survey the field of mesoscopic superpositions of nanoparticles and the potential of interferometric and non-interferometric experiments in space for the investigation of the superposition principle of quantum mechanics and the quantum-to-classical transition. We delve into the possibilities offered by the state-of-the-art of nanoparticle physics projected in the space environment and discuss the numerous challenges, and the corresponding potential advancements, that the space environment presents. In doing this, we also offer an ab-initio estimate of the potential of space-based interferometry with some of the largest systems ever considered and show that there is room for tests of quantum mechanics at an unprecedented level of detail.

TI Curvature of Gaussian quantum states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The space of quantum states can be endowed with a metric structure using the second order derivatives of the relative entropy, giving rise to the so-called Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov inner product. We explore its geometric properties on the submanifold of faithful, zero-displacement Gaussian states parameterised by their covariance matrices, deriving expressions for the geodesic equations, curvature tensors and scalar curvature. Our analysis suggests that the curvature of the manifold is strictly monotonic with respect to the von Neumann entropy, and thus can be interpreted as a measure of state uncertainty. This provides supporting evidence for the Petz conjecture in continuous variable systems.

TI Self-guided tomography of time-frequency qudits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB High-dimensional time-frequency encodings have the potential to significantly advance quantum information science; however, practical applications require precise knowledge of the encoded quantum states, which becomes increasingly challenging for larger Hilbert spaces. Self-guided tomography (SGT) has emerged as a practical and scalable technique for this purpose in the spatial domain. Here, we apply SGT to estimate time-frequency states using a multi-output quantum pulse gate. We achieve fidelities of more than 99% for 3- and 5-dimensional states without the need for calibration or post-processing. We demonstrate the robustness of SGT against statistical and environmental noise, highlighting its efficacy in the photon-starved regime typical of quantum information applications.

TI Risk-sensitive optimization for robust quantum controls
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Highly accurate and robust control of quantum operations is vital for the realization of error-correctible quantum computation. In this paper, we show that the robustness of high-precision controls can be remarkably enhanced through sampling-based stochastic optimization of a risk-sensitive (RS) loss function. Following the stochastic gradient-descent direction of this loss function, the optimization is guided to penalize poor-performance uncertainty samples in a tunable manner. We propose two algorithms, which are termed as the RS GRAPE and the adaptive RS GRAPE. Their effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical simulations, which is shown to be able to achieve high-control robustness while maintaining high fidelity.

TI Tuning-Confined States and Valley G-Factors by Quantum Dot Design in

SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Electrostatically confined quantum dots in bilayer graphene have shown potential as building blocks for quantum technologies. To operate the dots, e.g., as qubits, a precise understanding and control of the confined states and their properties is required. Herein, a large-scale numerical characterization of confined quantum states in bilayer graphene dots is performed over an extensive range of gate-tunable parameters such as the dot size, depth, shape, and the bilayer graphene gap. The dot states' orbital degeneracy, wave function distribution, and valley g-factor are established and the parametric dependencies to achieve different regimes are provided. It is found that the dot states are highly susceptible to gate-dependent confinement and material parameters, enabling efficient tuning of confined states and valley g-factor modulation by quantum dot design.

TI THE ENTANGLEMENT PROBLEM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL HYLOMORPHISM
SO RES PHILOSOPHICA
AB The theory of psychological hylomorphism has recently been advanced by David Charles as a viable alternative to physicalist and dualist theories of mind. According to Charles, a human or animal is a psycho-physical whole whose mental and physical properties are defined with reference to the whole. This is because it is a hylomorphic composite of matter and form, where the form contains the material principles of the composite in its definition. In this paper, we raise a difficulty concerning the individuation of forms in light of the quantum theory of matter, asking whether the phenomenon of quantum entanglement gives us reason to doubt that the micro-physical properties of a human or animal derive (solely) from the psycho-physical properties of a middle-sized whole. We suggest several ways of amending the theory of psychological hylomorphism to accommodate entanglement, including a proposal by Simpson, in which the cosmos counts as a psycho-physical whole, and a proposal by Koons, in which distinct substances share a `group form.'

TI Quantum Game-Based Study on the Incentive Mechanism for the Cooperative
   Distribution of E-Commerce Logistics Alliance
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Motivating active participation in e-commerce logistics alliances to enhance delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction has long been a societal interest. Leveraging the quantum game theory, this paper develops a model for incentivizing collaboration within these alliances. This model enables theoretical and numerical analysis of members' strategies and entanglement levels. The findings show that quantum strategies increase members' profits, achieving Nash equilibriums and Pareto optimal outcomes, outperforming the classical game theory. In addition, the size of quantum entanglement emerges as a critical determinant influencing members' active participation in collaborative distribution. Strengthening information sharing and aligning interests can enhance entanglement levels among members, making them more inclined to adopt strategies promoting active involvement in collaborative distribution. Moreover, members can adapt their strategies based on the initial entanglement in collaborative distribution, thereby incentivizing participation and reducing ethical risks. In conclusion, through numerical analysis, we present relevant strategies and recommendations for incentivizing collaborative distribution within e-commerce logistics alliances.

TI Keldysh nonlinear sigma model for a free-fermion gas under continuous
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum entanglement phase transitions have provided new insights into quantum many-body dynamics. Both disorders and measurements are found to induce similar entanglement transitions. Here, we provide a theoretical framework that unifies these two seemingly disparate concepts and discloses their internal connections. Specifically, we analytically analyze a d-dimensional free-fermion gas subject to continuous projective measurements. By mapping the Lindblad master equation to the functional Keldysh field theory, we develop an effective theory termed as the time-local Keldysh nonlinear sigma model, which enables us to analytically describe the physics of the monitored system. Our effective theory resembles that used to describe the disordered fermionic systems. As an application of the effective theory, we study the transport property and obtain a Drude-form conductivity where the elastic scattering time is replaced by the inverse measurement strength. According to these similarities, two different concepts, measurements and disorders, are unified in the same theoretical framework. A numerical verification of our theory and predictions is also provided.

TI Non-Gaussian entanglement criteria for atomic homodyne detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Homodyne measurement is a crucial tool widely used to address continuous variables for bosonic quantum systems. While an ideal homodyne detection provides a powerful analysis, e.g., to effectively measure quadrature amplitudes of light in quantum optics, it relies on the use of a strong reference field, the so-called local oscillator, typically in a coherent state. Such a strong coherent local oscillator may not be readily available, particularly for a massive quantum system like a Bose-Einstein condensate, posing a substantial challenge in dealing with continuous variables appropriately. It is necessary to establish a practical framework that includes the effects of nonideal local oscillators for a rigorous assessment of various quantum tests and applications. We here develop entanglement criteria beyond a Gaussian regime applicable for this realistic homodyne measurement that do not require assumptions on the state of local oscillators. We discuss the working conditions of homodyne detection to effectively detect non-Gaussian quantum entanglement under various states of local oscillators.

However, they are not the only example of topological bound states that can occur in such systems. Here, we study a model in which both Majorana and Tamm bound states compete. We show both numerically and analytically that, surprisingly, the Tamm state remains partially localized even when the spectrum becomes gapless. Despite this fact, we demonstrate that the Majorana polarization shows a clear transition between the two regimes.

TI Quantum Otto Heat Engine Using Polar Molecules in Pendular States
SO MOLECULES
AB Quantum heat engines (QHEs) are established by applying the principles of quantum thermodynamics to small-scale systems, which leverage quantum effects to gain certain advantages. In this study, we investigate the quantum Otto cycle by employing the dipole-dipole coupled polar molecules as the working substance of QHE. Here, the molecules are considered to be trapped within an optical lattice and located in an external electric field. We analyze the work output and the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine (QOHE) as a function of various physical parameters, including electric field strength, dipole-dipole interaction and temperatures of heat baths. It is found that by adjusting these physical parameters the performance of the QOHE can be optimized effectively. Moreover, we also examine the influences of the entanglement and relative entropy of coherence for the polar molecules in thermal equilibrium states on the QOHE. Our results demonstrate the potential of polar molecules in achieving QHEs.

TI Unconditional Wigner-negative mechanical entanglement with
   linear-and-quadratic optomechanical interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The generation of entangled states that display negative values of the Wigner function in the quantum phase space is a challenging task, particularly elusive for massive, and possibly macroscopic, systems such as mechanical resonators. In this work, we propose two schemes based on reservoir engineering for generating Wigner-negative entangled states unconditionally. We consider two noninteracting mechanical resonators that are radiation-pressure coupled to either one or two common cavity fields; the optomechanical coupling with the field(s) features both a linear and quadratic part in the mechanical displacement and the cavity is driven at multiple frequencies. We show analytically that both schemes stabilize a Wigner-negative entangled state that combines the entanglement of a two-mode squeezed vacuum with a cubic nonlinearity, which we dub cubic-phase entangled (CPE) state. We then perform extensive numerical simulations to test the robustness of Wigner-negative entanglement attained by approximate CPE states stabilized in the presence of thermal decoherence.

TI Reflected entropy in double holography
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Recently, the reflected entropy is proposed in holographic approach to describe the entanglement of a bipartite quantum system in a mixed state, which is identified as the area of the reflected minimal surface inside the entanglement wedge. In this paper, we study the reflected entropy in the doubly holographic setup, which contains the degrees of freedom of quantum matter in the bulk. In this context, we propose a notion of quantum entanglement wedge cross-section, which may describe the reflected entropy with higher-order quantum corrections. We numerically compute the reflected entropy in pure AdS background and black hole background in four dimensions, respectively. In general, the reflected entropy contains the contribution from the geometry on the brane and the contribution from the CFT. We compute their proportion for different Newton constants and find that their behaviors are in agreement with the results based on the semi-classical gravity and the correlation of CFT coupled to the bath CFT.

TI Aspects of quantum states asymmetry for the magnetic dipolar interaction
   dynamics
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We investigate the asymmetry properties of quantum states in relation to the Hamiltonian responsible for the magnetic dipolar interaction (MDI) dynamics, and we evaluate its relationship to entanglement production. We consider some classes of pure and mixed quantum states of two qubits evolved under MDI and, using the asymmetry measure defined via the Wigner-Yanase skew information, we describe the asymmetry dependence on the Hamiltonian parameters and initial conditions of the system. In addition, we define and calculate the dynamics of the asymmetry of local states, characterizing their temporal and interaction parameters dependence. Finally, because the MDI Hamiltonian has a null eigenvalue, the group generator-based asymmetry measure does not adequately quantify the state susceptibility with respect to the action of the subspace generated by the eigenvectors associated with this eigenvalue. For this reason, we also define and study the group element-based asymmetry measure with relation to the unitary operator associated with the MDI Hamiltonian.

The representation is useful to unveil the geometry associated with the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body state which may occasionally differ from the one suggested by the Hamiltonian of the system. Yet, the obtention of these entanglement links is a complex mathematical problem. In this work, we address this issue and propose several approximation techniques for matrix product states, free fermionic states, or in cases in which contiguous blocks are specially relevant. Along with this, we discuss the accuracy of the approximation for different types of states and partitions. Finally, we employ the link representation to discuss two different physical systems: the spin-1/2 long-range XXZ chain and the spin-1 bilinear biquadratic chain.

TI Relativistic effects on entangled single-electron traps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The manipulation of individual charged particles has been deeply explored in physics's theoretical and experimental domains during the past decades. It is the pillar of several existing devices used for metrology and sensing and is a promising platform for realizing future technologies, such as quantum computers. It is also known that in the relativistic regime, interactions between charged particles become affected by postCoulombian corrections, with the dominant couplings encoded in the Darwin Hamiltonian. The Darwin term has been extensively studied in atomic physics, where the interaction range is confined to the subangstrom scale. Still, there is a lack of understanding about whether (and when) Darwin's contributions are relevant at larger scales. In this paper, we explore the effects of these corrections in a system of two harmonically trapped electrons, where we look into the behavior of quantum entanglement present in the static and dynamical regimes. We explore the parameter space of the developed model and seek frequencies, distances, and squeezing parameters for which relativistic effects become relevant for the generation of entanglement.

TI Entangling the vibrational modes of two massive ferromagnetic spheres
   using cavity magnomechanics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a scheme to entangle the vibrational phonon modes of two massive ferromagnetic spheres in a dual-cavity magnomechanical system. In each cavity, a microwave cavity mode couples to a magnon mode (spin wave) via the magnetic dipole interaction, and the latter further couples to a deformation phonon mode of the ferromagnetic sphere via a nonlinear magnetostrictive interaction. We show that by directly driving the magnon mode with a red-detuned microwave field to activate the magnomechanical anti-Stokes process a cavity-magnon-phonon state-swap interaction can be realized. Therefore, if the two cavities are further driven by a two-mode squeezed vacuum field, the quantum correlation of the driving fields is successively transferred to the two magnon modes and subsequently to the two phonon modes, i.e., the two ferromagnetic spheres become remotely entangled. Our work demonstrates that cavity magnomechanical systems allow to prepare quantum entangled states at a more massive scale than currently possible with other schemes.

TI SOME NEW Z-EIGENVALUE LOCALIZATION SETS FOR EVEN-ORDER TENSORS AND THEIR
   APPLICATION IN THE GEOMETRIC MEASURE OF ENTANGLEMENT
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION
AB . We study Z-eigenvalue problems motivated by the geometric measure of quantum entanglement. Firstly, a new Z-eigenvalue localization set with parameters by Z-identity tensors is given. Secondly, some new Brauer-type Zeigenvalue inclusion sets by classifying the index set are presented. Thirdly, some lower and upper bounds for the Z-spectral radius of weakly symmetric nonnegative tensors are proposed, which improves some of the existing results. Finally, based on the connection between the geometric measure of entanglement of weakly symmetric pure states with nonnegative amplitudes and the Z-spectral theory of weakly symmetric nonnegative tensors, we propose sharp lower and upper bounds for the geometric measure of entanglement of multipartite pure states for two kinds of geometric measures with different definitions, respectively. The given numerical experiments are reported to show the efficiency of our results.

TI Tutorial: Cavity Quantum Optomechanics
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Exploring quantum physics in mancroscopic systems and manupulating these systems for various technological applications has been a topic of intense research in the last one decade or so. In this regard, the field of cavity quantum optomechanics turns out to be one of the most rapidly emerging area of research. It has opened many doors to study various open ended fundamental questions in quantum physics, apart from numerous possible applications. A typical cavity optomechanical system consists of two mirrors, one fixed while the other one is movable. These systems may be of micrometer or nano-meter in dimensions. The electromagnetic radiation incident on the system may get coupled to the mechanical motion of the movable mirror. This opto-mechanical coupling is the root of all phenomena such as quantum entanglement, state-transfer, squeezing and so on. In this short tutorial, basic concepts of cavity quantum optomechanics are discussed. We hope that this tutorial would motivate readers, both theorists and experimentalists, to take up advanced studies in this immensely fruitful area of research.

TI Phase transition and dynamics of qubits in coupled-cavity arrays with
   nonlinear topological photonics
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The topological properties of a coupled-cavity array corresponding to a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model have been investigated through the evolution of a edge cavity, with the Kerr-like nonlinearities added to the inter-cavity coupling strengths. In the topological phase, the state distribution is more localized at the first cavity with the nonlinearities enhanced. The phase transition occurs with the enhancement of nonlinearities after the system evolving for long time when the SSH model is initially at the phase-transition point or in the trivial phase. The entanglement dynamics of two atoms placed in the two edge cavities is explored, and it is found the coupled-cavity array with nonlinearities is more robust against the disturbance of the frequency of each cavity. Moreover, the dynamics and phase transition of a 2-dimensional kagome lattice with the Kerr-like nonlinearities is also discussed through the probability amplitude of the first site after evolving for long time.

TI Bounding entanglement entropy using zeros of local correlation matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Correlation functions and entanglement are two different aspects to characterize quantum many-body states. While many correlation functions are experimentally accessible, entanglement entropy (EE), the simplest characterization of quantum entanglement, is usually difficult to measure. In this Letter, we propose a protocol to bound EE by local measurements. This protocol utilizes local correlation matrices and focuses on their (approximate) zero eigenvalues. Given a quantum state, each (approximate) zero eigenvalue can be used to define a set of local projection operators. An auxiliary Hamiltonian can then be constructed by summing these projectors. When the construction only involves projectors of zero eigenvalues, we prove the EE of a subsystem is bounded by the ground-state degeneracy of the auxiliary Hamiltonian on this subsystem. When projectors from nonzero eigenvalues are included, we show the EE can be bounded by a thermal entropy of the subsystem. Our protocol can be applied experimentally to investigate exotic quantum many-body states prepared in quantum simulators.

TI Photon extraction enhancement of praseodymium ions in gallium nitride
   nanopillars
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Lanthanoid-doped Gallium Nitride (GaN) integrated into nanophotonic technologies is a promising candidate for room-temperature quantum photon sources for quantum technology applications. We manufactured praseodymium (Pr)-doped GaN nanopillars of varying size, and showed significantly enhanced room-temperature photon extraction efficiency compared to unstructured Pr-doped GaN. Implanted Pr ions in GaN show two main emission peaks at 650.3 nm and 651.8 nm which are attributed to P-3(0)-F-3(2) transition in the 4f-shell. The maximum observed enhancement ratio was 23.5 for 200 nm diameter circular pillars, which can be divided into the emitted photon extraction enhancement by a factor of 4.5 and the photon collection enhancement by a factor of 5.2. The enhancement mechanism is explained by the eigenmode resonance inside the nanopillar. Our study provides a pathway for Lanthanoid-doped GaN nano/micro-scale photon emitters and quantum technology applications.

TI Testing entanglement of annihilation photons
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a new experimental study of the quantum entanglement of photon pairs produced in positron-electron annihilation at rest. Each annihilation photon has an energy that is five orders of magnitude higher than the energy of photons in optical experiments. It provides a unique opportunity for controlled Compton pre-scattering of initial photons before the polarization measurements. The experimental setup includes a system of Compton polarimeters to measure the angular correlations of annihilation photons in initial and thus prepared pre-scattered states. For the first time, a direct comparison of the polarization correlations of initial and pre-scattered annihilation photons has been carried out. The angular distributions of scattered in polarimeters photons turned out to be the same for both types of events. Moreover, the correlation function in the Bell's inequality is also the same for both states. We discuss the implications of our results for quantum measurement theory and for the quantum-entangled positron emission tomography.

TI Angular correlations of causally-coherent primordial quantum
   perturbations
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We consider the hypothesis that nonlocal, omnidirectional, causally-coherent quantum entanglement of inflationary horizons may account for some well-known measured anomalies of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy on large angular scales. It is shown that causal coherence can lead to less cosmic variance in the large-angle power spectrum C ( l ) of primordial curvature perturbations on spherical horizons than predicted by the standard model of locality in effective field theory, and to new symmetries of the angular correlation function C(Theta). Causal considerations are used to construct an approximate analytic model for C(Theta) on angular scales larger than a few degrees. Allowing for uncertainties from the unmeasured intrinsic dipole and from Galactic foreground subtraction, causally-coherent constraints are shown to be consistent with measured CMB correlations on large angular scales. Reduced cosmic variance will enable powerful tests of the hypothesis with better foreground subtraction and higher fidelity measurements on large angular scales.

TI Topological superconductivity enhanced by exceptional points
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) emerge as edge states in topological superconductors and are promising for topological quantum computation, but their detection has so far been elusive. Here we show that non-Hermiticity can be used to obtain dramatically more robust MZMs. The enhanced properties appear as a result of an extreme instability of exceptional points to superconductivity, such that even a vanishingly small superconducting order parameter already opens a large energy gap, produces well-localized MZMs, and leads to strong superconducting pair correlations. Our work thus illustrates the large potential of enhancing electronic ordering, here in the form of topological superconductivity, using non-Hermitian exceptional points.

TI Demonstration of geometric diabatic control of quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Geometric effects can play a pivotal role in streamlining quantum manipulation. We demonstrate a geometric diabatic control, that is, perfect tunneling between spin states in a diamond by a quadratic sweep of a driving field. The field sweep speed for the perfect tunneling is determined by the geometric amplitude factor and can be tuned arbitrarily. Our results are obtained by testing a quadratic version of Berry's twisted Landau-Zener model. This geometric tuning is robust over a wide parameter range. Our work provides a basis for quantum control in various systems, including condensed-matter physics, quantum computation, and nuclear magnetic resonance.

TI Entanglement and entropy uncertainty in black hole quantum atmosphere
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB In this work, we investigate the properties of Hawking radiation induced by the quantum atmosphere beyond the event horizon, by considering two detectors in Schwarzschild spacetime with the parameterized Hartle-Hawking temperature. We explicitly study the dynamics of quantum entanglement and found that its characteristics are closely correlated with Hawking quantum radiation beyond the event horizon. Namely, its minimal value corresponds to the peak of Hawking radiation. By virtue of the mutual information, we demonstrate the complementary relationship of the information distribution in the black hole. In addition, we detailedly discuss the influence of distance from the center of black hole to particle, radius of event horizon and Hartle-Hawking constant on the entropy uncertainty in the current scenario, and the results interestingly show that there exists an opposite correlation between the entanglement and the entropy uncertainty. It is believed that our observation could provide a new perspective for understanding the black hole information paradox and black hole thermodynamics.

TI Exploring Consciousness Beyond Carbon-based Life: Integrating Quantum
   Phenomena, Holographic Principles, and Multiverse Theories
SO BIOMEDICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB This study explores the hypothesis that consciousness may transcend carbon-based life through principles of quantum entanglement, the holographic principle, orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR), and the multiverse hypothesis. In this regard, the interconnections between these theories and their implications for understanding consciousness were investigated. A Bayesian statistical framework was employed, establishing a prior probability of 0.5. Likelihood estimations were derived from empirical data related to the four key theories, culminating in a posterior probability assessment. Significant correlations were found, with a posterior probability of 0.72 supporting the hypothesis. Participants reported transformative experiences aligned with the theoretical constructs. The findings suggest a compelling framework for understanding consciousness beyond carbon-based life, highlighting the need for further research in this emerging field. The study's reliance on theoretical frameworks may limit empirical validation, and the subjective nature of consciousness experiences introduces variability in participant reports.

TI MIP* = RE
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB The complexity class NP characterizes the collection of computational problems that have efficiently verifiable solutions. With the goal of classifying computational problems that seem to lie beyond NP, starting in the 1980s complexity theorists have considered extensions of the notion of efficient verification that allow for the use of randomness (the class MA), interaction (the class IP), and the possibility to interact with multiple proofs, or provers (the class MIP). The study of these extensions led to the celebrated PCP theorem and its applications to hardness of approximation and the design of cryptographic protocols.
   In this work, we study a fourth modification to the notion of efficient verification that originates in the study of quantum entanglement. We prove the surprising result that every problem that is recursively enumerable, including the Halting problem, can be efficiently verified by a classical probabilistic polynomial-time verifier interacting with two all-powerful but noncommunicating provers sharing entanglement. The result resolves long-standing open problems in the foundations of quantum mechanics (Tsirelson's problem) and operator algebras (Cowles' embedding problem).

TI High-fidelity spatial mode transmission through a 1-km-long multimode
   fiber via vectorial time reversal
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The large number of spatial modes supported by standard multimode fibers is a promising platform for boosting the channel capacity of quantum and classical communications by orders of magnitude. However, the practical use of long multimode fibers is severely hampered by modal crosstalk and polarization mixing. To overcome these challenges, we develop and experimentally demonstrate a vectorial time reversal technique, which is accomplished by digitally pre-shaping the wavefront and polarization of the forward-propagating signal beam to be the phase conjugate of an auxiliary, backward-propagating probe beam. Here, we report an average modal fidelity above 80% for 210 Laguerre-Gauss and Hermite-Gauss modes by using vectorial time reversal over an unstabilized 1-km-long fiber. We also propose a practical and scalable spatial-mode-multiplexed quantum communication protocol over long multimode fibers to illustrate potential applications that can be enabled by our technique. The use of long multimode fibers for multiplexed quantum communication is hindered by modal crosstalk and polarisation mixing. Here, the authors use an auxiliary laser beam sent backwards from Bob to Alice, allowing her to pre-compensate for the spatial distortions and polarisation scrambling.

TI Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB While entanglement between distant parties has been extensively studied, entangled measurements have received relatively little attention despite their significance in understanding nonlocality and their central role in quantum computation and networks. We present a systematic study of entangled measurements, providing a complete classification of all equivalence classes of iso-entangled bases for projective joint measurements on two qubits. The application of this classification to the triangular network reveals that the elegant joint measurement, along with white noise, is the only measurement resulting in output permutation invariant probability distributions when the nodes are connected by Werner states. The paper concludes with a discussion of partial results in higher dimensions.

TI Unsuitability of cubic phase gates for non-Clifford operations on
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding, Clifford gates and error correction can be carried out using simple Gaussian operations. Still, non-Clifford gates, required for universality, require non-Gaussian elements. In their original proposal, GKP suggested a particularly simple method of using a single application of the cubic phase gate to perform the logical non-Clifford T gate. Here we show that this cubic phase gate approach performs extraordinarily poorly, even for arbitrarily large amounts of squeezing in the GKP state. Thus, contrary to common belief, the cubic phase gate is not suitable for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with GKP states.

TI Entanglement Witness for the Weak Equivalence Principle
SO ENTROPY
AB The Einstein equivalence principle is based on the equality of gravitational and inertial mass, which has led to the universality of a free-fall concept. The principle has been extremely well tested so far and has been tested with a great precision. However, all these tests and the corresponding arguments are based on a classical setup where the notion of position and velocity of the mass is associated with a classical value as opposed to the quantum entities.Here, we provide a simple quantum protocol based on creating large spatial superposition states in a laboratory to test the quantum regime of the equivalence principle where both matter and gravity are treated at par as a quantum entity. The two gravitational masses of the two spatial superpositions source the gravitational potential for each other. We argue that such a quantum protocol is unique with regard to testing especially the generalisation of the weak equivalence principle by constraining the equality of gravitational and inertial mass via witnessing quantum entanglement.

TI Rotational Doppler Effect With Vortex Beams: Fundamental Mechanism and
   Technical Progress
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Structured light beams such as optical vortices can carry the orbital angular momentum (OAM) with an unbounded quantum number. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the rotational Doppler effect with vortex light. Here we present an overview on the technical progress in measuring the rotational Doppler effect associated with OAM. This includes how a high-order OAM light beam is crucial for realizing high-sensitivity remote sensing of rotating objects. The basic physical mechanism of rotational Doppler effect is manifested from both perspectives of the wave property and the conservation law of energy. Besides, we summarize the extension of the rotational Doppler effect from linear optics to nonlinear optics, and to quantum realms. Also, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities of angular remote sensing in a realistic scenario for future applications.

TI Wavenumber-dependent magnetic losses in yttrium iron garnet-gadolinium
   gallium garnet heterostructures at millikelvin temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Magnons have inspired potential applications in modern quantum technologies and hybrid quantum systems due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, nanoscale scalability, and a unique set of experimentally accessible parameters for manipulating their dispersion. Such magnon-based quantum technologies demand long decoherence times, millikelvin temperatures, and minimal dissipation. Due to its low magnetic damping, the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG), grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), is the most promising material for this objective. To comprehend the magnetic losses of propagating magnons in such YIG-GGG heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures, we investigate magnon transport in a micrometer-thick YIG sample via propagating spin-wave spectroscopy measurements for temperatures between 4 K to 26 mK. We demonstrate an increase in the dissipation rate with wavenumber at cryogenic temperatures, caused by dipolar coupling to the partially magnetized GGG substrate. Additionally, we observe a temperature-dependent decrease in spin-wave transmission, attributed to rare earth ion relaxations. The critical role of the additional dissipation channels at cryogenic temperatures is underpinned by the comparison of the experimental results with theoretical calculations and micromagnetic simulations. Our findings strengthen the understanding of magnon losses at millikelvin temperatures, which is essential for the future detection of individual propagating magnons.

We identify the ground state system on a surface with the value assigned to the surface by a non-semisimple TQFT generalizing the Turaev-Viro model.

TI Protocol for certifying entanglement in surface spin systems using a
   scanning tunneling microscope
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Certifying quantum entanglement is a critical step toward realizing quantum-coherent applications. In this work, we show that entanglement of spins can be unambiguously evidenced in a scanning tunneling microscope with electron spin resonance by exploiting the fact that entangled states undergo a free time evolution with a distinct characteristic time constant that clearly distinguishes it from the time evolution of non-entangled states. By implementing a phase control scheme, the phase of this time evolution can be mapped back onto the population of one entangled spin, which can then be read out reliably using a weakly coupled sensor spin in the junction of the scanning tunneling microscope. We demonstrate through open quantum system simulations with currently available spin coherence times of T2 approximate to 300 ns, that a signal directly correlated with the degree of entanglement can be measured at temperatures of 100-400 mK accessible in sub-Kelvin scanning tunneling microscopes.

TI Recognition of orbital-angular-momentum modes with different topological
   charges and their unknown superpositions via machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Light beams carrying orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) play an important role in optical manipulation and communication owing to their unbounded state space. However, it is still challenging to efficiently discriminate different OAM modes and their superpositions. Here we demonstrate that neural networks can be trained to recognize OAM modes with different topological charges and unknown superpositions. Using intensity images of OAM modes generated in simulations and experiments as the input data, we illustrate that our neural network has the generalization power to recognize OAM modes beyond training areas with high accuracy, whose topological charges are up to +/- 8 and 104 for experimental and numerical data, respectively. Moreover, the trained neural network can correctly classify and predict arbitrary superpositions of two OAM modes with random topological charges. Our machine learning approach only requires a small portion of experimental samples and significantly reduces the cost in experiments.

TI Introduction to theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum optimal
   control
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum optimal control (QOC) is a set of methods for designing time-varying electromagnetic fields to perform operations in quantum technologies. This tutorial paper introduces the basic elements of this theory based on the Pontryagin maximum principle, in a physicist-friendly way. An analogy with classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is proposed to present the main results used in this field. Emphasis is placed on the different numerical algorithms to solve a QOC problem. Several examples ranging from the control of two-level quantum systems to that of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a one-dimensional optical lattice are studied in detail, using both analytical and numerical methods. Codes based on shooting method and gradient-based algorithms are provided. The connection between optimal processes and the quantum speed limit is also discussed in two-level quantum systems. In the case of BEC, the experimental implementation of optimal control protocols is described, both for two-level and many-level cases, with the current constraints and limitations of such platforms. This presentation is illustrated by the corresponding experimental results.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are simple statistical models defined on a bipartite graph which have been successfully used in studying more complicated many-body systems, both classical and quantum. In this work, we exploit the representation power of RBMs to provide an exact decomposition of many-body contact interactions into one-body operators coupled to discrete auxiliary fields. This construction generalizes the well known Hirsch's transform used for the Hubbard model to more complicated theories such as pionless effective field theory in nuclear physics, which we analyze in detail. We also discuss possible applications of our mapping for quantum annealing applications and conclude with some implications for RBM parameter optimization through machine learning.

TI Topology Optimization of High-Performance Optomechanical Resonator
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB High quality mechanical resonators are critical for driving advances in quantum information technologies, precision sensing, and optomechanics. However, achieving compact resonator designs that maintain high performance is a key challenge. In this study, a new class of compact resonators optimized to operate at higher-order eigenmodes is presented, achieving both high frequencies and enhanced quality factor-frequency (Qf) products. By employing topology optimization to maximize the damping dilution factor, these resonators achieve minimized edge bending losses and enhanced intrinsic damping. Their high-(Qf) performance and compact form factor position these resonators as promising candidates for applications in quantum information transduction, advanced optomechanical systems, and next-generation sensing technologies.

TI Bound Entanglement in Thermalized States and Black Hole Radiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the mixed-state entanglement structure of chaotic quantum many-body systems at late times using the recently developed equilibrium approximation. A rich entanglement phase diagram emerges when we generalize this technique to evaluate the logarithmic negativity for various universality classes of macroscopically thermalized states. Unlike in the infinite-temperature case, when we impose energy constraints at finite temperature, the phase diagrams for the logarithmic negativity and the mutual information become distinct. In particular, we identify a regime where the negativity is extensive but the mutual information is subextensive, indicating a large amount of bound entanglement. When applied to evaporating black holes, these results imply that there is quantum entanglement within the Hawking radiation long before the Page time, although this entanglement may not be distillable into Einstein Podolsky-Rosen pairs. We claim that at this earlier time, rather than the Page time, information about diaries thrown into the black hole first starts to leak out.

TI Conversion of twisted light to twisted excitons using carbon nanotubes
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Carbon nanotubes are explored as a means of coherently converting the orbital angular momentum of light to an excitonic form that is more amenable to quantum information processing. An analytical analysis, based on dynamical conductivity, is used to show that orbital angular momentum is conserved, modulo N, for a carbon nanotube illuminated by radially polarized, twisted light. This result is numerically demonstrated using real-time time-dependent density functional theory which captures the absorption of twisted light and the subsequent transfer of twisted excitons. The results suggest that carbon nanotubes are promising candidates for constructing optoelectronic circuits in which quantum information is more readily processed while manifested in excitonic form.

TI Entanglement based tomography to probe new macroscopic forces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum entanglement provides a novel way to test short distance physics in the nonrelativistic regime. We will provide a protocol to potentially test new physics by bringing two charged massive particle interferometers adjacent to each other. Being charged, the two superpositions will be entangled via electromagnetic interactions mediated by the photons, including the Coulomb and the Casimir-Polder potential. We will bring a method of entanglement based tomography to seek time evolution of very small entanglement phases to probe new physical effects mediated by hitherto unknown macroscopic force which might be responsible for entangling the two charged superpositions modeled by the Yukawa type potential. We will be able to constrain the Yukawa couplings alpha >= 10(-35) for r >= 10(-6) m for new physics occurring in the electromagnetic sector, and in the gravitational potential alpha(g) >= 10(-8) for r >= 10(-6) m. Furthermore, our protocol can also constrain the axionlike particle mass and coupling, which is complimentary to the existing experimental bounds.

AB We work out a quantum-theoretic model in complex Hilbert space of a recently performed test on co-occurrencies of two concepts and their combination in retrieval processes on specific corpuses of documents. The test violated the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt version of Bell's inequalities ('CHSH inequality'), thus indicating the presence of entanglement between the combined concepts. We make use of a recently elaborated 'entanglement scheme' and represent the collected data in the tensor product of Hilbert spaces of the individual concepts, showing that the identified violation is due to the presence of a strong form of entanglement, involving both states and measurements and reflecting the meaning connection between the component concepts. These results provide a significant confirmation of the presence of quantum structures in corpuses of documents, like it is the case for the entanglement identified in human cognition.

TI Certified Quantum Random-Number Generator Based on Single-Photon
   Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum entanglement represents an ideal resource to guarantee the security of random numbers employed in many scientific and cryptographic applications. However, entanglement-based certified random number generators are particularly challenging to implement. Here, we demonstrate a certified quantum random number generator based on momentum-polarization entangled single-photon states. The use of single-photon entanglement allows an attenuated laser source to be employed and a simple setup where only linear optical components are utilized. For the latter, a semi-device-independent modeling of the photonic quantum random number generator is developed, which certifies a minimum entropy of (2.5 +/- 0.5)%, corresponding to a generation rate of 4.4 kHz. At the expenses of a higher level of trust in the system, the certified minimum entropy can be increased to (30.1 +/- 0.5)%, implying a generation rate of 52.7 kHz. Our results show that a simple optical implementation combined with an accurate modeling provide an entanglement-based high-security quantum random number generator using imperfect devices.

TI Transport of non-classical light mediated by topological domain walls in
   a SSH photonic lattice
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Advancements in photonics technologies have significantly enhanced their capability to facilitate experiments involving quantum light, even at room temperature. Nevertheless, fully integrating photonic chips that include quantum light sources, effective manipulation and transport of light minimizing losses, and appropriate detection systems remains an ongoing challenge. Topological photonic systems have emerged as promising platforms to protect quantum light properties during propagation, beyond merely preserving light intensity. In this work, we delve into the dynamics of non-classical light traversing a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattice with topological domain walls. Our focus centers on how topology influences the quantum properties of light as it moves across the array. By precisely adjusting the spacing between waveguides, we achieve dynamic repositioning and interaction of domain walls, facilitating effective beam-splitting operations. Our findings demonstrate high-fidelity transport of non-classical light across the lattice, replicating known results that are now safeguarded by the topology of the system. This protection is especially beneficial for quantum communication protocols with continuous variable states. Our study enhances the understanding of light dynamics in topological photonic systems and paves the way for high-fidelity, topology-protected quantum communication.

TI Kitaev interactions through extended superexchange pathways in the
   jeff=1/2 Ru3+ honeycomb magnet
   RuP3SiO11
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Magnetic materials are composed of the simple building blocks of magnetic moments on a crystal lattice that interact via magnetic exchange. Yet from this simplicity emerges a remarkable diversity of magnetic states. Some reveal the deep quantum mechanical origins of magnetism, for example, quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in which magnetic moments remain disordered at low temperatures despite being strongly correlated through quantum entanglement. A promising theoretical model of a QSL is the Kitaev model, composed of unusual bond-dependent exchange interactions, but experimentally, this model is challenging to realise. Here we show that the material requirements for the Kitaev QSL survive an extended pseudo-edge-sharing superexchange pathway of Ru3+ octahedra within the honeycomb layers of the inorganic framework solid, RuP3SiO11. We confirm the requisite j(eff) = 1/2 state of Ru3+ in RuP3SiO11 and resolve the hierarchy of exchange interactions that provide experimental access to an unexplored region of the Kitaev model.

TI Study of entanglement via a multi-agent dynamical quantum game
SO PLOS ONE
AB At both conceptual and applied levels, quantum physics provides new opportunities as well as fundamental limitations. We hypothetically ask whether quantum games inspired by population dynamics can benefit from unique features of quantum mechanics such as entanglement and nonlocality. For doing so, we extend quantum game theory and demonstrate that in certain models inspired by ecological systems where several predators feed on the same prey, the strength of quantum entanglement between the various species has a profound effect on the asymptotic behavior of the system. For example, if there are sufficiently many predator species who are all equally correlated with their prey, they are all driven to extinction. Our results are derived in two ways: by analyzing the asymptotic dynamics of the system, and also by modeling the system as a quantum correlation network. The latter approach enables us to apply various tools from classical network theory in the above quantum scenarios. Several generalizations and applications are discussed.

TI Computing Shor's algorithmic steps with interference patterns of
   classical light
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB When considered as orthogonal bases in distinct vector spaces, the unit vectors of polarization directions and the Laguerre-Gaussian modes of polarization amplitude are inseparable, constituting a so-called classical entangled light beam. Equating this classical entanglement to quantum entanglement necessary for computing purpose, we show that the parallelism featured in Shor's factoring algorithm is equivalent to the concurrent light-path propagation of an entangled beam or pulse train. A gedanken experiment is proposed for executing the key algorithmic steps of modular exponentiation and Fourier transform on a target integer N using only classical manipulations on the amplitudes and polarization directions. The multiplicative order associated with the sought-after integer factors is identified through a four-hole diffraction interference from sources obtained from the entangled beam profile. The unique mapping from the fringe patterns to the computed order is demonstrated through simulations for the case N = 15.

CY JUL 20-22, 2021

AB Rank-metric code-based cryptography relies on the hardness of decoding a random linear code in the rank metric. The Rank Support Learning problem (RSL) is a variant where an attacker has access to N decoding instances whose errors have the same support and wants to solve one of them. This problem is for instance used in the Durandal signature scheme [5]. In this paper, we propose an algebraic attack on RSL which often outperforms the previous attacks to solve this problem when the number of instances is of the order of the one used in Durandal. We build upon [8], where similar techniques are used to solve MinRank and RD. However, our analysis is simpler and overall our attack relies on very elementary assumptions compared to standard Grobner bases attacks. In particular, our results show that key recovery attacks on Durandal are more efficient than was previously thought, especially in a parameter range where the RD attack from [8] is not the most powerful.

TI Quantum data parallelism in quantum neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum neural networks hold promise for achieving lower generalization error bounds and enhanced computational efficiency in processing certain datasets. However, the integration of quantum superposition in data parallelism-a key aspect in the applications of classical neural network-has been largely unexplored in the context of quantum neural networks. Here, we demonstrate the effective application of quantum parallelism, via quantum superposition and entanglement, to achieve data parallelism in generic quantum neural network models. We address two classes of encoding schemes for the training data: as orthogonal and nonorthogonal quantum states, respectively. With orthogonal encoding, we rigorously prove that parallel and individual training are equivalent in terms of the loss function, a result directly derived from quantum entanglement; with nonorthogonal encoding, we show that parallel computing remains viable, and quantum interference among data becomes notable. We perform a comparative numerical analysis in these different scenarios, exploring various quantum neural networks with or without superposed data input, highlighting the validity of quantum data parallelism.

TI Entangled q-convolutional neural nets
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a machine learning model, the q-CNN model, sharing key features with convolutional neural networks and admitting a tensor network description. As examples, we apply q-CNN to the MNIST and Fashion MNIST classification tasks. We explain how the network associates a quantum state to each classification label, and study the entanglement structure of these network states. In both our experiments on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we observe a distinct increase in both the left/right as well as the up/down bipartition entanglement entropy (EE) during training as the network learns the fine features of the data. More generally, we observe a universal negative correlation between the value of the EE and the value of the cost function, suggesting that the network needs to learn the entanglement structure in order the perform the task accurately. This supports the possibility of exploiting the entanglement structure as a guide to design the machine learning algorithm suitable for given tasks.

TI Experimental quantum speed-up in reinforcement learning agents
SO NATURE
AB As the field of artificial intelligence advances, the demand for algorithms that can learn quickly and efficiently increases. An important paradigm within artificial intelligence is reinforcement learning', where decision-making entities called agents interact with environments and learn by updating their behaviour on the basis of the obtained feedback. The crucial question for practical applications is how fast agents learn(2). Although various studies have made use of quantum mechanics to speed up the agent's decision-making process(3,4), a reduction in learning time has not yet been demonstrated. Here we present a reinforcement learning experiment in which the learning process of an agent is sped up by using a quantum communication channel with the environment. We further show that combining this scenario with classical communication enables the evaluation of this improvement and allows optimal control of the learning progress. We implement this learning protocol on a compact and fully tunable integrated nanophotonic processor. The device interfaces with telecommunication-wavelength photons and features a fast active-feedback mechanism, demonstrating the agent's systematic quantum advantage in a setup that could readily be integrated within future large-scale quantum communication networks.

TI Self-testing of a single quantum system from theory to experiment
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Self-testing allows one to characterise quantum systems under minimal assumptions. However, existing schemes rely on quantum nonlocality and cannot be applied to systems that are not entangled. Here, we introduce a robust method that achieves self-testing of individual systems by taking advantage of contextuality. The scheme is based on the simplest contextuality witness for the simplest contextual quantum system-the Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky inequality for the qutrit. We establish a lower bound on the fidelity of the state and the measurements as a function of the value of the witness under a pragmatic assumption on the measurements. We apply the method in an experiment on a single trapped Ca-40(+) using randomly chosen measurements and perfect detection efficiency. Using the observed statistics, we obtain an experimental demonstration of self-testing of a single quantum system.

TI A classical fluid mechanics description of the spin-up and spin-down
   states that violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB The multipolar spherical vortices of any degree & ell;, which are exact solutions to the classical nonlinear equation of motion for a perfect fluid, exhibit two possible polarizations determined by the sign of the radial wavenumber k. We propose that the spin-up and spin-down states of spin- 1/2 quantum particles correspond to these two classical polarization states of & ell;=1 vortices. In the presence of a homogeneous background vorticity field 2 nu, these vortices precess around the axis defined by nu and propagate with a drift velocity equal to 2 nu/k. This drift enables the experimental separation of vortices with opposite polarizations. It is shown that the correlation between measurements of the drift velocity 2 nu/k for pairs of vortices, as observed by two independent observers, can lead to violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality-suggesting a classical physics explanation of quantum entanglement.

TI Entanglement and Bell nonlocality in
   τ+τ- at the BEPC
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality are two phenomena that occur only in quantum systems. In both cases, these are correlations between two subsystems that are classically absent. Traditionally, these phenomena have been measured in low-energy photon and electron experiments, but more recently they have also been measured in high-energy particle collider environments. In this work, we propose measuring the entanglement and Bell nonlocality in the tau+tau- state near and above its kinematic threshold at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC). We find that in the existing dataset, entanglement is observable if systematic uncertainties are kept to 1%. In the upcoming run between 4.0 and 5.6 GeV, the entanglement is predicted to be measurable with a precision better than 4% and Bell nonlocality can be established at 5 sigma as long as systematic uncertainty can be controlled at level of 0.5%-2.0%, depending on the center-of-mass energy.

TI Gyroscope measurements of the precession and nutation of Earth's axis
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB High-precision, Sagnac interferometry has long been proposed as a route to test fundamental questions in physics such as the magnitude of relativistic precessions (e.g., the Lense-Thirring effect). Although many elaborate experiments have been performed using, for example, matter wave interferometry or even quantum entanglement, none are within six orders of magnitude of the sensitivity and stability required to achieve such a measurement. We report on the operation of a free space ring laser gyroscope over a period of 250 days under an ambient pressure stabilizing vessel continuously in an unperturbed underground laboratory. Because we measure relative to local inertial space, the precession and nutation motion of Earth's axis are intrinsically contained in the observations. It is demonstrated that optical interferometry, using an ultrastable cavity, yields an accuracy limit for rotation sensing of 48 parts per billion (i.e., picoradians per second), less than an order of magnitude away from the regime in which relativistic effects can be measured.

TI Decoherence of photon entanglement by transmission through brain tissue
   with Alzheimer?s disease
SO BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The generation, manipulation and quantification of non-classical light, such as quantum-entangled photon pairs, differs significantly from methods with classical light. Thus, quantum measures could be harnessed to give new information about the interaction of light with matter. In this study we investigate if quantum entanglement can be used to diagnose disease. In particular, we test whether brain tissue from subjects suffering from Alzheimer's disease can be distinguished from healthy tissue. We find that this is indeed the case. Polarization-entangled photons traveling through brain tissue lose their entanglement via a decohering scattering interaction that gradually renders the light in a maximally mixed state. We found that in thin tissue samples (between 120 and 600 micrometers) photons decohere to a distinguishable lesser degree in samples with Alzheimer's disease than in healthy-control ones. Thus, it seems feasible that quantum measures of entangled photons could be used as a means to identify brain samples with the neurodegenerative disease.

TI How gravitational fluctuations degrade the high-dimensional spatial
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Twisted photons carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) are competent candidates for future interstellar communications. However, the gravitational fluctuations are ubiquitous in spacetime. Thus a fundamental question arises naturally as to how the gravitational fluctuations affect the coherence and the degree of high-dimensional OAM entanglement when twisted photons travel across the textures of curved spacetime. Here, we consider the covariant scalar Helmholtz equations and the Minkowski metric with fluctuations of Gaussian distribution and formulate analytically the equations describing the motion for twisted light in the Laguerre-Gaussian mode space. It is seen that the OAM cannot remain conserved in the presence of gravitational fluctuations. Furthermore, two-photon density matrices are derived for interstellar OAM quantum entanglement distribution, and the degree of entanglement degradation is characterized by purity and negativity. It is revealed that the higher-dimensional OAM entanglement is more susceptible to spacetime fluctuations. We believe that our findings will be of fundamental importance for the future interstellar quantum communications with twisted photons.

TI High-dimensional orbital angular momentum multiplexing nonlinear
   holography
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Nonlinear holography has been identified as a vital platform for optical multiplexing holography because of the appearance of new optical frequencies. However, due to nonlinear wave coupling in nonlinear optical processes, the nonlinear harmonic field is coupled with the input field, laying a fundamental barrier to independent control of the interacting fields for holography. We propose and experimentally demonstrate high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing nonlinear holography to overcome this problem. By dividing the wavefront of the fundamental wave into different orthogonal OAM channels, multiple OAM and polarization-dependent holographic images in both the fundamental wave and second-harmonic wave have been reconstructed independently in the spatial frequency domain through a type-II second harmonic generation process. Moreover, this method can be easily extended to cascaded chi(2) nonlinear optical processes for multiplexing in more wavelength channels, leading to potential applications in multicasting in optical communications, multiwavelength display, multidimensional optical storage, anticounterfeiting, and optical encryption.

TI Holographic reconstruction of black hole spacetime: machine learning and
   entanglement entropy
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the metallic property of these models.

TI Screening the Coulomb interaction leads to a prethermal regime in
   two-dimensional bad conductors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The absence of thermalization in certain isolated many-body systems is of great fundamental interest. Many-body localization (MBL) is a widely studied mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered quantum systems, but it is still not understood precisely how the range of interactions affects the dynamical behavior and the existence of MBL, especially in dimensions D > 1. By investigating nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly disordered D = 2 electron systems with power-law interactions proportional to 1/r(alpha) and poor coupling to a thermal bath, here we observe MBL-like, prethermal dynamics for alpha = 3. In contrast, for alpha = 1, the system thermalizes, although the dynamics is glassy. Our results provide important insights for theory, especially since we obtained them on systems that are much closer to the thermodynamic limit than synthetic quantum systems employed in previous studies of MBL. Thus, our work is a key step towards further studies of ergodicity breaking and quantum entanglement in real materials.

TI Steady-state entanglement generation via Casimir-Polder interactions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the generation of steady-state entanglement between two atoms resulting from the fluctuation-mediated Casimir-Polder (CP) interactions near a surface. Starting with an initially separable state of the atoms, we analyze the atom-atom entanglement dynamics for atoms placed at distances in the range of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim 25$$\end{document} nm away from a planar medium, examining the effect of medium properties and geometrical configuration of the atomic dipoles. We show that perfectly conducting and superconducting surfaces yield an optimal steady-state concurrence value of approximately 0.5. Furthermore, although the generated entanglement decreases with medium losses for a metal surface, we identify an optimal distance from the metal surface that assists in entanglement generation by the surface. While fluctuation-mediated interactions are typically considered detrimental to the coherence of quantum systems at nanoscales, our results demonstrate a mechanism for leveraging such interactions for entanglement generation.

AB Classical classifiers such as the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) struggle to accurately classify video Quality of Delivery (QoD) time-series due to the challenge in constructing suitable decision boundaries using small amounts of training data. We develop a technique that takes advantage of a quantum-classical hybrid infrastructure called Quantum-Enhanced Codecs (QEC). We evaluate a (1) purely classical, (2) hybrid kernel, and (3) purely quantum classifier for video QoD congestion classification, where congestion is either low, medium or high, using QoD measurements from a real networking test-bed. Findings show that the SVC performs the classification task 4% better in the low congestion state and the kernel method performs 6.1% and 10.1% better for the medium and high congestion states. Empirical evidence suggests that when the SVC is trained on a very low amount of data, the classification accuracy varies significantly depending on the quality of the training data, however, the variance in classification accuracy of quantum models is significantly lower. Classical video QoD classifiers benefit from the quantum data embedding techniques. They learn better decision regions using less training data.

TI Entanglement signatures of a percolating quantum system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In this Letter, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder, free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties due to massively degenerate ground states. We define and calculate appropriate entanglement measures such as typical, annealed, and quenched entanglement entropy in both one and two dimensions, showing they can capture both geometrical aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. In particular, while typical and annealed entanglements show a volume law character directly dependent on the number of zero modes in the system, quenched entanglement is generally an area law albeit showing characteristic signatures of the classical percolation transition. Our work presents an exotic interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.

TI Quantizing DNA Metallization for Site-Defined Growth of Single Quantum
   Emitters
SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB DNA-templated silver nanoclusters promise subwavelength light control for quantum photonics, sensing, and bioimaging. Yet deterministic one-per-site growth has lacked explicit quantitative criteria. Here, we define quantitative thresholds that render site-specific nucleation of single silver nanoclusters reliable on DNA origami. By systematically varying oligocytosine (OligoC) handle number and Ag+ reduction conditions, we identify a cooperative rule-of-10 OligoC handles per site and an AgNO3 loading window that together produce one nanocluster per site with nanometer registration. To enable tailored emitter permutations, we program one-, two-, and three-site arrays and show that the same thresholds hold for both substrate-bound and solution-phase syntheses. Correlative atomic force microscopy and single-molecule two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy verify single-emitter behavior, bright two-photon fluorescence, single-step photobleaching, and approximate to 1.2 ns lifetimes. We expect that these explicit rules provide physical insight into DNA-directed nucleation and open practical routes to addressable quantum emitters and scalable nanocluster arrays for integrated nanophotonics and single-molecule sensing.

TI Anomalous weak values via a single photon detection
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Is it possible that a measurement of a spin component of a spin-1/2 particle yields the value 100? In 1988 Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman argued that upon pre- and postselection of particular spin states, weakening the coupling of a standard measurement procedure ensures this paradoxical result(1). This theoretical prediction, called weak value, was realised in numerous experiments(2-9), but its meaning remains very controversial(10-19), since its "anomalous" nature, i.e., the possibility to exceed the eigenvalue spectrum, as well as its "quantumness" are debated(20-22). We address these questions by presenting the first experiment measuring anomalous weak values with just a single click, without the need for statistical averaging. The measurement uncertainty is significantly smaller than the gap between the measured weak value and the nearest eigenvalue. Beyond clarifying the meaning of weak values, demonstrating their non-statistical, single-particle nature, this result represents a breakthrough in understanding the foundations of quantum measurement, showing unprecedented measurement capability for further applications of weak values to quantum photonics.

TI Quantum-Classical Autoencoder Architectures for End-to-End Radio
   Communication
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB End-to-end radio communication needs to be optimized against noisy channel conditions and other distortion effects. This paper presents a novel concept, a set of hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architectures with a comprehensive feasibility study using standard encoded radio signals, to evaluate quantum neural network design requirements for the radio context. The hybrid scenarios include single-sided, i.e., quantum encoder (transmitter) or quantum decoder (receiver), as well as fully quantum radio channel autoencoder (transmitter-receiver) systems. We provide detailed formulas for each scenario and validate our model through an extensive set of simulations. Our results demonstrate model robustness and adaptability. Supporting experiments are conducted utilizing 4 and 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation schemes and we expect that the model is adaptable to more general encoding schemes. We explore model performance against both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading models. Our numerical findings highlight the importance of designing efficient quantum neural network architectures for meeting application performance constraints - including data re-uploading methods, encoding schemes, and core layer structures.

TI Distinguishing an Anderson insulator from a many-body localized phase
   through space-time snapshots with neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Distinguishing the dynamics of an Anderson insulator from a many-body localized (MBL) phase is an experimentally challenging task. In this work we propose a method based on machine learning techniques to analyze experimental snapshot data to separate the two phases. We show how to train three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using space-time Fock-state snapshots, allowing us to obtain dynamic information about the system. We benchmark our method on a paradigmatic model showing MBL (t-V model with quenched disorder), where we obtain a classification accuracy of approximate to 80% between an Anderson insulator and an MBL phase. We underline the importance of providing temporal information to the CNNs and we show that CNNs learn the crucial difference between an Anderson localized and an MBL phase, namely the difference in the propagation of quantum correlations. Particularly, we show that the misclassified MBL samples are characterized by an unusually slow propagation of quantum correlations, and thus the CNNs label them wrongly as Anderson localized. Finally, we apply our method to the case with quasiperiodic potential, known as the Aubry-Andre model (AA model). We find that the CNNs have more difficulties in separating the two phases. We show that these difficulties are due to the fact that the MBL phase of the AA model is characterized by a slower information propagation for numerically accessible system sizes.

TI Statistical Link Between Bell Nonlocality and Uncertainty Relations in
   Quantum Mechanics
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Bell nonlocality refers to the nonlocal correlation strength among quantum systems that cannot be duplicated using local hidden variables, and uncertainty relations set the lower bound on the sum or product of variances for incompatible observables within a quantum system. In this work, the study of linking these two fundamental quantum features in terms of statistical characteristics within Bell tests is initiated. Two statistics determine the state-dependent quantum upper bounds of the Bell values: the expectation values of local observables, and the joint uncertainty that is the product of local uncertainty. Specifically, it is showed that the joint measurement uncertainty determines the upper bounds of covariant Bell inequalities in the quantum region, with more joint measurement uncertainty required for more covariant correlation strengths. Conversely, the covariant Bell value defines the lower bound of joint uncertainty. In addition, given the maximally entangled states, Tsirelson's bounds of Bell inequalities can be achieved when the joint uncertainty reaches the maximum.

TI Monogamy of nonlocal games
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Bell monogamy relations characterize the trade-offs in Bell inequality violations among pairs of players in multiplayer settings. In this work, we introduce a method for extending monogamy relations from a distinguished set of configurations to monogamy relations in all possible multiplayer settings. Applying this approach, we show that nonlocality in the Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt game arises in only two cases: the original two-player scenario and the four-player scenario on a line. While the bound for this four-player scenario follows from known quadratic monogamy constraints, we also establish two six-party numerical monogamy relations that cannot be derived from existing results. In particular, we show there are points in the intersection of consecutive quadratic Bell monogamy relations which are not quantum realizable. Finally, we present a nonlocal game in which a single player can simultaneously saturate the quantum value with two other parties. This is an example of a nonlocal game unaffected by the monogamous nature of quantum entanglement.

TI The fastest generation of multipartite entanglement with natural
   interactions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Natural interactions among multiple quantum objects are fundamentally composed of two-body terms only. In contradistinction, single global unitaries that generate highly entangled states typically arise from Hamiltonians that couple multiple individual subsystems simultaneously. Here, we study the time to produce strongly nonclassical multipartite correlations with a single unitary generated by the natural interactions. We restrict the symmetry of two-body interactions to match the symmetry of the target states and focus on the fastest generation of multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, W, Dicke and absolutely maximally entangled states for up to seven qubits. These results are obtained by constraining the energy in the system and accordingly can be seen as state-dependent quantum speed limits for symmetry-adjusted natural interactions. They give rise to a counter-intuitive effect where the creation of particular entangled states with an increasing number of particles does not require more time. The methods used rely on extensive numerical simulations and analytical estimations.

TI Testing entanglement and Bell inequalities in H-ZZ
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We discuss quantum entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities in the H - ZZ decay, in particular when the two Z-bosons decay into light leptons. Although such process implies an important suppression of the statistics, this is traded by clean signals from a "quasi maximally entangled" system, which makes it very promising to check these crucial phenomena at high energy. In this paper we devise a novel framework to extract from H - ZZ data all significant information related to this goal, in particular spin correlation observables. In this context we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for entanglement in terms of only two parameters. Likewise, we obtain a sufficient and improved condition for the violation of Bell-type inequalities. The numerical analysis shows that with a luminosity of L = 300 fb-1 entanglement can be probed at > 3a level. For L = 3 ab-1 (HL-LHC) entanglement can be probed beyond the 5a level, while the sensitivity to a violation of the Bell inequalities is at the 4.5a level.

TI Analysis of Neural Network Predictions for Entanglement Self-Catalysis
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to classifying an extensive range of phenomena in quantum theory. From detecting quantum phase transitions to identifying Bell non-locality, it has been established that classical machines can learn genuine quantum features via classical data. Quantum entanglement is one of the uniquely quantum phenomena in that range, as it has been shown that neural networks can be used to classify different types of entanglement. Our work builds on this topic. We investigate whether distinct models of neural networks can learn how to detect catalysis and self-catalysis of entanglement for pure states. Additionally, we also study whether a trained machine can detect another related phenomenon - which we dub transfer knowledge. As we build our models from scratch, besides making all the codes available, we can study a whole gamut of paradigmatic measures, including accuracy, execution time, training time, bias in the training data set and so on.

TI Review on fractional vortex beam
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB As an indispensable complement to an integer vortex beam, the fractional vortex beam has unique physical properties such as radially notched intensity distribution, complex phase structure consisting of alternating charge vortex chains, and more sophisticated orbital angular momentum modulation dimension. In recent years, we have noticed that the fractional vortex beam was widely used for complex micro-particle manipulation in optical tweezers, improving communication capacity, controllable edge enhancement of image and quantum entanglement. Moreover, this has stimulated extensive research interest, including the deep digging of the phenomenon and physics based on different advanced beam sources and has led to a new research boom in micro/nano-optical devices. Here, we review the recent advances leading to theoretical models, propagation, generation, measurement, and applications of fractional vortex beams and consider the possible directions and challenges in the future.

TI Deep learning of topological phase transitions from entanglement
   aspects: An unsupervised way
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective to recognize different phases of matter and produce phase diagrams in the parameter space of interest, while they usually require prior labeled data to perform well. Here, we propose a machine learning procedure, mainly in an unsupervised manner, which can first identify topological/nontopological phases and then refine the locations of phase boundaries. By following this proposed procedure, we expand our previous work on the one-dimensional p-wave superconductor [Tsai et al., Phys. Rev. B 102, 054512 (2020)] and further on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with an emphasis on using the quantum-entanglement-based quantities as the input features. We find that our method not only reproduces similar results to the previous work with sharp phase boundaries but importantly it also does not rely on prior knowledge of the phase space, e.g., the number of phases present. We conclude with a few remarks about its potential, limitations, and explanatory power.

TI Detection uncertainty of fractional optical vortex with angle
   indeterminacy in different transformation-based OAM-sorting systems
SO OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING
AB This paper reveals and compares the detection uncertainty of fractional optical vortex (FOV) in several coordinate transformation-based OAM sorting systems. It is found that the azimuth of the phase mutation of FOV will significantly affect the output results. Hence, there will be a detection uncertainty when analyzing FOV with angle indeterminacy, but this uncertainty is not come from the FOV itself, but from the OAM sorting system. Therefore, FOV with angular uncertainty could be a tool to evaluate the robustness of the OAM sorting system. From the simulation and comparison, the features of the earliest proposed log-polar sorting method and the improved beam-copying, spiral-transformation sorting methods are studied. We conclude that the beam-copying sorting method is better for OAM spectrum analysis, and the spiral-transformation sorting with appropriate parameters performs better for average OAM detection.

TI On fundamental aspects of quantum extreme learning machines
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) have emerged as a promising framework for quantum machine learning. Their appeal lies in the rich feature map induced by the dynamics of a quantum substrate-the quantum reservoir-and the efficient post-measurement training via linear regression. Here, we study the expressivity of QELMs by decomposing the prediction of QELMs into a Fourier series. We show that the achievable Fourier frequencies are determined by the data encoding scheme, while Fourier coefficients depend on both the reservoir and the measurement. Notably, the expressivity of QELMs is fundamentally limited by the number of Fourier frequencies and the number of observables, while the complexity of the prediction hinges on the reservoir. As a cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the exponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows (randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show how this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles. In particular, our result on the reservoir-induced concentration strongly indicates that quantum reservoirs drawn from a highly random ensemble make QELM models unscalable. Our analysis elucidates the potential and fundamental limitations of QELMs and lays the groundwork for systematically exploring quantum reservoir systems for other machine learning tasks.

TI Parametric t-stochastic neighbor embedding with quantum neural network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonparametric data visualization method in classical machine learning. It maps the data from the high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space, especially a two-dimensional plane, while maintaining the relationship or similarities between the surrounding points. In t-SNE, the initial position of the low-dimensional data is randomly determined, and the visualization is achieved by moving the low-dimensional data to minimize a cost function. Its variant called parametric t-SNE uses neural networks for this mapping. In this paper, we propose to use quantum neural networks for parametric t-SNE to reflect the characteristics of high-dimensional quantum data on low-dimensional data. We use fidelity-based metrics instead of Euclidean distance in calculating high-dimensional data similarity. To verify our proposed method, we visualize both classical (Iris dataset) and quantum (time-depending Hamiltonian dynamics) data for classification tasks. Since this method allows us to represent a quantum dataset in a higher dimensional Hilbert space by a quantum dataset in a lower dimension while keeping their similarity, the proposed method can also be used to compress quantum data for further quantum machine learning.

TI Quantum adversarial metric learning model based on triplet loss function
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Metric learning plays an essential role in image analysis and classification, and it has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a quantum adversarial metric learning (QAML) model based on the triplet loss function, where samples are embedded into the high-dimensional Hilbert space and the optimal metric is obtained by minimizing the triplet loss function. The QAML model employs entanglement and interference to build superposition states for triplet samples so that only one parameterized quantum circuit is needed to calculate sample distances, which reduces the demand for quantum resources. Considering the QAML model is fragile to adversarial attacks, an adversarial sample generation strategy is designed based on the quantum gradient ascent method, effectively improving the robustness against the functional adversarial attack. Simulation results show that the QAML model can effectively distinguish samples of MNIST and Iris datasets and has higher & epsilon;-robustness accuracy over the general quantum metric learning. The QAML model is a fundamental research problem of machine learning. As a subroutine of classification and clustering tasks, the QAML model opens an avenue for exploring quantum advantages in machine learning.

TI Quantum neural network cost function concentration dependency on the
   parametrization expressivity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Although we are currently in the era of noisy intermediate scale quantum devices, several studies are being conducted with the aim of bringing machine learning to the quantum domain. Currently, quantum variational circuits are one of the main strategies used to build such models. However, despite its widespread use, we still do not know what are the minimum resources needed to create a quantum machine learning model. In this article, we analyze how the expressiveness of the parametrization affects the cost function. We analytically show that the more expressive the parametrization is, the more the cost function will tend to concentrate around a value that depends both on the chosen observable and on the number of qubits used. For this, we initially obtain a relationship between the expressiveness of the parametrization and the mean value of the cost function. Afterwards, we relate the expressivity of the parametrization with the variance of the cost function. Finally, we show some numerical simulation results that confirm our theoretical-analytical predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these two important aspects of quantum neural networks are explicitly connected.

TI Quantum Image Processing Algorithm Using Line Detection Mask Based on

AB Line detection is a fundamental technique in image processing. It can extract the required information, while the information that does not need attention can be ignored, thus reducing the amount of data. At the same time, line detection is also the basis of image segmentation and plays an important role in this process. In this paper, we implement a quantum algorithm based on a line detection mask for novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR). We build a quantum algorithm for line detection in different directions and design a quantum circuit for line detection. The detailed module designed is also provided. On a classical computer, we simulate the quantum method, and the simulation results prove the feasibility of the quantum method. By analyzing the complexity of quantum line detection, we find that the computation complexity of the proposed method is improved compared to some similar edge detection algorithms.

AB Accurate cropland classification is important for sustainable land management and agricultural planning. Remote sensing data, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), have proven instrumental in vegetation monitoring. Traditional machine learning and deep learning have shown remarkable results in land classification using remote sensing data. However, when facing an immense volume of data or high-dimensional features, deep learning requires large models, extensive parameters, and substantial training resources. To address the above issues, this paper proposes Cropland Quantum Learning (CQL), a quantum-classical hybrid method that utilizes quantum machine learning to extract features from geospatial information, and integrates it with a single-layer fully connected classifier to locate cultivation regions of a given target crop. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on NDVI and EVI datasets. The results show that the proposed CQL can achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning while significantly reducing the number of model parameters. In some datasets, even achieved better results in multiple metrics. This study provides a new solution for quantum-enhanced approaches in geospatial analysis.

TI An uncertainty view on complementarity and a complementarity view on
   uncertainty
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Since the uncertainty about an observable of a system prepared in a quantum state is usually described by its variance, when the state is mixed, the variance is a hybrid of quantum and classical uncertainties. Besides that complementarity relations are saturated only for pure, single-quanton, quantum states. For mixed states, the wave-particle quantifiers never saturate the complementarity relation and can even reach zero for a maximally mixed state. So, to fully characterize a quanton it is not sufficient to consider its wave-particle aspect; one has also to regard its correlations with other systems. In this paper, we discuss the relation between quantum correlations and local classical uncertainty measures, as well as the relation between quantum coherence and quantum uncertainty quantifiers. We obtain a complete complementarity relation for quantum uncertainty, classical uncertainty, and predictability. The total quantum uncertainty of a d-paths interferometer is shown to be equivalent to the Wigner-Yanase coherence and the corresponding classical uncertainty is shown to be an entanglement monotone. The duality between complementarity and uncertainty is used to derive quantum correlations measures that complete the complementarity relations for l(1)-norm and l(2)-norm coherences. Besides, we show that Brukner-Zeilinger's invariant information quantifies both the wave and particle characters of a quanton and we obtain a sum uncertainty relation for the generalized Gell-Mann's matrices.

TI Scrambling Transition in a Radiative Random Unitary Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study quantum information scrambling in a random unitary circuit that exchanges qubits with an environment at a rate p. As a result, initially localized quantum information not only spreads within the system, but also spills into the environment. Using the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) to characterize scrambling, we find a nonequilibrium phase transition in the directed percolation universality class at a critical swap rate p(c): for p < p(c) the ensemble-averaged OTOC exhibits ballistic growth with a tunable light cone velocity, while for p > p(c) the OTOC fails to percolate within the system and vanishes uniformly within a finite timescale, indicating that all local operators are rapidly swapped into the environment. To elucidate its information-theoretic consequences, we demonstrate that the transition in operator spreading coincides with a transition in an observer's ability to decode the system's initial quantum information from the swapped-out, or "radiated," qubits. We present a simple decoding scheme which recovers the system's initial information with perfect fidelity in the nonpercolating phase, and with continuously decreasing fidelity with decreasing swap rate in the percolating phase. Depending on the initial state of the swapped-in qubits, we further observe a corresponding entanglement transition in the coherent information from the system into the radiated qubits.

   Classifiers
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB A quantum machine is a human-made device whose collective motion follows the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum machine learning (QML) is machine learning for quantum computers. The availability of quantum processors has led to practical applications of QML algorithms in the remote sensing field. Quantum machines can learn from fewer data than non-quantum machines, but because of their low processing speed, quantum machines cannot be applied to an image that has hundreds of thousands of pixels. Researchers around the world are exploring applications for QML and in this work, it is applied for pseudo-labelling of samples. Here, a PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) hyperspectral dataset is prepared by quantum-based pseudo-labelling and 11 different machine learning algorithms viz., support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), XGBoost, support vector classifier (SVC) + decision tree (DT), RF + SVC, RF + DT, XGBoost + SVC, XGBoost + DT, and XGBoost + RF with this dataset are evaluated. An accuracy of 86% was obtained for the classification of pine trees using the hybrid XGBoost + decision tree technique.

TI Benchmarking the Role of Particle Statistics in Quantum Reservoir
   Computing
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum reservoir computing is a neuro-inspired machine learning approach harnessing the rich dynamics of quantum systems to solve temporal tasks. It has gathered attention for its suitability for NISQ devices, for easy and fast trainability, and for potential quantum advantage. Although several types of systems have been proposed as quantum reservoirs, differences arising from particle statistics have not been established yet. In this work, the ability of bosons, fermions, and qubits are assessed and compared to store information from past inputs by measuring linear and nonlinear memory capacity. While, in general, the performance of the system improves with the Hilbert space size, it is shown that also the information spreading capability is a key factor. For the simplest reservoir Hamiltonian choice, and for each boson limited to at most one excitation, fermions provide the best reservoir due to their intrinsic nonlocal properties. On the other hand, a tailored input injection strategy allows the exploitation of the abundance of degrees of freedom of the Hilbert space for bosonic quantum reservoir computing and enhances the computational power compared to both qubits and fermions.

TI A novel feature selection method based on quantum support vector machine
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Feature selection is critical in machine learning to reduce dimensionality and improve model accuracy and efficiency. The exponential growth in feature space dimensionality for modern datasets directly results in ambiguous samples and redundant features, which can severely degrade classification accuracy. Quantum machine learning offers potential advantages for addressing this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel method, quantum support vector machine feature selection (QSVMF), integrating quantum support vector machines with multi-objective genetic algorithm. QSVMF optimizes multiple simultaneous objectives: maximizing classification accuracy, minimizing selected features and quantum circuit costs, and reducing feature covariance. We apply QSVMF for feature selection on a breast cancer dataset, comparing the performance of QSVMF against classical approaches with the selected features. Experimental results show that QSVMF achieves superior performance. Furthermore, the Pareto front solutions of QSVMF enable analysis of accuracy versus feature set size trade-offs, identifying extremely sparse yet accurate feature subsets. We contextualize the biological relevance of the selected features in terms of known breast cancer biomarkers. This work highlights the potential of quantum-based feature selection to enhance machine learning efficiency and performance on complex real-world data.

TI Effective Floquet Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace-preserving map, also known as a quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map in order to identify if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective Lindbladian in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.

TI Electrically Driven Strain-Activated Defect Emission from Hexagonal
   Boron Nitride at Room Temperature
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Defect-related emission in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) could operate at room temperature with high brightness, enabling potential applications in quantum photonics. However, limited by the large bandgap of hBN, defect emission in hBN has mainly been excited in optical ways. Herein, with an Ag nanowire/hBN/graphene tunnel junction, electrically driven strain-activated defect emission from hBN is demonstrated. The Ag nanowire serves as both the bottom electrode and the strain source to activate the defect in hBN. Under external biases, quantum tunneling occurs preferably at the defect regions in hBN layers, i.e., local conduction channels, leading to sub-band transition (or defect emission with the electron-photon coupling efficiency about 10-6) from hBN. The bias-induced electroluminescence spatially overlaps with the laser excited photoluminescence with bias-independent spectra, indicating that both are originating from the same defects. The research extends the study of defect emission in hBN from optical excitation to electrical excitation, which paves the way for electrically driven hBN-based light sources.

TI Nonclassical light from finite-range interactions in a two-dimensional
   quantum mirror
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Excitons in a semiconductor monolayer form a collective resonance that can reflect resonant light with extraordinarily high efficiency. Here, we investigate the nonlinear optical properties of such atomistically thin mirrors and show that finite-range interactions between excitons can lead to the generation of highly nonclassical light. We describe two scenarios, in which optical nonlinearities arise either from direct photon coupling to excitons in excited Rydberg states or from resonant two-photon excitation of Rydberg excitons with finite-range interactions. The latter case yields conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency and thereby provides an efficient mechanism for single-photon switching between high transmission and reflectance of the monolayer, with a tunable dynamical timescale of the emerging photon-photon interactions. Remarkably, it turns out that the resulting high degree of photon correlations remains virtually unaffected by Rydberg-state decoherence, in excess of nonradiative decoherence observed for ground-state excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors. This robustness to imperfections suggests a promising approach to quantum photonics at the level of individual photons.

TI Free-Space Applications of Silicon Photonics: A Review
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Silicon photonics has recently expanded its applications to delivering free-space emissions for detecting or manipulating external objects. The most notable example is the silicon optical phased array, which can steer a free-space beam to achieve a chip-scale solid-state LiDAR. Other examples include free-space optical communication, quantum photonics, imaging systems, and optogenetic probes. In contrast to the conventional optical system consisting of bulk optics, silicon photonics miniaturizes an optical system into a photonic chip with many functional waveguiding components. By leveraging the mature and monolithic CMOS process, silicon photonics enables high-volume production, scalability, reconfigurability, and parallelism. In this paper, we review the recent advances in beam steering technologies based on silicon photonics, including optical phased arrays, focal plane arrays, and dispersive grating diffraction. Various beam-shaping technologies for generating collimated, focused, Bessel, and vortex beams are also discussed. We conclude with an outlook of the promises and challenges for the free-space applications of silicon photonics.

TI Many-Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3
   Quantum Dots
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB All-inorganic lead-halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light-emitting devices (in the weak light-matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light-matter interaction at room temperature. Many-body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single-photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single-QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration-interaction (CI) calculations, the size-dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7 to 17 meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30 to 9 nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15 to 30 meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all-inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

TI Fidelity Restorable Universal Linear Optics
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Universal multiport interferometers that can be programmed to perform any unitary or linear transformation turn into an important building block for both classical and quantum photonics. These interferometers typically utilize the mathematical framework of U(2) unitary matrix decomposition techniques and comprise a mesh of 2 similar to 2 beam splitters and phase shifters. All of them are, however, inherently fidelity limited as their U(2)-based deployment approach leads to imbalanced path losses without supporting any fidelity restoration mechanism. Herein, a novel Universal Generalized Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (UGMZI) architecture is presented that migrates from U(2) decomposition techniques and adopts a recursive U(N) decomposition, exploiting cascaded size-augmenting N similar to N beam splitters and phase shifters. The design can natively support fidelity restoration and safeguard absolute fidelity, while outperforming the state-of-theart designs also with respect to phase-error-induced fidelity performance properties. Finally, it is demonstrated that its fidelity restoration properties turn the design into the optimal architecture for constructing any real/complex-valued matrix via the singular value decomposition (SVD) scheme.

TI Controllable multichannel acousto-optic modulator and frequency
   synthesizer enabled by nonlinear MEMS resonator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nonlinear physics-based harmonic generators and modulators are critical signal processing technologies for optical and electrical communication. However, most optical modulators lack multi-channel functionality while frequency synthesizers have deficient control of output tones, and they additionally require vacuum, complicated setup, and high-power configurations. Here, we report a piezoelectrically actuated nonlinear Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) based Single-Input-Multiple-Output multi-domain signal processing unit that can simultaneously generate programmable parallel information channels (>100) in both frequency and spatial domain. This significant number is achieved through the combined electromechanical and material nonlinearity of the Lead Zirconate Titanate thin film while still operating the device in an ambient environment at Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor compatible voltages. By electrically detuning the operation point along the nonlinear regime of the resonator, the number of electrical and light-matter interaction signals generated based on higher-order non-Eigen modes can be controlled meticulously. This tunable multichannel generation enabled microdevice is a potential candidate for a wide variety of applications ranging from Radio Frequency communication to quantum photonics with an attractive MEMS-photonics monolithic integration ability.

TI Enhancement of the indistinguishability of single photon emitters
   coupled to photonic waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB One of the main steps towards large-scale quantum photonics consists of the integration of single photon sources (SPS) with photonic integrated circuits (PICs). For that purpose, the PICs should offer an efficient light coupling and a high preservation of the indistinguishability of photons. Therefore, optimization of the indistinguishability through waveguide design is especially relevant. In this work we have developed an analytical model that uses the Green's Dyadic of a 3D unbounded rectangular waveguide to calculate the coupling and the indistinguishability of an ideal point-source quantum emitter coupled to a photonic waveguide depending on its orientation and position. The model has been numerically evaluated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations showing consistent results. The maximum coupling is achieved when the emitter is embedded in the center of the waveguide but somewhat surprisingly the maximum indistinguishability appears when the emitter is placed at the edge of the waveguide where the electric field is stronger due to the surface discontinuity.

TI Zero sum subsequences and hidden subgroups
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We propose a method for solving the hidden subgroup problem in nilpotent groups. The main idea is iteratively transforming the hidden subgroup to its images in the quotient groups by the members of a central series, eventually to its image in the commutative quotient of the original group, and then using an abelian hidden subgroup algorithm to determine this image. Knowing this image allows one to descend to a proper subgroup unless the hidden subgroup is the full group. The transformation relies on finding zero sum subsequences of sufficiently large sequences of vectors over finite prime fields. We present a new deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the latter problem in the case when the size of the field is constant. The consequence is a polynomial time exact quantum algorithm for the hidden subgroup problem in nilpotent groups having constant nilpotency class and whose order only have prime factors also bounded by a constant.

TI Remote excitation between quantum emitters mediated by an optical Fano
   resonance
SO OPTICA
AB Remote coupling between quantum emitters is of great importance for constructing quantum networks. Conventionally, this can be achieved via photon exchange by incorporating the quantum emitters in a waveguide or a large cavity. However, such photonic structures suffer from low quality-factors or large mode volumes, limiting the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we demonstrate remote coupling between two site-controlled semiconductor quantum dot emitters mediated by an optical Fano resonance induced by coupling cavity modes via a continuum waveguide state. Unlike ordinary coupled modes, the Fano mode offers both a spatially extended field and a high local density of optical states at the emitters, enhancing light-matter interaction. This coupling scheme allows the demonstration of mutual excitation between two quantum dots separated in space by >17 wavelengths. Our approach holds promise for achieving long-distance interaction without compromising interaction efficiency, which is essential for scaling up on-chip integration of quantum networks based on solid-state quantum emitters.

TI Readout of quasiperiodic systems using qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop a theoretical scheme to perform a readout of the properties of a quasiperiodic system by coupling it to one or two qubits. We show that the decoherence dynamics of a single qubit coupled via a pure dephasing type term to a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system with a potential given by the Andre-Aubry-Harper (AAH) model and its generalized versions (GAAH model) is sensitive to the nature of the single-particle eigenstates (SPEs). More specifically, we can use the non-Markovianity of the qubit dynamics as quantified by the backflow of information to clearly distinguish the localized, delocalized, and mixed regimes with a mobility edge of the AAH and GAAH models and evidence the transition between them. By attaching two qubits at distinct sites of the system, we demonstrate that the transport property of the quasiperiodic system is encoded in the scaling of the threshold time to develop correlations between the qubits with the distance between the qubits. This scaling can also be used to distinguish and infer different regimes of transport such as ballistic, diffusive, and no transport engendered by SPEs that are delocalized, critical, and localized respectively. In addition, the localization length of the SPEs can also be gleaned from the exponential decay of correlations at long times as a function of distance between qubits. When there is a mobility edge allowing the coexistence of different kinds of SPEs in the spectrum, such as the coexistence of localized and delocalized states in the GAAH models, we find that the transport behavior and the scaling of the threshold time with qubit separation are governed by the fastest spreading states.

TI An RRAM compute-in-memory architecture for energy-efficient binary
   matrix-vector multiplication processing
SO IEICE ELECTRONICS EXPRESS
AB Binary matrix-vector multiplication (BMVM) is a key operation in post-quantum cryptography schemes like the Classic McEliece cryptosystem. Conventional computing architectures incur significant energy efficiency loss due to data movement of large matrices when handling such tasks. Non-volatile compute-in-memory (nvCIM) is an ideal technology for energy-efficient BMVM processing but faces challenges, including signal margin degradation in high input-parallelism arrays due to device non-idealities and high hardware overhead from current readout and XOR operations. This work presents a resistive memory (RRAM) nvCIM architecture featuring: 1) 1T1R cells with high-resistive-state compensation modules; and 2) pulsed current-sensing parity checkers. Based on the 180nm process and test results from RRAM devices, the computing accuracy and efficiency of the architecture are verified by simulation. The proposed architecture performs high-precision current accumulation with a maximum MAC value of 10 and achieves an energy efficiency of 1.51TOPS/W, offering approximately 1.62x improvement compared to an advanced 28nm FPGA platform.

TI On the Holographic Spectral Effects of Time-Interval Subdivisions
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Drawing on formal parallels between scalar diffraction theory and quantum mechanics, it is demonstrated that quantum wavefunction propagation requires a holographic model of time. Measurable time manifests between interactions as a duration which is encoded in the frequency domain. It is thus a unified entity, and attempts to subdivide these intervals introduce oscillatory artifacts or spectral broadening, altering the system's physical characteristics. Analogous to spatial holograms, where information is distributed across interference patterns, temporal intervals encode information as a discrete whole. This framework challenges the concept of continuous time evolution, suggesting instead that discrete trajectories define a frequency spectrum which holographically constructs the associated time interval, giving rise to the experimentally observed energy spread of particles in applications such as time-bin entanglement, ultra-fast light pulses, and the temporal double slit. A generalized model of quantum wavefunction propagation based on recursive Fourier transforms is discussed, and novel applications are proposed, including starlight analysis and quantum cryptography.

AB The authentication and key establishment (AKE) mechanism is considered one of the promising solutions for securing communication in Internet of Drones (IoD) applications. Nevertheless, existing AKE mechanisms based on traditional cryptographic techniques rely on integer factorization and discrete logarithms, which are no longer safe with the advent of quantum computers. These shortcomings motivate us to design a cutting-edge Quantum Secure Authentication and Key-Establishment mechanism (QSAKE) for the IoD environment. To the best of our knowledge, QSAKE is the pioneered work that uses advanced quantum-safe cryptography, providing a strong defence beyond traditional methods. To further enhance security, it eliminates storing long-term secrets directly in drone memory, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. A Holybro Pixhawk-based microcontroller is used with a Raspberry Pi connected to a Xilinx Arty A7-100T FPGA board to develop a realistic testbed. Finally, this work stands out as a groundbreaking application of a complete authentication process within a practical IoD testbed, demonstrating its high efficacy and practicality.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement and asymmetric steering between
   distant macroscopic mechanical and magnonic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a deterministic scheme for establishing hybrid Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement channel between a macroscopic mechanical oscillator and a magnon mode in a distant yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere across about 10 GHz of frequency difference. The system consists of a driven electromechanical cavity which is unidirectionally coupled to a distant electromagnonical cavity inside which a YIG sphere is placed. We find that far beyond the sideband-resolved regime in the electromechanical subsystem, stationary phonon-magnon EPR entanglement can be achieved. This is realized by utilizing the output field of the electromechanical cavity being an intermediary which distributes the electromechanical entanglement to the magnons, thus establishing the remote phonon-magnon entanglement. The EPR entanglement is strong enough such that phonon-magnon quantum steering can be attainable in an asymmetric manner. This long-distance macroscopic hybrid EPR entanglement and steering enable potential applications not only in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics at the macroscale, but also in quantum networking and one-sided device-independent quantum cryptography based on magnonics and electromechanics.

AB At Asiacrypt 2020, Moriya et al. introduced two new IND-CPA secure supersingular isogeny based Public Key Encryption (PKE) protocols: SiGamal and C-SiGamal. Unlike the PKEs canonically derived from SIDH and CSIDH, the new protocols provide IND-CPA security without the use of hash functions. SiGamal and C-SiGamal are however not IND-CCA secure. Moriya et al. suggested a variant of SiGamal that could be IND-CCA secure, but left its study as an open problem.
   In this paper, we revisit the protocols introduced by Moriya et al. First, we show that the SiGamal variant suggested by Moriya et al. for IND-CCA security is, in fact, not IND-CCA secure. Secondly, we propose a new isogeny-based PKE protocol named SimS, obtained by simplifying SiGamal. SimS has smaller public keys and ciphertexts than (C-)SiGamal and it is more efficient. We prove that SimS is IND-CCA secure under CSIDH security assumptions and one Knowledge of Exponent-type assumption we introduce. Interestingly, SimS is also much closer to the CSIDH protocol, facilitating a comparison between SiGamal and CSIDH.

AB Delegating heavy computations to auxiliary servers, while keeping the inputs secret, presents a practical solution for computationally limited devices to use resource-intense cryptographic protocols, such as those based on isogenies, and thus allows the deployment of post-quantum security on mobile devices and in the internet of things. We propose two algorithms for the secure and verifiable delegation of isogeny computations in the CSIDH setting. We then apply these algorithms to different instances of CSIDH and to the signing algorithms SeaSign and CSI-FiSh. Our algorithms present a communication-cost trade-off. Asymptotically (for high communication), the cost for the delegator is reduced by a factor 9 for the original CSIDH-512 parameter set and a factor 30 for SQALE'd CSIDH-4096, while the relative cost of SeaSign vanishes. Even for much lower communication cost, we come close to these asymptotic results. Using the knowledge of the class group, the delegation of CSI-FiSh is basically free (up to element generation) already at a very low communication cost.

AB Zero-knowledge proofs for NP statements are an essential tool for building various cryptographic primitives and have been extensively studied in recent years. In a seminal result from Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson [17], zero-knowledge proofs for NP statements can be built from any one-way function, but this construction leads very inefficient proofs. To yield practical constructions, one often uses the additional structure provided by homomorphic commitments.
   In this paper, we introduce a relaxed notion of homomorphic commitments, called malleable commitments, which requires less structure to be instantiated. We provide a malleable commitment construction from the ElGamal-type isogeny-based group action from Eurocrypt'22 [5]. We show how malleable commitments with a group structure in the malleability can be used to build zero-knowledge proofs for NP statements, improving on the naive construction from one-way functions. We compare three different approaches, namely from arithmetic circuits, rank-1 constraint systems and branching programs.

TI A Survey of Post-Quantum Oblivious Protocols
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Modern distributed computing systems and applications with strict privacy requirements demand robust data confidentiality. A primary challenge involves enabling parties to exchange data or perform joint computations. These interactions must avoid revealing private information about the data. Protocols with the obliviousness property, known as oblivious protocols, address this issue. They ensure that no party learns more than necessary. This survey analyzes the security and performance of post-quantum oblivious protocols, with a focus on oblivious transfer and oblivious pseudorandom functions. The evaluation assesses resilience against malicious adversaries in the Universal Composability framework. Efficiency is quantified through communication and computational overhead. It identifies optimal scenarios for these protocols. This paper also surveys related primitives, such as oblivious signatures and data structures, along with their applications. Key findings highlight the inherent trade-offs between computational cost and communication complexity in post-quantum oblivious constructions. Open challenges and future research directions are outlined. Emphasis is placed on quantum-resistant designs and formal security proofs in stronger adversarial models.

TI Further improvements of the estimation of key enumeration with
   applications to solving LWE
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY AND COMMUNICATIONS-DISCRETE-STRUCTURES BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS
   AND SEQUENCES
AB In post-quantum cryptography, Learning With Errors (LWE) is one of the dominant underlying mathematical problems. The dual attack is one of the main strategies for solving the LWE problem, and it has recently gathered significant attention within the research community. The attack strategy consists of a lattice reduction part and a distinguishing part. The latter includes an enumeration subroutine over a certain number of positions of the secret key. Our contribution consists of giving a precise and efficient approach for calculating the expected complexity of such an enumeration procedure, which was missing in the literature. This allows us to decrease the estimated cost of the whole dual attack, both classically and quantumly, on well-known protocols such as Kyber, Saber, and TFHE. In addition, we explore different enumeration strategies to investigate some potential further improvements. As our method of calculating the expected cost of enumeration is pretty general, it might be of independent interest in other areas of cryptanalysis or even in different research areas.

TI Tackling Sampling Noise in Physical Systems for Machine Learning
   Applications: Fundamental Limits and Eigentasks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The expressive capacity of physical systems employed for learning is limited by the unavoidable presence of noise in their extracted outputs. Though present in physical systems across both the classical and quantum regimes, the precise impact of noise on learning remains poorly understood. Focusing on supervised learning, we present a mathematical framework for evaluating the resolvable expressive capacity (REC) of general physical systems under finite sampling noise and provide a methodology for extracting its extrema, the eigentasks. Eigentasks are a native set of functions that a given physical system can approximate with minimal error. We show that the REC of a quantum system is limited by the fundamental theory of quantum measurement and obtain a tight upper bound for the REC of any finitely sampled physical system. We then provide empirical evidence that extracting low-noise eigentasks can lead to improved performance for machine learning tasks such as classification, displaying robustness to overfitting. We present analyses suggesting that correlations in the measured quantum system enhance learning capacity by reducing noise in eigentasks. The applicability of these results in practice is demonstrated with experiments on superconducting quantum processors. Our findings have broad implications for quantum machine learning and sensing applications.

TI Photonic quantum data locking
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum data locking is a quantum phenomenon that allows us to encrypt a long message with a small secret key with information-theoretic security. This is in sharp contrast with classical information theory where, according to Shannon, the secret key needs to be at least as long as the message. Here we explore photonic architectures for quantum data locking, where information is encoded in multi-photon states and processed using multi-mode linear optics and photo-detection, with the goal of extending an initial secret key into a longer one. The secret key consumption depends on the number of modes and photons employed. In the no-collision limit, where the likelihood of photon bunching is suppressed, the key consumption is shown to be logarithmic in the dimensions of the system. Our protocol can be viewed as an application of the physics of Boson Sampling to quantum cryptography. Experimental realisations are challenging but feasible with state-of-the-art technology, as techniques recently used to demonstrate Boson Sampling can be adapted to our scheme (e.g., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 250503, 2019).

What are the implications of the main findings? Interface engineering and molecular passivation are identified as key routes to improving the stability and operational performance of 2D MHP-based devices. The presented insights provide guidance for the rational design of flexible, high-efficiency optoelectronic and quantum photonic devices.Abstract Metal halide perovskite (MHP)-based heterojunctions have become a forefront area in the research of optoelectronic functional materials due to their unique layered crystal structure, tunable band gaps, and exceptional optoelectronic properties. Recent studies have demonstrated that interface charge transfer is a crucial factor in determining the optoelectronic performance of the heterojunction devices. By constructing heterojunctions between MHPs and two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, MoS2, and WS2, efficient electron-hole separation and transport can be achieved, significantly extending carrier lifetimes and suppressing non-radiative recombination. This results in enhanced response speed and energy conversion efficiency in photodetectors, photovoltaic devices, and light-emitting devices (LEDs). In these heterojunctions, the thickness of the MHP layer, interface defect density, and band alignment significantly influence carrier dynamics. Furthermore, techniques such as interface engineering, molecular passivation, and band engineering can effectively optimize charge separation efficiency and improve device stability. The integration of multilayer heterojunctions and flexible designs also presents new opportunities for expanding the functionality of high-performance optoelectronic devices. In this review, we systematically summarize the charge transfer mechanisms in MHP-based heterojunctions and highlight recent advances in their optoelectronic applications. Particular emphasis is placed on the influence of interfacial coupling on carrier generation, transport, and recombination dynamics. Furthermore, the ultrafast dynamic behaviors and band-engineering strategies in representative heterojunctions are elaborated, together with key factors and approaches for enhancing charge transfer efficiency. Finally, the potential of MHP heterojunctions for high-performance optoelectronic devices and emerging photonic systems is discussed.
   This review aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical and experimental reference for future research and to offer new insights into the rational design and application of flexible optoelectronics, photovoltaics, light-emitting devices, and quantum photonic technologies.

TI Two dimensional Floquet topological states in a driven graphene lattice
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The study of topological phase transitions induced by external fields in quantum systems is of significant interest in physics, as it enables the exploration of various topological nontrivial phenomena in a controllable manner. This paper investigates the induced topological states of a graphene lattice subjected to an in-plane time-periodic electric field. The time-independent effective Hamiltonian in the high-frequency approximation is obtained under the Floquet theory. The results show that the graphene lattice can be turned into a chiral symmetric protection architectures by a specially designed periodic driving, which thus fulfills a topological phase transition. The topological invariant is found to confirm the transition in the corresponding nanoribbons. The controlled topological transition is impressively demonstrated by two distinct edge states in a nanosheet with different edges in two directions, achieved simply by adjusting the external field. This type of driven lattice, which can be easily realized in quantum photonics, shaken optical lattices, or other systems, provides a feasible theoretical foundation for experimental studies of the controllable topological phase of matter.

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Aluminum nitride (AlN) is an emerging material for integrated quantum photonics with its excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. In particular, its second-order nonlinear susceptibility chi (2) allows single-photon generation. We have grown AlN thin films on silicon nitride (Si3N4) via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The thin films have been characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), optical reflectometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy. The crystalline properties of the thin films have been improved by optimizing the nitrogen to argon ratio and the magnetron DC power of the deposition process. XRD measurements confirm the fabrication of high-quality c-axis oriented AlN films with a full width at half maximum of the rocking curves of 3.9 degrees for 300 nm-thick films. AFM measurements reveal a root mean square surface roughness below 1 nm. The AlN deposition on SiN allows us to fabricate hybrid photonic circuits with a new approach that avoids the challenging patterning of AlN.

TI Experimental Efficient Source-Independent Quantum Secret Sharing against
   Coherent Attacks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Source-independent quantum secret sharing (SI QSS), while essential for secure multi-user cryptographic operations in quantum networks, faces significant implementation challenges stemming from the inherent complexity of generating and distributing multipartite entangled states. Recently, a resourceefficient SI QSS protocol utilizing entangled photon pairs combined with a postmatching method has been proposed to address this limitation. In this Letter, we report an experimental demonstration of this protocol using high-fidelity polarization-entangled photon pairs in a star topology. For a three-user network, we obtain secure key rates of 21.18, 4.69, and 1.71 kbps under single-user channel losses of 7.6, 10.9, and 12.9 dB respectively. Furthermore, under conditions of equal channel loss per user, we achieve secure key rates of 6.97, 6.46, and 5.88 kbps for three-, four-, and five-user scenarios respectively. These results demonstrate the advantageous independence of the key rate from the number of users. Our Letter paves the way for large-scale deployment of SI QSS in multiuser quantum networks.

TI Maximally efficient quantum thermal machines fueled by nonequilibrium
   steady states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The concept of thermal machines has evolved from the canonical steam engine to the recently proposed nanoscopic quantum systems as working fluids. The latter obey quantum open system dynamics and frequently operate in nonequilibrium conditions. However, the role of this dynamics in the overall performance of quantum heat engines remains an open problem. Here we analyze and optimize the efficiency and power output of two-stage quantum heat engines fueled by nonequilibrium steady states. In a charging first stage, the quantum working fluid consisting of a qutrit or two coupled qubits is connected to two reservoirs at different temperatures, which establish a heat current that stores ergotropy in the system; the second stage comprises a coherent driving force that extracts work from the machine in finite a amount of time; finally, the external drive is switched off and the machine enters a new cycle.

TI Rydberg-atom-based multiband frequency-hopping communication receiver
   using five-level atomic system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A frequency-hopping communication receiver based on Rydberg atoms, whose carrier frequency changes in accordance with a predetermined sequence, is proposed for what we believe to be the first time and experimentally verified. Based on the coherent population trapping (CPT) effect of atoms, a five-level system is built under the assumption of a constant laser wavelength, where the carrier is the resonance band corresponding to different separated quantum states. Pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) and complex image signals undergo keying modulation to achieve frequency-domain hopping reception. In the experiment, a dynamic range of 62 dB is demonstrated. The digital transmission with a data rate of 1 Mbps is performed reliably, within a tunable bandwidth of 50 MHz, an instantaneous bandwidth of 700 kHz and a max hopping rate of 20000 hop/s. The proposed atom-based frequency-hopping receiver is suitable for secure communications, satellite uplinks, quantum cryptography, and high-precision scientific research.

AB Large polynomial multiplications are crucial for Post-Quantum Cryptography standards like Module-Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice-based Digital Signature (ML-DSA). These multiplications, being complex, are often accelerated using the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). This work presents a novel architecture of a high-performance NTT accelerator capable of performing both NTT and inverse NTT operations using a single set of hardware resources. The design makes use of a single butterfly configuration unit to reduce resource requirements and improve critical path. The Multi-path Delay Commutator (MDC) strategy is employed to enable fully pipelined and parallel processing of multiple coefficients, supporting both ML-KEM and ML-DSA computations. Practical results show that our proposed NTT engine requires 3,821 LUTs, 2970 FFs, 20 DSPs, and 5 BRAMs on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA, and can run up to 322 MHz. Our design provides the best Area-Time Product (ATP) among current NTT architectures.

TI Highly scalable quantum router with frequency-independent scattering
   spectra
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optical quantum routers play a crucial role in quantum networks and have been extensivelystudied in both theory and experiment, leading to significant advancements in their performance.However, these routers impose stringent requirements for achieving desired routing results, as theincident photon frequency must be in strict resonance with one or several specific frequencies. Toaddress this challenge, we propose an efficient quantum router scheme composed of semi-infinitecoupled-resonator waveguide (CRW) and a giant atom. The single-channel router scheme enablesstable output with 100% transfer rate over the entire energy band of the CRW. Leveraging thisintriguing result, we further propose a multi-channel router scheme that possesses high stability and universality, while also being capable of performing various functionalities. The completephysical explanation of the underlying mechanism for this intriguing result is also presented. Wehope that quantum router with output results unaffected by the frequency of the incominginformation carriers presents a more reliable solution for the implementation of quantum networks.

TI Optimizing Dilithium Implementation with AVX2/-512
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Dilithium is a signature scheme that is currently being standardized to the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard by NIST. It is believed to be secure even against attacks from large-scale quantum computers based on lattice problems. The implementation efficiency is important for promoting the migration of current cryptography algorithms to post-quantum cryptography algorithms. In this article, we optimize the implementation of Dilithium with several new approaches proposed. Firstly, we improve the efficiency of parallel NTT implementations. The overhead of shuffling operations is reduced in our implementations, and fewer loading instructions are invoked for the precomputations. Then, we optimize the sampling and bit-packing of polynomial coefficients in Dilithium. We can handle double the number of coefficients within one register using a new approach for the sampling of secret key polynomials. The approaches proposed in this article are applicable to implementations under AVX2 and AVX-512 instruction sets. Take Dilithium2 as an illustration, our AVX2 implementation demonstrates improvements of 22.7%, 16.9%, and 13.5% for KeyGen, Sign, and Verify compared with the previous implementation.

TI Quantum Secure Multi-Party Summation with Identity Authentication Based
   on Commutative Encryption
SO PHOTONICS
AB In quantum secure multi-party summation protocols, some attackers can impersonate legitimate participants in the summation process, and easily steal the summation results from the participants. This is often overlooked for existing secure multi-party summation protocols, thus rendering them insecure. Based on commutative encryption, a quantum secure multi-party summation protocol with identity authentication is proposed in this paper. In the protocol, each participant encodes a secret integer on photons via unitary operations. At the same time, a one-way hash function technique with a key is utilized to perform identity authentication operations for each participant. Finally, the summation is calculated with the help of a semi-trusted third party. The analysis of the protocol shows that the proposed protocol is correct and resistant to common and impersonation attacks. Compared to related protocols, the use and measurement of single photons makes the protocol easier to implement into existing technology. Furthermore, the simulation experiments on the IBM Q Experience cloud platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented protocol.

AB In order to mitigate the security threat of quantum computers, NIST is undertaking a process to standardize post-quantum cryptosystems, aiming to assess their security and speed up their adoption in production scenarios. Several hardware and software implementations have been proposed for each candidate, while only a few target heterogeneous platforms featuring CPUs and FPGAs. This work presents a HW/SW co-design of BIKE for embedded platforms featuring both CPUs and small FPGAs and employs high-level synthesis (HLS) to timely deliver the hardware accelerators. In contrast to state-of-the-art solutions targeting performance-optimized HLS accelerators, the proposed solution targets the small FPGAs implemented in the heterogeneous platforms for embedded systems. Compared to the software- only execution of BIKE, the experimental results collected on the systems-on-chip of the entire Xilinx Zynq-7000 family highlight a performance speedup ranging from 1.37x, on Z-7010, to 2.78x, on Z-7020.

TI Optical Bound States in the Continuum Enabled by Magnetic Resonances
   Coupled to a Mirror
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Dielectric metasurfaces made of high refractive index and low optical loss materials have emerged as promising platforms to achieve high-quality factor modes enabling strong light-matter interaction. Bound states in the continuum have shown potential to demonstrate narrow spectral resonances but often require asymmetric geometry and typically feature strong polarization dependence, complicating fabrication and limiting practical applications. We introduce a novel approach for designing high-quality bound states in the continuum using magnetic dipole resonances coupled to a mirror. The resulting metasurface has simple geometric parameters requiring no broken symmetry. To demonstrate the unique features of our photonic platform we show a record-breaking third harmonic generation efficiency from the metasurface benefiting from the strongly enhanced electric field at high-quality resonances. Our approach mitigates the shortcomings of previous platforms with simple geometry enabling facile and large-area fabrication of metasurfaces paving the way for applications in optical sensing, detection, quantum photonics, and nonlinear devices.

TI Nanoscale axial position and orientation measurement of hexagonal boron
   nitride quantum emitters using a tunable nanophotonic environment
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as promising candidates for single-photon emitters (SPEs) due to their bright emission characteristics at room temperature. In contrast to mono- and few-layered hBN, color centers in multi-layered flakes show superior emission characteristics such as higher saturation counts and spectral stability. Here, we report a method for determining both the axial position and three-dimensional dipole orientation of SPEs in thick hBN flakes by tuning the photonic local density of states using vanadium dioxide (VO2), a phase change material. Quantum emitters under study exhibit a strong surface-normal dipole orientation, providing some insight on the atomic structure of hBN SPEs, deeply embedded in thick crystals. Next, we optimized a hot pickup technique to reproducibly transfer the hBN flake from VO2/sapphire substrate onto SiO2/Si substrate and relocated the same emitters. Our approach serves as a practical method to systematically characterize SPEs in hBN prior to integration in quantum photonics systems.

TI HySecure: FPGA-Based Hybrid Post-Quantum and Classical Cryptography
   Platform for End-to-End IoT Security
SO ELECTRONICS
AB As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand into mission-critical and long-lived applications, securing low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) such as Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) against both classical and quantum threats becomes imperative. Existing NB-IoT security mechanisms terminate at the core network, leaving transmission payloads exposed. This paper proposes HySecure, an FPGA-based hybrid cryptographic platform that integrates both classical elliptic curve and post-quantum schemes to achieve end-to-end (E2E) security for NB-IoT communication. Our architecture, built upon the lightweight RISC-V PULPino platform, incorporates hardware accelerators for X25519, Kyber, Ed25519, and Dilithium. We design a hybrid key establishment protocol combining ECDH and Kyber through HKDF, and a dual-signature scheme using EdDSA and Dilithium to ensure authenticity and integrity during handshake. Cryptographic functions are evaluated on FPGA, achieving a 32.2x to 145.4x speedup. NS-3 simulations under realistic NB-IoT configurations demonstrate acceptable latency and throughput for the proposed hybrid schemes, validating their practicality for secure constrained IoT deployments and communications.

TI FRACTIONAL NON-NORM ELEMENTS FOR DIVISION ALGEBRAS, AND AN APPLICATION
   TO CYCLIC LEARNING WITH ERRORS
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Given a cyclotomic field K and a finite Galois extension L, we discuss the construction of unit-magnitude elements in K which are not in the image of the field norm map NL/K(Lx). We observe that the construction of Elia, Sethuraman, and Kumar extends to all cyclotomic fields whose rings of integers are a principal ideal domain, a fact we have not seen appear elsewhere in the literature. We then prove a number of lemmas concerning non-norm elements, and extend the above results to hold for arbitrary cyclotomic ground fields. We give examples of towers of fields and corresponding non-norm el-ements in both instances. Finally, we apply this to cryptography, defining a novel variant of Learning with Errors, defined over cyclic division algebras with fractional unit-magnitude non-norm elements, and reduce lattice problems de-fined over ideals in maximal orders in such algebras to the search problem for this form of LWE.

TI Efficient TFHE Bootstrapping in the Multiparty Setting
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB TFHE is a practical fully homomorphic encryption scheme (FHE) capable of computing any boolean gate or non-linear function. The scheme was originally designed to work for the single key setting. To implement realistic application scenarios, it is necessary to extend it to handle multiple users. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to generate TFHE bootstrapping keys for (predefined) multiple users. Hence, a fixed number of users can enjoy the same level of efficiency as in the single key setting, keeping their individual input privacy. Our construction relies on a novel algorithm called homomorphic indicator, which can be of independent interest. We provide a detailed analysis of the noise growth and a set of secure parameters suitable to be used in practice. Moreover, we compare the complexity of our technique with other state-of-the-art constructions and show which method performs better depending on the parameter sets. We also provide a prototype implementation of our technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of TFHE in the multiparty setting.

TI Spontaneous parametric down conversion without poling for silicon
   carbide and lithium niobate photonics
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB State-of-the-art photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) currently rely on artificial structuring of the material nonlinearity to satisfy phase-matching conditions. This technique, known as periodic poling, is available only in a limited number of material platforms and introduces additional fabrication steps and errors, which are detrimental to up-scaling efforts. Here, we present a device architecture that enables SPDC of a wide range of frequencies without the need for periodic poling. We present explicit designs and calculations for 4H Silicon Carbide on-insulator, in which SPDC photon generation is so far unavailable, and thin-film Lithium Niobate on-insulator, a state-of-the-art quantum photonics platform. Our design, based on mode conversion and subsequent modal phase-matched SPDC, facilitates a CMOS compatible \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\chi <^>{(2)}$$\end{document} platform, and simplifies photon sources by removing the requirement of periodic poling and the associated additional fabrication complexity.

TI Multi-party semi-quantum private comparison based on the maximally
   entangled GHZ-type states
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The goal of semi-quantum privacy comparison (SQPC) is to use a small amount of quantum capabilities to compare private information for equality. In recent years, research on semi-quantum privacy comparison protocol has made some achievements. However, most of SQPC protocols can merely compare the private information of two parties, and the research of multi-party SQPC protocols are still scarce. If the number of participants is more than two, the protocol needs to be executed multiple times. Therefore, we proposed a multi-party semi-quantum private comparison protocol based on the maximally entangled GHZ-type state, which has the capability to compare the equality of n parties by executing the protocol once. What is more, the transmission of participant's encrypted information is not through the classical channel, which improves the security of the protocol. Finally, the security analysis shows that outsider attacks, dishonest participants attacks and semi-honest TP attacks are all invalid for this protocol.

TI Observation of anti-PT-symmetry and higher-order exceptional point
   PT-symmetry in ternary systems for single-mode operation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nowadays, topological parity-time (PT) and anti- parity-time (APT) symmetry systems have attracted substantial attention due to their noticeable features and specific applications. The emergence of exceptional points in these systems plays a direct role in their overall responses and causes them to exhibit an entirely real spectrum. Here, we propose and analyze a new approach based on the broken PT in the vicinity of a third-order exceptional point and APT symmetry that allows us to experimentally achieve a stable single-mode laser. A feasible third-order exceptional point can be synthesized by coupling three microcavities to each other. The behaviors of these lasers are evaluated in different situations according to introducing the gain and loss perturbation to the system. Our proposed microlasers and their distinct properties based on photonic exceptional points may find use in a wide variety of applications such as ultrahigh precision sensing, spectroscopy, and optical on-chip filters and lasers.

TI Arbitrary optical wave evolution with Fourier transforms and phase masks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A large number of applications in classical and quantum photonics require the capability of implementing arbitrary linear unitary transformations on a set of optical modes. In a seminal work by Reck et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 58 (1994)], it was shown how to build such multiport universal interferometers with a mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters, and this design became the basis for most experimental implementations in the last decades. However, the design of Reck et al. is difficult to scale up to a large number of modes, which would be required for many applications. Here we present a deterministic algorithm that can find an exact and efficient implementation of any unitary transformation, using only Fourier transforms and phase masks. Since Fourier transforms and phase masks are routinely implemented in several optical setups and they do not suffer from some of the scalability issues associated with building extensive meshes of beam splitters, we believe that our design can be useful for many applications in photonics.

TI Cryptanalysis of a code-based full-time signature
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB We present an attack against a code-based signature scheme based on the Lyubashevsky protocol that was recently proposed by Song, Huang, Mu, Wu and Wang (SHMWW). The private key in the SHMWW scheme contains columns coming in part from an identity matrix and in part from a random matrix. The existence of two types of columns leads to a strong bias in the distribution of set bits in produced signatures. Our attack exploits such a bias to recover the private key from a bunch of collected signatures. We provide a theoretical analysis of the attack along with experimental evaluations, and we show that as few as 10 signatures are enough to be collected for successfully recovering the private key. As for previous attempts of adapting Lyubashevsky's protocol to the case of code-based cryptography, the SHMWW scheme is thus proved unable to provide acceptable security. This confirms that devising secure code-based signature schemes with efficiency comparable to that of other post-quantum solutions (e.g., based on lattices) is still a challenging task.

TI Experimental implementation of an efficient test of quantumness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A test of quantumness is a protocol where a classical user issues challenges to a quantum device to determine if it exhibits nonclassical behavior, under certain cryptographic assumptions. Recent attempts to implement such tests on current quantum computers rely on either interactive challenges with efficient verification or noninteractive challenges with inefficient (exponential time) verification. In this paper, we execute an efficient noninteractive test of quantumness on an ion-trap quantum computer. Our results significantly exceed the bound for a classical device's success.

TI Origin of giant valley splitting in silicon quantum wells induced by
   superlattice barriers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Enhancing valley splitting in SiGe heterostructures is crucial for developing silicon spin qubits. Complex SiGe heterostructures, sharing a common feature of four-monolayer (4 ML) Ge layer next immediately to the silicon quantum well (QW), have been computationally designed in 2013 to have giant valley splitting approaching 9 meV and hence could be used to overcome the challenge of valley splitting towards the experimental realization of Si quantum computing. However, none of them has been successfully fabricated, perhaps due to their complexity. Here, we remarkably simplify the originally designed complex SiGe heterostructures by laying out the Si QW directly on the SiGe substrate followed by capping a (Ge4Si4)n superlattice (SL) barrier with a sacrifice in valley splitting (VS), which is reduced from a maximum value of 8.7 to 5.2 meV. Even the smallest number of SL periods (n = 1) will also give a sizable VS of 1.6 meV, which is large enough for developing stable spin qubits. We further develop an effective Hamiltonian model to reveal the physical mechanism underlying the enhanced valley splitting by the (Ge4Si4)n SL barriers. We surprisingly find that the presence of the SL barrier will reduce rather than enhance the VS in most cases. The only exception is the (Ge4Si4)n SL barriers, where their miniband states have such a strong coupling with Si QW valley states that they provide an even larger VS. These findings lay a solid theoretical foundation for overcoming the valley splitting issue of SiGe heterostructures in the experiment that is heading toward Si quantum computing.

TI Optimal classical and quantum real and complex dimension witness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We find the minimal number of independent preparations and measurements certifying the dimension of a classical or quantum system limited to d states, optionally reduced to the real subspace. As a dimension certificate, we use the linear independence tested by a determinant. We find the sets of preparations and measurements that maximize the chance to detect larger space if the extra contribution is very small. We discuss the practical application of the test to certify the space logical operations on a quantum computer.

TI Freeform thin-film lithium niobate mode converter for photon-pair
   generation
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising platform for integrated photonics due to its exceptional material properties. The application of freeform topology optimization to TFLN devices enables the realization of compact designs with complex functionalities and high efficiency. However, the stringent fabrication constraints of TFLN present significant challenges for optimization, particularly in nonlinear photonic devices. In this work, we propose an inverse design methodology that successfully addresses these challenges and demonstrates the development of an efficient freeform TFLN mode converter. The numerically optimized mode converter achieves a transmission efficiency of 67.60 % and a mode purity of 84.58 %. Experimental validation through nonlinear processes, including second harmonic generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion, shows that the fabricated devices improve the efficiency of these processes by factors of two and three, respectively, compared to devices without freeform designs. The proposed inverse design framework provides a powerful tool for advancing the development of TFLN-based devices, with broad applicability to nonlinear and quantum photonics.

TI Jet: Fast quantum circuit simulations with parallel task-based
   tensor-network contraction
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce a new open-source software library Jet, which uses task-based parallelism to obtain speed-ups in classical tensor-network simulations of quantum circuits. These speed-ups result from i) the increased parallelism introduced by mapping the tensor-network simulation to a task-based framework, ii) a novel method of reusing shared work between tensornetwork contraction tasks, and iii) the concurrent contraction of tensor networks on all available hardware. We demonstrate the advantages of our method by benchmarking our code on several Sycamore53 and Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) supremacy circuits against other simulators. We also provide and compare theoretical performance estimates for tensornetwork simulations of Sycamore-53 and GBS supremacy circuits for the first time.

TI Measurement-protected quantum phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a class of hybrid quantum circuits, with random unitaries and projective measurements, which host long-range order in the area-law entanglement phase of the steady state. Our primary example is circuits with unitaries respecting a global Ising symmetry and two competing types of measurements. The phase diagram has an area-law phase with spin-glass order, which undergoes a direct transition to a paramagnetic phase with volume-law entanglement, as well as a critical regime. Using mutual information diagnostics, we find that such entanglement transitions preserving a global symmetry are in universality classes different from those without symmetry. We analyze generalizations of such hybrid circuits to higher dimensions, which allow for coexistence of order and volume-law entanglement, as well as topological order without any symmetry restrictions.

TI Unlocking Efficient Ultrafast Bound-Electron Optical Nonlinearities via
   Mirror Induced Quasi Bound States in the Continuum
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The operation of photonic devices often relies on modulation of their refractive index. While the sub-bandgap index change through bound-electron optical nonlinearity offers a faster response than utilizing free carriers with an overbandgap pump, optical switching often suffers from inefficiency. Here, we use a recently observed metasurface based on mirror-induced optical bound states in the continuum, to enable superior modulation characteristics. We achieve a pulsewidth-limited switching time of 100 fs, reflectance change of 22%, remarkably low energy consumption of 255 mu J/cm(2), and an enhancement of modulation contrast by a factor of 440 compared to unpatterned silicon. Additionally, the narrow photonic resonance facilitates the detection of the dispersive nondegenerate two-photon nonlinearity, allowing tunable pump and probe excitation. These findings are explained by a two-band theoretical model for the dispersive nonlinear index. The demonstrated efficient and rapid switching holds immense potential for applications, including quantum photonics, sensing, and metrology.

TI Fabrication of gallium nitride waveguide resonators by high-power
   impulse magnetron sputtering at room temperature
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB In this work, we demonstrate gallium nitride (GaN) waveguide resonators by sputtering amorphous GaN films on the silicon-based substrate. With the aid of high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), high-quality, high-deposition-rate, and high-flatness GaN films can be deposited directly onto the silicon substrate with a 4 mu m buried oxide layer at room temperature. Waveguide resonators with a quality factor of up to 4 x 10(4 )are demonstrated, and closely critical coupling is achieved at a 0.2 mu m gap by optimizing the gap sizes, showing a high extinction ratio of waveguide resonators at approximate to 24 dB. The fabrication process of HiPIMS-GaN waveguide resonators utilizes CMOS-compatible techniques and operates at a low thermal budget. Compared to conventional GaN films fabricated using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, this study offers the potential to produce low-cost GaN waveguides on amorphous substrates and realize integrated GaN photonics in optical communication, nonlinear photonics, and quantum photonics by high-quality HiPIMS films.

(p) over right arrow semiclassical model accurately predicts ellipsometric spectra, reflecting strong subband hybridization and nonparabolicity. In contrast, single-band plasmon models show qualitative discrepancies with experiment, even with adjusted effective masses. These findings highlight the potential of broken-gap wells for quantum technologies leveraging interband coupling and wavefunction hybridization.

TI Optoacoustic Cooling of Traveling Hypersound Waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We experimentally demonstrate optoacoustic cooling via stimulated Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a 50 cm long tapered photonic crystal fiber. For a 7.38 GHz acoustic mode, a cooling rate of 219 K from room temperature has been achieved. As anti -Stokes and Stokes Brillouin processes naturally break the symmetry of phonon cooling and heating, resolved sideband schemes are not necessary. The experiments pave the way to explore the classical to quantum transition for macroscopic objects and could enable new quantum technologies in terms of storage and repeater schemes.

TI Lithographically defined cavities with high Quality and Purcell factors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB We introduce and analyze a lithographically defined cavity (Li-cavity) incorporating a buried mesa defect in a planar vertical structure, which induces transverse photonic confinement while enabling compatibility with electrical injection. We systematically investigate the influence of key cavity parameters on optical behavior and fundamental properties using a comprehensive three-dimensional optical model. Our analysis reveals that the Li-cavity exhibits low optical scattering, resulting in high Q and Purcell factors, even at sub-wavelength dimensions. Furthermore, the Li-cavity supports single-mode operation within a broader aperture size range compared to conventional cavity designs, promising enhanced optical power of single-mode emission. Adequately designed structures demonstrate superior Q and Purcell factors at wavelength-scale sizes, outperforming conventional micropillar cavities. These improved properties and customizable device characteristics stem from a simple fabrication process that precisely controls the cavity size, shape, and optical mode. Superior characteristics, along with its adaptability to diverse materials, wavelengths, and photonic integration platforms, promise a broad range of applications and potential adaptation of this design to diverse photonic devices.

TI Slow light in a 2D semiconductor plasmonic structure
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spectrally narrow optical resonances can be used to generate slow light, i.e., a large reduction in the group velocity. In a previous work, we developed hybrid 2D semiconductor plasmonic structures, which consist of propagating optical frequency surface-plasmon polaritons interacting with excitons in a semiconductor monolayer. Here, we use coupled exciton-surface plasmon polaritons (E-SPPs) in monolayer WSe2 to demonstrate slow light with a 1300 fold decrease of the SPP group velocity. Specifically, we use a high resolution two-color laser technique where the nonlinear E-SPP response gives rise to ultra-narrow coherent population oscillation (CPO) resonances, resulting in a group velocity on order of 10(5) m/s. Our work paves the way toward on-chip actively switched delay lines and optical buffers that utilize 2D semiconductors as active elements.
   Slow light effects are interesting for telecommunications and quantum photonics applications. Here, the authors use coupled exciton-surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in a hybrid monolayer WSe2-metallic waveguide structure to demonstrate a 1300-fold reduction of the SPP group velocity.

TI Chiral single photons from deterministic quantum emitter arrays via
   proximity coupling to van der Waals ferromagnets
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Chiral single photons are highly sought to enhance encoding capacities or enable propagation-dependent routing in nonreciprocal devices. Unfortunately, most semiconductor quantum emitters (QEs) produce only linear polarized photons unless external magnets are applied. Magnetic proximity coupling utilizing 2D ferromagnets promises to make bulky external fields obsolete. Here we directly grow Fe-doped MoS2 (Fe:MoS2) via chemical vapor deposition that displays pronounced hard ferromagnetic properties even in monolayer form. This approach with monolayer ferromagnets enables full utilization of the strain from the pillar stressor to form QE in WSe2 deterministically. The Fe:MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures display strong hysteretic magneto-response and high-purity chiral single photons with a circular polarization degree of 92 & PLUSMN; 1% (74% average) without external magnetic fields. Furthermore, the chiral single photons are robust against uncontrolled twist-angle and external stray-fields. This ability to manipulate quantum states and transform linear polarized photons into high-purity chiral photons on-chip enables nonreciprocal device integration in quantum photonics.

TI High-Resolution Single Photon Level Storage of Telecom Light Based on
   Thin Film Lithium Niobate Photonics
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This study presents an experimental analysis of high-resolution single photon buffers based on low-loss thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic devices operating at room temperature. While dynamically controlling writing and reading operations within picosecond timescales poses a challenge, the devices are capable of resolving 102.8 +/- 4.6 ps time step with -0.89 dB loss per round-trip and 197.7 +/- 6.6 ps time steps with -1.29 dB loss per round-trip, respectively. These results imply that the devices are at the cutting edge of on-chip technology, performing in the current state of the art at the single photon level. Both of the single photon buffers do not introduce any detrimental effects and provide a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The room-temperature, low-loss, and voltage-controlled TFLN buffers combine scalable architecture with relatively high buffering capacity in the sub-nanosecond regime and are expected to unlock many novel photonics applications such as temporally multiplexed single photon sources.

TI Generation of Stable Entanglement in an Optomechanical System with
   Dissipative Environment: Linear-and-Quadratic Couplings
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this paper, we present a theoretical scheme for the generation and manipulation of bipartite atom-atom entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system containing two atoms in the presence of linear and nonlinear (quadratic) couplings. To achieve the goal of paper, we first obtain the interaction Hamiltonian in the interaction picture, and then, by considering some resonance conditions and applying the rotating wave approximation, the effective Hamiltonian, which is independent of time, is derived. In the continuation, the system solution was obtained via solving the Lindblad master equation, which includes atomic, optical and mechanical dissipation effects. Finally, bipartite atom-atom entanglement is quantitatively discussed, by evaluating the negativity, which is a well-known measure of entanglement. Our numerical simulations show that a significant degree of entanglement can be reached via adjusting the system parameters. It is noticeable that the optical and mechanical decay rates play an important role in the quasi-stability and even stability of the obtained atom-atom entanglement.

Speeding up the expensive post-quantum cryptographic operations by delegating these computations from a weaker client to untrusted powerful external servers is a promising approach. Following this, we present in this work mechanisms allowing computationally restricted devices to securely and verifiably delegate isogeny computations to potentially untrusted third parties. In particular, we propose two algorithms that can be integrated into existing isogeny-based protocols and which lead to a much lower cost for the delegator than the full, local computation. For example, compared to the local computation cost, we reduce the public key computation step of SIDH/SIKE by a factor 5 and zero-knowledge proofs of identity by a factor 16 for the prover, while it becomes almost free for the verifier, respectively, at the NIST security level 1.

TI Definitions and Security of Quantum Electronic Voting
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Recent advances indicate that quantum computers will soon be reality. Motivated by this ever more realistic threat for existing classical cryptographic protocols, researchers have developed several schemes to resist "quantum attacks." In particular, for electronic voting (e-voting), several schemes relying on properties of quantum mechanics have been proposed. However, each of these proposals comes with a different and often not well-articulated corruption model, has different objectives, and is accompanied by security claims that are never formalized and are at best justified only against specific attacks. To address this, we propose the first formal security definitions for quantum e-voting protocols. With these at hand, we systematize and evaluate the security of previously proposed quantum e-voting protocols; we examine the claims of these works concerning privacy, correctness, and verifiability, and if they are correctly attributed to the proposed protocols. In all non-trivial cases, we identify specific quantum attacks that violate these properties. We argue that the cause of these failures lies in the absence of formal security models and references to the existing cryptographic literature.

TI Stepwise π-extension of double [5]helicene diimides to planar
   nanographene diimides
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB A facile, stepwise synthetic route has been developed to access symmetric double [5]helicene diimides and their planar nanographene diimide counterparts via a C-shaped asymmetric [5]helicene. The synthetic strategy employs benzannulation and Scholl reaction methodologies to achieve progressive pi-extension, yielding a new class of n-type rylene diimides with reversible redox characteristics. These helical and planar diimides exhibit variable crosswise pi-conjugation and structural tunability, resulting in emission wavelengths that can be tailored alongside enhanced photoluminescence quantum yields-from 12% for the S-shaped diimide, to 57% for the C-shaped intermediate, and up to 63% for the fully planar nanographene diimide. Such properties make them promising candidates for quantum photonics, particularly as single-photon emitters. Photophysical properties, including time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, reveal correlations between molecular structure, exciton dynamics, and emission behaviour. Notably, these helical rylene diimides demonstrate high photoluminescence efficiency in the solid state, reaching up to 32%, positioning them as strong contenders for next-generation optoelectronic devices.

TI Instantaneous Quantum Description of Photonic Wavefronts and
   Applications
SO QUANTUM BEAM SCIENCE
AB Three physical elements are missing from the conventional formalism of quantum photonics: (1) the quantum Rayleigh spontaneous and stimulated emissions; (2) the unavoidable parametric amplification; and (3) the mixed time-frequency spectral structure of a photonic field which specifies its duration or spatial extent. As a single photon enters a dielectric medium, the quantum Rayleigh scattering prevents it from propagating in a straight-line, thereby destroying any possible entanglement. A pure dynamic and coherent state composed of two consecutive number states, delivers the correct expectation values for the number of photons carried by a photonic wave front, its complex optical field, and phase quadratures. The intrinsic longitudinal and lateral field profiles associated with a group of photons for any instantaneous number of photons are independent of the source. These photonic properties enable a step-by-step analysis of the correlation functions characterizing counting of coincident numbers of photons or intensities with unity visibility interference, spanning the classical and quantum optic regimes.

TI Cryogenic and hermetically sealed packaging of photonic chips for
   optomechanics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a hermetically sealed packaging system for integrated photonic devices at cryogenic temperatures with plug-and-play functionality. This approach provides the ability to encapsulate a controlled amount of gas into the optical package allowing helium to be used as a heat-exchange gas to thermalize photonic devices, or condensed into a superfluid covering the device. This packaging system was tested using a silicon-on-insulator slot waveguide resonator which fills with superfluid He-4 below the transition temperature. To optimize the fiber-to-chip optical integration 690 tests were performed by thermally cycling optical fibers bonded to various common photonic chip substrates (silicon, silicon oxide and HSQ) with a range of glues (NOA 61, NOA 68, NOA 88, NOA 86H and superglue). This showed that NOA 86H (a UV curing optical adhesive with a latent heat catalyst) provided the best performance under cryogenic conditions for all the substrates tested. The technique is relevant to superfluid optomechanics experiments, as well as quantum photonics and quantum optomechanics applications.

TI Growth and structure of alpha-Ta films for quantum circuit integration
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Tantalum films incorporated into superconducting circuits have exhibited low surface losses, resulting in long-lived qubit states. The remaining loss pathways originate in microscopic defects that manifest as two level systems (TLSs) at low temperatures. These defects limit performance, so careful attention to tantalum film structures is critical for optimal use in quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the growth of tantalum using magnetron sputtering on sapphire, Si, and photoresist substrates. In the case of sapphire, we present procedures for the growth of fully-oriented films with alpha-Ta [1 1 1]//Al2O3 [0 0 0 1] and alpha-Ta [1 -1 0]//Al2O3 [1 0 -1 0] orientational relationships and having residual resistivity ratio (RRR) similar to 60 for 220 nm thick films. On Si, we find a complex grain texturing with Ta [1 1 0] normal to the substrate and RRR similar to 30. We further demonstrate airbridge fabrication using Nb to nucleate alpha-Ta on photoresist surfaces. For the films on sapphire, resonators show TLS-limited quality factors of 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) at 10 mK (for a waveguide gap and conductor width of 3 and 6 mu m, respectively). Structural characterization using scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, low temperature transport, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the dependence of residual impurities and screw dislocation density on processing conditions. The results provide practical insights into the fabrication of advanced superconducting devices including qubit arrays and guide future works on crystallographically deterministic qubit fabrication.

TI Quantum mean estimation for lattice field theory

This shows a quadratic advantage over Monte Carlo methods which persists even in presence of a sign problem, and is insensitive to critical slowing down. The algorithm is used to compute pi with and without a sign problem, a toy U(1) gauge theory model, and the Ising model. The effect of R-Z-gate synthesis errors on a future fault-tolerant quantum computer is investigated.

TI Dissipative failure of adiabatic quantum transport as a dynamical phase
   transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is the central resource in adiabatic quantum transport. Dephasing affects the availability of that resource by biasing trajectories, driving transitions between success and failure. This depletion of entanglement is important for the practical implementation of quantum technologies. We present an alternative perspective on the failure of adiabatic computation by understanding the failure of adiabatic transport as a dynamical phase transition. These ideas are demonstrated in a toy model of adiabatic quantum transport in a two-spin system.

TI Molecule-induced surface second-order nonlinearity in an
   inversion-symmetric microcavity
SO OPTICA
AB Inversion symmetry eliminates second-order nonlinear responses in materials that are commonly used in silicon photonics. The lack of effective methods to induce second-order nonlinearity in silicon photonic materials (silicon, silica, and silicon nitride) significantly hinders their applications in second-order nonlinear integrated photonics. Herein, we demonstrate a surface second-order nonlinear optics approach for boosting the second-harmonic (SH) generation process in a silica microcavity. We theoretically and experimentally investigated whispering gallery mode microcavity-based molecule-induced second-order nonlinearity. A record-high SH efficiency of approximately 6.7% W-1 was achieved in a silica microcavity with a surface asymmetrically aligned molecular monolayer, with an enhancement factor of approximately two orders of magnitude. Our approach is not limited to the specific optical microcavity materials used in the present work, but is also a highly implementable inversion-symmetric material platform. The demonstrated results would open up a promising avenue for integrated microcavity nonlinear photonics and quantum photonics.

TI Tailoring Third-Harmonic Diffraction Efficiency by Hybrid Modes in
   High-Q Metasurfaces
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Metasurfaces are versatile tools for manipulating light; however, they have received little attention as devices for the efficient control of nonlinearly diffracted light. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear wavefront control through third-harmonic generation (THG) beaming into diffraction orders with efficiency tuned by excitation of hybrid Mie-quasi-bound states in the continuum (BIC) modes in a silicon metasurface. Simultaneous excitation of the high-Q collective Mie-type modes and quasi-BIC modes leads to their hybridization and results in a local electric field redistribution. We probe the hybrid mode by measuring far-field patterns of THG and observe the strong switching between (0,-1) and (-1,0) THG diffraction orders from 1:6 for off-resonant excitation to 129:1 for the hybrid mode excitation, showing tremendous contrast in controlling the nonlinear diffraction patterns. Our results pave the way to the realization of metasurfaces for novel light sources, telecommunications, and quantum photonics.

AB Chiral light-matter interactions have emerged as a promising area in biophysics and quantum optics. Remarkable progress in enhancing chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated through passive resonators or spontaneous emission. Nevertheless, the interaction between chiral biomolecules and stimulated emission remains unexplored. Here we introduce the concept of a biological chiral laser by amplifying chiral light-matter interactions in an active resonator through stimulated emission process. Green fluorescent proteins or chiral biomolecules encapsulated in Fabry-Perot microcavity served as the gain material while excited by either left-handed or right-handed circularly polarized pump laser. Owing to the nonlinear pump energy dependence of stimulated emission, significant enhancement of chiral light-matter interactions was demonstrated. Detailed experiments and theory revealed that lasing dissymmetry factor is determined by molecular absorption dissymmetry factor at its excitation wavelength. Finally, chirality transfer was investigated under stimulated emission process through Forster resonance energy transfer. Our findings elucidate the mechanism of stimulated chiral light-matter interactions, providing new prospects for understanding light-matter interaction in biophysics, chiral sensing, and quantum photonics.

TI Hilbert Series for Systems of UOV Polynomials
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Multivariate public key cryptosystems (MPKC) are constructed based on the problem of solving multivariate quadratic equations (MQ problem). Among various multivariate schemes, UOV is an important signature scheme since it is underlying some signature schemes such as MAYO, QR-UOV, and Rainbow which was a finalist of NIST PQC standardization project. To analyze the security of a multivariate scheme, it is necessary to analyze the first fall degree or solving degree for the system of polynomial equations used in specific attacks. It is known that the first fall degree or solving degree often relates to the Hilbert series of the ideal generated by the system. In this paper, we study the Hilbert series of the UOV scheme, and more specifically, we study the Hilbert series of ideals generated by quadratic polynomials used in the central map of UOV. In particular, we derive a prediction formula of the Hilbert series by using some experimental results. Moreover, we apply it to the analysis of the reconciliation attack for MAYO.

TI An improved BKW algorithm on the learning with rounding problem
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB The Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) algorithm is a significant combinatorial algorithm used to tackle the Learning with Errors (LWE) and Learning with Rounding (LWR) problems. In 2015, Duc et al. (in: Oswald and Fischlin (eds) EUROCRYPT 2015, Springer, Berlin, 2015) proposed the first BKW algorithm applied directly to LWR, which consists of the reduction phase and the solving phase. In this paper, we propose an improved LWR-solving BKW algorithm. For the reduction phase, we design a novel coding method with relaxed collision conditions and introduce a post-processing stage and for the solving phase, we switch to a more efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) distinguisher with pruning. Compared to previous LWR-solving BKW algorithms, our new BKW algorithm achieves a time complexity improvement of 4.0-48.5 bits for the instances considered. Additionally, by incorporating a novel heuristic method in the reduction phase, our algorithm further improves the sample complexity by 3.7-48.7 bits.

AB We present an efficient key recovery attack on the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman protocol (SIDH). The attack is based on Kani's "reducibility criterion" for isogenies from products of elliptic curves and strongly relies on the torsion point images that Alice and Bob exchange during the protocol. If we assume knowledge of the endomorphism ring of the starting curve then the classical running time is polynomial in the input size (heuristically), apart from the factorization of a small number of integers that only depend on the system parameters. The attack is particularly fast and easy to implement if one of the parties uses 2-isogenies and the starting curve comes equipped with a non-scalar endomorphism of very small degree; this is the case for SIKE, the instantiation of SIDH that recently advanced to the fourth round of NIST's standardization effort for post-quantum cryptography. Our Magma implementation breaks SIKEp434, which aims at security level 1, in about ten minutes on a single core.

TI Code-Based Cryptography With Generalized Concatenated Codes for
   Restricted Error Values
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Code-based cryptosystems are promising candidates for post-quantum cryptography. Recently, generalized concatenated codes over Gaussian and Eisenstein integers were proposed for those systems. For a channel model with errors of restricted weight, those q-ary codes lead to high error correction capabilities. Hence, these codes achieve high work factors for information set decoding attacks. In this work, we adapt this concept to codes for the weight-one error channel, i.e., a binary channel model where at most one bit-error occurs in each block of m bits. We also propose a low complexity decoding algorithm for the proposed codes. Compared to codes over Gaussian and Eisenstein integers, these codes achieve higher minimum Hamming distances for the dual codes of the inner component codes. This property increases the work factor for a structural attack on concatenated codes leading to higher overall security. For comparable security, the key size for the proposed code construction is significantly smaller than for the classic McEliece scheme based on Goppa codes.

Among its solving algorithms, the Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) algorithm, originally proposed for solving the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, performs well, especially for certain parameter settings with cryptographic importance. The BKW algorithm consists of two phases, the reduction phase and the solving phase. In this work, we study the performance of distinguishers used in the solving phase. We show that the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) distinguisher from Eurocrypt'15 has the same sample complexity as the optimal distinguisher, when making the same number of hypotheses. We also show via simulation that it performs much better than previous theory predicts and develop a sample complexity model that matches the simulations better. We also introduce an improved, pruned version of the FFT distinguisher. Finally, we indicate, via extensive experiments, that the sample dependency due to both LF2 and sample amplification is limited.

TI A Time-to-Voltage Converter With Miller-Impedance Technique for
   Single-Photon Arrival Time-to-Digital Conversions
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB A low-power time-to-voltage converter (TVC) is composed of a reconfigurable current-mode integrator and a capacitive voltage holder specifically for random sampling-and-averaging (RSA) time-to-digital conversions (TDC) in time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) systems. To accommodate the TVC circuit within each single-photon detection pixel for compact silicon-photonics integration, this paper exploits the Miller-impedance technique to demonstrate the leakage time-constant of the voltage holder being extended up to tens of milliseconds, which represents a more than 100x improvement in high-leakage 22-nm digital CMOS process technology, with only a 9-pF (36- mu m x 36- mu m) metal-finger hold capacitor and 120- mu W power consumption.

TI Realizing quantum-safe information sharing: Implementation and adoption
   challenges and policy recommendations for quantum-safe transitions
SO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY
AB By utilizing the properties of quantum mechanics, quantum computers have the potential to factor a key pair of a large prime number and break some of the core cryptographic primitives that most information infrastructures depend on. This means that today's widely used cryptographic algorithms can soon become unsafe and need to be modified with quantum-safe (QS) cryptography. While much work is still needed in developing QS cryptographic algorithms, the institutional, organizational, and policy aspects of transitioning the current infrastructures have received less attention. This paper provides an empirical analysis of QS transition challenges and policy recommendations for moving to a QS situation. We analyzed the data collected through interviews with experts and practitioners from the Dutch government. The results reveal that institutional, organizational and policy aspects of QS transitions are interconnected, and solutions for QS transitions are scattered. Consequently, organizations may face a Catch-22 loop without further actionable approaches and planning for QS transitions.

TI Exploiting ROLLO's constant-time implementations with a single-trace
   analysis
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB ROLLO, for Rank-Ouroboros, LAKE and LOCKER, was a candidate to the second round of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process. In the lastest update in April 2020, there was a key-encapsulation mechanism (ROLLO-I) and a public-key encryption scheme (ROLLO-II). In this paper, we propose a side-channel attack to recover the syndrome during the decapsulation process of ROLLO-I. From this syndrome, we explain how to recover the private key. We target two constant-time implementations: the C reference implementation and a C implementation available on GitHub. By capturing power measurements during the execution of the Gaussian elimination function, we are able to extract from a single trace each element of the syndrome. This attack can also be applied to the decryption process of ROLLO-II. Finally, we give countermeasures based on masking and randomization to protect future implementations. We also provide their impact regarding the execution time.

TI Rapid single-flux-quantum and adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron cell
   libraries using a 1 kA/cm2 niobium fabrication process
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Superconductor logic families can operate with small power dissipation and are thus suitable as building blocks for various computing systems. In some applications, superconductor logic circuits should be designed using Josephson junctions with low I-c values (I-c: critical current). For instance, lowering I-c values enables qubit interface circuits to operate with very small power dissipation at similar to 10 mK and stochastic electronics to easily induce stochastic operations. In this study, we develop the AIST 1 kA cm(-2) Nb planarized process (1KP) with a minimum critical current of 10 mu A, dedicated to the design of qubit interface circuits and stochastic electronics. We also develop rapid single-flux-quantum (RSFQ) and adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) cell libraries using the 1KP. The power dissipation of RSFQ logic using the 1KP can be reduced to 3.2% of that for conventional RSFQ logic by reducing both I-c values and a bias voltage. Furthermore, the amount of supply currents for AQFP circuits using the 1KP can be reduced to similar to 40% of that for conventional AQFP circuits due to a large mutual inductance between AQFP gates and excitation lines, which results from a reduction in I-c and an increase in inductances. We demonstrate RSFQ and AQFP circuits fabricated by the 1KP at 4.2 K. These results indicate that RSFQ and AQFP circuits using the 1KP have the potential to be used for the design of qubit interface circuits and stochastic electronics.

TI Core/Shell-Like Localized Emission at Atomically Thin Semiconductor-Au
   Interface
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Localized emission in atomically thin semiconductors has sparked significant interest as single-photon sources. Despite comprehensive studies into the correlation between localized strain and exciton emission, the impacts of charge transfer on nanobubble emission remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of core/shell-like localized emission from monolayer WSe2 nanobubbles at room temperature through near-field studies. By altering the electronic junction between monolayer WSe2 and the Au substrate, one can effectively adjust the semiconductor to metal junction from a Schottky to an Ohmic junction. Through concurrent analysis of topography, potential, tip-enhanced photoluminescence, and a piezo response force microscope, we attribute the core/shell-like emissions to strong piezoelectric potential aided by induced polarity at the WSe2-Au Schottky interface which results in spatial confinement of the excitons. Our findings present a new approach for manipulating charge confinement and engineering localized emission within atomically thin semiconductor nanobubbles. These insights hold implications for advancing the nano and quantum photonics with low-dimensional semiconductors.

AB Quasi-Cyclic Moderate-Density Parity-Check (QC-MDPC) codes are receiving increasing attention for their advantages in the context of post-quantum asymmetric cryptography based on codes. However, a fundamentally open question concerns modeling the performance of their decoders in the region of a low decoding failure rate (DFR). We provide two approaches for bounding the performance of these decoders, and study their asymptotic behavior. We first consider the well-known Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder, which achieves optimal performance and thus provides a lower bound on the performance of any sub-optimal decoder. We provide lower and upper bounds on the performance of ML decoding of QC-MDPC codes and show that the DFR of the ML decoder decays polynomially in the QC-MDPC code length when all other parameters are fixed. Secondly, we analyze some hard to decode error patterns for Bit-Flipping (BF) decoding algorithms, from which we derive some lower bounds on the DFR of BF decoders applied to QC-MDPC codes.

TI On the Computational Hardness of Quantum One-Wayness
SO QUANTUM
AB There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness are needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions and pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require equivalent computational assumptions in order to be realized. Furthermore, the existence of either of these primitives implies that P not equal NP, which gives a lower bound on the necessary hardness. One can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output: respectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike in the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built from the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators for certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators, the implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge the existence of one-way state generators has no known implications in traditional complexity theory. We show that pseudorandom states compressing n bits to log n + 1 qubits can be used to build one-way state generators and that pseudorandom states compressing n bits to omega (log n) qubits are themselves one-way state generators. This is a nearly optimal result, since pseudorandom states with fewer than c log n-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that any one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical access to a PP oracle. An interesting implication of our results is that a t(n)-copy one-way state generator exists unconditionally, for every t(n) = o(n/ log n). This contrasts nicely with the previously known fact that O(n)-copy one-way state generators require computational hardness. We also outline a new route towards a black-box separation between one-way state generators and quantum bit commitments.

AB Chameleon hash (CH) function differs from a classical hash function in a way that a collision can be found with the knowledge of a trapdoor secret key. CH schemes have been used in various cryptographic applications such as sanitizable signatures and redactable blockchains. In this work, we reconstruct CH to ensure advanced security and usability. Our contributions are four-fold. First, we propose the first CH scheme, which supports full security, meaning the inclusion of both full indistinguishability and full collision-resistance. These two properties are required in the strongest CH security model in the literature. We achieve this by our innovative design of removing the CH public key during the computation of the hash value. Second, we investigate the security of CH in the multi-party setting and introduce the new properties of claimability and deniability under this setting. Third, we present and implement two instantiations of our CH scheme: an ECC-based one and a post-quantum lattice-based one. Our implementation demonstrates their practicality. Finally, we discuss the possible use cases in the blockchain.

TI Threshold switching strategy for unambiguous state discrimination of
   quadrature phase-shift-keying coherent states under thermal noise
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum-enhanced measurement technologies can unambiguously discriminate coherent states with accuracy beyond the classical heterodyne measurement. However, typical quantum-enhanced measurement scheme is vulnerable to the thermal noise, which will change the photon counting statistics of the coherent state. This paper presents a threshold-switching strategy that can discriminate quadrature phase-shift-keying coherent states with performance surpassing the typical quantum-enhanced scheme. In our scheme, photon number resolving detectors are used to switch the value of the threshold, which can mitigate the influence of thermal noise and other imperfections. Simulation results show that our scheme unambiguously discriminates the signal states with higher correct probability and the same error ratio compared with the typical scheme. Besides, this scheme can reduce the error ratio simultaneously for thermal noise N <= 0.2. The paper demonstrations that quantum-enhanced measurement with the threshold-switching strategy can adapt to different thermal noises by switching the value of the threshold under situations of different thermal noises and signal states.

TI Deep Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Divide-And-Conquer Method for
   Solving a Larger Problem with Smaller Size Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a divide-and-conquer method for the quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to solve larger problems with small-scale quantum computers. Specifically, we concatenate a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a reduction in the system dimension, where the interactions between divided subsystems are taken as an effective Hamiltonian expanded by the reduced basis. Then the effective Hamiltonian is further solved by the VQE, which we call deep VQE. Deep VQE allows us to apply quantum-classical hybrid algorithms on small-scale quantum computers to large systems with strong intrasubsystem interactions and weak intersubsystem interactions, or strongly correlated spin models on large regular lattices. As proof-of-principle numerical demonstrations, we use the proposed method for quasi-one-dimensional models, including one-dimensionally coupled 12-qubit Heisenberg antiferromagnetic models on kagome lattices as well as two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnetic models on square lattices. The largest problem size of 64 qubits is solved by simulating 20-qubit quantum computers with a reasonably good accuracy approximately a few %. The proposed scheme enables us to handle the problems of > 1000 qubits by concatenating VQEs with a few tens of qubits. While it is unclear how accurate ground-state energy can be obtained for such a large system, our numerical results on a 64-qubit system suggest that deep VQE provides a good approximation (discrepancy within a few percent) and has room for further improvement. Therefore, deep VQE provides us a promising pathway to solve practically important problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.

TI On the applicability of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation to the BIKE
   KEM
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS- COMPUTER SYSTEMS THEORY
AB The QC-MDPC code-based KEM BIKE is one of the Round-3 candidates of the NIST PQC standardization project. Its Round-2 specification document described variants claiming to have IND-CCA security. The security proof used the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation and a decoder targeting a Decoding Failure Rate (DFR) of 2(-128) (for Level-1 security). However, several aspects needed to be amended in order for the IND-CCA proof to hold. The main issue is that using a decoder with DFR of 2(-128) does not necessarily imply that the underlying PKE is delta-correct with delta = 2(-128), as required. In this paper, we handle the necessary aspects to ensure the security claim is correct. In particular, we close the gap in the proof by defining the notion of message-agnostic PKE. We show that the PKEs underlying the BIKE versions are message-agnostic. This implies that BIKE with a decoder that has a sufficiently low DFR is also an IND-CCA KEM.

SO CYBERSECURITY
AB One-way quantum state generators (OWSGs), which serve as the quantum analog of one-way functions (OWFs), have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications and the reduced assumption requirements compared to OWFs. This paper explores the applications of structured OWSGs and presents several results: We construct efficiently samplable, statistically far but computationally indistinguishable pairs of distributions (EFI pairs) from secretly-verifiable OWSGs with somewhat injectivity, which has implications for quantum commitment schemes; We demonstrate that somewhat injective OWSGs can be derived from almost regular OWSGs; We also focus on a specific type of OWSGs, termed SV-eSI-OWSGs, and prove that the existence of a single-copy-secure hard-core predicate for these OWSGs is both necessary and sufficient for constructing EFI pairs; Moreover, we propose a simple quantum commitment scheme based on the decisional LPN assumption, offering improved parameter choices and flexibility over classical schemes. These findings contribute to the understanding and potential applications of OWSGs in quantum cryptography.

AB Isogeny-based cryptography is cryptographic schemes whose security is based on the hardness of a mathematical problem called the isogeny problem, and is attracting attention as one of the candidates for post-quantum cryptography. A representative isogeny-based cryptography is the signature scheme called SQIsign, which was submitted to the NIST PQC standardization competition. SQIsign has attracted much attention because of its very short signature and key size among the candidates for the NIST PQC standardization. Recently, a lot of new schemes have been proposed that use high-dimensional isogenies. Among them, the signature scheme called SQIsignHD has an even shorter signature size than SQIsign. However, it requires 4-dimensional isogeny computations for the signature verification. In this paper, we propose a new signature scheme, SQIsign2D-East, which requires only two-dimensional isogeny computations for verification, thus reducing the computational cost of verification though increasing the signing cost. First, we generalized an algorithm called RandIsogImg, which computes a random isogeny of non-smooth degree. Then, by using this generalized RandIsogImg, we construct a new signature scheme SQIsign2D-East.

TI The Efficiency of Embedding-Based Attacks on the GGH Lattice-Based
   Cryptosystem
SO MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
AB The Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) cryptosystem is declared broken due to the modified versions of the embedding attacks, known as Nguyen's s, Nguyen's 2s and Lee-Hahn's attacks. Despite using the same approach as the original embedding attack, these attacks deployed different strategies and resulted in different performances for breaking the GGH cryptosystem. In this paper, we described those strategies in detail. Moreover, we investigated the mathematical factors behind these attacks' ability and performance discrepancies. Mathematical proof examines and discusses the factors that triggered those variances. As a result, the expected lattice gap and implemented lattice dimensions are mathematically proven as the factors that significantly influenced these attacks' performance. By demonstrating how the attacks manipulated these factors, any lattice-based cryptosystem that relies on the hardness of the CVP could avoid repeating the same slipup as the GGH. Hence, precautionary action could be proactively taken to prevent it from being threatened by embedding-based attacks.

TI Reusable Fuzzy Extractor from Isogeny-Based Assumptions
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A fuzzy extractor is a foundational cryptographic component that enables the extraction of reproducible and uniformly random strings from sources with inherent noise, such as biometric traits. Reusable fuzzy extractor guarantees the security of multiple extractions from the same noisy source. In addition, although isogeny-based cryptography has become an important branch in post-quantum cryptography, the study of fuzzy extractors based on isogeny assumptions is still in its early stages and holds much room for improvement. In this paper, we give two reusable fuzzy extractor schemes derived from isogeny-based assumptions: one is based on the linear hidden shift assumption over group actions, while the other is built upon the group-action decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption within the isogeny framework. Both proposed constructions achieve post-quantum security and are capable of correcting a linear proportion of errors. They rely solely on fundamental cryptographic primitives, which ensure simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, the second construction is based on restricted effective group action, which is weaker than the effective group action used in the first construction, thereby offering greater practical applicability.

TI Quantum Secure Multi-Party Summation with Graph State
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum secure multi-party summation (QSMS) is a fundamental problem in quantum secure multi-party computation (QSMC), wherein multiple parties compute the sum of their data without revealing them. This paper proposes a novel QSMS protocol based on graph state, which offers enhanced security, usability, and flexibility compared to existing methods. The protocol leverages the structural advantages of graph state and employs random graph state structures and random encryption gate operations to provide stronger security. Additionally, the stabilizer of the graph state is utilized to detect eavesdroppers and channel noise without the need for decoy bits. The protocol allows for the arbitrary addition and deletion of participants, enabling greater flexibility. Experimental verification is conducted to demonstrate the security, effectiveness, and practicality of the proposed protocols. The correctness and security of the protocols are formally proven. The QSMS method based on graph state introduces new opportunities for QSMC. It highlights the potential of leveraging quantum graph state technology to securely and efficiently solve various multi-party computation problems.

AB This paper explores the challenges and potential solutions of implementing the recommended upcoming post-quantum cryptography standards (the CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithms) onresource constrained devices. The high computational cost of polynomial operations, fundamental to cryptography based on ideal lattices, presents significant challenges in an efficient implementation. This paper proposes a hardware/software co-design strategy using RISC-Vextensions to optimize resource utilization and speed up the number-theoretic transformations (NTTs). The primary contributions include a lightweight custom arithmetic logic unit (ALU), integrated into a 4-stage pipeline 32-bit RISC-V processor. This ALU is tailored towards the NTT computations and supports modular arithmetic as well as NTT butterfly operations. Furthermore, an extension to the RISC-V instruction set is introduced, with ten new instructions accessing the custom ALU to perform the necessary operations. The new instructions reduce the cycle count of the Kyber and Dilithium NTTs by more than 80% compared to optimized assembly, while being more lightweight than other works that exist in the literature.

TI Rank AGS Identification Scheme and Signature Scheme
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The identification protocol is a type of zero-knowledge proof. One party (the prover) needs to prove his identity to another party (the verifier) without revealing the secret key to the verifier. One can apply the Fiat-Shamir transformation to convert an identification scheme into a signature scheme which can be used for achieving security purposes and cryptographic purposes, especially for authentication. In this paper, we recall an identification protocol, namely the RankID scheme, and show that the scheme is incorrect and insecure. Then, we proposed a more natural approach to construct the rank version of the AGS identification protocol and show that our construction overcomes the security flaws in the RankID scheme. Our proposal achieves better results when comparing the public key size, secret key size, and signature size with the existing identification schemes, such as Rank RVDC and Rank CVE schemes. Our proposal also achieves 90%, 50%, and 96% reduction for the signature size, secret key size, and public key size when compared to the Rank CVE signature scheme.

TI Fluctuation theorems for multitime processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we extend the fluctuation theorems used for quantum channels to multitime processes. The fluctuation theorems for quantum channels are less restrictive. We show that the given entropy production can be equal to the result of a closed system environment. The assumption that the system evolves under a completely positive and trace-preserving map is quite general, but it is more specific for cases in which the system is initially correlated with the environment. System-environment correlations arise naturally in multitime processes with which we can give clear and physical interpretations regarding the effects of correlations. Multitime processes can provide many-body channels. The Choi state of such a many-body channel is called a process tensor. One can derive channels by executing the process tensor on a set of operations. We establish a general quantum fluctuation theorem framework for a many-body channel and its derived channels. In this framework, the effects of correla-tions are reflected in a Markovian property. For Markovian processes, we can extend the two-point measurement to a three-point measurement and obtain that the fluctuation theorems contain complete information about the intermediate state. For non-Markovian processes, the complete measurement of the intermediate state leads to conflicts. Therefore, we use a general measurement, which only provides partial information, for the intermediate state. The corresponding fluctuation theorems show that memory effects can reduce these fluctuations. This is consistent with the fact that system states can be recovered under non-Markovian processes.

TI A novel transition protocol to post-quantum cryptocurrency blockchains
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Blockchain-based public ledgers, known as cryptocurrencies, are used to build peer-to-peer digital payment systems. Cryptocurrency transactions are secured by digital signatures. However, today's public-key cryptography, which is the basis of digital signatures, is vulnerable to quantum attacks. Therefore, there is a significant risk to the 2.7 trillion dollar market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector in the Quantum Era. In this paper, we review the current risk of quantum attacks on the blockchains of cryptocurrencies. We also discuss the migration of existing cryptocurrencies from classical to quantum-resistant blockchains and review some of the existing transition protocol algorithms. The main contribution of this work is to propose a new transition protocol algorithm that allows smooth and safe migration to post-quantum blockchains without delay. The proposed algorithm requires a soft fork of the original blockchain, which makes it more desirable than other hard-fork solutions. We also prove the soundness and completeness properties of the proposed algorithm and discuss its advantages compared to the existing ones. We conclude by highlighting our recommendations based on this study.

AB Group actions are fundamental mathematical tools, with a long history of use in cryptography. Indeed, the action of finite groups at the basis of the discrete logarithm problem is behind a very large portion of modern cryptographic systems. With the advent of post-quantum cryptography, however, other group actions, such as isogeny-based ones, received interest from the cryptographic community, attracted by the possibility of translating old discrete logarithm-based functionalities.
   Usually, research focuses on abelian group actions; however in this work we show that isomorphism problems which stem from non-abelian cryptographic group actions can be viable building blocks for threshold signature schemes. In particular, we construct a full N-out-of-N threshold signature scheme, and discuss the efficiency issues arising from extending it to the generic T-out-of-N case. To give a practical outlook on our constructions, we instantiate them with two different flavors of code-based cryptographic group actions, respectively at the basis of the LESS and MEDS signature schemes, two of NIST's candidates in the recent call for post-quantum standardization.

AB Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is relatively new and has yet to stand the test of time. Therefore, one of the challenges of the transition to PQC is to design protocols that can withstand this revolution without losing the level of security provided by the use of traditional quantum-vulnerable algorithms. Among the vast number of protocols and frameworks that require transition, the digital identity is one of the most important, especially in the case of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a decentralized model to build and to prove the identity with full control over the data. This paper presents for the first time the design of a Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) hybrid SSI framework. The enabling component of the hybrid framework is the novel design of PQ/T hybrid verifiable credential and presentation, featuring a PQ/T combined proof with backward compatibility. The paper concludes with a complete design and a performance estimation on a well-resourced IoT node.

TI Lightweight Detection of a Small Number of Large Errors in a Quantum
   Circuit
SO QUANTUM
AB Suppose we want to implement a unitary U, for instance a circuit for some quantum algorithm. Suppose our actual implementation is a unitary (U) over tilde, which we can only apply as a black-box. In general it is an exponentially-hard task to decide whether (U) over tilde equals the intended U, or is significantly different in a worst-case norm. In this paper we consider two special cases where relatively efficient and lightweight procedures exist for this task.
   First, we give an efficient procedure under the assumption that U and (U) over tilde (both of which we can now apply as a black-box) are either equal, or differ significantly in only one k-qubit gate, where k = O(1) (the k qubits need not be contiguous). Second, we give an even more lightweight procedure under the assumption that U and (U) over tilde are Clifford circuits which are either equal, or different in arbitrary ways (the specification of U is now classically given while (U) over tilde can still only be applied as a black-box). Both procedures only need to run (U) over tilde a constant number of times to detect a constant error in a worst-case norm. We note that the Clifford result also follows from earlier work of Flasnmia and Liu [FL11] and da Silva, Landon-Cardinal, and Poulin [dSLCP 11].
   In the Clifford case, our error-detection procedure also allows us efficiently to learn (and hence correct) (U) over tilde if we have a small list of possible errors that could have happened to U; for example if we know that only O(1) of the gates of (U) over tilde are wrong, this list will be polynomially small and we can test each possible erroneous version of U for equality with U.

TI Broadband nonreciprocal transmission tuned by pump-induced magnon modes
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Nonreciprocal electromagnetic wave transmission is essential for wireless communication, quantum computing, and radar systems, traditionally relying on breaking time-reversal symmetry through static magnetic fields or structural modifications, which face limitations in tunability and integration. Recent advancements in cavity magnonics, particularly the use of bound states in the continuum (BIC) and pump-induced magnon mode (PIM), have enhanced the nonreciprocal isolation and dynamic control of magnon dynamics. In this study, a novel method to achieve broadband-tunable microwave nonreciprocal isolation is presented by introducing multiple modulated pump signals, thereby extending traditional single-mode magnon-based nonreciprocal transmission to multi-channel and broadband regimes. The core method involves exciting multiple PIMs in a cavity magnonics system and strongly coupling them with BIC to generate hybrid modes with pronounced nonreciprocal characteristics. The experimental setup is comprised of a 1-millimeter-diameter yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere positioned at the node of a microwave resonator (central frequency: 2.92 GHz), with pump signals injected through a microwave patch antenna. By dynamically tuning the frequency, power, and number of pump signals, the precise control over the number of nonreciprocal isolation channels and their spectral positions is realized. Notably, the continuous tuning of the nonreciprocal bandwidth is achieved by increasing the number of pump signals from 2 to 5, expanding the isolation bandwidth from 6 MHz to 14 MHz. Furthermore, by tailoring the spectral distribution of pump signals, the system realizes flexible switching between bandpass and band-stop isolation states. Importantly, this method eliminates the need of static magnetic field adjustments or structural reconfiguration, relying solely on coherent microwave-photon interactions to modulate PIM-BIC coupling. Experimental results highlight two key physical outcomes: 1) Extending conventional single-mode magnonic nonreciprocal transmission to multi-channel and broadband-tunable regimes; 2) achieving microwave nonreciprocal control without the need of static magnetic field adjustments or structural reconfiguration. These advances establish a robust platform for designing reconfigurable multi-channel isolators and circulators, which can be directly applied to microwave communication systems, quantum information processing, and radar technologies.

TI Optimized optical tomography of quantum states of a room-temperature

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate an experimental technique for the quantum-state tomography of the collective qutrit states of a room-temperature alkali-metal vapor. It is based on the measurements of the polarization of light traversing the vapor subjected to a magnetic field. To assess the technique's robustness against errors, experimental investigations are supported with numerical simulations. This not only allows us to determine the fidelity of the reconstructed states, but also to analyze the quality of the reconstruction for specific experimental parameters, such as light tuning and the number of measurements. By utilizing the conditional number, we demonstrate that the reconstruction robustness can be optimized by a proper adjustment of experimental parameters, and further improvement is possible with the repetition of specific measurements. Our results demonstrate the potential of this high-fidelity reconstruction method of quantum states of room-temperature atomic vapors.

TI Comparison of Methods for Quantifying Extracellular Vesicles of
   Gram-Negative Bacteria
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB There are a variety of methods employed by laboratories for quantifying extracellular vesicles isolated from bacteria. As a result, the ability to compare results across published studies can lead to questions regarding the suitability of methods and buffers for accurately quantifying these vesicles. Within the literature, there are several common methods for vesicle quantification. These include lipid quantification using the lipophilic dye FM 4-64, protein quantification using microBCA, Qubit, and NanoOrange assays, or direct vesicle enumeration using nanoparticle tracking analysis. In addition, various diluents and lysis buffers are also used to resuspend and treat vesicles. In this study, we directly compared the quantification of a bacterial outer membrane vesicle using several commonly used methods. We also tested the impact of different buffers, buffer age, lysis method, and vesicle diluent on vesicle quantification. The results showed that buffer age had no significant effect on vesicle quantification, but the lysis method impacted the reliability of measurements using Qubit and NanoOrange. The microBCA assay displayed the least variability in protein concentration values and was the most consistent, regardless of the buffer or diluent used. MicroBCA also demonstrated the strongest correlation to the NTA-determined particle number across a range of vesicle concentrations. Overall, these results indicate that with appropriate diluent and buffer choice, microBCA vs. NTA standard curves could be generated and the microBCA assay used to estimate the particle number when NTA instrumentation is not readily available.

As a special case, we obtain a barycentric decomposition for channels between such spaces and for normalized positive-operator-valued measures in separable Hilbert spaces. This extends the known results by Ali and Chiribella et al on decompositions of quantum measurements, and formalizes the fact that every instrument between finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be represented using only finite-outcome instruments.

TI Fundamental Energy Requirement of Reversible Quantum Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Landauer's principle asserts that any computation has an unavoidable energy cost that grows proportionally to its degree of logical irreversibility. But even a logically reversible operation, when run on a physical processor that operates on different energy levels, requires energy. Here we quantify this energy requirement, providing upper and lower bounds that coincide up to a constant factor. We derive these bounds from a general quantum resource-theoretic argument, which implies that the initial resource requirement for implementing a unitary operation within an error. grows like 1/root epsilon. times the amount of resource generated by the operation. Applying these results to quantum circuits, we find that their energy requirement can, by an appropriate design, be made independent of their time complexity.

TI Superoperator Approach to the Lindbladian Dynamics of a Mirror-Field
   System
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We use superoperator techniques to solve the master equation for the interaction between a single-mode quantized field and a single mechanical mode of a moving mirror, which is coupled to a zero-temperature reservoir that damps its amplitude. The solution we provide allows for its application in any initial state of the combined system. Furthermore, we obtain solutions to the stationary master equation for an initial number state for the field that is consistent with the result obtained for the average number of phonons.

TI Nonreciprocal scattering in a microwave frequency comb
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We investigate nonreciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the m-->  pound scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process  pound --> m. We outline the methodology for realizing nonreciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer alternative quantum correlations.

TI Probing Mermin's inequalities violations through pseudospin operators
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB The violation of Mermin's inequalities is analyzed by making use of two different Bell setups built with pseudospin operators. Employing entangled states defined by means of squeezed and coherent states, the expectation value of Mermin's polynomials Mn is evaluated for n = 3 and n = 4. In each case, we analyze the correlator ⟨Mn⟩ and identify the set of parameters leading to the violation of Mermin's inequalities and to the saturation of the bound predicted by Quantum Mechanics.

TI Quantum spin systems: Toroidal classification and geometric duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We demonstrate a toroidal classification for quantum spin systems, revealing an intrinsic geometric duality within this structure. Through our classification and duality, we reveal that various bipartite quantum features in magnon systems can manifest equivalently in both bipartite ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials, based upon the availability of relevant Hamiltonian parameters. Additionally, the results highlight the antiferromagnetic regime as an ultrafast dual counterpart to the ferromagnetic regime, both exhibiting identical capabilities for quantum spintronics and technological applications. Concrete illustrations are provided, demonstrating how splitting and squeezing types of two-mode magnon quantum correlations can be realized across ferro- and antiferromagnetic regimes.

TI Effect of spatial walk-off on squeezing properties of quantum optical
   frequency combs
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum optical frequency combs are of great significance in the fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and high precision quantum measurement, which can be produced by using a degenerate type-I synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO). When anisotropic crystal is used as a nonlinear medium in the SPOPO, the spatial walk-off effect will occur due to the birefringence effect, which cannot be ignored and will adversely affect the generation of squeezed state. In this work, we investigate the influence of spatial walk-off effect on the squeezing level of quantum optical frequency combs both theoretically and experimentally. A Ti : sapphire mode-locked femtosecond pulsed laser which produces 130 fs pulse trains at 815 nm with a repetition rate of 76 MHz is utilized as a fundamental source. Its second harmonic at 407.5 nm is used to pump the collinear BiB3O6 (BIBO) crystal for generating the squeezed vacuum frequency comb. It is indicated that as the crystal length increases, the area of interaction between pump light and signal light decreases gradually. Thus the enhancement of squeezing is eventually limited by the spatial walk-off effect. According to the simulations, the squeezing level reaches a maximum value when the crystal length is 1.49 mm. The quantum properties of squeezed vacuum optical frequency combs obtained for four crystal lengths (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm) are subsequently measured experimentally. When the length of BIBO is 1.5 mm, the maximum vacuum squeezing of (3.6 +/- 0.2) dB is obtained, which is (7.0 +/- 0.2) dB after being corrected for detection loss. The experimental results are consistent with the numerical simulations. This study demonstrates that the spatial walk-off effect in nonlinear crystal is a significant factor affecting the quantum optical frequency comb, and the theoretical model presented in this paper can be used to provide a guideline for optimizing the experimental implementation.

TI Optomechanics-Based Quantum Estimation Theory for Collapse Models

We show that a study performed in non-equilibrium conditions unveils the advantages provided by the use of genuinely quantum resources-such as quantum correlations-in estimating the CSL-induced diffusion rate. In stationary conditions, instead, the gap between quantum performance and a classical scheme disappears. Our investigation contributes to the ongoing effort aimed at identifying suitable conditions for the experimental assessment of collapse models.

TI Exchange fluctuation theorems for strongly interacting quantum pumps
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We derive a general quantum exchange fluctuation theorem for multipartite systems with arbitrary coupling strengths by taking into account the informational contribution of the back-action of the quantum measurements, which contributes to the increase in the von-Neumann entropy of the quantum system. The resulting second law of thermodynamics is tighter than the conventional Clausius inequality. The derived bound is the quantum mutual information of the conditional thermal state, which is a thermal state conditioned on the initial energy measurement. These results elucidate the role of quantum correlations in the heat exchange between multiple subsystems.

TI Revealing nonclassicality of multiphoton optical beams via artificial
   neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The identification of nonclassical features of multiphoton quantum states represents a crucial task in the development of many quantum photonic technologies. Under realistic experimental conditions, a photonic quantum state gets affected by its interaction with several nonideal optoelectronic devices, including those used to guide, detect, or characterize it. The result of such noisy interaction is that the nonclassical features of the original quantum state get considerably reduced or are completely absent in the detected, final state. In this work, the self-learning features of artificial neural networks are exploited to experimentally show that the nonclassicality of multiphoton quantum states can be assessed and fully characterized, even in the cases in which the nonclassical features are concealed by the measuring devices. Our work paves the way toward artificial-intelligence-assisted experimental-setup characterization, as well as smart quantum state nonclassicality identification.

TI A Trust Establishment and Key Management Architecture for
   Hospital-at-Home
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING FOR HEALTHCARE
AB The landscape of healthcare is experiencing a digitalization shift, transferring many medical activities to the patients' homes, a phenomenon commonly referred to as Hospital-at-Home. While Internet of Things (IoT) devices facilitate the building of such systems, there is a need for powerful middleware that encapsulates device-to-device communication and enables the construction of user-friendly, secure, and robust Hospital-at-Home systems. A key challenge for such middleware is to build a trustworthy and lightweight key management system allowing different devices in the system to exchange messages securely. In this article, we present a simple, easily manageable and scalable such architecture which, in addition, supports long-term data protection using post-quantum cryptographic primitives. Our proposed solution utilizes a Merkle tree to enable the IoT devices to establish trust between each other automatically, even in the absence of an Internet connection. We have implemented the architecture and present performance figures as well as a security analysis of our approach.

In this work, we expand on such attacks by analyzing the behavior of the zero curve E-0 and six curve E-6 in CSIDH and SIKE. We demonstrate an attack on static-key CSIDH and SIKE implementations that recovers bits of the secret key by observing via zero-value-based resp. exploiting correlation-collision-based side-channel analysis whether secret isogeny walks pass over the zero or six curve. We apply this attack to fully recover secret keys of SIKE and two state-of-the-art CSIDH-based implementations: CTIDH and SQALE. We show the feasibility of exploiting side-channel information for the proposed attacks based on simulations with various realistic noise levels. Additionally, we discuss countermeasures to prevent zero-value and correlation-collision attacks against CSIDH and SIKE in our attacker model.

TI An Efficient Unified Polynomial Arithmetic Unit for CRYSTALS-Dilithium
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB The CRYSTALS-Dilithium protocol is considered as one of the most promising digital signature schemes in NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process. While separating arithmetic computation units can be advantageous in some cases, it can lead to increased hardware resource consumption and performance degradation. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel architecture called the Unified Polynomial Arithmetic Unit (UniPAU), specifically designed for the Dilithium signature scheme. The proposed UniPAU offers a unique hardware module that can execute all the polynomial operations required for the Dilithium signature scheme. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our design, we implemented it on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 (xczu9eg-ffvb1156-2-e) FPGA platform and evaluated its hardware efficiency and performance. Our implementation results indicate that the proposed UniPAU can achieve comparable throughput while consuming fewer hardware resources compared to state-of-the-art studies. These findings suggest that our UniPAU can provide an optimized and efficient hardware solution for polynomial arithmetic operations in the Dilithium signature scheme.

TI Coupling Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride to Monolithic Bullseye

SO NANO LETTERS
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are becoming an increasingly important building block for quantum photonic applications. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient coupling of recently discovered spin defects in hBN to purposely designed bullseye cavities. We show that boron vacancy spin defects couple to the monolithic hBN cavity system and exhibit a 6.5-fold enhancement. In addition, by comparative finite-difference time-domain modeling, we shed light on the emission dipole orientation, which has not been experimentally demonstrated at this point. Beyond that, the coupled spin system exhibits an enhanced contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance readout and improved signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, our experimental results, supported by simulations, constitute a first step toward integration of hBN spin defects with photonic resonators for a scalable spin-photon interface.

TI Experimental approach to demonstrating contextuality for qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method to experimentally demonstrate contextuality with a family of tests for qudits. The experiment we propose uses a qudit encoded in the path of a single photon and its temporal degrees of freedom. We consider the impact of noise on the effectiveness of these tests, taking the approach of ontologically faithful noncontextuality. In this approach, imperfections in the experimental setup must be taken into account in any faithful ontological (classical) model, which limits how much the statistics can deviate within different contexts. In this way we bound the precision of the experimental setup under which ontologically faithful noncontextual models can be refuted. We further consider the noise tolerance through different types of decoherence models on different types of encodings of qudits. We quantify the effect of the decoherence on the required precision for the experimental setup in order to demonstrate contextuality in this broader sense.

TI Systematization of Shuffling Countermeasures: With an Application to
   CRYSTALS-Dilithium
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Shuffling is an essential countermeasure employed during the implementation of cryptographic algorithms to mitigate vulnerabilities against side-channel attacks, regardless of the algorithm's nature. However, a comprehensive and structured shuffling framework has yet to be established, resulting in the need for developers to create customized solutions adapted to their specific algorithmic or operational requirements. This research paper introduces an innovative and systematic shuffling framework, providing developers with a set of guidelines to effectively select suitable shuffling methodologies aligned with their specific objectives. Additionally, we illustrate the application of this framework to the CRYSTALS-Dilithium signature algorithm, a finalist in NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process. By leveraging our framework, we devise shuffling countermeasures and present an extensive array of twelve shuffling schemes. For each scheme, shuffling schemes are applied universally to all operations involving any confidential data, regardless of existence of known attacks targeting corresponding data. We also measured the performance of implementations of our shuffling schemes, the minimal overhead is 12.4%.

TI Vulnerability-Information Leakage of Reused Secret Key in NewHope
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB The NIST post-quantum project intends to standardize cryptographic systems that are secure against attacks by both quantum and classical computers. One of these cryptographic systems is NewHope that is a RING-LWE based key exchange scheme. The NewHope Key Encapsulation Method (KEM) allows to establish an encapsulated (secret) key shared by two participants. This scheme defines a private key that is used to encipher a random shared secret and the private key enables the deciphering. This paper presents Fault Information Leakage attacks, using conventional personal computers, if the attacked participant, say Bob, reuses his public key. This assumption is not so strong since reusing the pair (secret, public) keys saves Bob's device computing cost when the public global parameter is not changed. With our result we can conclude that, to prevent leakage, Bob should not reuse his NewHope secret and public keys because Bob's secret key can be retrieved with only 2 communications. We also found that Bob's secret keys can be retrieved for NewHopeToy2, NewHopeToy1 and NewHopeLudicrous with 1, 2, and 3 communications, respectively.

TI Anomaly detection in high-energy physics using a quantum autoencoder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The lack of evidence for new interactions and particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has motivated the high-energy physics community to explore model-agnostic data-analysis approaches to search for new physics. Autoencoders are unsupervised machine learning models based on artificial neural networks, capable of learning background distributions. We study quantum autoencoders based on variational quantum circuits for the problem of anomaly detection at the LHC. For a QCD tt??background and resonant heavy-Higgs signals, we find that a simple quantum autoencoder outperforms classical autoencoders for the same inputs and trains very efficiently. Moreover, this performance is reproducible on present quantum devices. This shows that quantum autoencoders are good candidates for analysing highenergy physics data in future LHC runs.

TI Nano antenna-assisted quantum dots emission into high-index planar
   waveguide
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Integrated quantum photonic circuits require the efficient coupling of photon sources to photonic waveguides. Hybrid plasmonic/photonic platforms are a promising approach, taking advantage of both plasmon modal confinement for efficient coupling to a nearby emitter and photonic circuitry for optical data transfer and processing. In this work, we established directional quantum dot (QD) emission coupling to a planar TiO2 waveguide assisted by a Yagi-Uda antenna. Antenna on waveguide is first designed by scaling radio frequency dimensions to nano-optics, taking into account the hybrid plasmonic/photonic platform. Design is then optimized by full numerical simulations. We fabricate the antenna on a TiO2 planar waveguide and deposit a few QDs close to the Yagi-Uda antenna. The optical characterization shows clear directional coupling originating from antenna effect. We estimate the coupling efficiency and directivity of the light emitted into the waveguide.

TI Two-dimensional many-body localized systems coupled to a heat bath
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction-dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also perform long-time time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) simulations with matrix product states, but find that the quantum circuit approach produces superior results because of the lack of boundary effects. Finally, we present additional results on the two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites.

TI Bistable and absolute switching driven by superconducting exchange
   coupling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB As per de Gennes' predictions, a superconducting layer placed between two ferromagnetic insulators can drive an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between them. Using two ferromagnetic insulating GdN layers having dissimilar switching fields sandwiching a superconducting Vanadium thin film, we demonstrate evidence of such exchange coupling. We demonstrate that such an exchange coupling promotes switching between zero and finite resistance states of Vanadium. Our devices hold either a finite resistance or a zero-resistance state at zero magnetic field, dependent on their magnetic field history. Moreover, we demonstrate the absolute switching effect, thus making such devices suitable for application at the lowest temperatures as non-volatile cryogenic memory useful for futuristic quantum circuits and for several other superconducting spintronic applications.

TI Femtosecond-laser-induced creation of G and W color centers in
   silicon-on-insulator substrates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The creation of fluorescent defects in silicon is a key stepping stone toward assuring the integration perspectives of quantum photonic devices into existing technologies. Here, we demonstrate the creation, by femtosecond laser annealing, of W and G centers in commercial silicon on insulator (SOI) previously implanted with 12 C + ions. Their quality is comparable to that found for the same emitters obtained with conventional implantation processes; as quantified by the photoluminescence radiative lifetime, the broadening of their zero -phonon line (ZPL), and the evolution of these quantities with temperature. In addition to this, we show that both defects can be created without carbon implantation and that we can erase the G centers by annealing while enhancing the W -center emission. These demonstrations are relevant to the deterministic and operando generation of quantum emitters in silicon.

TI Toward ultimate-efficiency frequency conversion in nonlinear optical
   microresonators
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Integrated nonlinear photonics has emerged as a transformative platform, enabling nanoscale nonlinear optical processes with substantial implications. Achieving efficient nonlinear frequency conversion in microresonators is paramount to fully unlocking this potential, yet the absolute conversion efficiency (ACE) remains fundamentally constrained by dissipative losses and intrinsic nonlinear effects. In this work, we establish a unified framework for second harmonic generation in microresonators, identifying a decisive factor M that predicts the ACE limit under the nonlinear critical coupling (NCC) condition. Using this framework, we fabricate periodically poled lithium niobate microresonators and address the dispersive-dissipative suppression to approach the NCC condition. We achieve a record-high ACE of 61.3% with milliwatt-level pump powers toward the ultimate efficiency, with the potential for higher efficiency as the M factor increases. These results provide a versatile paradigm for high-efficiency nonlinear optical devices, offering opportunities for advancements across classical and quantum photonic applications.

TI Qudits for witnessing quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses
   under decoherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recently, a theoretical and an experimental protocol known as quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) has been proposed to test the quantum nature of gravity using two mesoscopic masses, each placed in a superposition of two locations. If after eliminating all nongravitational interactions between them the particles become entangled, one can conclude that the gravitational potential is induced via a quantum mediator, i.e., graviton. In this paper we explore extensions of the QGEM experiment to multidimensional quantum objects and examine a range of different experiment geometries, in order to determine which would generate entanglement faster. We conclude that when a sufficiently high decoherence rate is introduced, multicomponent superpositions can outperform the two-qubit setup. With low decoherence however, and given a maximum distance Ax between any two spatial states of a superposition, a set of two qubits placed in spatial superposition parallel to one another will outperform all other models given realistic experimental parameters. This is further verified with an experiment simulation, showing that O(103) measurements are required to reject the no-entanglement hypothesis with a parallel-qubit setup without decoherence at a 99.9% confidence level. The number of measurements increases when decoherence is introduced. When the decoherence rate reaches 0.125 Hz, six-dimensional qudits are required as the two-qubit system entanglement cannot be witnessed anymore. However, in this case, O(106) measurements will be required. One can group the witness operators to measure in order to reduce the number of measurements (up to tenfold). However, this may be challenging to implement experimentally.

TI Mechanical squeezing in an active-passive-coupled double-cavity
   optomechanical system via pump modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We focus on the generation of mechanical squeezing by using periodically amplitude -modulated laser to drive an active-passive-coupled double-cavity optomechanical system, where the coupled gain cavity and loss cavity can form into a parity-time (PT)-symmetry system. The numerical analysis of the system stability shows that the system is more likely to be stable in the unbroken-PT-symmetry regime than in the broken-PT-symmetry regime. The mechanical squeezing in the active-passive system exhibits stronger robustness against the thermal noise than that in the passive-passive system, and the so-called 3 dB limit can be broken in the resolved-sideband regime. Furthermore, it is also found that the mechanical squeezing obtained in the unbroken-PT-symmetry region is stronger than that in the broken-PT-symmetry region. This work may be meaningful for the quantum state engineering in the gain-loss quantum system that contributes to the study of PT-symmetric physics in the quantum regime.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Search for axion-like dark matter with spin-based amplifiers
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB A search for axion-like dark matter with a quantum sensor that enhances potential signals is reported. This work constrains the parameter space of different interactions between nucleons and axion-like particles and between nucleons and dark photons.
   Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated dark matter candidates introduced by theories beyond the standard model of particle physics. However, directly constraining their parameter space with laboratory experiments usually yields weaker limits than indirect approaches relying on astrophysical observations. Here we report the search for axion-like particles with a quantum sensor in the mass range of 8.3-744.0 feV. The sensor makes use of hyperpolarized long-lived nuclear spins as a pre-amplifier that effectively enhances a coherently oscillating axion-like dark matter field by a factor of more than 100. Using these spin-based amplifiers, we achieve an ultrahigh magnetic sensitivity of 18 fT Hz(-(1/2)), which exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art nuclear spin magnetometers. Our experiment constrains the parameter space describing the coupling of axion-like particles to nucleons over the aforementioned mass range, namely, at 67.5 feV reaching 2.9 x 10(-9) GeV-1, improving on previous laboratory constraints by at least five orders of magnitude. Our measurements also constrain the quadratic interaction between axion-like particles and nucleons as well as interactions between dark photons and nucleons, exceeding bounds from astrophysical observations.

TI Long-lived Bell states in an array of optical clock qubits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Long-lived entanglement is a key resource for quantum metrology with optical clocks. Rydberg-based entangling gates within arrays of neutral atoms enable the generation of clock-transition Bell states with high fidelity and long coherence times.
   The generation of long-lived entanglement in optical atomic clocks is one of the main goals of quantum metrology. Arrays of neutral atoms, where Rydberg-based interactions may generate entanglement between individually controlled and resolved atoms, constitute a promising quantum platform to achieve this. Here we leverage the programmable state preparation afforded by optical tweezers and the efficient strong confinement of a three-dimensional optical lattice to prepare an ensemble of strontium-atom pairs in their motional ground state. We engineer global single-qubit gates on the optical clock transition and two-qubit entangling gates via adiabatic Rydberg dressing, enabling the generation of Bell states with a state-preparation-and-measurement-corrected fidelity of 92.8(2.0)% (87.1(1.6)% without state-preparation-and-measurement correction). For use in quantum metrology, it is furthermore critical that the resulting entanglement be long lived; we find that the coherence of the Bell state has a lifetime of 4.2(6) s via parity correlations and simultaneous comparisons between entangled and unentangled ensembles. Such long-lived Bell states can be useful for enhancing metrological stability and bandwidth. In the future, atomic rearrangement will enable the implementation of many-qubit gates and cluster state generation, as well as explorations of the transverse field Ising model.

Entanglement preserving voltage-driven switching of single photons is achieved with a unique combination of ultra-fast and low-loss characteristics (less than 50 ps 10%-90% transition time and greater than 90% transmission), and we present a roadmap towards even lower losses. The switch properties are well matched to the wavelength, bandwidth and lifetime of photons generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing sources also realized in silicon photonics. Such a switch can enable reconfigurability of each single photon and addressing of each time bin, and benefit future quantum photonic circuits.

AB The variational quantum eigensolver is a promising algorithm for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computation. Verification and validation of NISQ algorithms' performance on NISQ devices is an important task. We consider the exactly diagonalizable Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model as a candidate for benchmarking NISQ computers. We use the Bethe Ansatz to construct eigenstates of the trigonometric LMG model using quantum circuits inspired by the LMG's underlying algebraic structure. We construct circuits with depth O(N) and O(log(2)N) that can prepare any trigonometric LMG eigenstate of N particles. The number of gates required for both circuits is O(N). The energies of the eigenstates can then be measured and compared to the exactly known answers.

TI Topologically-Protected Single-Photon Sources with Topological Slow
   Light Photonic Crystal Waveguides
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Slow light waveguides are advantageous for implementing high-performance single-photon sources required for scalable operation of integrated quantum photonic circuits (IQPCs), though such waveguides are known to suffer from propagation loss due to backscattering. A way to overcome the drawback is to use topological photonics, in which robust waveguiding in topologically-protected optical modes has recently been demonstrated. Here, single-photon sources are reported using single quantum dots (QDs) embedded in topological slow light waveguides based on valley photonic crystals. Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission is demonstrated from a QD into a topological slow light mode with a group index over 20 and its robust propagation even under the presence of sharp bends. These results pave the way for the realization of robust and high-performance single-photon sources indispensable for IQPCs.

TI Saber With Hybrid Striding Toom Cook-Based Multiplier: Implementation
   Using Open-Source Tool Flow and Industry Standard Chip Design Tools
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers are a significant threat to the existing cryptography algorithms. The Saber is a lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic or quantum-safe algorithm designed as a quantum computing attack-resistant protocol. The hardness of SABER is based on the Rounding with Learning (LWR) problem. This work presents a hardware implementation of Striding Toom Cook multiplier-based Saber. SABER is selected algorithms of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) round 3 criteria. After evaluation in the striding school book multiplier, a technique is also introduced to efficiently load the weighted polynomials into registers and multipliers. The implemented design is realized utilizing Cadence digital-flow (industry-standard) and open-source tool flow (OFRS) with CMOS 180nm TSMC and CMOS (130nm/180nm SKY-WATER) process, respectively. The realized chip for the proposed Saber implementation resulted in an area of 12 mm(2) and 43.59 mm(2)/16 mm2 for TSMC CMOS 180nm and SKY-WATER CMOS 180nm/130nm process, respectively. This implementation provided roughly equal latency for Key encryption, decryption, and Key generation when compared to a state-of-the-art design which utilized different techniques for polynomial multiplication whereas this design utilized 2X, 2X, and 2.5X lesser clock cycles required for Key generation, Key encryption, and decryption, respectively, compared to Saber implementation utilizing Striding Toom cook based multiplier for polynomial multiplication.

TI Observation of magnetic adatom-induced Majorana vortex and its
   hybridization with field-induced Majorana vortex in an iron-based
   superconductor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Braiding Majorana zero modes is essential for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Iron-based superconductors with nontrivial band topology have recently emerged as a surprisingly promising platform for creating distinct Majorana zero modes in magnetic vortices in a single material and at relatively high temperatures. The magnetic field-induced Abrikosov vortex lattice makes it difficult to braid a set of Majorana zero modes or to study the coupling of a Majorana doublet due to overlapping wave functions. Here we report the observation of the proposed quantum anomalous vortex with integer quantized vortex core states and the Majorana zero mode induced by magnetic Fe adatoms deposited on the surface. We observe its hybridization with a nearby field-induced Majorana vortex in iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. We also observe vortex-free Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states at the Fe adatoms with a weaker coupling to the substrate, and discover a reversible transition between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and Majorana zero mode by manipulating the exchange coupling strength. The dual origin of the Majorana zero modes, from magnetic adatoms and external magnetic field, provides a new single-material platform for studying their interactions and braiding in superconductors bearing topological band structures. Braiding Majorana modes is essential for topological quantum computing, but it remains difficult to find a suitable platform. Here, the authors report the evidence of hybridization between field-induced and magnetic adatom induced Majorana modes in an iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45, providing a possible single-material platform for braiding Majorana modes.

TI Direct coupling of light to valley current
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The coupling of circularly polarized light to local band structure extrema ("valleys") in two dimensional semiconductors promises a new electronics based on the valley degree of freedom. Such pulses, however, couple only to valley charge and not to the valley current, precluding lightwave manipulation of this second vital element of valleytronic devices. Contradicting this established wisdom, we show that the few cycle limit of circularly polarized light is imbued with an emergent vectorial character that allows direct coupling to the valley current. The underlying physical mechanism involves the emergence of a momentum space valley dipole, the orientation and magnitude of which allows complete control over the direction and magnitude of the valley current. We demonstrate this effect via minimal tight-binding models both for the visible spectrum gaps of the transition metal dichalcogenides (generation time similar to 1 fs) as well as the infrared gaps of biased bilayer graphene (similar to 14 fs); we further verify our findings with state-of-the-art time-dependent density functional theory incorporating transient excitonic effects. Our findings both mark a striking example of emergent physics in the ultrafast limit of light-matter coupling, as well as allowing the creation of valley currents on time scales that challenge quantum decoherence in matter.

TI Purcell enhanced coupling of nanowire quantum emitters to silicon
   photonic waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We design a quantum dot (QD) embedded in a vertical-cavity photonic nanowire (NW), deterministically integrated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide (WG), as a novel quantum light source in a quantum photonic integrated circuit (QPIC). Using a broadband QD emitter, we perform finite-difference time domain simulations to systematically tune key geometrical parameters and to explore the coupling mechanisms of the emission to the NW and WG modes. We find distinct Fabry-Perot resonances in the Purcell enhanced emission that govern the outcoupled power into the fundamental TE mode of the SOI-WG. With an optimized geometry that places the QD emitter in a finite NW in close proximity to the WG, we obtain peak outcoupling efficiencies for polarized emission as high as eighty percent.

TI Universal effectiveness of high-depth circuits in variational
   eigenproblems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore the effectiveness of variational quantum circuits in simulating the ground states of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. We show that generic high-depth circuits, performing a sequence of layer unitaries of the same form, can accurately approximate the desired states. We demonstrate their universal success by using two Hamiltonian systems with very different properties: the transverse field Ising model and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. The energy landscape of the high-depth circuits has a proper structure for the gradient-based optimization, i.e., the presence of local extrema-near any random initial points-reaching the ground level energy. We further test the circuit's capability of replicating random quantum states by minimizing the Euclidean distance.

TI Analyzing the barren plateau phenomenon in training quantum neural
   networks with the ZX-calculus
SO QUANTUM
AB In this paper, we propose a general scheme to analyze the gradient vanishing phenomenon, also known as the barren plateau phenomenon, in training quantum neural networks with the ZX-calculus. More precisely, we extend the barren plateaus theorem from unitary 2-design circuits to any parameterized quantum circuits under certain reasonable assumptions. The main technical contribution of this paper is representing certain integrations as ZX-diagrams and computing them with the ZX-calculus. The method is used to analyze four concrete quantum neural networks with different structures. It is shown that, for the hardware efficient ansatz and the MPS-inspired ansatz, there exist barren plateaus, while for the QCNN ansatz and the tree tensor network ansatz, there exists no barren plateau.

TI Curved GaAs cantilever waveguides for the vertical coupling to photonic
   integrated circuits
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report the nanofabrication and characterization of optical spot-size converter couplers based on curved GaAs cantilever waveguides. Using the stress mismatch between the GaAs substrate and deposited Cr-Ni-Au strips, single-mode waveguides can be bent out-of-plane in a controllable manner. A stable and vertical orientation of the out-coupler is achieved by locking the spot-size converter at a fixed 90 angle via short-range forces. The optical transmission is characterized as a function of temperature and polarization, resulting in a broad-band chip-to-fiber coupling extending over 150 nm wavelength bandwidth at cryogenic temperatures, with the lower bound for the coupling efficiency into the TE mode being 16 +/- 2% in the interval 900-1050 nm. The methods reported here are fully compatible with quantum photonic integrated circuit technology with quantum dot emitters, and open opportunities to design novel photonic devices with enhanced functionality.

TI MEMS-Integrated Tunable Fabry-Pérot Microcavity for High-Quality
   Single-Photon Sources
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-integrated Fabry-P & eacute;rot (F-P) microcavity designed for a tunable single-photon source based on a single semiconductor quantum dot (QD). Through theoretical simulations, our design achieved a Purcell factor of 23, a photon extraction efficiency exceeding 88%, and an optical cavity mode tuning range of more than 30 nm. Experimentally, we fabricated initial device prototypes using a micro-transfer printing process and demonstrated a tuning range exceeding 15 nm. The device exhibits high mechanical stability, full reversibility, and minimal hysteresis, ensuring reliable operation over multiple tuning cycles. Our findings highlight the potential of MEMS-integrated F-P microcavities for scalable, tunable single-photon sources. Furthermore, reaching a strong coupling regime could enable efficient single-photon routing, opening new possibilities for integrated quantum photonic circuits.

TI Cathodoluminescence monitoring of quantum emitter activation in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The ability to locally activate or generate quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials is of major interest for the realization of integrated quantum photonic devices. In particular, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been shown to allow a variety of techniques for obtaining quantum emitters at desired locations. Here, we use cathodoluminescence (CL) to monitor in situ the local activation of color centers by an electron beam in hBN. We observe that the CL signal saturates at a given surface dose, independently of the electron current density. Based on photoluminescence and photon correlations, we show that the number of photoactive color centers is proportional to the CL signal, and we estimate the maximum density of quantum emitters that can be generated by our technique. Our results provide insight about the activation mechanism and could help to optimize the controlled generation of single photon sources in hexagonal boron nitride.

TI Decoherence and the ultraviolet cutoff: non-Markovian dissipative
   dynamics of a charged particle in a magnetic field
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We derive a non-Markovian master equation for a charged particle in a magnetic field coupled to a bath and study decoherence by analyzing the temporal decay of the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix in the position basis. The coherent oscillations characterized by the cyclotron frequency get suppressed as a result of decoherence due to coupling with the environment. We consider an Ohmic bath with three distinct models for the high-frequency cutoff for the spectral density of the bath and compare the three cases. As expected, the three cutoff models converge in the limit of the uppermost frequency of the bath tending to infinity. We notice a dramatic slowing down of loss of coherence in the low-temperature limit dominated by zero point quantum fluctuations compared to the high-temperature classical limit dominated by thermal fluctuations. We also go beyond the Ohmic model and study super-Ohmic and sub-Ohmic baths with the spectral densities deviating from a linear dependence on the frequency. Our results are testable in a state of the art cold atom laboratory.

TI Genetic model-based success probability prediction of quantum software
   development projects
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: Quantum computing (QC) holds the potential to revolutionize computing by solving complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers, transforming fields such as cryptography, optimization, and scientific simulations. To unlock the potential benefits of QC, quantum software development (QSD) enables harnessing its power, further driving innovation across diverse domains. To ensure successful QSD projects, it is crucial to concentrate on key variables.Objective: This study aims to identify key variables in QSD and develop a model for predicting the success probability of QSD projects.Methodology: We identified key QSD variables from existing literature to achieve these objectives and collected expert insights using a survey instrument. We then analyzed these variables using an optimization model, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), with two different prediction methods the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression (LR).Results: The results of success probability prediction models indicate that as the QSD process matures, project success probability significantly increases, and costs are notably reduced. Furthermore, the best fitness rankings for each QSD project variable determined using NBC and LR indicated a strong positive correlation (rs=0.945). The t-test results (t = 0.851, p = 0.402>0.05) show no significant differences between the rankings calculated by the two methods (NBC and LR).Conclusion: The results reveal that the developed success probability prediction model, based on 14 identified QSD project variables, highlights the areas where practitioners need to focus more in order to facilitate the costeffective and successful implementation of QSD projects.

TI Quantum-Resistant Cryptography for the Internet of Things Based on
   Location-Based Lattices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB An important enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) is the Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology, which is a 3GPP standards compliant connectivity solution. Quantum computing, another emerging technological paradigm, promises novel compute opportunities but is also able to compromise cybersecurity ciphers. Therefore, improved methods to mitigate such security threats are needed. In this research, we propose a location-aware cryptographic system that guarantees post-quantum IoT security. The ultimate value of a location-driven cryptosystem is to use the geographic location as a player's identity and credential. Position-driven cryptography using lattices is efficient and lightweight, and it can be used to protect sensitive and confidential data in many critical situations that rely heavily on exchanging confidential data. At the best of our knowledge, this research starts the study of unconditional-quantum-resistant-location-driven cryptography by using the Lattice problem for the IoT in a pre-and post-quantum world. Unlike existing schemes, the proposed cryptosystem is the first secure and unrestricted position-based protocol that guards against any number of collusion attackers and against quantum attacks. It has a guaranteed authentication process, solves the problems of distributing public keys by removing a public key infrastructure (PKI), offers secure NB-IoT without SIM cards, and resists location spoofing attacks. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any network - not just NB-IoT.

TI Epitaxial hexagonal boron nitride with high quantum efficiency
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is one of the few materials showing great promise for light emission in the far ultraviolet (UV)-C wavelength, which is more effective and safer in containing the transmission of microbial diseases than traditional UV light. In this report, we observed that h-BN, despite having an indirect energy bandgap, exhibits a remarkably high room-temperature quantum efficiency (similar to 60%), which is orders of magnitude higher than that of other indirect bandgap material, and is enabled by strong excitonic effects and efficient exciton-phonon interactions. This study offers a new approach for the design and development of far UV-C optoelectronic devices as well as quantum photonic devices employing 2D semiconductor active regions. (C) 2023 Author(s).

TI QIACO: A Quantum Dynamic Cost Ant System for Query Optimization in
   Distributed Database
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Query optimization is considered as the most significant part in a model of distributed database. The optimizer tries to find an optimal join order, which reduces the query execution cost. Several factors may affect the cost of query execution, including number of relations, communication costs, resources, and access to large distributed data sets. The success of a processed query depends heavily on the search methodology that is implemented by the query optimizer. Query processing is considered as NP-hard problem and many researchers are focusing on this problem. Researches are trying to find an appropriate algorithm to seek an ideal solution especially when the size of the database increases. In case of large queries, classical heuristic methods such as ant colony and genetic algorithm can't cover all search space and may lead to falling in a local minimum. In this paper, quantum inspired ant colony algorithm (QIACO), as one of the hybrid strategy of probabilistic algorithms, is utilized to improve the query join cost in the distributed database model. The ability of quantum computing to diversify leads to cover query large search space, which helps in selecting the best trail and thus improves the slow convergence speed and avoid falling into a local optimum. Using this strategy, the algorithm aims to find an optimal join order which minimizes the total execution time. Experimental results show that the proposed model convergence faster with better goodness than the classic ant colony model for same number of ants used.

TI Universal Behavior beyond Multifractality of Wave Functions at
   Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the structure of many-body wave functions of 1D quantum circuits with local measurements employing the participation entropies. The leading term in system size dependence of participation entropy indicates a model-dependent multifractal scaling of the wave functions at any nonzero measurement rate. The subleading term contains universal information about measurement-induced phase transitions and plays the role of an order parameter, being constant nonzero in the error-correcting phase and vanishing in the quantum Zeno phase. We provide robust numerical evidence investigating a variety of quantum many-body systems and provide an analytical interpretation of this behavior expressing the participation entropy in terms of partition functions of classical statistical models in 2D.

TI Quantum circuit cutting with maximum-likelihood tomography
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We introduce maximum-likelihood fragment tomography (MLFT) as an improved circuit cutting technique for running clustered quantum circuits on quantum devices with a limited number of qubits. In addition to minimizing the classical computing overhead of circuit cutting methods, MLFT finds the most likely probability distribution for the output of a quantum circuit, given the measurement data obtained from the circuit's fragments. We demonstrate the benefits of MLFT for accurately estimating the output of a fragmented quantum circuit with numerical experiments on random unitary circuits. Finally, we show that circuit cutting can estimate the output of a clustered circuit with higher fidelity than full circuit execution, thereby motivating the use of circuit cutting as a standard tool for running clustered circuits on quantum hardware.

TI Observation of Cartesian light propagation through a three-dimensional
   cavity superlattice in a silicon photonic band gap crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We experimentally investigate peculiar light propagation inside a three-dimensional (3D) superlattice of resonant cavities that are confined within a 3D photonic band gap. To this end, we fabricated 3D diamondlike photonic crystals from silicon with a broad 3D band gap in the near-infrared and doped them with a periodic array of point defects. In position-resolved reflectivity and scattering microscopy, we observe narrow spectral features that match well with superlattice bands in band structures computed with the plane-wave expansion. The cavities are coupled in all three dimensions when they are closely spaced (aSL 3a), and uncoupled when they are further apart. The superlattice bands correspond to light that hops in high-symmetry directions in 3D ("Cartesian light") that opens applications in 3D photonic networks, 3D Anderson localization of light, and future 3D quantum photonic networks.

TI A blockchain-based hybrid encryption technique with anti-quantum
   signature for securing electronic health records
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Electronic health records (EHRs) are important for the efficient management of healthcare data. However, Healthcare data travels across an open route, i.e., the Internet, making EHR security a difficult process to do. This puts healthcare data vulnerable to cyber assaults. A possible method for protecting EHRs is blockchain technology. In this work, we develop an EHR architecture based on blockchain, which ensures all stakeholder's safety and privacy. We analyze various security architectures used for EHRs and the standard encryption system is integrated with quantum computing (QC). To safeguard the conventional traditional encrypting system against quantum assaults, we provide a hybrid signature technique that combines the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Dilithium within the anti-quantum lattice-based blind signature. Based on the difficulty of lattice problems over finite fields, Dilithium is a lattice-based signature method that is substantially safe against selected message assaults. The developed technique creates high entropy secret keys using the lattice basis delegation mechanism. The combination of ECDSA and Dilithium provides an efficient and secure signature system that is resilient to quantum attacks. The proposed scheme ensures that only authorized users with a defined role can use the database to access the data. We evaluate the efficiency of our scheme by comparing its performance to other state-of-the-art solutions in terms of transaction throughput, resource utilization, and communication cost. Results demonstrate that the developed technique outperforms the existing techniques in terms of efficiency and security.

TI Topological surface superconductivity in
   FeSe0.45Te0.55
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Topological superconductors are expected to play an important role in the development of quantum computing devices and iron-based superconductors represent an ideal platform to explore and engineer the underlying physics. Here, the authors investigate the origin of topological superconductivity in FeSe0.45Te0.55 arising from the interplay of the superconducting gap, magnetism, and a Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and its effects on the superconductor's properties.
   The engineering of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors, a paradigm for the realization of topological quantum computing and topology-based devices, has been hampered by the absence of materials with sufficiently large superconducting gaps. Recent experiments, however, have provided enthralling evidence for the existence of topological surface superconductivity in the iron-based superconductor FeSe0.45Te0.55 possessing a full s(+/-)-wave gap of a few meV. Here, we propose a mechanism for the emergence of topological superconductivity on the surface of FeSe0.45Te0.55 by demonstrating that the interplay between the s(+/-)-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, surface magnetism, and a Rashba spin-orbit interaction gives rise to robust topological superconducting phases. Moreover, the proposed mechanism explains a series of experimentally observed hallmarks of topological superconductivity, such as the emergence of Majorana zero modes in the center of vortex cores and at the end of line defects, as well as of chiral Majorana edge modes along domain walls. We also propose that the spatial distribution of supercurrents near a domain wall is a characteristic signature measurable via a scanning superconducting quantum interference device that can distinguish between chiral Majorana edge modes and trivial in-gap states.

TI Mitigating photorefractive effect in thin-film lithium niobate microring
   resonators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate is an attractive integrated photonics platform due to its low optical loss and favorable optical nonlinear and electro-optic properties. However, in applications such as second harmonic generation, frequency comb generation, and microwave-to-optics conversion, the device performance is strongly impeded by the photorefractive effect inherent in thin-film lithium niobate. In this paper, we show that the dielectric cladding on a lithium niobate microring resonator has a significant influence on the photorefractive effect. By removing the dielectric cladding layer, the photorefractive effect in lithium niobate ring resonators can be effectively mitigated. Our work presents a reliable approach to control the photorefractive effect on thin-film lithium niobate and will further advance the performance of integrated classical and quantum photonic devices based on thin-film lithium niobate.

TI A graph-theoretic framework for free-parafermion solvability
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB We present a graph-theoretic characterization of when a quantum spin model admits an exact solution via a mapping to free parafermions. Our characterization is based on the concept of a frustration graph, which represents the commutation relations between Weyl operators of a Hamiltonian. We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Furthermore, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterization extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.

TI Formation of intrinsic point defects in AlN: a study of donor and
   acceptor characteristics using hybrid QM/MM techniques
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The wide-gap material aluminium nitride (AlN) is gaining increasing attention for its applications in optoelectronics, energy, and quantum computing, making the investigation of its defect properties crucial for effective use in these fields. This study employs a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) embedded cluster method and uses three different hybrid-level density functional theory (DFT) functionals (B97-2, PBE0, and BB1K) to investigate systematically the thermodynamic stability, electronic properties, and donor/acceptor nature of intrinsic charged point defects in AlN. Our approach allows for the examination of defects within a significantly larger simulation cell, enhancing the reliability of the calculations. Our findings highlight the stable structures of defects including the symmetry-breaking reconstruction of octahedral-centred nitrogen interstitial and nitrogen split-interstitial defects, as well as the potential of nitrogen vacancies and aluminium interstitial defects as sources of shallow donor species. Additionally, we compute equilibrium defect concentrations at different annealing temperatures up to 2800 K, elucidating the roles of nitrogen and aluminium vacancies and interstitials in the conductivity of undoped, n-type doped, and p-type doped AlN. This comprehensive study advances the understanding of defect stability and electronic properties in AlN, paving the way for its enhanced application in advanced technologies.

TI Nonlinear amplitude versus angle inversion using hybrid quantum ant
   colony optimization and the exact Zoeppritz equation
SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB Prestack amplitude versus offset (AVO) inversion is an essential tool to estimate elastic properties. Approximations of P-wave reflection coefficients based on the Zoeppritz equation are limited by the assumption of weak contrast and are inaccurate for far offset, and the existing nonlinear inversion method, like ant colony optimization (ACO), cannot converge to the global optimal solution within a limited time. Consequently, we propose a nonlinear AVO inversion method based on the exact Zoeppritz equation using hybrid quantum ant colony optimization (HQACO). The Zoeppritz equation is a forward modeling approach with high accuracy at far offset and is valid at the strong-contrast interface. HQACO, as a global optimization algorithm, not only has the potential of ACO to search global solutions but also exploits the power of quantum computing to speed up optimization procedures. The self-adaptive rotating strategy is proposed to improve the flexibility and efficiency of the conventional quantum rotating gate largely. Moreover, the quantum gate is introduced to enhance the global search ability. Numerical results show that the average evaluation number required for the global solution decreases largely and the solution converges to the global optimal solution closely using the proposed method. Synthetic applications verify that HQACO shows the most reliable exploring competence to find the global solution. The new inversion method is not only suitable for the strong-contrast interface with noise but also shows promising accuracy using the wide offset range.

TI Quantum-Inspired Fully Complex-Valued Neutral Network for Sentiment
   Analysis
SO AXIOMS
AB Most of the existing quantum-inspired models are based on amplitude-phase embedding to model natural language, which maps words into Hilbert space. In quantum-computing theory, the vectors corresponding to quantum states are all complex values, so there is a gap between these two areas. Presently, complex-valued neural networks have been studied, but their practical applications are few, let alone in the downstream tasks of natural language processing such as sentiment analysis and language modeling. In fact, the complex-valued neural network can use the imaginary part information to embed hidden information and can express more complex information, which is suitable for modeling complex natural language. Meanwhile, quantum-inspired models are defined in Hilbert space, which is also a complex space. So it is natural to construct quantum-inspired models based on complex-valued neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new quantum-inspired model for NLP, ComplexQNN, which contains a complex-valued embedding layer, a quantum encoding layer, and a measurement layer. The modules of ComplexQNN are fully based on complex-valued neural networks. It is more in line with quantum-computing theory and easier to transfer to quantum computers in the future to achieve exponential acceleration. We conducted experiments on six sentiment-classification datasets comparing with five classical models (TextCNN, GRU, ELMo, BERT, and RoBERTa). The results show that our model has improved by 10% in accuracy metric compared with TextCNN and GRU, and has competitive experimental results with ELMo, BERT, and RoBERTa.

However, existing methods fail to achieve both high accuracy and low circuit complexity, rendering it impossible to deploy onto current quantum devices. This paper proposes Rasengan, a high-precision and deployable approach that leverages algorithm-hardware codesign for solving constrained optimization problems. Unlike traditional VQAs that shrink the whole space and locate the possible solutions in a superposition state, our key idea is to expand the search space from one feasible solution and precisely identify the optimal solution in a basis state. Specifically, we propose the transition Hamiltonian that exponentially explores the entire feasible solution space with all combinations of homogeneous basis vectors. We then introduce three optimization techniques, which greatly reduce the circuit complexity when implementing the Hamiltonian simulation, including Hamiltonian simplification and pruning, segmented execution, and solution purification. Experiments demonstrate that Rasengan improves the accuracy by 4.12x compared to SOTA QAOA [43] and exhibits 379x improvement on real-world quantum platforms.

TI A highly tunable quadruple quantum dot in a narrow bandgap semiconductor
   InAs nanowire
SO NANOSCALE
AB Quantum dots (QDs) made from semiconductors are among the most promising platforms for the development of quantum computing and simulation chips, and they have the advantages of high density integration and compatibility with the standard semiconductor chip fabrication technology compared to other platforms. However, the development of a highly tunable semiconductor multiple QD system still remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a highly tunable linear quadruple QD (QQD) in a narrow bandgap semiconductor InAs nanowire via a fine finger gate technique. The QQD is studied by electron transport measurements in the linear response regime. Characteristic two-dimensional charge stability diagrams containing four groups of resonant current lines of different slopes are obtained for the QQD. It is shown that these current lines arise from and can be individually assigned to resonant electron transport through the energy levels of different QDs. Benefitting from the excellent gate tunability, we also demonstrate the tuning of the QQD to regimes where the energy levels of two QDs, three QDs and all four QDs are energetically in resonance, respectively, with the Fermi level of the source and drain contacts. A capacitance network model is developed for the linear QQD and the simulated charge stability diagrams based on this model show good agreement with the experiments. Our work provides solid experimental evidence that narrow bandgap semiconductor nanowire multiple QDs could be used as a versatile platform to achieve integrated qubits for quantum computing and to perform quantum simulations of complex many-body systems.

TI A Survey on Quaternion Algebra and Geometric Algebra Applications in
   Engineering and Computer Science 1995-2020
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Geometric Algebra (GA) has proven to be an advanced language for mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering. This review presents a comprehensive study of works on Quaternion Algebra and GA applications in computer science and engineering from 1995 to 2020. After a brief introduction of GA, the applications of GA are reviewed across many fields. We discuss the characteristics of the applications of GA to various problems of computer science and engineering. In addition, the challenges and prospects of various applications proposed by many researchers are analyzed. We analyze the developments using GA in image processing, computer vision, neurocomputing, quantum computing, robot modeling, control, and tracking, as well as improvement of computer hardware performance. We believe that up to now GA has proven to be a powerful geometric language for a variety of applications. Furthermore, there is evidence that this is the appropriate geometric language to tackle a variety of existing problems and that consequently, step-by-step GA-based algorithms should continue to be further developed. We also believe that this extensive review will guide and encourage researchers to continue the advancement of geometric computing for intelligent machines.

TI Entanglement generation from athermality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the thermodynamic constraints on the pivotal task of entanglement generation using out-ofequilibrium states through a model-independent framework with minimal assumptions. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a thermal process to generate bipartite qubit entanglement, starting from an initially separable state. Consequently, we identify the set of system states that cannot be entangled, when no external work is invested. In the regime of infinite temperature, we analytically construct this set; while for finite temperature, we provide a simple criterion to verify whether any given initial state is or is not entangleable. Furthermore, we provide an explicit construction of the future thermal cone of entanglement-the set of entangled states that a given separable state can thermodynamically evolve to. We offer a detailed discussion on the properties of this cone, focusing on the interplay between entanglement and its volumetric properties. We conclude with several key remarks on the generation of entanglement beyond two-qubit systems, and discuss its dynamics in the presence of dissipation.

TI Performance of high impedance resonators in dirty dielectric
   environments
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB High-impedance resonators are a promising contender for realizing long-distance entangling gates between spin qubits. Often, the fabrication of spin qubits relies on the use of gate dielectrics which are detrimental to the quality of the resonator. Here, we investigate loss mechanisms of high-impedance NbTiN resonators in the vicinity of thermally grown SiO2 and Al2O3 fabricated by atomic layer deposition. We benchmark the resonator performance in elevated magnetic fields and at elevated temperatures and find that the internal quality factors are limited by the coupling between the resonator and two-level systems of the employed oxides. Nonetheless, the internal quality factors of high-impedance resonators exceed 103 in all investigated oxide configurations which implies that the dielectric configuration would not limit the performance of resonators integrated in a spin-qubit device. Because these oxides are commonly used for spin qubit device fabrication, our results allow for straightforward integration of high-impedance resonators into spin-based quantum processors. Hence, these experiments pave the way for large-scale, spin-based quantum computers.

TI Coherence in cooperative photon emission from indistinguishable quantum
   emitters
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Photon-mediated interactions between atoms can arise via coupling to a common electromagnetic mode or by quantum interference. Here, we probe the role of coherence in cooperative emission arising from two distant but indistinguishable solid-state emitters because of path erasure. The primary signature of cooperative emission, the emergence of "bunching" at zero delay in an intensity correlation experiment, is used to characterize the indistinguishability of the emitters, their dephasing, and the degree of correlation in the joint system that can be coherently controlled. In a stark departure from a pair of uncorrelated emitters, in Hong-Ou-Mandel-type interference measurements, we observe photon statistics from a pair of indistinguishable emitters resembling that of a weak coherent state from an attenuated laser. Our experiments establish techniques to control and characterize cooperative behavior between matter qubits using the full quantum optics toolbox, a key step toward realizing large-scale quantum photonic networks.

TI Quantum cost of dense coding and teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum cost is a key ingredient in evaluating the quality of quantum protocols from a practical viewpoint. We show that the quantum cost of a d-dimensional dense coding protocol is equal to d + 3 when transmitting the classical message (0,0) and d + 4 when transmitting another classical message. It appears as linear growth with the dimension and thus makes sense for implementation. In contrast, the quantum cost of high-dimensional teleportation protocols is equal to 13, which is the maximum value of the cost for the two-dimensional case. As an application, we establish the relation between the quantum cost and fidelity of dense coding protocols in terms of four typical noise scenarios.

TI Scanning Spin Probe Based on Magnonic Vortex Quantum Cavities
SO ACS NANO
AB Performing nanoscale scanning electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) requires three essential ingredients: First, a static magnetic field together with field gradients to Zeeman split the electronic energy levels with spatial resolution; second, a radio frequency (rf) magnetic field capable of inducing spin transitions; finally, a sensitive detection method to quantify the energy absorbed by spins. This is usually achieved by combining externally applied magnetic fields with inductive coils or cavities, fluorescent defects, or scanning probes. Here, we theoretically propose the realization of an EPR scanning sensor merging all three characteristics into a single device: the vortex core stabilized in ferromagnetic thin-film discs. On one hand, the vortex ground state generates a significant static magnetic field and field gradients. On the other hand, the precessional motion of the vortex core around its equilibrium position produces a circularly polarized oscillating magnetic field, which is enough to produce spin transitions. Finally, the spin-magnon coupling broadens the vortex gyrotropic frequency, suggesting a direct measure of the presence of unpaired electrons. Moreover, the vortex core can be displaced by simply using external magnetic fields of a few mT, enabling EPR scanning microscopy with large spatial resolution. Our numerical simulations show that, by using low damping magnets, it is theoretically possible to detect single spins located on the disc's surface. Vortex nanocavities could also attain strong coupling to individual spin molecular qubits with potential applications to mediate qubit-qubit interactions or to implement qubit readout protocols.

TI Indexed improvements for real-time trotter evolution of a (1
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Today's quantum computers offer the possibility of performing real-time calculations for quantum field theory scattering processes motivated by high energy physics. In order to follow the successful roadmap which has been established for the calculation of static properties at Euclidean time, it is crucial to develop new algorithmic methods to deal with the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and to establish quantitative measures of the progress made with different devices. In this paper, we report recent progress in these directions. We show that nonlinear aspects of the trotter errors allow us to take much larger step then suggested by low-order analysis. This is crucial to reach physically relevant time scales with today's NISQ technology. We propose to use an index averaging absolute values of the difference between the accurately calculated trotter evolution of site occupations and their actual measurements on NISQ machines (G index) as a measure to compare results that have been obtained from different hardware platforms. Using the transverse Ising model in one spatial dimension with four sites we apply this metric across several hardware platforms. We study the results including readout mitigation and Richardson extrapolations and show that the mitigated measurements are very effective based on the analysis of the trotter step size modifications. We discuss how this advance in the trotter step size procedures can improve quantum computing physics scattering results and how this technical advance can be applied to other machines and noise mitigation methods.

TI Energy-Limited Quantum Dynamics
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We consider quantum systems with energy constraints relative to a reference Hamiltonian. In general, quantum channels and continuous-time dynamics need not satisfy energy conservation. Physically meaningful channels, however, only introduce a finite amount of energy to the system, and continuous-time dynamics only increase the energy gradually over time. We systematically study such "energy-limited" channels and dynamics. For Markovian dynamics, energy-limitedness is equivalent to a single operator inequality in the Heisenberg picture. We observe new submultiplicativity inequalities for the energy-constrained diamond and operator norm. As an application, we derive new state-dependent continuity bounds for quantum speed limits.

AB Optimized quantum f-divergence was first introduced by Wilde and further explored by Li and Wilde later. Wilde raised the question of whether the monotonicity of optimized quantum f-divergence can be generalized to maps that are not quantum channels. In this paper, we answer this question by generalizing the monotonicity of optimized quantum f-divergences to positive trace preserving maps satisfying a Schwarz inequality. Any 2-positive maps satisfy such a Schwarz inequality. The main tool in this paper is the Petz recovery map.

TI Quantum distance approximation for persistence diagrams
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB Topological data analysis (TDA) methods can be useful for classification and clustering tasks in many different fields as they can provide two dimensional persistence diagrams that summarize important information about the shape of potentially complex and high dimensional data sets. The space of persistence diagrams can be endowed with various metrics, which admit a statistical structure and allow to use these summaries for machine learning algorithms, e.g. the Wasserstein distance. However, computing the distance between two persistence diagrams involves finding an optimal way to match the points of the two diagrams and may not always be an easy task for classical computers. Recently, quantum algorithms have shown the potential to speedup the process of obtaining the persistence information displayed on persistence diagrams by estimating the spectra of persistent Dirac operators. So, in this work we explore the potential of quantum computers to estimate the distance between persistence diagrams as the next step in the design of a fully quantum framework for TDA. In particular we propose variational quantum algorithms for the Wasserstein distance as well as the dpc distance. Our implementation is a weighted version of the quantum approximate optimization Algorithm that relies on control clauses to encode the constraints of the optimization problem.

TI Classical versus quantum features of the Berthelot cosmological model
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB In this paper, we compare and contrast the classical versus quantum dynamics of a cosmological model based on the literature (Modified) Berthelot equation of state for the description of the dark sector of the universe. At the classical background level we identify a Minkowski-like and a de Sitter-like equilibrium epochs, with the latter occurring only beyond a certain threshold for a parameter in the equation of state; at the classical perturbed level we find that this same parameter realizes a duality in the adiabatic speed of sound between the two equilibrium epochs. The quantum evolution of this model is studied in the context of quantum geometrodynamics by solving analytically the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the scalar field potentials about the two equilibrium epochs. We identify the phenomenon of quantum decoherence to arise at the same threshold which constitutes the bifurcation between the two equilibrium epochs at the classical level. We comment on the quantum modified power spectrum focusing on some consequences dealing with the formation of astrophysical structures within the Press-Schechter framework. Our paper is intended to scrutinize which classical features of a certain cosmological model are preserved at its quantum level, and under which assumptions.

TI Control and Entanglement of Individual Rydberg Atoms near a Nanoscale

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Coherent control of Rydberg atoms near dielectric surfaces is a major challenge due to the large sensitivity of Rydberg states to electric fields. We demonstrate coherent single -atom operations and twoqubit entanglement as close as 100 mu m from a nanophotonic device. Using the individual atom control enabled by optical tweezers to study the spatial and temporal properties of the electric field from the surface, we employ dynamical decoupling techniques to characterize and cancel the electric -field noise with submicrosecond temporal resolution. We further use entanglement -assisted sensing to accurately map magnitude and direction of electric -field gradients on a micrometer scale. Our observations open a path for integration of Rydberg arrays with micro- and nanoscale devices for applications in quantum networking and quantum information science.

To this end, we derive a strengthened form of the quantum data processing inequality for the change in relative entropy of two states under a channel between two von Neumann algebras. Compared to the usual inequality, there is an explicit lower bound involving the fidelity between the original state and a recovery channel.

TI Few-cycle vacuum squeezing in nanophotonics

AB One of the most fundamental quantum states of light is the squeezed vacuum, in which noise in one of the quadratures is less than the standard quantum noise limit. In nanophotonics, it remains challenging to generate, manipulate, and measure such a quantum state with the performance required for a wide range of scalable quantum information systems. Here, we report the development of a lithium niobate-based nanophotonic platform to demonstrate the generation and all-optical measurement of squeezed states on the same chip. The generated squeezed states span more than 25 terahertz of bandwidth supporting just a few optical cycles. The measured 4.9 decibels of squeezing surpass the requirements for a wide range of quantum information systems, demonstrating a practical path toward scalable ultrafast quantum nanophotonics.

TI Subtraction and Addition of Propagating Photons by Two-Level Emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Coherent manipulation of quantum states of light is key to photonic quantum information processing. In this Letter, we show that a passive two-level nonlinearity suffices to implement non-Gaussian quantum operations on propagating field modes. In particular, the collective light-matter interaction can efficiently extract a single photon from a multiphoton input wave packet to an orthogonal temporal mode. We accurately describe the single-photon subtraction process by elements of an intuitive quantum-trajectory model. By employing this process, quantum information protocols gain orders of magnitude improved efficiency over heralded schemes with linear optics. The reverse process can be used to add photons one by one to a single wave packet mode and compose arbitrarily large Fock states with a finite total success probability >96.7%.

AB The rise of quantum information as a viable technology requires appropriate instructional curricula for preparing a future workforce. Key concepts that are the basis of quantum information involve fundamentals of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement and measurement. To complement modern initiatives to teach quantum physics to the emerging workforce, lab experiences are needed. We have developed a curriculum of quantum optics experiments to teach quantum mechanics fundamentals and quantum algebra. These laboratories provide hands-on experimentation of optical components on a table-top. We have also created curricular materials, manuals, tutorials, parts and price lists for instructors. Automation of the apparatus offers the flexibility of using the apparatus remotely and for giving access to a greater number of students with a single setup.

TI Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy ( center). The optical addressability of the center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate 180-350 mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h11B15N samples, where the coherence time can reach 1-20 mu s, significantly exceeding the low-field T 2 values.

TI A de Finetti theorem for quantum causal structures
SO QUANTUM
AB What does it mean for a causal structure to be 'unknown'? Can we even talk about 'repetitions' of an experiment without prior knowledge of causal relations? And under what conditions can we say that a set of processes with arbitrary, possibly indefinite, causal structure are independent and identically distributed? Similar questions for classical probabilities, quantum states, and quantum channels are beautifully answered by so-called "de Finetti theorems", which connect a simple and easy-to-justify condition-symmetry multipartite structure: a mixture of identical states/channels. Here we extend the result to processes with arbitrary causal be of independent interest.

TI Sum and difference frequency generation in a
   valley-photonic-crystal-like topological system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Nonlinear sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG) are fundamental methods to obtain new light sources for various applications. However, most of the on-chip SFG and DFG are based on conventional resonators, lacking robustness against fabrication defects. Here, we demonstrate topologically protected SFG and DFG in a second-order topological photonic system. The mechanism is based on the nonlinear interaction between three high-Q corner modes inside dual topological band gaps. The frequency matching condition for SFG and DFG is precisely satisfied by designing a valley-photonic-crystal-like topological system, which provides more freedoms to tune the corner modes. The topological SFG and DFG are achieved with high conversion efficiency, and the underlying topological physics is revealed. This work opens up avenues toward topologically protected nonlinear frequency conversion, and can find applications in the fields of on-chip single-photon detections and optical quantum memories with robustness against defects.

TI Defects in Silicon Carbide as Quantum Qubits: Recent Advances in Defect
   Engineering
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This review provides an overview of defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with potential applications as quantum qubits. It begins with a brief introduction to quantum qubits and existing qubit platforms, outlining the essential criteria a defect must meet to function as a viable qubit. The focus then shifts to the most promising defects in SiC, notably the silicon vacancy (VSi) and divacancy (VC-VSi). A key challenge in utilizing these defects for quantum applications is their precise and controllable creation. Various fabrication techniques, including irradiation, ion implantation, femtosecond laser processing, and focused ion beam methods, have been explored to create these defects. Designed as a beginner-friendly resource, this review aims to support early-career experimental researchers entering the field of SiC-related quantum qubits. Providing an introduction to defect-based qubits in SiC offers valuable insights into fabrication strategies, recent progress, and the challenges that lie ahead.

TI Complexity phase transitions in instantaneous quantum polynomial-time
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the classical hardness of learning the output distribution from instantaneous quantum polynomialtime circuits with a varying density of two-qubit gates. We first investigate the complexity phases relevant to simulating the output distribution. In addition to a known parameter regime for anticoncentration, where the classical simulation is believed to be infeasible, we identify a novel parameter condition such that the classically simulability of the circuit can be proven rigorously. Next, we explore the classical learnability of the output distribution. We prove that a circuit instance whose output distribution is not classically learnable exists, assuming the hardness of learning parity with noise. We numerically study this phenomenon deeply using a classical energy-based model, where we find that the classical model fails to learn the output distribution even when the density of two-qubit gates is much smaller than that for the anticoncentration. We argue that this is mainly due to the fact that an accurate classical description of the output distribution requires exponentially large amount of resources.

TI Flopping-mode electron dipole spin resonance in the strong-driving
   regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Achieving high-fidelity control of spin qubits with conventional electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR) requires large magnetic field gradients of about 1mTnm(-1), which also couple the qubit to charge noise, and large drive amplitudes of order 1 mV. The flopping mode is an alternative method to drive EDSR of an electron in a double quantum dot, where the large displacement between both dots increases the driving efficiency. We propose to operate the flopping mode in the strong-driving regime to use the fullmagnetic field difference between the two dots. In simulations, the reduced required magnetic field gradients suppress the infidelity contribution of charge noise by more than two orders of magnitude, while providing Rabi frequencies of up to 60MHz. However, the near degeneracy of the conduction band in silicon introduces a valley degree of freedom that can degrade the performance of the strong-driving mode. This necessitates a valley-dependent pulse optimization and makes operation to the strong-driving regime questionable.

TI Eliminating temporal correlation in quantum-dot entangled photon source
   by quantum interference
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Semiconductor quantum dots, as promising solid-state platform, have exhibited deterministic photon pair generation with high polarization entanglement fidelity for quantum information applications. However, due to temporal correlation from inherently cascaded emission, photon indistinguishability is limited, which restricts their potential scalability to multi-photon experiments. Here, by utilizing quantum interferences to decouple polarization entanglement from temporal correlation, we improve fourphoton Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state entanglement fidelity from (58.7 +/- 2.2)% to (75.5 +/- 2.0)%. Our work paves the way to realize scalable and high-quality multi-photon states from quantum dots.(c) 2023 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

TI Converting coherence based on positive-operator-valued measures into
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum resource theories provide a diverse and powerful framework for extensively studying the phenomena in quantum physics. Quantum coherence, a quantum resource, is the basic ingredient in many quantum information tasks. It is a subject of broad and current interest in quantum information, and many new concepts have been introduced and generalized since its establishment. Here we show that the block coherence can be transformed into entanglement via a block-incoherent operation. Moreover, we find that the coherence based on positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs) associated with block coherence through the Naimark extension acts as a potential resource from the perspective of generating entanglement. Finally, we discuss avenues of creating entanglement from POVM-based coherence, present strategies that require embedding channels and auxiliary systems, give some examples, and generalize them.

TI The Necessary and Sufficient Conditions When Global and Local Fidelities
   Are Equal
SO ENTROPY
AB In the field of quantum information theory, the concept of quantum fidelity is employed to quantify the similarity between two quantum states. It has been observed that the fidelity between two states describing a bipartite quantum system A & OTIMES;B is always less than or equal to the quantum fidelity between the states in subsystem A alone. While this fidelity inequality is well understood, determining the conditions under which the inequality becomes an equality remains an open question. In this paper, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality of fidelities between a bipartite system A & OTIMES;B and subsystem A, considering pure quantum states. Moreover, we provide explicit representations of quantum states that satisfy the fidelity equality, based on our derived results.

TI Characterization of P-divisibility in two-level open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study different characterizations of positive (P) divisibility in two-level open quantum systems whose dynamics are governed by a time-local master equation with time-dependent relaxation rates. In the case of phase-covariant dynamics, necessary and sufficient conditions for the P-divisibility of the dynamical map are given in terms of inequalities on such relaxation rates. We propose a geometric P-divisibility criterion based on the Bloch coordinates. The connection to the Breuer-Laine-Piilo (BLP) measure of non-Markovianity is also established. We show how these results can be extended to a Redfield master equation. As an application of such characterizations, we study the open dynamics of a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode. More precisely, we characterize the properties of the local map of the qubit generated by its interaction with the bosonic mode, playing the role of an extremely reduced bath. Interesting observations are made, opening perspectives for a deeper physical understanding of complete positive divisibility, P-divisibility, and BLP measure.

TI Quantum shortcut to adiabaticity for state preparation in a finite-sized
   Jaynes-Cummings lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In noisy quantum systems, achieving high-fidelity state preparation using the adiabatic approach faces a dilemma: either extending the evolution time to reduce diabatic transitions or shortening it to mitigate de- coherence effects. Here we present a quantum shortcut to adiabaticity for state preparation in a finite-sized Jaynes-Cummings lattice by applying counterdiabatic (CD) driving along given adiabatic trajectories. Leveraging the symmetry of eigenstates in our system, we convert the CD driving to an implementable Hamiltonian that only involves local qubit-cavity couplings for a two-site lattice with one polariton excitation. Additionally, we derive a partial analytical form of the CD driving for the lattice with two excitations. Our numerical results demonstrate that circuit errors and environmental noise have negligible effects on our scheme under practical parameters. We also show that our scheme can be characterized through the detection of qubit operators. This approach can lead to a promising pathway to high-fidelity state preparation in a significantly reduced timescale when compared to conventional adiabatic methods.

TI Spin-dependent photodynamics of boron-vacancy centers in hexagonal boron
   nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The negatively charged boron vacancy (V-B ) center in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is currently garnering considerable attention for the design of two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensing units. Such developments require a precise understanding of the spin-dependent optical response of V-B centers, which still remains poorly documented despite its key role for sensing applications. Here we investigate the spin-dependent photodynamics of V-B centers in hBN by a series of time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements. We first introduce a robust all-optical method to infer the spin-dependent lifetime of the excited states and the electron spin polarization of V-B centers under optical pumping. Using these results, we then analyze PL time traces recorded at different optical excitation powers with a seven-level model of the V-B center and we extract all the rates involved in the spin-dependent optical cycles, both under ambient conditions and at liquid helium temperature. These findings are finally used to study the impact of a vector magnetic field on the optical response. More precisely, we analyze PL quenching effects resulting from electron spin mixing induced by the magnetic field component perpendicular to the V-B quantization axis. All experimental results are well reproduced by the seven-level model, illustrating its robustness to describe the spin-dependent photodynamics of V-B centers. This work provides important insights into the properties of V-B centers in hBN, which are valuable for future developments of 2D quantum sensing units.

TI SSA-BP network model based Hong-Ou-Mandel interference delay measurement
   and its application in quantum gyroscope
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB High sensitivity optical gyroscopes, as an important component of aerospace navigation system, have become a research hotspot. The sensitivity of the classical optical gyroscope is restricted by the shot-noise-limit owing to the vacuum zero energy fluctuation. Therefore, the classical optical gyroscope cannot meet the growing demand of navigation, sensing and communication. In this work, a measurement scheme of quantum gyroscope based on frequency entangled source and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is proposed. In order to realize high-precision delay measurement, the interference visibility and width of HOM interferogram are regulated by changing the bandwidth of pump laser and the length of nonlinear crystal. However, traditional experimental regulation method is inefficient and time consuming. On the basis of the above scheme, a delay measurement scheme of HOM interference based on SSA-BP network is established. The SSA-BP network is used to simulate different bandwidths of pump laser and the lengths of nonlinear crystal to predict the interference visibility and width of HOM interferogram. The verification results show that the mean square error (MSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) predicted by SSA-BP network are smallest. Based on the above SSA-BP network model, the interference visibility and width of HOM interferogram are and respectively. Combined with quantum Fisher information, the maximum value of F is obtained to be 1.999. Meanwhile, according to the Cramer-Rao bound theory, the minimum ratio of the uncertainty of the delay to the shot-noise-limit can reach 0.707, indicating that the precision of delay measurement is increased by 2 orders of magnitude. According to the relationship between delay and rotational angular velocity, the measurement sensitivity of the rotational angular velocity is improved by 2 orders of magnitude compared with that of the classical optical gyroscope. These results prove that the above quantum gyroscope scheme can realize the measurement sensitivity of rotational angular velocity beyond the shot-noise-limit. Therefore, the SSA-BP network model can provide theoretical support for the subsequent experimental verification of quantum gyroscopes based on HOM interference delay measurement, and is the technical basis for the development of quantum navigation, quantum sensing and quantum communication.

TI Geometric Event-Based Quantum Mechanics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a special relativistic framework for quantum mechanics. It is based on introducing a Hilbert space for events. Events are taken as primitive notions (as customary in relativity), whereas quantum systems (e.g. fields and particles) are emergent in the form of joint probability amplitudes for position and time of events. Textbook relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory can be recovered by dividing the event Hilbert spaces into space and time (a foliation) and then conditioning the event states onto the time part. Our theory satisfies the full Lorentz symmetry as a 'geometric' unitary transformation, and possesses relativistic observables for space (location of an event) and time (position in time of an event).

TI n-Lüders channels: a novel class of rebit channels, their
   properties and applications
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In a very recent paper, the complete classification of rebit channels has been achieved. Here, we exploit that result to show how the classification can be used to perform an exhaustive analysis of a novel class of rebit channels induced by effects called n-L & uuml;ders channels. In the final part of the paper we propose a concrete application of these channels within the mathematical framework of a quantum theory of color perception that originated the interest about a rebit channels classification.

TI Can increasing the size and flexibility of a molecule reduce decoherence
   and prolong charge migration?
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Coherent superposition of electronic states, created by ionizing a molecule, can initiate ultrafast dynamics of the electron density. Correlation between nuclear and electron motions, however, typically dissipates the electronic coherence in only a few femtoseconds, especially in larger and more flexible molecules. We, therefore, use ab initio semiclassical dynamics to study decoherence in a sequence of analogous organic molecules of increasing size and find, surprisingly, that extending the carbon skeleton in propynal analogs slows down decoherence and prolongs charge migration. To elucidate this observation, we decompose the overall decoherence into contributions from individual vibrational modes and show that: 1) The initial decay of electronic coherence is caused by high- and intermediate-frequency vibrations via momentum separation of nuclear wavepackets evolving on different electronic surfaces. 2) At later times, the coherence disappears completely due to the increasing position separation in the low-frequency modes. 3) In agreement with another study, we observe that only normal modes that preserve the symmetry of the molecule induce decoherence. All together, we justify the enhanced charge migration by a combination of increased holemixing and the disappearance of decoherence contributions from specific vibrational modes-CO stretching in butynal and various H rockings in pentynal.

SO JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING
AB We present a formalization of several fundamental notions and results from Quantum Information theory in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL, including density matrices and projective measurements, along with the proof that the local hidden-variable hypothesis advocated by Einstein to model quantum mechanics cannot hold. The proof of the latter result is based on the so-called CHSH inequality, and it is the violation of this inequality that was experimentally evidenced by Aspect, who earned the Nobel Prize in 2022 for his work. We also formalize various results related to the violation of the CHSH inequality, such as Tsirelson's bound, which quantifies the amount to which this inequality can be violated in a quantum setting.

TI Quantum Interface for Noble-Gas Spins Based on Spin-Exchange Collisions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB An ensemble of noble-gas nuclear spins is a unique quantum system that could maintain coherence for many hours at room temperature and above, owing to exceptional isolation from the environment. This isolation, however, is a mixed blessing, limiting the ability of these ensembles to interface with other quantum systems coherently. Here we show that spin-exchange collisions with alkali-metal atoms render a quantum interface for noble-gas spins without impeding their long coherence times. We formulate the many-body theory of the hybrid system and reveal a collective mechanism that strongly couples the macroscopic quantum states of the two spin ensembles. Despite their stochastic and random nature, weak collisions enable entanglement and reversible exchange of nonclassical excitations in an efficient, controllable, and deterministic process. With recent experiments now entering the strong-coupling regime, this interface paves the way toward realizing hour-long quantum memories and entanglement at room temperature.

TI Unextendible product operator basis
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum nonlocality is associated with the local indistinguishability of orthogonal states. Unextendible product basis (UPB), a widely used tool in quantum information, exhibits nonlocality, which is the powerful resource for quantum information processing. In this work, we extend the definitions of nonlocality and genuine nonlocality from states to operators. We also extend UPB to the notions of unextendible product operator basis, unextendible product unitary operator basis (UPUOB), and strongly UPUOB. We construct their examples and show the nonlocality of some strongly UPUOBs under local operations and classical communications. We study the phenomenon of these operators acting on quantum states. As an application, we distinguish the two-dimensional strongly UPUOB, which only consumes three ebits of entanglement. Our results imply that such UPUOBs exhibit nonlocality as UPBs, and the distinguishability of them requires entanglement resources.

TI Bayesian-Based Hybrid Method for Rapid Optimization of NV Center Sensors
SO SENSORS
AB NV centers are among the most promising platforms in the field of quantum sensing. Magnetometry based on NV centers, especially, has achieved concrete development in areas of biomedicine and medical diagnostics. Improving the sensitivity of NV center sensors under wide inhomogeneous broadening and fieldamplitude drift is a crucial issue of continuous concern that relies on the coherent control of NV centers with high average fidelity. Quantum optimal control (QOC) methods provide access to this target; nevertheless, the high time consumption of current methods due to the large number of needful sample points as well as the complexity of the parameter space has hindered their usability. In this paper, we propose the Bayesian estimation phase-modulated (B-PM) method to tackle this problem. In the case of the state transforming of an NV center ensemble, the B-PM method reduced the time consumption by more than 90% compared with the conventional standard Fourier basis (SFB) method while increasing the average fidelity from 0.894 to 0.905. In the AC magnetometry scenario, the optimized control pulse obtained with the B-PM method achieved an eight-fold extension of coherence time T-2 compared with the rectangular p pulse. Similar application can be made in other sensing situations. As a general algorithm, the B-PM method can be further extended to the open- and closed-loop optimization of complex systems based on a variety of quantum platforms.

TI Resonances crossing and electric field quantum sensors
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose a theoretical model for a quantum sensor that can determine in a very simple way whether the intensity of an electric field has an assigned value or not. It is based on the fact that when an exact crossing of the imaginary parts of the resonances occurs in a double-well quantum system subject to an external DC electric field, a damped beating phenomenon occurs, which is absent if there is no such a crossing. This result is then tested numerically on an explicit one-dimensional model.

TI Two-path interference of single-particle pulses measured by the
   Unruh-DeWitt-type quantum detector
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the two-path interference of single-particle pulses measured by the Unruh-DeWitt-type quantum detector, which itself is a quantum state as well as the incoming pulse, and of which the interaction with the pulse is described by unitary quantum evolution instead of a nonunitary collapsing process. Provided that the quantum detector remains coherent in time long enough, the detection probability still manifests the two-path interference pattern even if the length difference between the two paths considerably exceeds the coherence length of the single-particle pulse, contrary to the result measured by an ordinary classical detector. Furthermore, it is formally shown that an ensemble of identical Unruh-DeWitt-type quantum detectors collectively behaves as an ordinary classical detector, if coherence in time of each individual quantum detector becomes sufficiently short. Our study provides a concrete yet manageable theoretical model to investigate the two-path interference measured by a quantum detector and facilitates a quantitative analysis of the difference between classical and quantum detectors. The analysis affirms the main idea of decoherence theory: quantum behavior is lost as a result of quantum decoherence.

TI Quantum catalysts
SO EES CATALYSIS
AB There is a non-local energy wave reality that rules our local observable experiences, which is non-observable directly using quantum mechanics based on continuous functions in space-time. Thus, wavefunctions start the transition from a classical deterministic realm to a probabilistic and discrete one. The principles of quantum mechanics fundamentally diverge from classical intuitions; thus, quantum materials have emerged as materials that cannot be described in terms of semiclassical particles and low-level approximations of quantum mechanics. Quantum materials have unique properties including non-weak (strong) electronic correlations and some type of electronic orders, such as superconducting and spin-orbital (magnetic) orders, and multiple coexisting interdependent phases, which are associated with new perceptions such as superposition and entanglement. Examples of quantum materials include superconductors, topological materials, Moir & eacute; superlattices, quantum dots and magnetically ordered materials. Many (solid) catalysts show distinctive quantum behaviours, which are frequently associated with open-shell orbital configurations. Thus, this perspective aims to show that the literature is already full of quantum catalysts, and it is necessary to distinguish them and adapt/improve their theoretical models for better understanding. Part of this work is focused on clarifying the complex language of many-body quantum physics, isolating the approximations that are not fundamentally complete, and connecting the non-classical interactions with more familiar concepts in chemistry. This approach is also valuable for the physics community, since it gives a more chemical view to the properties of quantum materials, with its adapted terminology. In this case, we aim to go beyond mathematics to try to explain the possible meaning and plausible real interpretation of quantum correlations. Only the understanding of true quantum potentials and their interplay within the transition state theory would enable a complete conceptual description of the most relevant electronic interactions in catalysis. Consequently, there is almost no new science in this article; it is mainly a collection of examples of quantum catalysts and the origin of the successful theoretical models that predicted the results. Finally, a perspective on the status of this emerging field is presented, emphasizing the imminent significant role of quantum correlations. Currently, the advanced incorporation of the fundamental principles of orbital physics in solid-state quantum catalysts is leading the technological transition towards a greener and more sustainable economy. Quantum correlations unify catalysis and embrace advanced physics, because the rivalry between quantum interactions is likewise the reference electronic background that explains the properties of quantum materials.

Efficient algorithms are developed for the indexing and unindexing of the solution space and for implementing the required alternating phase-walk unitaries, which are the core components of QWOA. Results of numerical simulation demonstrate that the QWOA is capable of producing convergence to near-optimal solutions for a randomly generated eight location CVRP. Preparation of the amplified quantum state in this example problem is demonstrated to produce higher-quality solutions than expected from classical random sampling of equivalent computational effort.

TI Group delay controls of the photons transmitting through two cavities
   coupled by an artificial atomic ensemble: controllable
   electromagnetically induced transparency-like effects
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB As one of the typical quantum coherence phenomena, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been extensively applied to implement various quantum coherent manipulations, typically, e.g., optical quantum memories, photonic switches, and optical quantum computations, etc. By applying the input-output theory to the photonic transports through two cavities dispersively coupled by an artificial two-level atomic ensemble, we show here that the EIT-like effects could be observed. Particularly, the transparency windows and phase shift spectra of the transmitting photons could be engineered by manipulating the atomic levels in the ensemble to adjust the effective coupling strength between the cavities. As a consequence, the group delays of the transmitting photons can be manipulated by using the EIT-like effects. The proposal is demonstrated specifically with the experimental superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators coupled by the voltage-biased electrons on liquid Helium.

TI Observation of emergent Z2 gauge invariance in a
   superconducting circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) are one of the most fundamental subjects in many-body physics, and has recently attracted considerable research interests in quantum simulations. Here we experimentally investigate the emergent Z(2) gauge invariance in a 1D superconducting circuit with 10 transmon qubits. By precisely adjusting staggered longitudinal and transverse fields to each qubit, we construct an effective Hamiltonian containing an LGT and gauge-broken terms. The corresponding matter sector can exhibit a localization, and there also exists a 3-qubit operator, of which the expectation value can retain nonzero for a long time in low-energy regimes. The above localization can be regarded as the confinement of matter fields, and the 3-body operator is the Z(2) gauge generator. These experimental results demonstrate that, despite the absence of gauge structure in the effective Hamiltonian, Z(2) gauge invariance can still emerge in low-energy regimes. Our work provides a method for both theoretically and experimentally studying the rich physics in quantum many-body systems with emergent gauge invariance.

Such a mechanical amplifier converts DC displacements into much larger AC oscillations via the quantum gain of the system which, in some cases, can be a factor of a million or more.

   two laser beams
SO REVISTA MEXICANA DE FISICA
AB A quantum scheme is presented in which a three-level trapped ion interacts with two laser beams in the absence and presence of a classical field. We analyze the impact of the classical field and the Lamb-Dicke parameter (LDP) on the dynamical behavior of an entanglement quantifier, population probabilities and the geometric phase (GP). From the set of LDP values and the classical field, we obtain the time dependence of the GP and population probabilities. The results show that both the time-dependent field and the LDP play an important role in developing the entanglement, fidelity and population probabilities. Robust entangled qudit states are obtained by two elaborated measures which are concurrence and fidelity.

We present a quantum matrix multiplication (QMM) algorithm that employs amplitude encoding and combines quantum walks with Chebyshev polynomial approximation to achieve quadratic acceleration for matrix chain multiplication where the same matrix is applied K times while maintaining logarithmic complexity in matrix dimension and precision. The algorithm can be applied to any complex matrix. Furthermore, we discuss integrating our QMM algorithm as a subroutine in other matrix operations and propose strategies to optimize QMM for matrices with large condition numbers with numerical simulation.

TI Thermodynamics of precision in quantum nanomachines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Fluctuations strongly affect the dynamics and functionality of nanoscale thermal machines. Recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics have shown that fluctuations in many far-from-equilibrium systems are constrained by the rate of entropy production via so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relations. These relations imply that increasing the reliability or precision of an engine's power output comes at a greater thermodynamic cost. Here we study the thermodynamics of precision for small thermal machines in the quantum regime. In particular, we derive exact relations between the power, power fluctuations, and entropy production rate for several models of few-qubit engines (both autonomous and cyclic) that perform work on a quantized load. Depending on the context, we find that quantum coherence can either help or hinder where power fluctuations are concerned. We discuss design principles for reducing such fluctuations in quantum nanomachines and propose an autonomous three-qubit engine whose power output for a given entropy production is more reliable than would be allowed by any classical Markovian model.

TI Quectonewton Local Force Sensor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report on the realization of a quantum sensor based on trapped atom interferometry in an optical lattice for the measurement of atom-surface interactions, with sub-micrometer-level control of the mean atom-surface separation distance. The force sensor reaches a short-term sensitivity of 3.4 x 10(-28) N at 1 s and a long-term stability of 4 qN (4 x 10(-30) N). We perform force measurements in the 0-300 mu m range, and despite significant stray forces caused by adsorbed atoms on the surface, we obtain evidence of the Casimir-Polder force.

TI Highly tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling and crossover from weak
   localization to weak antilocalization in ionic-gated tellurium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Electrostatically gating various two-dimensional materials has shown different phase transitions upon changing their charge carrier density, which could provide an additional understanding about the fundamental properties of solids. Moreover, the gate voltage or electric field control of electron spin in materials with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a key factor in the field of spintronics. In this paper, we performed electrostatic doping in p-type tellurium (Te) thin flakes using electric double-layer transistors (EDLTs). Our results show the possibility of gate tuning the insulator-metal phase transition in Te by effectively changing its charge carrier density. Furthermore, a crossover from weak localization (WL) to weak antilocalization (WAL) was observed, suggesting an increased Rashba-like SOC in the material created by a strong electric field restricted to the solid/electrolyte interface in EDLTs. The WAL becomes more pronounced as we increase the conductivity of the sample. The temperature dependence of the WAL further showed an e-e interaction to be the main scattering mechanism of the quantum decoherence and dephasing in the material. More interestingly, we have demonstrated the ability to control the electron spin and increase the Rashba parameter by a factor of 4 through ionic gating p-type Te, which holds an intriguing potential for spintronics applications.

TI Unfolding band structure and topological property of 3d
   transition metal doped monolayer CrTe2: A first-principle
   calculation
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Owing to their distinctive novel properties, topological metals hold significant promise for application in spintronics, quantum computing, and superconductivity. Using first-principle calculations, we have elucidated the unfolding band structure of 3d transition metal (3d-TM)-doped CrTe2. Notably, our investigation has revealed band crossings in Cu-doped CrTe2, forming a nodal ring near the Fermi level. Through analyzing Wannier charge centers, we have established the topological nontriviality of CrTe2 upon Cu doping. This study demonstrates a fresh platform for exploring their inherent topological properties and introduces a novel perspective on tectonic topological metals.

TI A dephasing sweet spot with enhanced dipolar coupling
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Two-level systems (TLSs) are the basic units of quantum computers but face a trade-off between operation speed and coherence due to shared coupling paths. Here, we investigate a TLS given by a singlet-triplet (ST+) transition. We identify a magnetic-field configuration that maximizes dipole coupling while minimizing total dephasing, forming a compromise-free sweet spot that mitigates this fundamental trade-off. The TLS is implemented in a crystal-phase-defined double-quantum dot in an InAs nanowire. Using a superconducting resonator, we measure the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gap, the spin-photon coupling strength, and the total TLS dephasing rate as a function of the in-plane magnetic-field orientation. Our theoretical description postulates phonons as the dominant noise source. The compromise-free sweet spot originates from the SOI, suggesting that it is not restricted to this material platform but might find applications in any material with SOI. These findings pave the way for enhanced nanomaterial engineering for next-generation qubit technologies.

TI Enhanced Nanoscale Ge Concentration Oscillations in Si/SiGe Quantum Well
   through Controlled Segregation
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The integration of electron spin qubits on Si/SiGe heterostructures requires precise control of valley splitting associated with conduction band degeneracy. This can be achieved by introducing nanoscale oscillating Ge concentration profiles, known as Wiggle Wells. However, the intermixing and segregation of Ge during growth have hindered their realization. We report the growth of Si/SiGe heterostructures with clear nanoscale composition modulation within the quantum well using molecular beam epitaxy. By oscillation of the growth temperature, Ge segregation is suppressed, achieving a Ge concentration modulation of 30%/nm, an order of magnitude higher than prior results. Tight-binding simulations suggest that Wiggle Well heterostructures with sharp compositional transitions significantly enhance valley splitting, yielding average values exceeding 200 mu eV, with energy levels well separated from 0 mu eV. Hence, Wiggle Wells are a promising approach for Si-based electronic qubits.

TI Long-range order and quantum criticality in a dissipative spin chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The environmental interaction is a fundamental consideration in any controlled quantum system. While an interaction with a dissipative bath can lead to decoherence, it can also provide desirable emergent effects including induced spin-spin correlations. In this Letter, we show that under quite general conditions, a dissipative bosonic bath can induce a long-range ordered phase, without the inclusion of any additional direct spin-spin couplings. Through a quantum-to-classical mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the T = 0 quantum phase transition of an Ising chain embedded in a bosonic bath with Ohmic dissipation. We show that the quantum critical point is continuous, Lorentz invariant with a dynamical critical exponent z = 1.07(9), has a correlation length exponent nu = 0.80(5), and anomalous exponent eta = 1.02(6), thus the universality class is distinct from the previously studied limiting cases. The implications of our results on experiments in ultracold atomic mixtures and qubit chains in dissipative environments are discussed.

TI Effect of chaos on the simulation of quantum critical phenomena in
   analog quantum simulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study how chaos, introduced by a weak perturbation, affects the reliability of the output of analog quantum simulation. As a toy model, we consider the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Inspired by the semiclassical behavior of the order parameter in the thermodynamic limit, we propose a protocol to measure the quantum phase transition in the ground state and the dynamical quantum phase transition associated with quench dynamics. We show that the presence of a small time-dependent perturbation can render the dynamics of the system chaotic. We then show that the estimates of the critical points of these quantum phase transitions, obtained from the quantum simulation of its dynamics, are robust to the presence of this chaotic perturbation, while other aspects of the system, such as the mean magnetization, are fragile and therefore cannot be reliably extracted from this simulator. This can be understood in terms of the simulated quantities that depend on the global structure of phase space vs those that depend on local trajectories.

TI Polynomial Complexity of Quantum Sample Tomography
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Efficient quantum tomography is crucial for advancing quantum computing technologies. Traditional quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements for complete reconstruction. Therefore, developing methods that reduce measurement complexity to polynomial scale is essential for practical applications. In this paper, we show that quantum sample tomography can be accomplished with polynomial scale measurements while maintaining accuracy with a high probability. We present a novel approach using conditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with solid theoretical foundations from Rademacher complexity and random projection theory. The effectiveness of our method is validated through several quantum models.

AB With the rapid development of quantum theory, the discrete logarithm problem and significant integer factorization problem have polynomial solution algorithms under quantum computing, and their security is seriously threatened. Therefore, a three-party password-authenticated key agreement scheme based on module learning with errors problem was proposed, and its security was proved in the BPR model. Compared with other password-authenticated key agreement protocols, the proposed protocol has higher efficiency and a shorter key length, which can resist quantum attacks. Therefore, the protocol is efficient and secure and suitable for large-scale network communication.

TI Gate-Based Spin Readout of Hole Quantum Dots with Site-Dependent
   g-Factors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The rapid progress of hole spin qubits in group IV semiconductors has been driven by their potential for scalability. This is due to the compatibility with industrial manufacturing standards, as well as the ease of operation and addressability via all-electric drives. However, owing to a strong spin-orbit interaction, these systems present variability and anisotropy in key qubit control parameters such as the Lande g -factor, requiring careful characterization for reliable qubit operation. Here, we experimentally investigate a hole double quantum dot in silicon by carrying out spin readout with gate-based reflectometry. We show that characteristic features in the reflected phase signal arising from magnetospectroscopy convey information on site-dependent g-factors in the two dots. Using analytical modeling, we extract the physical parameters of our system and, through numerical calculations, we extend the results to point to the prospect of conveniently extracting information about the local g-factors from reflectometry measurements.

TI Characteristics of reversible circuits for error detection
SO ARRAY
AB In this work, we consider error detection via simulation for reversible circuit architectures. We rigorously prove that reversibility augments the performance of this simple error detection protocol to a considerable degree. A single randomly generated input is guaranteed to unveil a single reversible error with a probability that only depends on the size of the error, not the size of the circuit itself. Empirical studies confirm that this behavior typically extends to multiple errors as well. In conclusion, reversible circuits offer characteristics that reduce masking effects - a desirable feature that is in stark contrast to irreversible circuit architectures.

In this paper, we introduce a valid subset of typing rules, defining an expressive enough quantum calculus. Then, we propose a categorical semantics for it. Such a semantics consists of an adjunction between the category of distributive-action spaces of value distributions (that is, linear combinations of values in the lambda calculus), and the category of sets of value distributions.

TI Large-scale wireless coverage optimization: A quantum approach

AB Wireless network coverage optimization is critical for improving service quality. However, optimizing largescale networks remains challenging for both classical algorithms and quantum methods in the NISQ era. This paper proposes a quantum approach that models the problem as a covering graph, partitions it using a QUBO formulation, and solves subproblems via a filtered variational quantum eigensolver. The method is experimentally validated on real quantum hardware, including a coherent Ising machine and a superconducting quantum processor, and compared with classical methods like SA and PSO. This work introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy for large-scale network coverage optimization and expands the solution landscape.

TI Topological line in frustrated toric code models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Typical topological systems undergo a topological phase transition in the presence of a strong enough perturbation. We propose an adjustable frustrated toric code with a "topological line" at which no phase transition happens in the system and the topological order is robust against a nonlinear perturbation of arbitrary strength. This important result is a consequence of the interplay between frustration and nonlinearity in our system, which also causes the emergence of other interesting phenomena such as reentrant topological phases and survival of the topological order under local projection operations. Our study opens a window towards more robust topological quantum codes which are the cornerstones of large-scale quantum computing.

TI Discriminating the Phase of a Coherent Tone with a Flux-Switchable
   Superconducting Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a new phase detection technique based on a flux-switchable superconducting circuit, the Josephson digital phase detector (JDPD), which is capable of discriminating between two phase values of a coherent input tone. When properly excited by an external flux, the JDPD is able to switch from a single-minimum to a double-minima potential and, consequently, relax in one of the two stable configurations depending on the phase sign of the input tone. The result of this operation is digitally encoded in the occupation probability of a phase particle in either of the two JDPD wells. In this work, we demonstrate the working principle of the JDPD up to a frequency of 400 MHz with a remarkable agreement with theoretical expectations. As a future scenario, we discuss the implementation of this technique to superconducting qubit readout. We also examine the JDPD compatibility with the single-flux-quantum architecture, employed to fast-drive and measure the device state.

AB The anomalous low-temperature properties of glasses arise from intrinsic excitable entities, so-called tunneling Two-Level-Systems (TLS), whose microscopic nature has been baffling solid-state physicists for decades. TLS have become particularly important for micro-fabricated quantum devices such as superconducting qubits, where they are a major source of decoherence. Here, we present a method to characterize individual TLS in virtually arbitrary materials deposited as thin films. The material is used as the dielectric in a capacitor that shunts the Josephson junction of a superconducting qubit. In such a hybrid quantum system the qubit serves as an interface to detect and control individual TLS. We demonstrate spectroscopic measurements of TLS resonances, evaluate their coupling to applied strain and DC-electric fields, and find evidence of strong interaction between coherent TLS in the sample material. Our approach opens avenues for quantum material spectroscopy to investigate the structure of tunneling defects and to develop low-loss dielectrics that are urgently required for the advancement of superconducting quantum computers.

TI Fault-Tolerant Postselection for Low-Overhead Magic State Preparation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a framework for fault-tolerant postselection (FTPS) of fault-tolerant codes and channels-such as those based on surface codes-using soft-information metrics based on visible syndrome and erasure information. We introduce several metrics for ranking configurations of syndromes and erasures. In particular, we introduce the logical gap (and variants thereof) as a powerful soft-information metric for predicting logical error rates of fault-tolerant channels based on topological error-correcting codes. The logical gap is roughly the unsigned weight difference between inequivalent logical corrections and is adaptable to any tailored noise model or decoder. We deploy this framework to prepare high-quality surface-code magic states with low overhead under a model of independent and identically distributed (IID) Pauli and erasure errors. Postselection strategies based on the logical gap can suppress the encoding error rate (EER) of a magic state preparation channel to the level of the physical error rate with low overhead. For example, when operating at 60% of the bulk threshold of the corresponding surface code, an overall reduction of the EER by a factor of 15 is achievable with a relative overhead factor of < 2 (approximately 23 times less than that of simple syndrome-counting rules). We analyze a schematic buffer architecture for implementing postselection rules on magic state factories in the context of magic state distillation. The FTPS framework can be utilized for mitigating errors in more general fault-tolerant logical channels.

TI Ultra-high-Q nanomechanical resonators for force sensing

Here, I propose that such resonators will allow the detection of electron and nuclear spins with high spatial resolution, paving the way to future nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging instruments. The article lists the challenges that must be overcome before this vision can become reality, and indicates potential solutions.

TI Low Field Nano-NMR via Three-Level System Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Conventional control strategies for nitrogen-vacancy centers in quantum sensing are based on a two-level model of their triplet ground state. However, this approach fails in regimes of weak bias magnetic fields or strong microwave pulses, as we demonstrate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel control sequence that exploits all three levels by addressing a hidden Raman configuration with microwave pulses tuned to the zero-field transition. We report excellent performance in typical dynamical decoupling sequences, opening up the possibility for nano-NMR operation in low field environments.

TI Quantum microgrid state estimation
SO ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB This paper investigates the feasibility and efficiency of quantum-circuit-based algorithms for microgrid state estimation. Our new contributions include: (1) a general quantum state estimation (GQSE) formulation is devised for swing-bus-contained microgrids through the quantized Gaussian-Newton iteration, (2) a preconditioned quantum linear solver (PQLS) is developed for tackling the ill-conditioned GQSE with limited quantum resources, and (3) an enhanced quantum state estimation (EQSE) algorithm is further established for hierarchical-control-based microgrids with exogenous disturbances. Extensive case studies demonstrate the correctness of GQSE, PQLS and EQSE in two typical microgrids. The robustness and convergence performance of EQSE are also verified.

TI Quantum-inspired permanent identities
SO QUANTUM
AB The permanent is pivotal to both complexity theory and combinatorics. In quantum computing, the permanent appears in the expression of output amplitudes of linear optical computations, such as in the Boson Sampling model. Taking advantage of this connection, we give quantum-inspired proofs of many existing as well as new remarkable permanent identities. Most notably, we give a quantum-inspired proof of the MacMahon master theorem as well as proofs for new generalizations of this theorem. Previous proofs of this theorem used completely different ideas. Beyond their purely combinatorial applications, our results demonstrate the classical hardness of exact and approximate sampling of linear optical quantum computations with input cat states.

TI Traffic Signal Optimization in Large-Scale Urban Road Networks: An
   Adaptive-Predictive Controller Using Ising Models
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Realizing smooth traffic flow is important for achieving carbon neutrality. Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use Ising solvers, which have been widely studied and are expected to offer fast and efficient optimization performance. The method works adaptively according to traffic conditions such as the structure of the road network and feedback from observation of the traffic system. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. Compared to the classical pattern control method, the results show that AMPIC increases the vehicle cruising speed by 13%, reduces the waiting vehicle ratio to 60%, and lowers the CO2 emissions to only 25% of the original level. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.

TI Stabilizing lattice gauge theories through simplified local
   pseudogenerators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The postulate of gauge invariance in nature does not lend itself directly to implementations of lattice gauge theories in modern setups of quantum synthetic matter. Unavoidable gauge-breaking errors in such devices require gauge invariance to be enforced for faithful quantum simulation of gauge-theory physics. This poses major experimental challenges, in large part due to the complexity of the gauge-symmetry generators. Here, we show that gauge invariance can be reliably stabilized by employing simplified local pseudogenerators designed such that within the physical sector they act identically to the actual local generator. Dynamically, they give rise to emergent exact gauge theories up to time scales polynomial and even exponential in the protection strength. This obviates the need for implementing often complex multibody full gauge symmetries, thereby further reducing experimental overhead in physical realizations. We showcase our method in the Z(2) lattice gauge theory, and discuss experimental considerations for its realization in modern ultracold-atom setups.

TI Characterizing two-dimensional superconductivity via nanoscale noise
   magnetometry with single-spin qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose nanoscale magnetometry via isolated single-spin qubits as a probe of superconductivity in two-dimensional materials. We characterize the magnetic field noise at the qubit location, arising from current and spin fluctuations in the sample and leading to measurable polarization decay of the qubit. We show that the noise due to transverse current fluctuations studied as a function of temperature and sample-probe distance can be used to extract useful information about the transition to a superconducting phase and the pairing symmetry of the superconductor. Surprisingly, at low temperatures, the dominant contribution to the magnetic noise arises from longitudinal current fluctuations and can be used to probe collective modes such as monolayer plasmons and bilayer Josephson plasmons. We also characterize the noise due to spin fluctuations, which allows probing the spin structure of the pairing wave function. Our results provide a noninvasive route to probe the rich physics of two-dimensional superconductors.

TI Loss-tolerant cross-Kerr enhancement via modulated squeezing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We develop squeezing protocols to enhance cross-Kerr interactions. We show that through alternating between squeezing along different quadratures of a single photonic mode, the cross-Kerr interaction strength can be generically amplified. As an application of the squeezing protocols, we discuss speeding up the deterministic implementation of controlled phase gates in photonic quantum computing architectures. We develop bounds that characterize how fast and strong single-mode squeezing has to be applied to achieve a desired gate error and show that the protocols can overcome photon losses. Finally, we discuss experimental realizations of the squeezing strategies in optical fibers and nanophotonic waveguides.

We propose a colored PROP to model computation in this framework, where the choice is parameterized by an algebraic side effect: the model can support regular tests, probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, as well as quantum branching, i.e. superposition. The graphical language comes equipped with a denotational semantics based on linear maps, and an equational theory. We prove the language to be universal, and the equational theory to be complete with respect to this semantics.

TI Security analysis of ensemble-based quantum token protocol under
   advanced attacks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present and characterize advanced attacks on an ensemble-based quantum token protocol that allows for implementing non-clonable quantum coins. Multiple differently initialized tokens of identically prepared qubit ensembles are combined to a quantum coin that can be issued by a bank. A sophisticated attempt to copy tokens can assume that measurements on sub-ensembles can be carried through and that even individual qubits can be measured. Even though such an advanced attack might be perceived as technically unfeasible, we prove the security of the protocol under these conditions. We performed numerical simulations and verified our results by experiments on the IBM quantum platforms for different types of advanced attacks. Finally, we demonstrate that the security of the quantum coin can be made high by increasing the number of tokens. This paper in conjunction with provided numerical simulation tools verified against experimental data from the IBM quantum platforms allows for securely implementing our ensemble-based quantum token protocol with arbitrary quantum systems.

TI Control of threshold voltages in Si/Si0.7Ge0.3 quantum devices via
   optical illumination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optical illumination of quantum dot qubit devices at cryogenic temperatures, while not well studied, is often used to recover operating conditions after undesired shocking events or charge injection. Here, we demonstrate systematic threshold-voltage shifts in a dopant-free Si/Si0.7Ge0.3 field-effect transistor using a near-infrared (780-nm) laser diode. We find that illumination under an applied gate voltage can be used to set a specific, stable, and reproducible threshold voltage that, over a wide range in gate bias, is equal to that gate bias. Outside this range, the threshold voltage can still be tuned, although the resulting threshold voltage is no longer equal to the applied gate bias during illumination. We present a simple and intuitive model that provides a mechanism for the tunability in the gate bias. The model presented also explains why cryogenic illumination is successful at resetting quantum dot qubit devices after undesired charging events.

TI Spin Readout of a CMOS Quantum Dot by Gate Reflectometry and
   Spin-Dependent Tunneling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Silicon spin qubits are promising candidates for realizing large-scale quantum processors, benefitting from a magnetically quiet host material and the prospects of leveraging the mature silicon device fabrication industry. We report the measurement of an electron spin in a singly occupied gate-defined quantum dot, fabricated using CMOS-compatible processes at the 300-mm wafer scale. For readout, we employ spin-dependent tunneling combined with a low-footprint single-lead quantum-dot charge sensor, measured using rf gate reflectometry. We demonstrate spin readout in two devices using this technique, obtaining valley splittings in the range 0.5-0.7 meV using excited-state spectroscopy, and measure a maximum electron-spin relaxation time (T-1) of 9 +/- 3 s at 1 T. These long lifetimes indicate the silicon-nanowire geometry and fabrication processes employed here show a great deal of promise for qubit devices, while the spin-readout method demonstrated here is well suited to a variety of scalable architectures.

TI Superactivation of memory effects in a classical Markov environment
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We investigate a phenomenon known as Superactivation of Backflow of Information (SBFI); namely, the fact that the tensor product of a non-Markovian dynamics with itself exhibits Backflow of Information (BFI) from environment to system even if the single dynamics does not. Such an effect is witnessed by the non-monotonic behaviour of the Helstrom norm and emerges in the open dynamics of two independent, but statistically coupled, parties. We physically interpret SBFI by means of the discrete-time non-Markovian dynamics of two open qubits collisionally coupled to an environment described by a classical Markov chain. In such a scenario, SBFI can be ascribed to the decrease of the qubit-qubit-environment correlations in favour of those of the two qubits, only. We further prove that the same mechanism at the roots of SBFI also holds in a suitable continuous-time limit. We also show that SBFI does not require entanglement to be witnessed, but only the quantumness of the Helstrom ensemble.

TI All-optical generation of deterministic squeezed Schrodinger-cat states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum states are important resources and their preparations are essential prerequisites to all quantum tech-nologies. However, they are extremely fragile due to the inevitable dissipations. Here the all-optical generation of a deterministic squeezed Schrodinger-cat state based on dissipation is proposed. Our system is based on the Fredkin-type interaction between three optical modes, one of which is subject to coherent two-photon driving and the others are coherent driving. We show that an effective degenerate three-wave-mixing process can be engineered in our system, which can cause the simultaneous loss of two photons, resulting in the generation of a deterministic squeezed Schrodinger-cat state. More importantly, by controlling the driving fields in our system, the two-photon loss can be adjustable, which can accelerate the generation of squeezed Schrodinger-cat states. In addition, we exploit the squeezed Schrodinger-cat states to estimate the phase in the optical interferometer and show that the quantum Fisher information about the phase can reach the Heisenberg limit in the limit of a large photon number. Meanwhile, it can have an order of magnitude factor improvement over the Heisenberg limit in the low-photon-number regime, which is very valuable for fragile systems that cannot withstand large photon fluxes. This work proposes an all-optical scheme to deterministically prepare the squeezed Schrodinger-cat state with high speed and can also be generalized to other physical platforms.

TI Observation of Non-Markovian Spin Dynamics in a Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard
   Model Using a Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) model is a fundamental many-body model for light-matter interaction. As a leading platform for quantum simulation, the trapped ion system has realized the JCH model for two to three ions. Here, we report the quantum simulation of the JCH model using up to 32 ions. We verify the simulation results even for large ion numbers by engineering low excitations and thus low effective dimensions; then we extend to 32 excitations for an effective dimension of 277, which is difficult for classical computers. By regarding the phonon modes as baths, we explore Markovian or non-Markovian spin dynamics in different parameter regimes of the JCH model, similar to quantum emitters in a structured photonic environment. We further examine the dependence of the non-Markovian dynamics on the effective Hilbert space dimension. Our Letter demonstrates the trapped ion system as a powerful quantum simulator for many-body physics and open quantum systems.

TI Scaling whole-chip QAOA for higher-order ising spin glass models on
   heavy-hex graphs
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We show that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for higher-order, random coefficient, heavy-hex compatible spin glass Ising models has strong parameter concentration across problem sizes from 16 up to 127 qubits for p = 1 up to p = 5, which allows for computationally efficient parameter transfer of QAOA angles. Matrix product state (MPS) simulation is used to compute noise-free QAOA performance. Hardware-compatible short-depth QAOA circuits are executed on ensembles of 100 higher-order Ising models on noisy IBM quantum superconducting processors with 16, 27, and 127 qubits using QAOA angles learned from a single 16-qubit instance using the JuliQAOA tool. We show that the best quantum processors find lower energy solutions up to p = 2 or p = 3, and find mean energies that are about a factor of two off from the noise-free distribution. We show that p = 1 QAOA energy landscapes remain very similar as the problem size increases using NISQ hardware gridsearches with up to a 414 qubit processor.

TI Evidence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling on a digital quantum simulator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Understanding how hydrodynamic behaviour emerges from the unitary evolution of the many-particle Schrodinger equation is a central goal of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this work we implement a digital simulation of the discrete time quantum dynamics of a spin-21 XXZ spin chain on a noisy near-term quantum device, and we extract the high temperature transport exponent at the isotropic point. We simulate the temporal decay of the relevant spin correlation function at high temperature using a pseudo-random state generated by a random circuit that is specifically tailored to the ibmq-montreal 27 qubit device. The resulting output is a spin excitation on a homogeneous background on a 21 qubit chain on the device. From the subsequent discrete time dynamics on the device we are able to extract an anomalous super-diffusive exponent consistent with the conjectured Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling at the isotropic point. Furthermore we simulate the restoration of spin diffusion with the application of an integrability breaking potential.

TI Protecting local and global symmetries in simulating (1+1)D non-Abelian
   gauge theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Efficient quantum simulation protocols for any quantum theories demand efficient protection protocols for its underlying symmetries. This task is nontrivial for gauge theories as it involves local symmetry/invariance. For non-Abelian gauge theories, protecting all the symmetries generated by a set of mutually noncommuting generators, is particularly difficult. In this paper, a global symmetry-protection protocol is proposed. Using the novel loop-string-hadron formalism of non-Abelian lattice gauge theory, we numerically demonstrate that all of the local symmetries get protected even for large time by this global symmetry protection scheme. With suitable protection strength, the dynamics of a (1 + 1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory remains confined in the physical Hilbert space of the theory even in presence of explicit local symmetry violating terms in the Hamiltonian that may occur in both analog and digital simulation schemes as an error. The whole scheme holds for SU(3) gauge theory as well.

TI Modulation of topological phase transition and topological quantum state
   of magnon-photon in one-dimensional coupled cavity lattices
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB We propose a theoretical scheme to study the topological properties of magnon-photon in a one-dimensional coupled cavity lattice. Each unit cell is composed of the cavity microwave photon and the magnon, where the magnon is placed inside the cavity. The coupling of cavity microwave photon and magnon is controlled by an external magnetic field, and multiple cavities are coupled with each other to form a one-dimensional coupled cavity lattice system. Here, we study the topological phase transition and topological quantum channels of magnon-photon in the system by adjusting the magnon-photon coupling. Firstly, considering odd and even number lattices, we analyze and discuss the energy spectrum and the edge state in one-dimensional coupled cavity lattices. It is found that the energy band of the system is symmetric, and the edge states in the energy gap have time reversal symmetry, which makes the system topologically protected. At the same time, it is also noted that the maximum value, flipping, and period of the energy spectrum have changed, and the region of the edge state has expanded and extended. In addition, the edge state distribution can undergo the flipping process, which can achieve multi-channel topological quantum state transmission. Besides, considering the presence of defects and disorder in the system, it is found that when the random defect potential is small, the edge state of the system is robust to it, but when the random defect potential is large, the fluctuation of the energy band will be enhanced, and the edge state will be submerged in the energy band. However, when the disorder is very small, it can cause band fluctuations and flipping phenomena, and the edge state is robust to it, indicating the topological protection of the edge state. This work offers an effective way to study topological magnon-photon, which will have promising applications in quantum information processing.

TI Genuine entanglement under squeezed generalized amplitude damping
   channels with memory
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We study genuine entanglement among three qubits undergoing a noisy process that includes dissipation, squeezing, and decoherence. We obtain a general solution and analyze the asymptotic quantum states. We find that most of these asymptotic states can be genuinely entangled depending upon the parameters of the channel, memory parameter, and the parameters of the initial states. We study Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states, mixed with white noise, and determine the conditions for them to be genuinely entangled at infinity. We find that for these mixtures, it is possible to start with a bi-separable state (with a specific mixture of white noise) and end with genuine entangled states. However, the memory parameter mu must be very high. We find that in contrast to the two-qubit case, none of the three-qubit asymptotic states for n -> infinity are genuinely entangled.

TI Chemical design with GPU-based Ising machines
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Ising machines are hardware-assisted discrete optimizers that often outperform purely software-based optimization. They are implemented, e.g., with superconducting qubits, ASICs or GPUs. In this paper, we show how Ising machines can be leveraged to gain efficiency improvements in automatic molecule design. To this end, we construct a graph-based binary variational autoencoder to obtain discrete latent vectors, train a factorization machine as a surrogate model, and optimize it with an Ising machine. In comparison to Bayesian optimization in a continuous latent space, our method performed better in three benchmarking problems. Two types of Ising machines, a qubit-based D-Wave quantum annealer and GPU-based Fixstars Amplify, are compared and it is observed that the GPU-based one scales better and is more suitable for molecule generation. Our results show that GPU-based Ising machines have the potential to empower deep-learning-based materials design.
   Ising machines are used to create molecules with desired properties. GPU-based Ising machines are shown to outperform qubit-based ones in terms of scalability.

TI Uniformity improvement of Josephson-junction resistance by considering
   sidewall deposition during shadow evaporation for large-scale
   integration of qubits
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The uniformity of Josephson-junction (JJ) characteristics is crucial in wafer-scale superconducting quantum-bit (qubit) integration. To achieve the level of accuracy demanded the circuits, every detail of the fabrication process needs to be optimized. Here we reveal that the junction-resistance (R (N)) variations of Al/AlO x /Al JJs are affected by the metal deposition on the sidewall of the resist mask during shadow evaporation. The effect is reproduced in numerical simulation using a simple model taking into account the resist structure and the evaporation angle. To overcome the issue, we introduce a two-step shadow evaporation method to reduce the variation of R (N). As a result, the coefficient of variations across a 3-inch wafer decreases from 6.7% to 4.5%, achieving 1.1% in a chip with an area of 10 mm x 10 mm. This method is promising for developing large-scale superconducting quantum computers.

TI Method for the Quantum Metric Tensor Measurement in a Continuous
   Variable System
SO PHOTONICS
AB As a fundamental concept, geometry is widely used in understanding physical phenomena. In quantum mechanics, geometry is related to the system's quantum state and can be characterized by the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part is referred to as the quantum metric tensor (QMT), which defines the distance between two neighboring quantum states in the projected Hilbert space. Several pieces of research based on discrete variables have been proposed to extract the QMT, but research with the use of continuous variables is lacking. Here, we propose a method to extract the QMT of a continuous variable system, specified here as a cat-qubit. The method is developed by constructing the Kerr nonlinear parametric oscillator (KNPO) and by modulating it with external drives to induce adiabatic dynamics process within the state subspace spanned by the even and odd Schodinger cat states. The method paves the way for exploring the geometry for continuous variable systems.

TI O-terminated interface for thickness-insensitive transport properties of
   aluminum oxide Josephson junctions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Alumina Josephson junction has demonstrated a tremendous potential to realize superconducting qubits. Further progress towards scalable superconducting qubits urgently needs to be guided by novel analysis mechanisms or methods to reduce the thickness sensitivity of the junction critical current to the tunnel barrier. Here, it is first revealed that the termination mode of AlOx interface plays a crucial role in the uniformity of critical current, and we demonstrate that the O-terminated interface has the lowest resistance sensitivity to thickness. More impressively, we developed atomically structured three-dimensional models and calculated their transport properties using a combination of quantum ballistic transport theory with first-principles DFT and NEGF to examine the effects of the Al2O3 termination mode and thickness variations. This work clarifies that O-terminated interface can effectively improve the resistance uniformity of Josephson junction, offering useful guidance for increasing the yield of fixed-frequency multi-qubit quantum chips which require tight control on qubit frequency.

TI Radial Two-Dimensional Ion Crystals in a Linear Paul Trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We experimentally study two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb crystals in the "radial-2D" phase of a linear Paul trap. This phase is identified by a 2D ion lattice aligned entirely with the radial plane and is created by imposing a large ratio of axial to radial trapping potentials. Using arrays of up to 19 Yb-171(+) ions, we demonstrate that the structural phase boundaries of such crystals are well described by the pseudopotential approximation, despite the time-dependent ion positions driven by intrinsic micromotion. We further observe that micromotion-induced heating of the radial-2D crystal is confined to the radial plane. Finally, we verify that the transverse motional modes, which are used in most ion-trap quantum simulation schemes, are well-predictable numerically and remain decoupled and cold in this geometry. Our results establish radial-2D ion crystals as a robust experimental platform for realizing a variety of theoretical proposals in quantum simulation and computation.

TI Coherent rotation of a single spin via adiabatic half passage in the
   presence of a ferromagnetic vortex
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We experimentally and numerically study possible implementations for 7r/2 rotations of a single nitrogen-vacancy defect spin state in proximity to a magnetic vortex core. Dynamically controlled magnetic vortex cores have been suggested as a means to provide nanoscale, rapidly-tunable magnetic fields for spin qubit addressability and control. However, driven and thermal non-equilibrium dynamics of the vortex core complicate prospects for high-fidelity gate operations. We find that the complicated profile of the driven vortex core fringe field leads to significant, but unpredictable enhancement of both Zeeman splitting and Rabi frequency. Furthermore, the gyrotropic dynamics of the vortex core lead to a complicated evolution of the spin state. We demonstrate that the fidelity of pi/2 rotations can be improved using an adiabatic passage protocol in which the vortex provides an enhancement of spin splitting and Rabi frequency while unwanted vortex dynamics are suppressed.

TI Dynamical quantum phase transitions in the spin-boson model
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We study dynamical quantum phase transitions in a 2-qubit system interacting with a transverse field and a quantized bosonic environment in the context of open quantum systems. By applying the stochastic Schrodinger equation approach, the model with a spin-boson type of coupling can be solved numerically. It is observed that the dynamics of the rate function of the Loschmidt echo in a 2-qubit system within a finite size of Hilbert space exhibit nonanalyticity when the direction of the transverse field coupled to the system is under a sudden quench. Moreover, we demonstrate that the memory time of the environment and the coupling strength between the system and the transverse field can jointly impact the dynamics of the rate function. We also supply a semi-classical explanation to bridge the dynamical quantum phase transitions in many-body systems and the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems.

TI Quantum semantics of text perception
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The paper presents quantum model of subjective text perception based on binary cognitive distinctions corresponding to words of natural language. The result of perception is quantum cognitive state represented by vector in the qubit Hilbert space. Complex-valued structure of the quantum state space extends the standard vector-based approach to semantics, allowing to account for subjective dimension of human perception in which the result is constrained, but not fully predetermined by input information. In the case of two distinctions, the perception model generates a two-qubit state, entanglement of which quantifies semantic connection between the corresponding words. This two-distinction perception case is realized in the algorithm for detection and measurement of semantic connectivity between pairs of words. The algorithm is experimentally tested with positive results. The developed approach to cognitive modeling unifies neurophysiological, linguistic, and psychological descriptions in a mathematical and conceptual structure of quantum theory, extending horizons of machine intelligence.

TI Exchange-biased quantum tunnelling of magnetization in a
   [Mn3]2 dimer of single-molecule magnets with rare
   ferromagnetic inter-Mn3 coupling
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB A covalently-linked dimer of two single-molecule magnets (SMMs), [Mn6O(O2CMe)(6)(1,3-ppmd)(3)](ClO4)(2), has been synthesized from the reaction of [Mn3O(O2CMe)(6)(py)(3)](ClO4) with 1,3-phenylene-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethanone) dioxime (1,3-ppmdH(2)). It contains two [(Mn3O)-O-III](+7) triangular units linked by three 1,3-ppmd(2-) groups into an [Mn-3](2) dimer with D-3 symmetry. Solid-state dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements showed that each Mn-3 subunit retains its properties as an SMM with an S = 6 ground state. Magnetization vs. dc field sweeps on a single crystal reveal hysteresis loops below 1.3 K exhibiting exchange-biased quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) steps with a bias field of +0.06 T. This is the first example of a dimer of SMMs showing a positive exchange bias of the QTM steps in the hysteresis loops, and it has therefore been subjected to a detailed analysis. Simulation of the loops determines that each Mn-3 unit is exchange-coupled with its neighbour primarily through the 1,3-ppmd(2-) linkers, confirming a weak ferromagnetic inter-Mn-3 interaction of J(12) approximate to +6.5 mK ( = -2J(i)center dot(j) convention). High-frequency EPR studies of a microcrystalline powder sample enable accurate determination of the zero-field splitting parameters of the uncoupled Mn-3 SMMs, while also confirming the weak exchange interaction between the two SMMs within each [Mn-3](2) dimer. The combined results emphasize the ability of designed covalent linkers to generate inter-SMM coupling of a particular sign and relative magnitude, and thus the ability of such linkers to modulate the quantum physics. As such, this work supports the feasibility of using designed covalent linkers to develop molecular oligomers of SMMs, or other magnetic molecules, as multi-qubit systems and/or other components of new quantum technologies.

TI Black hole interior in unitary gauge construction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A quantum system with a black hole accommodates two widely different, though physically equivalent, descriptions. In one description, based on global spacetime of general relativity, the existence of the interior region is manifest, while understanding unitarity requires nonperturbative quantum gravity effects such as replica wormholes. The other description adopts a manifestly unitary, or holographic, description, in which the interior emerges effectively as a collective phenomenon of fundamental degrees of freedom. In this paper we study the latter approach, which we refer to as the unitary gauge construction. In this picture, the formation of a black hole is signaled by the emergence of a surface (stretched horizon) possessing special dynamical properties: quantum chaos, fast scrambling, and low energy universality. These properties allow for constructing interior operators, as we do explicitly, without relying on details of microscopic physics. A key role is played by certain coarse modes in the zone region (hard modes), which determine the degrees of freedom relevant for the emergence of the interior. We study how the interior operators can or cannot be extended in the space of microstates and analyze irreducible errors associated with such extension. This reveals an intrinsic ambiguity of semiclassical theory formulated with a (mite number of degrees of freedom. We provide an explicit prescription of calculating interior correlators in the effective theory, which describes only a finite region of spacetime. We study the issue of state dependence of interior operators in detail and discuss a connection of the resulting picture with the quantum error correction interpretation of holography.

TI QuantumLeap: Hybrid quantum neural network for financial predictions
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB This paper introduces a new hybrid deep quantum neural network for financial predictions, the QuantumLeap system. This system consists of an encoder that transforms a partitioned financial time series into a sequence of density matrices; a deep quantum network that predicts the density matrix at a later time; and a classical network that measures, from the output density matrix, the maximum price reached by a security at a later time. The deep quantum network is isomorphic to a deep classical network and is computationally tractable. A hybrid deep network is associated with each time stride, allowing for parallelisation of the learning process. The classical network is a learnable measurement apparatus which infers, from the output density matrix, the maximum price reached by a security for a given time. Experimental results associated with 24 securities clearly demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the system in both the regression and extrapolation regimes.

TI Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that in finite dimensions, around any m-partite product state rho prod = rho 1 (R) <middle dot> <middle dot> <middle dot> (R) rho m, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around rho prod. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of stochastic local operations and classiccal communication (SLOCC)-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to three-qubit X states, genuinely entangled four-qubit states mixed with noise, and the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.

TI Exchange anisotropies in microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hole spin qubits are emerging as the workhorse of semiconducting quantum processors because of their large spin-orbit interaction, enabling fast, low-power, all-electric operations. However, this interaction also causes non-uniformities, resulting in site-dependent qubit energies and anisotropies. Although these anisotropies enable single-spin control, if not properly harnessed, they can hinder scalability. Here, we report on microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits in planar germanium and use them to investigate spin anisotropies. For in-plane magnetic fields, the spins are largely anisotropic and electrically tunable, allowing access to all transitions and coherence times exceeding 3 mu s are extracted. For out-of-plane fields they have an isotropic response. Even in this field direction, where the qubit lifetime is strongly affected by nuclear spins, we find 400 ns coherence times. Our work adds a valuable tool to investigate and harness the spin anisotropies, applicable to two-dimensional devices, facilitating the path towards scalable quantum processors.

TI Geodesic Path for the Minimal Energy Cost in Shortcuts to Isothermality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Shortcuts to isothermality are driving strategies to steer the system to its equilibrium states within finite time, and enable evaluating the impact of a control promptly. Finding the optimal scheme to minimize the energy cost is of critical importance in applications of this strategy in pharmaceutical drug tests, biological selection, and quantum computation. We prove the equivalence between designing the optimal scheme and finding the geodesic path in the space of control parameters. Such equivalence allows a systematic and universal approach to find the optimal control to reduce the energy cost. We demonstrate the current method with examples of a Brownian particle trapped in controllable harmonic potentials.

TI Algebraic classification of Hietarinta's solutions of Yang-Baxter
   equations: invertible 4 x 4 operators
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In order to examine the simulation of integrable quantum systems using quantum computers, it is crucial to first classify Yang-Baxter operators. Hietarinta was among the first to classify constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). Including the one produced by the permutation operator, he was able to construct eleven families of invertible solutions. These techniques are effective for 4 by 4 solutions, but they become difficult to use for representations with more dimensions. To get over this limitation, we use algebraic ans & auml;tze to generate the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent way. We employ four distinct algebraic structures that, depending on the qubit representation, replicate 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families. Among the techniques are partition algebras, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and a collection of commuting operators. Using these techniques, we do not obtain the (2, 2) Hietarinta class.

TI Direct experimental test of commutation relation via imaginary weak
   value
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The canonical commutation relation is the hallmark of quantum theory, and Heisenberg's uncertainty relation is a direct consequence of it. Although various formulations of uncertainty relations have been tested in experiments a direct test of the commutation relation has hitherto not been performed. The reason for this is that whereas in quantum mechanics, observables are usually represented by Hermitian operators, the product of two noncommuting observables as occurring in the commutator relation is, in general, non-Hermitian. Here, we present a theoretical scheme for a direct test of the commutation relation and report its experimental realization. More precisely, we provide an experimental verification of the canonical commutation relation between two qubit observables based on a measurement scheme widely known as "weak measurement." In our neutron interferometric setup, we perform the measurement of a single anomalous weak value of a relevant path-qubit observable where the coupled spin-energy degree of freedom serves as an ancilla.

TI Toward Atomic-Resolution Quantum Measurements with Coherently Shaped
   Free Electrons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Free electrons provide a powerful tool for probing material properties at atomic resolution. Recent advances in ultrafast electron microscopy enable the manipulation of free-electron wave functions using laser pulses. It would be of great importance if one could combine the spatial resolution of electron microscopes with the ability of laser pulses to probe coherent phenomena in quantum systems. To this end, we propose a novel concept that leverages free electrons that are coherently shaped by laser pulses to measure quantum coherence in materials. We develop the quantum theory of interactions between shaped electrons and arbitrary qubit states in materials, and show how the postinteraction electron energy spectrum enables measuring the qubit state (on the Bloch sphere) and the decoherence or relaxation times (T-2/T-1). Finally, we describe how such electrons can detect and quantify superradiance from multiple qubits. Our scheme can be implemented in ultrafast transmission electron microscopes (UTEM), opening the way toward the full characterization of the state of quantum systems at atomic resolution.

TI Exploring the properties of the VB- defect in hBN:
   optical spin polarization, Rabi oscillations, and coherent nuclei
   modulation
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Optically active point defects in semiconductors have received great attention in the field of solid-state quantum technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride, with an ultra-wide band gap E-g = 6 eV, containing a negatively charged boron vacancy ( V-B(-) ) with unique spin, optical, and coherent properties presents a new two-dimensional platform for the implementation of quantum technologies. This work establishes the value of V-B(-) spin polarization under optical pumping with lambda( ext) = 532 nm laser using high-frequency (nu (mw) = 94 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In optimal conditions polarization was found to be P approximate to 38.4%. Our study reveals that Rabi oscillations induced on polarized spin states persist for up to 30-40 mu s, which is nearly two orders of magnitude longer than what was previously reported. Analysis of the coherent electron-nuclear interaction through the observed electron spin echo envelope modulation made it possible to detect signals from remote nitrogen and boron nuclei, and to establish a corresponding quadrupole coupling constant C (q) = 180 kHz related to nuclear quadrupole moment of N-14. These results have fundamental importance for understanding the spin properties of boron vacancy.

TI Quantum Cooperative Multicast in a Quantum Hybrid Topology Network
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum multicast is a significant transmission mode in a multiparty communication scenario. Multisource collaboration can further enhance the efficient multicast. However, it remains a challenge to realize quantum multicast with a cooperative way in a complex topology network. In this article, we propose a scheme of quantum cooperative multicast in a hybrid topology network. It provides information aggregation and simultaneous multipoint transmission services. First, collaborative information aggregation allows central network data to be integrated into the aggregation node. By exploiting the quantum multicast mode, the aggregation node can simultaneously deliver integrated quantum states to multiple targets. Second, our scheme is feasible for dynamic network expansion. It is capable of extending the network architecture iteratively, while the peer network requests can be handled in parallel. Finally, the new scheme shows great application potential in the distributed quantum network. It is a promising candidate for the implementation of quantum data disaster backup in future.

TI Spectral multiplexing of telecom emitters with stable transition
   frequency
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB In a quantum network, coherent emitters can be entangled over large distances using photonic channels. In solid-state devices, the required efficient light-emitter interface can be implemented by confining the light in nano-photonic structures. However, fluctuating charges and magnetic moments at the nearby interface then lead to spectral instability of the emitters. Here, we avoid this limitation when enhancing the photon emission up to 70(12)-fold using a Fabry-Perot resonator with an embedded 19-micrometer-thin crystalline membrane, in which we observe around 100 individual erbium emitters. In long-term measurements, they exhibit an exceptional spec-tral stability of <0.2 megahertz that is limited by the coupling to surrounding nuclear spins. We further implement spectrally multiplexed coherent control and find an optical coherence time of 0.11(1) milliseconds, approaching the lifetime limit of 0.3 milliseconds for the strongest-coupled emitters. Our results constitute an important step toward frequency-multiplexed quantum-network nodes operating directly at a telecommunication wavelength.

TI Radio-frequency single electron transistors in physically defined
   silicon quantum dots with a sensitive phase response
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Radio-frequency reflectometry techniques are instrumental for spin qubit readout in semiconductor quantum dots. However, a large phase response is difficult to achieve in practice. In this work, we report radio-frequency single electron transistors using physically defined quantum dots in silicon-on-insulator. We study quantum dots which do not have the top gate structure considered to hinder radio frequency reflectometry measurements using physically defined quantum dots. Based on the model which properly takes into account the parasitic components, we precisely determine the gate-dependent device admittance. Clear Coulomb peaks are observed in the amplitude and the phase of the reflection coefficient, with a remarkably large phase signal of similar to 45 degrees. Electrical circuit analysis indicates that it can be attributed to a good impedance matching and a detuning from the resonance frequency. We anticipate that our results will be useful in designing and simulating reflectometry circuits to optimize qubit readout sensitivity and speed.

TI Generation of a Maximally Entangled State Using Collective Optical
   Pumping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose and implement a novel scheme for dissipatively pumping two qubits into a singlet Bell state. The method relies on a process of collective optical pumping to an excited level, to which all states apart from the singlet are coupled. We apply the method to deterministically entangle two trapped Ca-40(+) ions. Within 16 pumping cycles, an initially separable state is transformed into one with 83(1)% singlet fidelity, and states with initial fidelity of >= 70% converge onto a fidelity of 93(1)%. We theoretically analyze the performance and error susceptibility of the scheme and find it to be insensitive to a large class of experimentally relevant noise sources.

TI Edge Modes and Symmetry-Protected Topological States in Open Quantum
   Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Topological order offers possibilities for processing quantum information that can be immune to imperfections. However, the question of its stability out of equilibrium is relevant for experiments, where coupling to an environment is unavoidable. In this work, we demonstrate the robustness of certain aspects of Z2 x Z2 symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order against a wide class of dissipation channels in the Lindblad and quantum trajectory formalisms of an open quantum system. This is illustrated using the one-dimensional ZXZ cluster Hamiltonian along with Pauli-string jump operators. We show that certain choices of dissipation retaining strong symmetries supporta steady-state manifold consisting of two nonlocal logical qubits and for Hamiltonian perturbations preserving the global symmetry, states in this manifold remain metastable. In contrast, this metastability is destroyed upon breaking the above-mentioned symmetry. While the localized edge qubits of the cluster Hamiltonian are not conserved by the Lindbladian evolution, they do correspond to weak symmetries and thus retain a memory of their initial state at all times in the quantum trajectories. We utilize this feature to construct protocols to retrieve the quantum information either by monitoring jumps or error mitigation. Our work thus proposes a novel framework to study the dynamics of dissipative SPT phases and opens up the possibility of engineering entangled states relevant to quantum information processing.

AB Entanglement-based quantum sensors have much better sensitivity than corresponding classical sensors in a noisy and lossy regime. In our recent paper, we showed that the entanglement-assisted (EA) joint monostatic-bistatic quantum radar performs much better than conventional radars. Here, we propose an entanglement-assisted (EA) multistatic radar that significantly outperforms EA bistatic, coherent state-based quantum, and classical radars. The proposed EA multistatic radar employs multiple entangled transmitters performing transmit-side optical phase conjugation, multiple coherent detection-based receivers serving as EA detectors, and a joint detector.

TI Phase diagram of the three-dimensional subsystem toric code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Subsystem quantum error-correcting codes typically involve measuring a sequence of noncommuting parity check operators. They can sometimes exhibit greater fault tolerance than conventional subspace codes, which use commuting checks. However, unlike subspace codes, it is unclear if subsystem codes-in particular their advantages-can be understood in terms of ground-state properties of a physical Hamiltonian. In this paper, we address this question for the three-dimensional subsystem toric code (3D STC), as recently constructed by Kubica and Vasmer [Nat. Commun. 13, 6272 (2022)], which exhibits single-shot error correction. Motivated by a conjectured relation between single-shot properties and thermal stability, we study the zero- and finitetemperature phases of an associated noncommuting Hamiltonian. By mapping the Hamiltonian model to a pair of 3D Z(2) gauge theories coupled by a kinetic constraint, we find various phases at zero temperature, all separated by first-order transitions: There are 3D toric code-like phases with deconfined point-like excitations in the bulk, and there are phases with a confined bulk supporting a 2D toric code on the surface when appropriate boundary conditions are chosen. The latter is similar to the surface topological order present in 3D STC. However, the similarities between the single-shot correction in 3D STC and the confined phases are only partial: they share the same sets of degrees of freedom, but they are governed by different dynamical rules. Instead, we argue that the process of single-shot error correction can more suitably be associated with a path (rather than a point) in the zero-temperature phase diagram, a perspective, which inspires alternative measurement sequences enabling single-shot error correction. Moreover, since none of the above-mentioned phases survives at nonzero temperature, the single-shot error-correction property of the code does not imply thermal stability of the associated Hamiltonian phase.

TI Four-Order Power Reduction in Nanoscale Electron-Nuclear Double
   Resonance with a Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamonds
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Detecting nuclear spins using single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is of particular importance in nanoscale science and engineering but often suffers from the heating effect of microwave fields for spin manipulation, especially under high magnetic fields. Here, we realize an energy-efficient nanoscale nuclear-spin detection using a phase-modulation electron-nuclear double resonance scheme. The microwave field can be reduced to 1/250 of the previous requirements, and the corresponding power is over four orders lower. Meanwhile, the microwave-induced broadening to the line-width of the spectroscopy is significantly canceled, and we achieve a nuclear-spin spectrum with a resolution down to 2.1 kHz under a magnetic field at 1840 Gs. The spectral resolution can be further improved by upgrading the experimental control precision. This scheme can also be used in sensing microwave fields and can be extended to a wide range of applications in the future.

TI Quantum speed limits of quantum system in colored environments
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we investigate quantum speed limits (QSLs) of a two -level system in the colored environments which are described by stochastic processes. We present QSL can be affected by the correlation time, the partitions of the constituent elements of the two -level system in different colored environments: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environment, simple fluctuating bottleneck environment, and the Dichotomic (two -state) environment. The investigations provide us a potential way to manipulate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) of the quantum system in the colored environments. Our results could provide different insights on quantum control technologies of QSL and decoherent dynamics for the quantum computation.

TI Criticality of quantum energy teleportation at phase transition points
   in quantum field theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum field theory can be a new medium for communication through quantum energy teleportation. We perform a demonstration of quantum energy teleportation with a relativistic fermionic field theory of self-coupled fermions, called the massive Thirring model. Our results reveal that there is a close relationship between the amount of energy teleported and the phase diagram of the theory. In particular, we show that the teleported energy peaks near the phase transition points. Since these results are obtained by measuring the two local subsystems, the noise from the quantum computation can be considerably reduced, allowing for efficient quantum simulations. Moreover, it is a new entanglement-based method that reveals global structure through local measurements.

TI Universal witnesses of vanishing energy gap
SO EPL
AB Energy gap, the difference between the energy of the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian and the energy of its first excited state, is a parameter of a critical importance in analysis of phase transitions and adiabatic quantum computation. We present a concrete technique to determine an upper bound for the energy gap of a Hamiltonian H-0 based on properties of the set of expectation values of H-0 and an additional auxiliary Hamiltonian V. This formalism can be applied to obtain an effective criterion of gaplessness, which we illustrate with a concrete example of the XY model -a physical system with vanishing energy gap.

TI Minor embedding in broken chimera and derived graphs is NP-complete
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The embedding is an essential step when calculating on the D-Wave machine. In this work, we show the hardness of the embedding problem for all types of currently existing hardware, represented by the Chimera and the derived Pegasus and Zephyr graphs, containing unavailable qubits. We construct certain broken Chimera graphs, where it is hard to find a Hamiltonian cycle. As the Hamiltonian cycle problem is a special case of the embedding problem, this proves the general complexity result for the Chimera graphs. By exploiting the subgraph relation between the Chimera and the derived graphs, the proof is then further extended to the Pegasus graphs and to the Zephyr graphs.

This problem is known to be useful for mobility-on-demand (MoD) platforms because drivers' choice behaviors are appropriately modeled, but solving the problem is still under development, although heuristic solvers have been proposed. We develop new branch-and-bound-based (BnB) solvers and a new heuristic solver based on a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Our numerical experiments show that the QUBO-based solver indeed works within the limit of available bits, and the BnB solver performs slightly better than existing heuristic ones.

TI Realization of a Coherent and Efficient One-Dimensional Atom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A quantum emitter interacting with photons in a single optical-mode constitutes a one-dimensional atom. A coherent and efficiently coupled one-dimensional atom provides a large nonlinearity, enabling photonic quantum gates. Achieving a high coupling efficiency (/3 factor) and low dephasing is challenging. Here, we use a semiconductor quantum dot in an open microcavity as an implementation of a onedimensional atom. With a weak laser input, we achieve an extinction of 99.2% in transmission and a concomitant bunching in the photon statistics of g(2)(0) = 587, showcasing the reflection of the singlephoton component and the transmission of the multi-photon components of the coherent input. The tunable nature of the microcavity allows /3 to be adjusted and gives control over the photon statistics-from strong bunching to antibunching-and the phase of the transmitted photons. We obtain excellent agreement between experiment and theory by going beyond the single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results pave the way towards the creation of exotic photonic states and two-photon phase gates.

TI Identity Test of Single NV- Centers in Diamond at
   Hz-Precision Level
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Atomiclike defects in solids are not considered to be identical owing to the imperfections of host lattice. Here, we found that even under ambient conditions, negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond could still manifest identical at Hz-precision level, corresponding to a 10(-7)-level relative precision, while the lattice strain can destroy the identity by tens of Hz. All parameters involved in the NV- - N-14 Hamiltonian are determined by formulating six nuclear frequencies at 10-mHz-level precision and measuring them at Hz-level precision. The most precisely measured parameter, the N-14 quadrupole coupling P, is given by -494 575 4.9(8) Hz, whose precision is improved by nearly 4 orders of magnitude compared with previous measurements. We offer an approach for performing precision measurements in solids and deepening our understandings of NV centers as well as other solid-state defects. Besides, these high-precision results imply a potential application of a robust and integrated atomiclike clock based on ensemble NV centers.

TI Secure Image Communication Using Galois Field, Hyper 3D Logistic Map,
   and B92 Quantum Protocol
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB In this paper, we propose a novel secure image communication system that integrates quantum key distribution and hyperchaotic encryption techniques to ensure enhanced security for both key distribution and plaintext encryption. Specifically, we leverage the B92 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol to secure the distribution of encryption keys, which are further processed through Galois Field (GF(28)) operations for increased security. The encrypted plaintext is secured using a newly developed Hyper 3D Logistic Map (H3LM), a chaotic system that generates complex and unpredictable sequences, thereby ensuring strong confusion and diffusion in the encryption process. This hybrid approach offers a robust defense against quantum and classical cryptographic attacks, combining the advantages of quantum-level key distribution with the unpredictability of hyperchaos-based encryption. The proposed method demonstrates high sensitivity to key changes and resilience to noise, compression, and cropping attacks, ensuring both secure key transmission and robust image encryption.

TI Virtual-Z Gates and Symmetric Gate Compilation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The virtual-Z (vz) gate has been established as an important tool for performing quantum gates on various platforms, including but not limited to superconducting systems. Many such platforms offer a limited set of calibrated gates and compile all other gates using combinations of X-type and vz gates. Here, we show that the method of compilation has important consequences in an open quantum system setting. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate that it is crucial to choose a compilation that is symmetric with respect to vz rotations. An important example is dynamical-decoupling (DD) sequences, where improper gate decomposition can result in unintended effects such as the implementation of the wrong sequence. Our findings indicate that in many cases the performance of DD is adversely affected by the incorrect use of vz gates, compounding other coherent pulse errors. This holds even for DD sequences designed to be robust against systematic control errors. In addition, we identify another source of coherent errors: interference between consecutive pulses that follow each other too closely. This work provides insights into improving general quantum gate performance and optimizing DD sequences in particular.

TI Probing defect densities at the edges and inside Josephson junctions of
   superconducting qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Tunneling defects in disordered materials form spurious two-level systems which are a major source of decoherence for micro-fabricated quantum devices. For superconducting qubits, defects in tunnel barriers of submicrometer-sized Josephson junctions couple strongest to the qubit, which necessitates optimization of the junction fabrication to mitigate defect formation. Here, we investigate whether defects appear predominantly at the edges or deep within the amorphous tunnel barrier of a junction. For this, we compare defect densities in differently shaped Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junctions that are part of a Transmon qubit. We observe that the number of detectable junction-defects is proportional to the junction area, and does not significantly scale with the junction's circumference, which proposes that defects are evenly distributed inside the tunnel barrier. Moreover, we find very similar defect densities in thermally grown tunnel barriers that were formed either directly after the base electrode was deposited, or in a separate deposition step after removal of native oxide by Argon ion milling.

TI Imaging AC magnetization response of soft magnetic thin films using
   diamond quantum sensors
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The energy loss in inductor core is a significant limitation in high-frequency power electronics. For evaluating and optimizing soft magnets, simultaneous imaging of both amplitude and phase of AC stray fields beyond 10 kHz is crucial. Here, we develop an imaging technique for analyzing AC magnetization response using diamond quantum sensors. For frequencies up to 200 kHz, we propose a measurement protocol, Qubit Frequency Track (Qurack), where microwave frequency modulation tracks qubit frequency oscillations. For higher frequencies above MHz, quantum heterodyne (Qdyne) imaging is employed. The soft magnetic CoFeB-SiO2 thin films, developed for high-frequency inductors, exhibit near-zero phase delay up to 2.3 MHz, indicating negligible energy loss. Moreover, the energy loss depends on the anisotropy: when the magnetization is driven along the easy axis, phase delay increases with frequency, signifying higher energy dissipation. These results suggest potential applications in analyzing soft magnets and improving the performance of power electronics.

TI Positive- and negative-frequency noise from an ensemble of two-level
   fluctuators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The analysis of charge noise based on the Bloch-Redfield treatment of an ensemble of dissipative two-level fluctuators generally results in a violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The standard Markov approximation (when applied to the two-level fluctuators coupled to a bath) can be identified as the main origin of this failure. The resulting decoherence rates only involve the bath response at the fluctuator frequency, and thus completely neglect the effects of frequency broadening. A systematic and computationally convenient way to overcome this issue is to employ the spectator-qubit method: by coupling an auxiliary qubit to the two-level fluctuator ensemble, an analytical approximation for S(omega) fully consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be obtained. We discuss the resulting characteristics of the noise which exhibits distinct behavior over several frequency ranges, including a 1/f to 1/f (2) crossover with a T-3 temperature dependence of the crossover frequency.

TI Extracting randomness from magic quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Magic quantum states (nonstabilizer states) play a pivotal role in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Simultaneously, random resources have emerged as a key element in various randomized techniques within contemporary quantum science. In this study, we establish a direct connection between these two notions. More specifically, our research demonstrates that when a subsystem of a quantum state is measured, the resultant unmeasured part of the system can exhibit a high degree of randomness that can be enhanced by the inherent correlations of the underlying magic quantum state. Our findings suggest an approach to quantifying correlations within magic quantum states beyond the conventional paradigm of entanglement, and introduce an efficient approach for leveraging such correlations to generate random quantum resources.

These gates can be subject to application-specific errors, leading to a dependence of their controls on the chosen circuit, the quality measure and the gate-set itself. A natural solution would be to apply quantum optimal control in an application-oriented fashion. In turn, this requires the definition of a meaningful measure of the contextual gate-set performance. Therefore, we explore and compare the applicability of quantum process tomography, linear inversion gate-set tomography, randomized linear gate-set tomography, and randomized benchmarking as measures for closed-loop quantum optimal control experiments, using a macroscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a test-bed. Our work demonstrates the relative trade-offs between those measures and how to significantly enhance the gate-set performance, leading to an improvement across all investigated methods.

TI Entanglement dynamics and ergodicity breaking in a quantum cellular
   automaton
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Ergodicity breaking is observed in the blockade regime of Rydberg atom arrays, in the form of low entanglement eigenstates known as scars, which fail to thermalize. The signature of these states persists in periodically driven systems, where they coexist with an extensive number of chaotic states. Here we investigate a quantum cellular automaton based on the classical rule that updates a site if its two neighbors are in the lower state. We show that the breaking of ergodicity extends to chaotic states. The dynamical breaking of ergodicity is controlled by chiral quasiparticle excitations which propagate entanglement. Evidence of nonlocal entanglement is found, showing that these nonthermal chaotic states may be useful to quantum computation.

TI Engineered platforms for topological superconductivity and Majorana zero
   modes
SO NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS
AB Topological qubits are attractive because of the potential to store quantum information in a topologically protected manner; however, they are challenging to realize. This Review surveys the recent attempts to realize topological qubits out of materials systems that combine superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field, and surveys both theoretical ideas and experimental results.
   Among the major avenues that are being pursued for realizing quantum bits, the Majorana-based approach has been the most recent to be launched. It attempts to realize qubits that store quantum information in a topologically protected manner. The quantum information is protected by non-local storage in localized and well-separated Majorana zero modes, and manipulated by exploiting their non-abelian quantum statistics. Realizing these topological qubits is experimentally challenging, requiring superconductivity, helical electrons (created by spin-orbit coupling) and breaking of time-reversal symmetry to all cooperate in an uncomfortable alliance. Over the past decade, several candidate materials systems for realizing Majorana-based topological qubits have been explored, and there is accumulating, though still debated, evidence that zero modes are indeed being realized. This Review surveys the basic physical principles on which these approaches are based, the materials systems that are being developed and the current state of the field. We highlight both the progress that has been made and the challenges that still need to be overcome.

TI Implementation of all-optical Toffoli gate by 2D Si-air photonic crystal
SO IET OPTOELECTRONICS
AB The quantum Toffoli gate is one of the essential reversible universal logic gates widely used for optical data processing. Herein, a new scheme of developing all-optical Toffoli gate using a two-dimensional silicon-air photonic crystal is proposed. For the realization of the Toffoli gate, the principles of constructive and destructive interference of light are used. The Toffoli gate comprises two-input-three-output-based optical AND gate, and a two-input-one-output optical XOR gate. Two Y junction power splitters have been used at the two inputs of the AND gate. The operating wavelength of the proposed Toffoli gate is 1550 nm along with the wafer size of 50 mu m x 50 mu m. The performance of the Toffoli gate has been analysed and simulated by the plane-wave expansion method and finite-difference time-domain method. The response time and contrast ratios are also obtained from the simulation. The proposed Toffoli gate is intensity encoded with no non-linear material within the crystal which shows significant improvement over other proposals.

TI Fermi Arcs Dominating the Electronic Surface Properties of Trigonal
   PtBi2
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Materials combining topologically non-trivial behavior and superconductivity offer a potential route for quantum computation. However, the set of available materials intrinsically realizing these properties are scarce. Recently, surface superconductivity has been reported in PtBi2 in its trigonal phase and an inherent Weyl semimetal phase has been predicted. Here, based on scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, the signature of topological Fermi arcs are revealed in the normal state patterns of the quasiparticle interference. It is shown that the scattering between Fermi arcs dominates the interference spectra, providing conclusive evidence for the relevance of Weyl fermiology for the surface electronic properties of trigonal PtBi2.

TI Enabling Resilient Quantum-Secured Microgrids Through Software-Defined
   Networking
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has been considered a potent and mature approach to secure communication in the quantum era. However, there exist resilience gaps that hinder the practical usefulness of QKD. This article improves the resilience of a QKD-based microgrid by leveraging software-defined networking (SDN). Specifically, the following contributions have been made. First, a novel QKD- and SDN-based communication framework is devised for microgrids. Second, an enhanced QKD simulator is developed, which can simulate both the number of generated keys and the amount of classical data required, providing a more accurate QKD study in microgrids. Third, an SDN-based resilience enhancement strategy, which incorporates three practical SDN applications, is developed to improve the system's resilience. Finally, a QKD- and SDN-enabled cyberphysical microgrid prototype is built in an RTDS environment using real whitebox SDN switches. Extensive case studies validate the effectiveness and excellent performance of SDN to improve the resilience of QKD-based microgrids in various situations.

TI Geometrically robust linear optics from non-Abelian geometric phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We construct a unified operator framework for quantum holonomies generated from bosonic systems. For a system whose Hamiltonian is bilinear in the creation and annihilation operators, we find a holonomy group determined only by a set of selected orthonormal modes obeying a stronger version of the adiabatic theorem. This photon-number independent description offers deeper insight as well as a computational advantage when compared to the standard formalism on geometric phases. In particular, a strong analogy between quantum holonomies and linear optical networks can be drawn. This relation provides an explicit recipe of how any linear optical quantum computation can be made geometrically robust in terms of adiabatic or nonadiabatic geometric phases.

TI Cosmic coding and transfer for ultra high security near-field
   communications
SO ISCIENCE
AB By using true random number (TRN) generators, encoding with the highest secu-rity can be realized. However, a completely secure strategy to transfer these TRNs has not yet been devised. Quantum key distribution (QKD) has attempted to establish secure key distribution methodology of this kind; however, several quantum cracking strategies have been predicted and experimentally demon-strated. In this work, COSMOCAT was invented as a solution for next-generation ultrahigh security near-field communications. With COSMOCAT, TRNs are gener-ated from naturally occurring and ubiquitous cosmic-ray muons and the gener-ated cosmic keys are distributed by these muons with an unprecedented level of security. The successful results of this experiment indicate that our prototype and the new key-generation-and-distribution standard can be utilized for prac-tical encoding and near-field data transfer at rates of 10-100 Mbps. It is antici-pated that COSMOCAT will be one of key techniques for future high security, near-field communication management.

TI 2.5 GHz Gated InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diode with 44 ps Time
   Jitter
SO ADVANCED DEVICES & INSTRUMENTATION
AB Gated single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are practical solutions for quantum key distribution (QKD) applications. However, the gating frequency is limited by time jitter and afterpulse probability when SPADs operate at a frequency higher than 2 GHz. We find that filter distortion and variation of signal amplitude are the dominant mechanisms for time jitter in high-frequency scenarios, and design a specific low-pass filter (LPF) and a zero crossing discriminator to reduce the time jitter effectively. Specifically, the LPF extracts avalanche signals and forms accurate zero crossing points by its impulse response, and the zero crossing discriminator correctly discriminates avalanche signals to achieve low time jitter. When the SPAD is operated at a gating frequency of 2.5 GHz with a detection efficiency of 21%, the time jitter and afterpulse probability are 44 ps and 1.4%, respectively. Our results pave the way to practical QKD systems at higher clock rates.

TI Quantitative Investigation of Quantum Emitter Yield in Drop-Casted
   Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoflakes
SO ACS APPLIED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Single photon emitters (SPEs) are a key component for their use as pure photon source in quantum technologies. In this study, we investigate the generation of SPEs from drop-casted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanoflakes, examining the influence of the immersion solution and the source of hBN. We show that, depending on the utilized supplier and solution, the number and quality of the emitters change. We perform a comprehensive optical characterization of the deposited nanoflakes to assess the quality of the generated SPEs. Importantly, we provide quantitative data on SPE yields, highlighting significant variations among solvents and different sources of hBN. We find that hBN from Merck drop-casted in acetone provided the best quality emitters with a g((2)) < 0.1 and photoluminescence intensities above 300 kCounts/s. Their number of SPEs among all photon emitters was also the highest, with about 14%, rendering a total yield of about 1.25% of all drop-casted flakes. These numbers hold particular significance when evaluating drop-casting as a practical method for the generation of SPEs and their deposition and incorporation within existing nanophotonic systems. By choosing appropriate solvents and source materials' quality and yield of SPEs can be significantly increased, showcasing further optimization potential for the development of future quantum applications.

TI Improved coherence in optically defined niobium trilayer-junction qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Niobium offers the benefit of increased operating temperatures and frequencies for Josephson junctions, which are the core component of superconducting devices. However, existing niobium processes are limited by more complicated fabrication methods and higher losses than now-standard aluminum junctions. Combining recent trilayer fabrication advancements, methods to remove lossy dielectrics and modern superconducting qubit design, we revisit niobium trilayer junctions and fabricate all-niobium transmons using only optical lithography. We characterize devices in the microwave domain, measuring coherence times up to 62 mu s and an average qubit quality factor above 105: much closer to state-of-the-art aluminumjunction devices. We find the higher superconducting gap energy also results in reduced quasiparticle sensitivity above 0.16 K, where aluminum-junction performance deteriorates. Our low-loss junction process is readily applied to standard optical-based foundry processes, opening alternative avenues for direct integration and scalability, and paves the way for higher-temperature and higher-frequency quantum devices.

TI Detector-integrated on-chip QKD receiver for GHz clock rates

AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can greatly benefit from photonic integration, which enables implementing low-loss, alignment-free, and scalable photonic circuitry. At the same time, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) are an ideal detector technology for QKD due to their high efficiency, low dark-count rate, and low jitter. We present a QKD receiver chip featuring the full photonic circuitry needed for different time-based protocols, including single-photon detectors. By utilizing waveguide-integrated SNSPDs we achieve low dead times together with low dark-count rates and demonstrate a QKD experiment at 2.6 GHz clock rate, yielding secret-key rates of 2.5 Mbit/s for low channel attenuations of 2.5 dB without detector saturation. Due to the broadband 3D polymer couplers the reciver chip can be operated at a wide wavelength range in the telecom band, thus paving the way for highly parallelized wavelength-division multiplexing implementations.

TI Ultrastrong Tunable Coupler Between Superconducting LC Resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We investigate the ultrastrong tunable coupler for coupling of superconducting resonators. The obtained coupling constant exceeds 1 GHz, and the wide-range tunability is achieved for both antiferromagnetics and ferromagnetics from -1086 to 604 MHz. The ultrastrong coupler is composed of a rf superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and dc SQUID as tunable junctions, which connect to resonators via shared aluminum thin-film meander lines enabling such a huge coupling constant. The spectrum of the coupler obviously shows the breaking of the rotating-wave approximation, and our circuit model treating the Josephson junction as a tunable inductance reproduces the experimental results well. The ultrastrong coupler is expected to be utilized in quantum annealing circuits and/or noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices with dense connections between qubits.

TI High Performance Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors for

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB The forthcoming era of quantum computers can be a threat to the conventional cryptography and data security. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides unconditional security under real-life conditions with several protocols over long distances in fibre and free space communication. Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are becoming a dominant technology for QKD thanks to their unique characteristics, such as a near-unity efficiency in the infrared, low dark counts and picoseconds time resolution. Where the detector is typically a weakness of QKD, these SNSPDs characteristics make exploitation difficult. In this work, we characterized NbN SNSPDs at 2.2 K, using a CW laser source at 1550 nm, varying both bias currents and input photon rates to prove their high efficiency at low dark counts with a high counting rate, consistent with the requirements for QKD over long distances or with a high secure key rate.

TI Globally optimal control of quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems, current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.

AB One major challenge to scaling quantum dot qubits is the dense wiring requirements, making it difficult to envision fabricating large 2D arrays of nearest-neighbor-coupled qubits necessary for error correction. We describe a method to ameliorate this issue by spacing out the qubits using superconducting resonators facilitated by 3D integration. To prove the viability of this approach, we use integration to couple an off-chip high-impedance TiN resonator to a double quantum dot in a Si/SiGe heterostructure. Using the resonator as a dispersive gate sensor, we tune the device down to the single electron regime with an SNR = 5.36. Characterizing the individual systems shows 3D integration can be done while maintaining low-charge noise for the quantum dots and high-quality factors for the superconducting resonator (single photon Q(L) = 2.14 x 10(4) with Q(i) approximate to 3 x 10(5)), necessary for readout and high-fidelity two-qubit gates.

TI Resonant and phonon-assisted ultrafast coherent control of a single hBN
   color center
SO OPTICA
AB Single-photon emitters in solid-state systems are important building blocks for scalable quantum technologies. Recently, quantum light emitters have been discovered in the wide-gap van derWaals insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). These color centers have attracted considerable attention due to their quantum performance at elevated temperatures and wide range of transition energies. Here, we demonstrate coherent state manipulation of a single hBN color center with ultrafast laser pulses and investigate in our joint experiment-theory study the coupling between the electronic system and phonons. We demonstrate that coherent control can be performed not only resonantly on the optical transition giving access to the decoherence but also phonon-assisted, which reveals the internal phonon quantum dynamics. In the case of optical phonons, we measure their decoherence, stemming in part fromtheir anharmonic decay. Dephasing induced by the creation of acoustic phonons manifests as a rapid decrease in the coherent control signal when traveling phonon wave packets are emitted. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quantum superposition between a phonon-assisted process and resonant excitation causes ultrafast oscillations of the coherent control signal. Our results pave the way for ultrafast phonon quantum state control on the nanoscale and open up a new promising perspective for hybrid quantum technologies.

TI Boosting the performance of quantum annealers using machine learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are spearheading the second quantum revolution. Of these, quantum annealers are the only ones currently offering real world, commercial applications on as many as 5000 qubits. The size of problems that can be solved by quantum annealers is limited mainly by errors caused by environmental noise and intrinsic imperfections of the processor. We address the issue of intrinsic imperfections with a novel error correction approach, based on machine learning methods. Our approach adjusts the input Hamiltonian to maximize the probability of finding the solution. In our experiments, the proposed error correction method improved the performance of annealing by up to three orders of magnitude and enabled the solving of a previously intractable, maximally complex problem.

TI Mode Coupling in Electromechanical Systems: Recent Advances and
   Applications
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Mode interactions have recently become the focus of intense research in micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (M/NEMS) due to their ability to improve device performance and explore the frontiers of fundamental physics. Understanding and controlling coupling between vibrational modes are critical for the development of advanced M/NEMS devices. This review summarizes the recent advances in studies of coupling between multiple modes in M/NEMS resonators, focusing especially on experimental developments and practical applications. First, depending on spatial distribution of interacting modes, this review divides the coupled mechanism in three types: intermode, near-neighbor, and long-range coupling. Then, several fundamental physics approaches based on mechanical-mode coupling, including linear and nonlinear coupling, modal localization, synchronization, and phonon manipulation are reviewed. This review also introduces sensing applications by using coupled mechanical modes. Finally, the state-of-the-art open questions and challenges are reviewed.

TI Tunable terahertz source on a chip with decade-long stability using
   layered-superconductor elliptical microcavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Chip-scale, electrically tunable, continuous-wave, coherent terahertz (THz) radiation sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communications, space, and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered hightemperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K (with Tc approximate to 90 K), delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across an approximately 0.5-m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to approximately 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over the air. These results demonstrate, for the first time, sustained and electrically tunable coherent THz emission from superconductors over multiyear timescales, defining another class of robust, chip-integrated THz lasers with applications in scalable THz and quantum technologies.

TI Direct Electrical Access to the Spin Manifolds of Individual Lanthanide
   Atoms
SO ACS NANO
AB Lanthanide atoms show long magnetic lifetimes because of their strongly localized 4f electrons, but electrical control of their spins has been difficult because of their closed valence shell configurations. We achieved electron spin resonance of individual lanthanide atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope to probe the atoms bound to a protective insulating film. The atoms on this surface formed a singly charged cation state having an unpaired 6s electron, enabling tunnel current to access their 4f electrons. Europium spectra display a rich array of transitions among the 54 combined electron and nuclear spin states. In contrast, samarium's ground state is a Kramers doublet with a very large g-factor of 5. These results demonstrate that all-electronic sensing and control of individual lanthanide spins is possible for quantum devices and spin-based electronics by using their rarely observed monovalent cation state.

TI Amplifying asymmetry with correlating catalysts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the fundamental constraint on amplifying the asymmetry in quantum states with correlating catalysts. Here a correlating catalyst is a finite-dimensional auxiliary, which exactly preserves its reduced state while allowed to become correlated with the quantum system. Interestingly, we prove that under translationally invariant operations, uncorrelating catalysts in pure states are useless in any state transformation, while with a correlating catalyst, one can extend the set of accessible states from an initially asymmetric state. Moreover, we show that the power of a catalyst increases with its dimension, and further, with a large enough catalyst, a qubit state with an arbitrarily small amount of asymmetry can be converted to any mixed qubit state. In doing so, we build a bridge between two important results concerning the restrictions on coherence conversion, the no-broadcasting theorem and the catalytic coherence. Our results may also apply to the constraints on coherence evolution in quantum thermodynamics and to the distribution of timing information between quantum clocks.

TI Large-Scale Statistical Analysis of Defect Emission in hBN: Revealing
   Spectral Families and Influence of Flake Morphology
SO ACS NANO
AB Quantum emitters in two-dimensional layered hexagonal boron nitride are quickly emerging as a highly promising platform for next-generation quantum technologies. However, the precise identification and control of defects are key parameters to achieve the next step in their development. We conducted a comprehensive study by analyzing over 10,000 photoluminescence emission lines from liquid exfoliated hBN nanoflake samples, revealing 11 narrow sets of defect families within the 1.6 to 2.2 eV energy range. This challenges hypotheses of a random energy distribution. We also reported averaged defect parameters, including emission line widths, spatial density, phonon side bands, and Franck-Condon-related factors. These findings provide valuable insights into deciphering the microscopic origin of emitters in hBN hosts. We also explored the influence of the hBN host morphology on defect family formation, demonstrating its crucial impact. By tuning the flake size and arrangement, we achieve selective control of defect types while maintaining high spatial density. This offers a scalable approach to defect emission control, diverging from costly engineering methods. It emphasizes the significance of the morphological aspects of hBN hosts for gaining insights into defect origins and expanding their spectral control.

TI Contributions to the optical linewidth of shallow donor-bound excitonic
   transition in ZnO
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Neutral shallow donors in zinc oxide (ZnO) are spin qubits with optical access via the donor-bound exciton. This spin-photon interface enables applications in quantum networking, memories, and transduction. Essential optical parameters which impact the spin-photon interface include radiative lifetime, optical inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidth, and optical depth. We study the donor-bound exciton optical linewidth properties of Al, Ga, and In donors in single-crystal ZnO. The ensemble photoluminescence linewidth ranges from 4 to 11 GHz, less than two orders of magnitude larger than the expected lifetime-limited linewidth. The ensemble linewidth remains narrow in absorption through samples with an estimated optical depth up to several hundred. The primary thermal relaxation mechanism is identified and found to have a negligible contribution to the total linewidth at 2 K. We find that inhomogeneous broadening due to the disordered isotopic environment in natural ZnO is significant, contributing 2 GHz. Two-laser spectral hole burning measurements indicate that the dominant mechanism, however, is homogeneous. Despite this broadening, the high homogeneity, large optical depth, and potential for isotope purification indicate that the optical properties of the ZnO donor-bound exciton are promising for a wide range of quantum technologies, and motivate a need to improve the isotope and chemical purity of ZnO for quantum technologies.

TI Parametric-interaction-induced avoided dressed-state crossings in cavity
   QED: Generation of quantum coherence and equally weighted superposition
   of Fock states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a paradigm in the field of cavity QED by bringing out remarkable features associated with the avoided crossing of the dressed-state levels of the Jaynes-Cummings model. We demonstrate how the parametric couplings, realized by a second order nonlinearity in the cavity, can turn the crossing of dressed states into avoided crossings. We show how one can generate coherence between the avoided crossing of dressed states. Such coherences result, for example, in quantum beats in the excitation probability of the qubit. The quality of quantum beats can be considerably improved by adiabatically turning on the parametric interaction. We show how these avoided crossings can be used to generate superpositions of even or odd Fock states with the remarkable property of equal weights for the states in superposition. The fidelity of generation is more than 95%. In addition, we show strong entanglement between the cavity field and the qubit with the concurrence parameter exceeding 90%.

TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Simulations of Chemistry in First Quantization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulations of chemistry in first quantization offer some important advantages over approaches in second quantization including faster convergence to the continuum limit and the opportunity for practical simulations outside of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. However, since all prior work on quantum simulation of chemistry in first quantization has been limited to asymptotic analysis, it has been impossible to directly compare the resources required for these approaches to those required for the more commonly studied algorithms in second quantization. Here, we compile, optimize, and analyze the finite resources required to implement two first quantized quantum algorithms for chemistry from Babbush et al. [Npj Quantum Inf. 5, 92 (2019)] that realize block encodings for the qubitization and interaction-picture frameworks of Low et al. [Quantum 3, 163 (2019), arXiv:1805.00675 (2018)]. The two algorithms we study enable simulation with gate complexities of (O) over tilde(eta(8)/(3)N(1/3)t +eta(4)/(3)N(2/3)t) and (O) over tilde(eta(8/3)N(1/3)t) where. is the number of electrons, N is the number of plane-wave basis functions, and t is the duration of time evolution (t is linearly inverse to target precision when the goal is to estimate energies). In addition to providing the first explicit circuits and constant factors for any first quantized simulation, and then introducing improvements, which reduce circuit complexity by about a thousandfold over naive implementations for modest sized systems, we also describe new algorithms that asymptotically achieve the same scaling in a real-space representation. Finally, we assess the resources required to simulate various molecules and materials and conclude that the qubitized algorithm will often be more practical than the interaction-picture algorithm. We demonstrate that our qubitization algorithm often requires much less surface-code space-time volume for simulating millions of plane waves than the best second quantized algorithms require for simulating hundreds of Gaussian orbitals.

TI Probing the spectrum of the Jaynes-Cummings-Rabi model by its
   isomorphism to an atom inside a parametric amplifier cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show how the Jaynes-Cummings-Rabi model of cavity quantum electrodynamics can be realized via an isomorphism to the Hamiltonian of a qubit inside a parametric amplifier cavity. This realization clears the way to observe the full spectrum of the Rabi model via a probe applied to a parametric amplifier cavity containing a qubit and a parametric oscillator operating below threshold. An important outcome of the isomorphism is that the actual frequencies are replaced by detunings which make it feasible to reach the ultrastrong coupling regime. We find that inside this regime the probed spectrum displays a narrow resonance peak that is traced back to the transition between ground and first excited states. The exact form of these states is given at an energy crossing and then extended numerically. At the crossing, the eigenstates are entangled states of field and atom where the field is found inside squeezed cat states.

TI Advantages and Limitations of Quantum Routing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The SWAP gate is a ubiquitous tool for moving information on quantum hardware, yet it can be considered a classical operation because it does not entangle product states. Genuinely quantum operations could outperform SWAP for the task of permuting qubits within an architecture, which we call routing. We consider quantum routing in two models: (i) allowing arbitrary two-qubit unitaries, or (ii) allowing Hamiltonians with norm-bounded interactions. We lower bound the circuit depth or time of quantum routing in terms of spectral properties of graphs representing the architecture interaction constraints, and give a generalized upper bound for all simple connected n-vertex graphs. In particular, we give conditions for a superpolynomial classical-quantum routing separation, which exclude graphs with a small spectral gap and graphs of bounded degree. Finally, we provide examples of a quadratic separation between gate-based and Hamiltonian routing models with a constant number of local ancillas per qubit and of an O (n) speedup if we also allow fast local interactions.

TI Fast Logic with Slow Qubits: Microwave-Activated Controlled-Z Gate on
   Low-Frequency Fluxoniums
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We demonstrate a controlled-Z gate between capacitively coupled fluxonium qubits with transition frequencies 72.3 and 136.3 MHz. The gate is activated by a 61.6-ns-long pulse at a frequency between noncomputational transitions vertical bar 10 > - vertical bar 20 > and vertical bar 11 > - vertical bar 21 >, during which the qubits complete only four and eight Larmor periods, respectively. The measured gate error of (8 +/- 1) x 10(-3) is limited by decoherence in the noncomputational subspace, which will likely improve in the next-generation devices. Although our qubits are about 50 times slower than transmons, the two-qubit gate is faster than microwave-activated gates on transmons, and the gate error is on par with the lowest reported. Architectural advantages of lowfrequency fluxoniums include long qubit coherence time, weak hybridization in the computational subspace, suppressed residual ZZ-coupling rate (here 46 kHz), and the absence of either excessive parameter-matching or complex pulse-shaping requirements.

TI Single-photon detection using high-temperature superconductors
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Superconducting single-photon detectors are critical for quantum communication, fluorescence lifetime imaging and remote sensing, but commonly operate at very low temperatures. Now, high-temperature cuprate superconducting nanowires enable single-photon detection up to 25 K.
   The detection of individual quanta of light is important for quantum communication, fluorescence lifetime imaging, remote sensing and more. Due to their high detection efficiency, exceptional signal-to-noise ratio and fast recovery times, superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have become a critical component in these applications. However, the operation of conventional SNSPDs requires costly cryocoolers. Here we report the fabrication of two types of high-temperature superconducting nanowires. We observe linear scaling of the photon count rate on the radiation power at the telecommunications wavelength of 1.5 mu m and thereby reveal single-photon operation. SNSPDs made from thin flakes of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta exhibit a single-photon response up to 25 K, and for SNSPDs from La1.55Sr0.45CuO4/La2CuO4 bilayer films, this response is observed up to 8 K. While the underlying detection mechanism is not fully understood yet, our work expands the family of materials for SNSPD technology beyond the liquid helium temperature limit and suggests that even higher operation temperatures may be reached using other high-temperature superconductors.

TI Non-Volatile Photo-Switch Using a Diamond pn Junction
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Ultrawide bandgap semiconductor technologies offer potentially revolutionary advances in the rapidly developing areas of quantum communication, short wavelength optics, smart energy conversion, and biomedical interfaces. These strongly demanding technologies can be partly constructed using conventional devices but new hybrid architectures are needed to overpass current performances and add functionalities. Here, a new concept based on the specific properties of a diamond pn junction combined with both an electric and optical control of the depletion region is proposed. Using this junction as a gate in a junction field effect transistor, a proof of concept of a non-volatile diamond photo-switch is reported. A diamond pn junction made with nitrogen deep donors in the n-side is demonstrated to be optically activated thanks to visible light. The n-type diamond gate is almost devoid of free carriers in the dark and thus insulating. Illuminating the device renders the standard electrical gate control of the transistor efficient. Without illumination, the device is frozen, keeping a permanent memory of the current state. This new way of operating the device opens numerous possibilities to store and transfer information or energy with applications in the field of electrical aircraft or aerospace electronics, power electronics, bio-electronics, and quantum communication.

TI Nonlocal subpicosecond delay metrology using spectral quantum
   interference
SO OPTICA
AB Precise knowledge of position and timing information is critical to support elementary protocols such as entanglement swapping on quantum networks. While approaches have been devised to use quantum light for such metrology, they largely rely on time-of-flight (ToF) measurements with single-photon detectors and, therefore, are limited to picosecond-scale resolution owing to detector jitter. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to distributed sensing that leverages phase modulation to map changes in the spectral phase to coincidence probability, thereby overcoming the limits imposed by single-photon detection. By extracting information about the joint biphoton phase, we measure a generalized delay-the difference in signal-idler arrival, relative to local radio frequency (RF) phase modulation. For nonlocal ranging measurements, we achieve (2 sigma) precision of +/- 0.04 ps and for measurements of the relative RF phase, (2 sigma) precision of +/- 0.7 degrees. We complement this fine timing information with ToF data from single-photon time-tagging to demonstrate absolute measurement of time delay. By relying on off-the-shelf telecommunications equipment and standard quantum resources, this approach has the potential to reduce overhead in practical quantum networks.

TI Improving NV centre density during diamond growth by CVD process using
   N2O gas
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are point-like defects that have attracted a lot of attention as promising candidates for quantum technologies particularly for sensing and imaging nanoscale magnetic fields. For this application, the use of a high NV density within a high-quality diamond layer is of prime interest. In previous works, it has been demonstrated that in situ doping with N2O rather than N-2 during chemical vapour deposition (CVD), limits the formation of macroscopic defects and improves NV's photostability. In this work, we focus on the optimization of the CVD growth conditions to obtain a high NV density keeping a constant N2O concentration in the gas phase (100 ppm). For this purpose, freestanding CVD layers are prepared varying two main growth parameters: methane content and substrate temperature. High energy electron irradiation followed by annealing is finally carried out in order to increase the NV yield through partial conversion of N impurities. Defect concentrations and spin properties are investigated. We find that growth under lower methane concentrations and lower temperatures enhances NV doping. NV ensembles with a density of the order of 2 ppm are finally obtained with narrow spin resonance linewidth. In addition, higher annealing temperatures of 1200 degrees C following irradiation are found to efficiently remove defects thus improving spin properties.

TI Enhancement of non-Gaussianity and nonclassicality of pair coherent
   states by superposition of photon addition and subtraction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Pair coherent states (PCSs) as a kind of two-mode non-Gaussian and nonclassical states were introduced and studied. Some nonclassical characteristics of them such as two-mode sum-squeezing, two-mode antibunching, and entanglement have been well investigated. In this paper, we focus on studying the superposition of photon addition and subtraction to the PCSs called superposition of photon-added and photon-subtracted pair coherent states (SPAPSPCSs). Our main purpose is to show that the non-Gaussian feature and all the above-mentioned nonclassical properties of the SPAPSPCSs can be enhanced compared with the photon-added-and-subtracted two modes pair coherent states (PAASTMPCSs) and the original PCSs. In general, we demonstrate that the SPAPSPCSs have more enhanced non-Gaussian character and nonclassical properties than the PCSs and the PAASTMPCSs by examining the negativity of the Wigner function. Specifically, we indicate that both the SPAPSPCSs and the PAASTMPCSs can exist in two-mode sum-squeezing while the original PCSs (without photon-addition and photon-subtraction) cannot, and the degree of squeezing is stronger in the SPAPSPCSs than in the PAASTMPCSs. The obtained results also indicate that the superposition of photon addition and subtraction of the SPAPSPCSs plays a vital role in enhancing the two-mode antibunching property and the entanglement degree compared with the PCSs and the PAASTMPCSs.

TI Control of an Environmental Spin Defect beyond the Coherence Limit of a
   Central Spin
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Electronic spin defects in the environment of an optically active spin can be used to increase the size and hence the performance of solid-state quantum registers, especially for applications in quantum metrology and quantum communication. Previous works on multiqubit electronic spin registers in the environment of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond have only included spins directly coupled to the NV. As this direct coupling is limited by the central spin coherence time, it significantly restricts the maximum attainable size of the register. To address this problem, we present a scalable approach to increase the size of electronic spin registers. Our approach exploits a weakly coupled probe spin together with doubleresonance control sequences to mediate the transfer of spin polarization between the central NV spin and an environmental spin that is not directly coupled to it. We experimentally realize this approach to demonstrate the detection and coherent control of an unknown electronic spin outside the coherence limit of a central NV. Our work paves the way for engineering larger quantum spin registers with the potential to advance nanoscale sensing, enable correlated noise spectroscopy for error correction, and facilitate the realization of spin-chain quantum wires for quantum communication.

TI Quantum Identity-Based Encryption from the Learning with Errors Problem
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB To prevent eavesdropping and tampering, network security protocols take advantage of asymmetric ciphers to establish session-specific shared keys with which further communication is encrypted using symmetric ciphers. Commonly used asymmetric algorithms include public key encryption, key exchange, and identity-based encryption (IBE). However, network security protocols based on classic identity-based encryption schemes do not have perfect forward secrecy. To solve this problem, we construct the first quantum IBE (QIBE) scheme based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem, which is also the first cryptographic scheme that applies the LWE problem to quantum encryption. We prove that our scheme is fully secure under the random oracle model and highlight the following advantages: (1) Network security protocols with our QIBE scheme provide perfect forward secrecy. The ciphertext is transmitted in the form of a quantum state unknown to the adversary and cannot be copied and stored. Thus, in network security protocols based on QIBE construction, the adversary does not have any previous quantum ciphertext to decrypt for obtaining the previous session key, even if the private identity key is threatened. (2) Classic key generation centre (KGC) systems can still be used in the QIBE scheme to generate and distribute private identity keys, reducing the cost when implementing this scheme. The classic KGC systems can be used because the master public and secret keys of our scheme are both in the form of classic bits. Finally, we present quantum circuits to implement this QIBE scheme and analyse its required quantum resources for given numbers of qubits, Hadamard gates, phase gates, T gates, and CNOT (controlled-NOT) gates. One of our main findings is that the quantum resources required by our scheme increase linearly with the number of plaintext bits to be encrypted.

TI Stepping Closer to Pulsed Single Microwave Photon Detectors for Axions
   Search
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Axions detection requires the ultimate sensitivity down to the single-photon limit. In the microwave region, this corresponds to energies in the yJ range. This extreme sensitivity has to be combined with an extremely low dark-count rate since the probability of axions conversion into microwave photons is supposed to be very low. To face this complicated task, we followed two promising approaches that both rely on the use of superconducting devices based on the Josephson effect. The first one is to use a single Josephson junction (JJ) as a switching detector (i.e., exploiting the superconducting to normal state transition in the presence of microwave photons). We designed a device composed of a coplanar waveguide terminated on a current-biased JJ. We tested its efficiency to pulsed (pulse duration 10 ns) microwave signals since this configuration is closer to an actual axions search experiment. We show how our device is able to reach detection capability of the order of ten photons with the frequency of 8 GHz. The second approach is based on an intrinsically quantum device formed by two resonators coupled only via a superconducting qubit network. This approach relies on quantum nondemolition measurements of the resonator photons. We show that by injecting radiofrequency power into the resonator, the frequency position of the resonant drop in the transmission coefficient (S21) can be modulated up to 4 MHz. We anticipate that, once optimized, both the devices have the potential to reach single-photon sensitivity.

TI Synthetic five-wave mixing in an integrated microcavity for
   visible-telecom entanglement generation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nonlinear optics processes lie at the heart of photonics and quantum optics for their indispensable role in light sources and information processing. During the past decades, the three- and four-wave mixing (chi((2)) and chi((3))) effects have been extensively studied, especially in the micro-/nano-structures by which the photon-photon interaction strength is greatly enhanced. So far, the high-order nonlinearity beyond the chi((3)) has rarely been studied in dielectric materials due to their weak intrinsic nonlinear susceptibility, even in high-quality microcavities. Here, an effective five-wave mixing process (chi((4))) is synthesized by incorporating chi((2)) and chi((3)) processes in a single microcavity. The coherence of the synthetic chi((4)) is verified by generating time-energy entangled visible-telecom photon pairs, which requires only one drive laser at the telecom waveband. The photon-pair generation rate from the synthetic process shows an estimated enhancement factor over 500 times upon intrinsic five-wave mixing. Our work demonstrates a universal approach of nonlinear synthesis via photonic structure engineering at the mesoscopic scale rather than material engineering, and thus opens a new avenue for realizing high-order optical nonlinearities and exploring functional photonic devices.
   High-order optical nonlinearities are a key tool in photonics and quantum optics, but their use is hindered by materials' small intrinsic high-order susceptibility. Here, the authors show how to realize high-order nonlinear processes by combining intrinsic low-order ones in a microcavity.

TI Persistence of Correlations in Neurotransmitter Transport through the
   Synaptic Cleft
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary The human brain is still an enigma, and the relation between its physiology and function is still poorly understood. Advancements in quantum computations led to the hypothesis that neurons can also exercise quantum coherence, and a model for neuronal activity with quantum correlations appearing from the nuclei entanglement was proposed. However, whether such correlations can survive in a high-temperature biological environment to propagate through a neural network is still an open question. In this work, we examine one of the first steps in this process, the diffusion of neurotransmitters through the synaptic cleft, and show that, at least at this step, the correlations are persistent. Our results do not confirm the "quantum brain" hypothesis, but at least, they do not disprove it either, with studies on further steps needed.Abstract The "quantum brain" proposal can revolutionize our understanding of cognition if proven valid. The core of the most common "quantum brain" mechanism is the appearance of correlated neuron triggering induced by quantum correlations between ions. In this work, we examine the preservation of the correlations created in the pre-synaptic neurons through the transfer of neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft, a critical ingredient for the validity of the "quantum brain" hypothesis. We simulated the transport of two neurotransmitters at two different clefts, with the only assumption that they start simultaneously, and determined the difference in their first passage times. We show that in physiological conditions, the correlations are persistent even if the parameters of the two neurons are different.

TI Training a quantum measurement device to discriminate unknown
   non-orthogonal quantum states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Here, we study the problem of decoding information transmitted through unknown quantum states. We assume that Alice encodes an alphabet into a set of orthogonal quantum states, which are then transmitted to Bob. However, the quantum channel that mediates the transmission maps the orthogonal states into non-orthogonal states, possibly mixed. If an accurate model of the channel is unavailable, then the states received by Bob are unknown. In order to decode the transmitted information we propose to train a measurement device to achieve the smallest possible error in the discrimination process. This is achieved by supplementing the quantum channel with a classical one, which allows the transmission of information required for the training, and resorting to a noise-tolerant optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the training method in the case of minimum-error discrimination strategy and show that it achieves error probabilities very close to the optimal one. In particular, in the case of two unknown pure states, our proposal approaches the Helstrom bound. A similar result holds for a larger number of states in higher dimensions. We also show that a reduction of the search space, which is used in the training process, leads to a considerable reduction in the required resources. Finally, we apply our proposal to the case of the phase flip channel reaching an accurate value of the optimal error probability.

TI Machine Learning Optimization ofQuantum Circuit Layouts
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The quantum circuit layout (QCL) problem involves mapping out a quantum circuit such that the constraints of the device are satisfied. We introduce a quantum circuit mapping heuristic, QXX, and its machine learning version, QXX-MLP. The latter automatically infers the optimal QXX parameter values such that the laid out circuit has a reduced depth. In order to speed up circuit compilation, before laying the circuits out, we use a Gaussian function to estimate the depth of the compiled circuits. This Gaussian also informs the compiler about the circuit region that influences most the resulting circuit's depth. We present empiric evidence for the feasibility of learning the layout method using approximation. QXX and QXX-MLP open the path to feasible large-scale QCL methods.

TI Quantitative measurements of reactive oxygen species partitioning in
   electron transfer flavoenzyme magnetic field sensing
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Biological magnetic field sensing that gives rise to physiological responses is of considerable importance in quantum biology. The radical pair mechanism (RPM) is a fundamental quantum process that can explain some of the observed biological magnetic effects. In magnetically sensitive radical pair (RP) reactions, coherent spin dynamics between singlet and triplet pairs are modulated by weak magnetic fields. The resulting singlet and triplet reaction products lead to distinct biological signaling channels and cellular outcomes. A prevalent RP in biology is between flavin semiquinone and superoxide (O2 center dot-) in the biological activation of molecular oxygen. This RP can result in a partitioning of reactive oxygen species (ROS) products to form either O2 center dot- or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, we examine magnetic sensing of recombinant human electron transfer flavoenzyme (ETF) reoxidation by selectively measuring O2 center dot- and H2O2 product distributions. ROS partitioning was observed between two static magnetic fields at 20 nT and 50 mu T, with a 13% decrease in H2O2 singlet products and a 10% increase in O2 center dot- triplet products relative to 50 mu T. RPM product yields were calculated for a realistic flavin/superoxide RP across the range of static magnetic fields, in agreement with experimental results. For a triplet born RP, the RPM also predicts about three times more O2 center dot- than H2O2, with experimental results exhibiting about four time more O2 center dot- produced by ETF. The method presented here illustrates the potential of a novel magnetic flavoprotein biological sensor that is directly linked to mitochondria bioenergetics and can be used as a target to study cell physiology.

TI An Almost Deterministic Cooling by Measurements
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nondeterministic measurement-based techniques are efficient in reshaping the population distribution of a quantum system but suffer from a limited success probability of holding the system in the target state. To save the experimental cost, a two-step protocol is proposed to cool a resonator down to the ground state with a near-unit probability by exploiting the state-engineering mechanisms of both conditional and unconditional measurements on an ancillary qubit. In the first step, the unconditional measurements on the ancillary qubit are applied to reshape the target resonator from a thermal state to a reserved Fock state. The measurement sequence can be efficiently optimized by reinforcement learning for maximum fidelity. In the second step, the population on the reserved state can be faithfully transferred in a stepwise way to the resonator's ground state with a near-unit fidelity by the conditional measurements on the qubit. Properly designing the projection operator and the measurement interval enables the Kraus operator to act as a lowering operator for neighboring Fock states. Through dozens of measurements in all, the initial thermal average population of the resonator can be reduced by five orders in magnitude with a success probability of over 95%.
   An almost deterministic ground-state cooling protocol is constructed by hybridizing conditional and unconditional measurements. It seems counterintuitive since any control based on the quantum measurement is intrinsically nondeterministic. However, a quantum resonator can be shaped from a thermal state to a Fock state and further moved to the ground state. A nonunitary control then presents with a high efficiency. image

TI Optimal Zeno Dragging for Quantum Control: A Shortcut to Zeno with
   Action-Based Scheduling Optimization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The quantum Zeno effect asserts that quantum measurements inhibit simultaneous unitary dynamics when the "collapse" events are sufficiently strong and frequent. This applies in the limit of strong continuous measurement or dissipation. It is possible to implement a dissipative control that is known as "Zeno dragging" by dynamically varying the monitored observable, and hence also the eigenstates, which are attractors under Zeno dynamics. This is similar to adiabatic processes, in that the Zeno-dragging fidelity is highest when the rate of eigenstate change is slow compared to the measurement rate. We demonstrate here two theoretical methods for using such dynamics to achieve control of quantum systems. The first, which we shall refer to as "shortcut to Zeno," is analogous to the shortcuts to adiabaticity (counterdiabatic driving) that are frequently used to accelerate unitary adiabatic evolution. In the second approach, we apply the Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan stochastic action [PRA 88, 042110 (2013)], and demonstrate that the extremal-probability readout paths derived from this are well suited to setting up a Pontryagin-style optimization of the Zeno-dragging schedule. A fundamental contribution of the latter approach is to show that an action suitable for measurement-driven control optimization can be derived quite generally from statistical arguments. Implementing these methods on the Zeno dragging of a qubit, we find that both approaches yield the same solution, namely, that the optimal control is a unitary that matches the motion of the Zeno-monitored eigenstate. We then show that such a solution can be more robust than a unitaryonly operation and we comment on solvable generalizations of our qubit example embedded in larger systems. These methods open up new pathways toward systematically developing dynamic control of Zeno subspaces to realize dissipatively stabilized quantum operations.

TI Construction and Application of a Static Magnetic Field Exposure
   Apparatus for Biological Research in Aqueous Model Systems and Cell
   Culture
SO BIO-PROTOCOL
AB With the growth of the quantum biology field, the study of magnetic field (MF) effects on biological processes and their potential therapeutic applications has attracted much attention. However, most biologists lack the experience needed to construct an MF exposure apparatus on their own, no consensus standard exists for exposure methods, and protocols for model organisms are sorely lacking. We aim to provide those interested in entering the field with the ability to investigate static MF effects in their own research. This protocol covers how to design, build, calibrate, and operate a static MF exposure chamber (MagShield apparatus), with instructions on how to modify parameters to other specific needs. The MagShield apparatus is constructed of mu-metal (which blocks external MFs), allowing for the generation of experimentally controlled MFs via 3-axial Helmholtz coils. Precise manipulation of static field strengths across a physiologically relevant range is possible: nT hypomagnetic fields, mu T to < 1 mT weak MFs, and moderate MFs of several mT. An integrated mu-metal partition enables different control and experimental field strengths to run simultaneously. We demonstrate (with example results) how to use the MagShield apparatus with Xenopus, planarians, and fibroblast/fibrosarcoma cell lines, discussing the modifications needed for cell culture systems; however, the apparatus is easily adaptable to zebrafish, C. elegans, , and 3D organoids. The operational methodology provided ensures uniform and reproducible results, affording the means for rigorous examination of static MF effects. Thus, this protocol is a valuable resource for investigators seeking to explore the intricate interplay between MFs and living organisms.

TI Vibration assisted electron tunnelling in COVID-19 infection using
   quantum state diffusion
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The spread of the COVID-19 virus has become a global health crisis, and finding effective treatments and preventions is a top priority. The field of quantum biology primarily focuses on energy or charge transfer, with a particular emphasis on photosynthesis. However, there is evidence to suggest that cellular receptors such as olfactory or neural receptors may also use vibration-assisted electron tunnelling to enhance their functions. Quantum tunnelling has also been observed in enzyme activity, which is relevant to the invasion of host cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, COVID-19 appears to disrupt receptors such as olfactory receptors. These findings suggest that quantum effects could provide new insights into the mechanisms of biological systems and disease, including potential treatments for COVID-19. We have applied the open quantum system approach using Quantum State Diffusion to solve the non-linear stochastic Schr & ouml;dinger equation (SSE) for COVID-19 virus infection. Our model includes the mechanism when the spike protein of the virus binds with an ACE2 receptor is considered as dimer. These two entities form a system and then coupled with the cell membrane, which is modelled as a set of harmonic oscillators (bath). By simulating the SSE, we find that there is vibration-assisted electron tunnelling happening in certain biological parameters and coupling regimes. Furthermore, our model contributes to the ongoing research to understand the fundamental nature of virus dynamics. It proposes that vibration-assisted electron tunneling could be a molecular phenomenon that augments the lock-and-key process for olfaction. This insight may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing virus-receptor interactions and could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

TI Charge dynamics in quantum-circuit refrigeration: Thermalization and
   microwave gain
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Previous studies of photon-assisted tunneling through normal-metal-insulator-superconductor junctions have exhibited potential for providing a convenient tool to control the dissipation of quantum-electric circuits in situ. However, the current literature on such a quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) does not present a detailed description for the charge dynamics of the tunneling processes or the phase coherence of the open quantum system. Here, we derive a master equation describing both quantum-electric and charge degrees of freedom, and discover that typical experimental parameters of low temperature and yet lower charging energy yield a separation of time scales for the charge and quantum dynamics. Consequently, the minor effect of the different charge states can be taken into account by averaging over the charge distribution. We also consider applying an ac voltage to the tunnel junction, which enables control of the decay rate of a superconducting qubit over four orders of magnitude by changing the drive amplitude; we find an order-of-magnitude drop in the qubit excitation in 40 ns and a residual reset infidelity below 10 - 4. Furthermore, for the normal island, we consider the case of charging energy and single-particle level spacing large compared to the superconducting gap, i.e., a quantum dot. Although the decay rates arising from such a dot QCR appear low for use in qubit reset, the device can provide effective negative damping (gain) to the coupled microwave resonator. The Fano factor of such a millikelvin microwave source may be smaller than unity, with the latter value being reached close to the maximum attainable power.

TI Machine learning-driven materials discovery: Unlocking next-generation
   functional materials - A review
SO COMPUTATIONAL CONDENSED MATTER
AB The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning, graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models (GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights realworld applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and optimized. This synergy paves the way for new innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.

TI Engines for predictive work extraction from memoryful quantum stochastic

SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum information-processing techniques enable work extraction from a system's inherently quantum features, in addition to the classical free energy it contains. Meanwhile, the science of computational mechanics affords tools for the predictive modeling of non-Markovian classical and quantum stochastic processes. We combine tools from these two sciences to develop a technique for predictive work extraction from non-Markovian stochastic processes with quantum outputs. We demonstrate that this technique can extract more work than non-predictive quantum work extraction protocols, on the one hand, and predictive work extraction without quantum information processing, on the other. We discover a phase transition in the efficacy of memory for work extraction from quantum processes, which is without classical precedent. Our work opens up the prospect of machines that harness environmental free energy in an essentially quantum, essentially time-varying form.

In most cases the interaction between the system of interest and the external degrees of freedom deeply changes its dynamics, as described by open quantum system theory. Nevertheless engineered environment can be turned into beneficial effects for some quantum information tasks. Here we demonstrate an optical simulator of a quantum system coupled to an arbitrary and reconfigurable environment built as a complex network of quantum interacting systems. We experimentally retrieve typical features of open quantum system dynamics like the spectral density and quantum non-Markovianity, by exploiting squeezing and entanglement correlation of a continuous-variable optical platform.

TI QUANTUM HARDNESS OF LEARNING SHALLOW CLASSICAL CIRCUITS
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB In this paper, we study the quantum learnability of constant-depth classical circuits under the uniform distribution and in the distribution-independent framework of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. In order to attain our results, we establish connections between quantum learning and quantum-secure cryptosystems. We then achieve the following results. 1. Hardness of PAC learning AC(0) and TC0 under the uniform distribution. Our first result concerns the concept class TC0 (resp., AC(0)), the class of constant-depth, polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority gates (resp., AND, OR, NOT gates). We show the following: if there exists no quantum (quasi-)polynomial-time algorithm to solve the ring-learning with errors (RLWE) problem, then there exists no (quasi-)polynomial-time quantum learning algorithm for TC0; and if there exists no 2(O(d1/eta))-time quantum algorithm to solve RLWE with dimension d = O(polylogn) (for every constant eta > 2), then there exists no O(n(log nu) n)-time quantum learning algorithm for poly(n)-sized AC(0) circuits (for a constant nu > 0), matching the classical upper bound of Linial, Mansour and Nisan [J. ACM, 40 (1993), pp. 607-620], where the learning algorithms are under the uniform distribution (even with access to quantum membership queries). The main technique in these results uses an explicit family of pseudorandom functions that are believed to be quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn quantumly under the uniform distribution. 2. Hardness of learning TC20 in the PAC setting. Our second result shows that if there exists no quantum polynomial-time algorithm for the L W E problem, then there exists no polynomial-time quantum-PAC learning algorithm for the class TC20, i.e., depth-2 TC0 circuits. The main technique in this result is to establish a connection between the quantum security of public-key encryption schemes and the learnability of a concept class that consists of decryption functions of the cryptosystem. Our results show that quantum resources do not give an exponential improvement to learning constant-depth polynomial-sized neural networks. This also gives a strong (conditional) negative answer to one of the "Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory" raised by Aaronson https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/qchallenge.html, 2005.

   Before the past of PVS knowledge: The initial phase of medicine in all cultures is reduced to the transfer of specific energy by special pathways throughout the body! This is the case in China, India, Japan, Korea, Tibet, etc. Undoubtedly, the five articles by B. H. Kim published in the early 1960s are considered to be the past of PVS.
   Strange present: PVS studies after 2002 are accepted as a present. Most of the articles on the topic are in journals with editors-in-chief originating and/or accepting the achievements of Eastern medicine. Is the science of PVS local since its research is in journals that publish mainly articles on Eastern medicine? Why few of the articles concerning PVS are in Western medicine journals?
   PVS: after the future or some conclusions and proposals: All substances, objects, biological objects generate a weak electromagnetic radiation typical for each of them which is a passport of the information. PVS has all the data to be the main carrier of information. Information medicine and Quantum Biology can serve as a basis for medicine and biomedical sciences, and it should explain the processes that exist for the change of DNA and organisms in general, in accordance with and in response to external causes and internal changes.

TI Quantum tunnelling in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has added new urgency to the study of viral mechanisms of infection. But while vaccines offer a measure of protection against this specific outbreak, a new era of pandemics has been predicted. In addition to this, COVID-19 has drawn attention to post-viral syndromes and the healthcare burden they entail. It seems integral that knowledge of viral mechanisms is increased through as wide a research field as possible. To this end we propose that quantum biology might offer essential new insights into the problem, especially with regards to the important first step of virus-host invasion. Research in quantum biology often centres around energy or charge transfer. While this is predominantly in the context of photosynthesis there has also been some suggestion that cellular receptors such as olfactory or neural receptors might employ vibration assisted electron tunnelling to augment the lock-and-key mechanism. Quantum tunnelling has also been observed in enzyme function. Enzymes are implicated in the invasion of host cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Receptors such as olfactory receptors also appear to be disrupted by COVID-19. Building on these observations we investigate the evidence that quantum tunnelling might be important in the context of infection with SARS-CoV-2. We illustrate this with a simple model relating the vibronic mode of, for example, a viral spike protein to the likelihood of charge transfer in an idealised receptor. Our results show a distinct parameter regime in which the vibronic mode of the spike protein enhances electron transfer. With this in mind, novel therapeutics to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission could potentially be identified by their vibrational spectra.

TI Room-Temperature Fiber-Coupled Single-Photon Source from CdTeSeS Core
   Quantum Dots
SO PHOTONICS
AB Single-photon sources with photon antibunching characteristics are essential for quantum information technologies. This paper investigates the potential of quaternary-alloy CdTeSeS colloidal core quantum dots (cQDs) as compact, room-temperature, and fiber-integrated single-photon sources. Single-photon emission from CdTeSeS cQDs was verified by measuring the second-order correlation function, g2 tau, using a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss setup. A novel method to determine zero-time delay through afterpulsing analysis is presented. The results demonstrate strong photon antibunching with g20=0.13, confirming that the photoemission from the CdTeSeS cQDs function as a single-photon source. This work highlights the potential of CdTeSeS cQDs as reliable and efficient single-photon sources for practical use in fiber-based quantum information technologies.

TI Highly Efficient Biphoton Generation from Thin Dense Atomic Ensemble
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Hybrid photonic quantum networks require photonic quantum states generated from different systems, such as atoms and quantum dots. Photonic quantum sources based on atomic ensembles are excellent candidates due to their brightness, low noise, and narrowband characteristics. Herein, a new platform for a highly efficient biphoton source is presented using a thin, dense atomic medium from a hot 1 mm-long chip-scale Cs atomic vapor cell. Strongly correlated bright biphotons are generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing from a dense atomic ensemble based on the 6S1/2-6P3/2-6D5/2 transition of 133Cs. Biphoton source achieves a detected biphoton count rate of 100 kilo-counts per second, a heralding efficiency of 15%, and a maximum normalized crosscorrelation function value of 100 between the signal and idler photons, despite the low detector efficiency of a silicon avalanche photodetector being less than 25% at 917 nm. Herein, the maximal violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by a factor greater than 106 at a pump power of 1 mu W is obtained. The scheme for a highly efficient photon source is believed to be useful for scalable quantum networks.

TI Observation and manipulation of quantum interference in a
   superconducting Kerr parametric oscillator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon that makes superconducting circuits "quantum". Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using quantum tunneling in phase space of a Kerr parametric oscillator as a resource for quantum information processing. Here, we report a direct observation of quantum interference induced by such tunneling and its dynamics in a planar superconducting circuit through Wigner tomography. We experimentally elucidate all essential properties of this quantum interference, such as mapping from Fock states to cat states, a temporal oscillation due to the pump detuning, as well as its characteristic Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes. Finally, we perform gate operations as manipulations of the observed quantum interference. Our findings lay the groundwork for further studies on quantum properties of superconducting Kerr parametric oscillators and their use in quantum information technologies.

TI Frequency-bin entanglement from domain-engineered down-conversion
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Frequency encoding is quickly becoming an attractive prospect for quantum information protocols owing to larger Hilbert spaces and increased resilience to noise compared to other photonic degrees of freedom. To fully make use of frequency encoding as a practical paradigm for quantum information processing, an efficient and simple source of frequency entanglement is required. Here, we present a single-pass source of discrete frequency-bin entanglement that does not use filtering or a resonant cavity. We use a domain-engineered nonlinear crystal to generate an eight-mode frequency-bin entangled source at telecommunication wavelengths. Our approach leverages the high heralding efficiency and simplicity associated with bulk crystal sources. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Macroscopic delayed choice and retrocausality: Quantum eraser,
   Leggett-Garg, and dimension witness tests with cat states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose delayed-choice experiments carried out with macroscopic qubits, realized as macroscopically distinct coherent states |??) and | ??? ??). Quantum superpositions of |??) and | ??? ??) are created via a unitary interaction U(??) based on a nonlinear Hamiltonian, in analogy with polarizing beam splitters used in photonic experiments. Macroscopic delayed-choice experiments give a compelling reason to develop interpretations not allowing macroscopic retrocausality: This would otherwise suggest changes to the macroscopic qubit value based on a future measurement setting ??. We therefore consider weak macroscopic realism (wMR), which for the system at time t specifies a hidden variable ???? to determine the macroscopic qubit value, independently of ??. Using entangled cat states, we demonstrate a quantum eraser where the choice to measure a which-way or wave-type property is delayed. Consistency with wMR is possible, if we interpret the macroscopic qubit value to be determined by ???? without specification of the state at the level of h??. We then demonstrate violations of a delayed-choice Leggett-Garg inequality, and of the Wheeler-Chaves-Lemos-Pienaar dimension witness inequality, for the macroscopic qubits. This negates all two-dimensional nonretrocausal wMR models. However, one can interpret consistently with wMR, thus avoiding conclusions of macroscopic retrocausality, by noting extra dimensions, and that violations require further unitary dynamics U after t. The violations are then explained as failure of deterministic macroscopic realism, which specifies the validity of ???? prior to the dynamics U(??) determining the measurement setting ??. Finally, although there is consistency with wMR for macroscopic observations, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen???type paradoxes pointing to the incompleteness of quantum mechanics exist at a microscopic level, based on fringe distributions.

TI Optimizing quantum tomography via shadow inversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In quantum information theory, the accurate estimation of observables is pivotal for quantum information processing, playing a crucial role in computational and communication protocols. This work introduces a technique for estimating such objects, leveraging an underutilized resource in the inversion map of classical shadows that greatly refines the estimation cost of target observables without incurring any additional overhead. A generalized framework for computing and optimizing additional degrees of freedom in the homogeneous space of the shadow inversion is given that may be adapted to a variety of near-term problems. In the special case of local measurement strategies, we show feasible optimization leading to an exponential separation in sample complexity versus the standard approach and, in an exceptional case, we give nontrivial examples of optimized postprocessing for local measurements, achieving the same efficiency as the global Cliffords shadows.

AB Incompatible measurements are of fundamental importance to revealing the peculiar features of quantum theory, and are also useful resources in various quantum information tasks. In this work, we investigate the quantum incompatibility of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) within the operational framework of quantum resource theory, and report an experimental validation via the task of state discrimination. In particular, we construct an experimentally friendly witness to detect incompatible MUBs, based on the probability of correctly discriminating quantum states. Furthermore, we prove that the noise robustness of MUBs can be retrieved from violating the above witness. Finally, we experimentally test the incompatibility of MUBs of dimensionality ranging from 2 to 4, and demonstrate that it is more number of MUBs increases. Our results may aid the exploration of and practical applications in quantum information.

AB The Quantum CONGEST model is a variant of the CONGEST model, where messages consist of O(log(n)) qubits. In this paper, we give a general framework for implementing quantum query algorithms efficiently in a Quantum CONGEST network, using the concept of parallel-query quantum algorithms.
   We apply our framework for distributed quantum queries in two settings: problems where data is distributed over the network, and graph theoretical problems where the network defines the input. The first setting is slightly unusual in CONGEST but here our results follow almost directly from the quantum query setting. The second setting is more traditional for the CONGEST model but here our framework requires also some classical CONGEST steps to apply.
   In the setting with distributed data, we show how a network can pick one of k dates for a meeting such that a maximum number of nodes is available, using (O) over tilde(root kD + D) rounds, with D the network diameter. The classical complexity is linear in k. We also give an efficient algorithm for element distinctness: if all nodes together holds a list of k numbers, we show that the nodes can determine whether there are any duplicates in (O) over tilde (k(2/3) D-1/3 + D) rounds. Classically this problem requires (Omega) over tilde (k + D) rounds. We also generalize the protocol for the distributed Deutsch-Jozsa problem from the two-party setting considered by Buhrman, Cleve, and Wigderson [4] to general networks. This gives a novel separation between exact classical and exact quantum protocols in the CONGEST model.
   In the setting where the input is the network structure itself, our framework almost directly allows us to recover the O(root nD) round diameter computation algorithm of Le Gall and Magniez [21]. We extend this approach to also compute the radius in the same number of rounds, and to give an epsilon-additive approximation of the average eccentricity in (O) over tilde (D-3/2/epsilon) rounds.
   Finally, we give the first quantum speedups over classical CONGEST for the problems of cycle detection and girth computation. We detect whether a graph has a cycle of length at most k in O(k + (kn)(1/2-1/Theta(k))) rounds. For girth computation, we give an (O) over tilde (g + (gn)(1/2-1/Theta(g))) round algorithm for graphs with girth g, beating the classical Omega(root n) round lower bound by Frischknecht, Holzer, and Wattenhofer [12].

TI Feasibility Analysis of QKD Integration in Real-World FTTH Access
   Networks
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a real-world Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON)-based Fiber to the Home (FTTH) network serving up to 32 users, installed in COSMOTE laboratories in Athens. The deployment relies on the use of fiber optics and GPON telecom equipment which are identical to those found in the currently deployed FTTH infrastructure. We describe real-life network designs that correspond to specific installations considered in Athens urban metropolitan area. We propose a practical upstream Quantum Access Network (QAN) over the installed FTTH network, relied on a centralized quantum receiver (Bob) station located at the operator's Central Office, which exploits the Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) framing technique to receive single-photons from multiple independent quantum transmitters (Alice) located at users premises. This integration scheme is characterized by performing a series of noise measurements at single-photon level to evaluate the potential of the coexistence of classical/quantum links on the same fiber cores. The noise count rates are found to follow the Raman noise profile for specified values of effective Raman cross-sections of downstream and upstream GPON data channels. Subsequently, the experimental results are exploited to evaluate the performance of the widely-used Coherent One Way (COW) Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. The presented simulation results for the quantum layer suggest the feasibility of our integration scheme for short feeder fiber segments. Finally, the dependance of the Secure Key Rate (SKR) on the network capacity is also discussed.

The coupling between the two CFT's leads to negative null energy in the bulk, which supports a static traversable wormhole. As the ground state of a simple Hamiltonian, it may be possible to make these wormholes in the lab or on a quantum computer.

TI Highly efficient measurement of optical quadrature squeezing using a
   spatial light modulator controlled by machine learning
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Pulsed squeezed light is a key resource for many quantum information processing tasks. Among the various methods for generating squeezed light, single-pass parametric amplification has various advantages such as broad bandwidth, compactness, and stability. The challenge in achieving high-level pulsed squeezing has been to improve detection efficiency. We used a spatial light modulator controlled by machine learning to improve the spatial mode matching between the local oscillator and squeezed light. We achieved pulsed squeezing of 5.88 dB generated by optical parametric amplification in a waveguide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest obtained pulsed squeezing, and we believe this achievement will lead to more compact and efficient quantum information technology.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum Metamaterial for Broadband Detection of Single Microwave Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Detecting traveling photons is an essential primitive for many quantum-information processing tasks. We introduce a single-photon detector design operating in the microwave domain, based on a weakly nonlinear metamaterial where the nonlinearity is provided by a large number of Josephson junctions. The combination of weak nonlinearity and large spatial extent circumvents well-known obstacles limiting approaches based on a localized Kerr medium. Using numerical many-body simulations we show that the single-photon detection fidelity increases with the length of the metamaterial to approach one at experimentally realistic lengths. A remarkable feature of the detector is that the metamaterial approach allows for a large detection bandwidth. The detector is nondestructive and the photon population wavepacket is minimally disturbed by the detection. This detector design offers promising possibilities for quantum information processing, quantum optics and metrology in the microwave frequency domain.

TI From nonequilibrium Green's functions to quantum master equations for
   the density matrix and out-of-time-order correlators: Steady-state and
   adiabatic dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We consider a finite quantum system under slow driving and weakly coupled to thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. We present a systematic derivation of the quantum master equation for the density matrix and the out-of-time-order correlators. We start from the microscopic Hamiltonian and we formulate the equations ruling the dynamics of these quantities by recourse to the Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, performing a perturbative expansion in the coupling between the system and the reservoirs. We focus on the adiabatic dynamics, which corresponds to considering the linear response in the ratio between the relaxation time due to the system-reservoir coupling and the time scale associated to the driving. We calculate the particle and energy fluxes. We illustrate the formalism in the case of a qutrit coupled to bosonic reservoirs and of a pair of interacting quantum dots attached to fermionic reservoirs, also discussing the relevance of coherent effects.

TI Purifying Photon Indistinguishability through Quantum Interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Indistinguishability between photons is a key requirement for scalable photonic quantum technologies. We experimentally demonstrate that partly distinguishable single photons can be purified to reach near- unity indistinguishability by the process of quantum interference with ancillary photons followed by heralded detection of a subset of them. We report on the indistinguishability of the purified photons by interfering two purified photons and show improvements in the photon indistinguishability of 2.774(3)% in the low-noise regime, and as high as 10.2(5)% in the high-noise regime.

TI Fast Driving of a Particle in Two Dimensions without Final Excitation

Applying a recently found two-dimensional invariant combined with linear invariants, we propose protocols to drive a particle in two dimensions so that the final harmonic trap is translated and rotated with respect to the initial one. These protocols realize a one-to-one mapping between initial and final eigenstates at some predetermined time and avoid any final excitations.

TI Robust Control of Linear Systems and Shortcut to Adiabaticity Based on
   Superoscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB With the advent of quantum technologies, control issues are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we address control in phase space under a global constraint provided by a minimal energylike cost function and a local (in Fourier space) constraint resulting from a robustness criterion. The inverseengineering Lagrangian formalism developed here generalizes the formalism commonly used to describe the superoscillation phenomenon. It is applied to both nondissipative and dissipative quantum mechanics, and extended to stochastic thermodynamics. Interestingly, our approach also allows one to improve sensing capabilities by appropriate control of the system.

TI Quantum-enhanced analysis of discrete stochastic processes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Discrete stochastic processes (DSP) are instrumental for modeling the dynamics of probabilistic systems and have a wide spectrum of applications in science and engineering. DSPs are usually analyzed via Monte-Carlo methods since the number of realizations increases exponentially with the number of time steps, and importance sampling is often required to reduce the variance. We propose a quantum algorithm for calculating the characteristic function of a DSP, which completely defines its probability distribution, using the number of quantum circuit elements that grows only linearly with the number of time steps. The quantum algorithm reduces the Monte-Carlo sampling to a Bernoulli trial while taking all stochastic trajectories into account. This approach guarantees the optimal variance without the need for importance sampling. The algorithm can be further furnished with the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm to provide quadratic speed-up in sampling. The Fourier approximation can be used to estimate an expectation value of any integrable function of the random variable. Applications in finance and correlated random walks are presented. Proof-of-principle experiments are performed using the IBM quantum cloud platform.

TI A Quantum Informational Approach to the Problem of Time
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB Several novel approaches have been proposed to resolve the problem of time by relating it to change. We argue using quantum information theory that the Hamiltonian constraint in quantum gravity cannot probe change, so it cannot be used to obtain a meaningful notion of time. This is due to the absence of quantum Fisher information with respect to the quantum Hamiltonian of a time-reparametization invariant system. We also observe that the inability of this Hamiltonian to probe change can be related to its inability to discriminate between states of such a system. However, if the time-reparametization symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the formation of quantum cosmological time crystals, these problems can be resolved, and it is possible for time to emerge in quantum gravity.

A common description of their dynamics is given by the celebrated Lindblad master equation, which can be generalized to the nonMarkovian scenario. In this work, we introduce the non-Markovian ensemble propagation (NMEP) method, which extends the Monte Carlo wave-function (MCWF) method to the non-Markovian case in a simple and general manner. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness in a selection of examples, and compare the results with either analytic expressions or direct numerical integration of the master equation.

TI Optimization of Voltage Requirements in Electro-Optic Polarization
   Controllers for High-Speed QKD Systems
SO PHOTONICS
AB We present a framework to optimize the voltage range of electro-optic polarization controllers (EPC) in polarization-based quantum key distribution (QKD) subsystems. In this study, we consider an EPC capable of modifying both the phase difference between its fast and slow axes and the orientation of the fast axis. This capability allows it to transform any input state of polarization (SOP) into any desired output SOP on the Poincar & eacute; sphere using a single wave-plate. When multiple wave-plates are available, properly distributing the required polarization modulation across them effectively reduces the electronic demands, lowers the implementation costs, and enhances the polarization modulation speeds. This optimization is achieved through the application of multi-objective optimization (MOO) and wave-plate splitting techniques. Within a simulation model, using the calibration parameters from a commercially available six-wave-plate EPC, we determined the optimized voltage ranges required to achieve the six, four, and three SOPs typically used in polarization-based QKD protocols. Two voltage reference points are considered in our study: bias voltage points, which result in zero birefringence, and zero voltage points. For optimization procedures centered around the bias voltage points, we observe a significant reduction in the voltage range, from +/- 37 V, for a single wave-plate, to approximately +/- 6 V, for six wave-plates. Furthermore, using wave-plate splitting techniques, we conclude that only two independent wave-plates (four variables) need to be considered in our model to achieve optimized results, which contributes to the efficient design of polarization-based QKD subsystems by minimizing voltage transitions while ensuring precise SOP control, ultimately enabling cost-effective and high-speed polarization modulation.

TI Toward a Classification of Mixed-State Topological Orders in Two
   Dimensions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable-thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasilocal quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground-state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering G-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasilocal quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated-thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged," resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.

These algorithms are universal, meaning that their performances do not depend on the reference frame in which the dataset is provided. Requiring the universality property implies a characterization of optimal measurements via group representation theory.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the impact of distinguishability and mixedness, two fundamental properties of quantum states, on quantum interference. We show that these can influence the interference of multiple particles in different ways, leading to effects that cannot be observed in the interference of two particles alone. This is demonstrated experimentally by interfering three independent photons in pure and mixed states and observing their different multiphoton interference, despite exhibiting the same two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. In addition to its fundamental relevance, our observation has important implications for quantum technologies relying on photon interference.

TI Quantum Circuit Cutting for Classical Shadows
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Classical shadow tomography is a sample-efficient technique for characterizing quantum systems and predicting many of their properties. Circuit cutting is a technique for dividing large quantum circuits into smaller fragments that can be executed more robustly using fewer quantum resources. We introduce a divide-and-conquer circuit cutting method for estimating the expectation values of observables using classical shadows. We derive a general formula for making predictions using the classical shadows of circuit fragments from arbitrarily cut circuits and provide the sample complexity analysis for the case when observables factorize across fragments. Then, we numerically show that our divide-and-conquer method outperforms traditional uncut shadow tomography when estimating high-weight observables that act non-trivially on many qubits and discuss the mechanisms for this advantage.

AB Efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states is important for quantum-enhanced metrology. Current protocols for generating strong spin squeezing rely on either high dimensionality or long-range interactions. A key challenge is how to generate considerable spin squeezing in one-dimensional systems with only nearest-neighbor interactions. Here, we develop variational spin-squeezing algorithms to solve this problem. We consider both digital and analog quantum circuits for these variational algorithms. After the closed optimization loop of the variational spin-squeezing algorithms, the generated squeezing can be comparable to the strongest squeezing created from two-axis twisting. By analyzing the experimental imperfections, the variational spin-squeezing algorithms proposed in this paper are feasible in recently developed noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.

TI Entropy and singular-value moments of products of truncated random
   unitary matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Products of truncated unitary matrices, independently and uniformly drawn from the unitary group, can be used to study universal aspects of monitored quantum circuits. The von Neumann entropy of the corresponding density matrix decreases with increasing the length L of the product chain, in a way that depends on the matrix dimension N and the truncation depth delta N. Here we study that dependence in the double-scaling limit L, N -* oc at the fixed ratio tau = L delta N/N. The entropy reduction crosses over from a linear to a logarithmic dependence on tau when this parameter crosses unity. The central technical result is an expression for the singular-value moments of the matrix product in terms of the Erlang function from queueing theory.

TI Quantum caloric effects
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum thermodynamics aims to explore quantum features to enhance energy conversion beyond classical limits. While significant progress has been made, the understanding of caloric potentials in quantum systems remains incomplete. In this context, this study focuses on deriving general expressions for these caloric potentials, by developing a quantum Maxwell relationship obtained from a thermal average form of the Ehrenfest theorem. Our results recover the classical cases and also reveal that the isothermal entropy change can be related to genuine quantum correlations in the system. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the understanding of the caloric behavior of quantum systems and their potential implication in caloric devices.

TI Quantum optics for undergraduate lab work revisited
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB This paper presents a new lab work concept promoting a series of quantumoptics experiments: experimental milestones on the quantum behaviour oflight designed for undergraduate lab work. The experiments may be carriedout with considerably less effort while addressing the fundamentals ofquantum theory:quantum states and their superposition,detected via thepropagation phase of probability amplitudes;quantum nonlocality,detectedvia the change of the state due to localized detection;quantum entanglement,detected via the violation ofBELL's inequality(CHSH criterion). The exper-imental setup is designed to meet the requirements of barrier-free multileveluse in undergraduate physics lab courses: students'labs for secondary schoolstudents, undergraduate university labs for physics students(science and sci-ence education)and lab work assisted courses for the training of in-servicephysics teachers. This article is aimed to describe the basics of the setup and toshow how the experiments may be implemented into lab courses to matchdifferent educational course levels. The experimental series could prove to bepromising in terms of fruitful discussion of quantum theory fundamentalswithout semiclassical pitfalls.

TI Bosonic Gaussian channel and Gaussian witness entanglement criterion of
   continuous variables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We use quantum entanglement witnesses derived from Gaussian operators to study the separable criteria of continuous variable states. For bipartite system, we transform the validity of a Gaussian witness to a bosonic Gaussian channel problem. It follows that the maximal means of two-mode and some four-mode Gaussian operators over product pure states are achieved by vacuum (or coherent states and squeezed states) according to the properties of bosonic Gaussian channels. We demonstrate necessary and sufficient criteria of separability for two-mode and some four-mode Gaussian quantum states. We also propose multipartite Gaussian witnesses based on numeric evidence. The entanglement and multipartite entanglement detecting powers of the Gaussian witness criteria are illustrated by the mixture of two Gaussian states. We apply the Gaussian witness criterion to a Gaussian Fock state, which is prepared by passing a product Fock state through bosonic Gaussian channel. We show that the necessary criterion of separability for a Gaussian Fock state does not rely on the initial product Fock state, it relies on the channel.

TI Renyi entropies and negative central charges in non-Hermitian quantum
   systems
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement is one essential element to characterize many-body quantum systems. However, the entanglement measures are mostly discussed in Hermitian systems. Here, we propose a natural extension of entanglement and Renyi entropies to non-Hermitian quantum systems. There have been other proposals for the computation of these quantities, which are distinct from what is proposed in the current paper. We demonstrate the proposed entanglement quantities which are referred to as generic entanglement and Renyi entropies. These quantities capture the desired entanglement properties in non-Hermitian critical systems, where the low-energy properties are governed by the non-unitary conformal field theories (CFTs). We find excellent agreement between the numerical extrapolation of the negative central charges from the generic entanglement/Renyi entropy and the non-unitary CFT prediction. Furthermore, we apply the generic entanglement/Renyi entropy to symmetry-protected topological phases with non-Hermitian perturbations. We find the generic n-th Renyi entropy captures the expected entanglement property, whereas the traditional Renyi entropy can exhibit unnatural singularities due to its improper definition.

TI Distribution and Generation of Quantum Coherence for Gaussian States in
   de Sitter Space
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The distribution and generation of quantum coherence for two-mode and multi-mode Gaussian states in de Sitter space are studied. It is found that the quantum coherence is redistributed among the mode in different open charts under the curvature effect of de Sitter space. In particular, the Gaussian coherence for the initially correlated state is found to survive in the limit of infinite curvature, while quantum entanglement vanishes in this limit. Unlike entanglement and steering, the coherence of a massive scalar field is more robust than a massless field under the influence of curvature of de Sitter space. In addition, it is shown that the curvature generates two-mode Gaussian state and three-mode Gaussian state quantum coherence among the open charts, even though the observers are localized in causally disconnected regions. It is worth noting that the gravity-generated three-mode coherence is extremely sensitive to the curvature effect for the conformal and massless scalar fields, which may be in principle employed to design an effective detector for the space curvature.

TI Measurement phase transitions in the no-click limit as quantum phase
   transitions of a non-hermitean vacuum
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB We study dynamical phase transitions occurring in the stationary state of the dynamics of integrable many-body non-hermitian Hamiltonians, which can be either realized as a no-click limit of a stochastic Schrodinger equation or using spacetime duality of quantum circuits. In two specific models, the Transverse Field Ising Chain and the Long Range Kitaev Chain, we observe that the entanglement phase transitions occurring in the stationary state have the same nature as that occurring in the vacuum of the nonhermitian Hamiltonian: bounded entanglement entropy when the imaginary part of the quasi-particle spectrum is gapped and a logarithmic growth for gapless imaginary spectrum. This observation suggests the possibility to generalize the area-law theorem to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

TI Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Circuits for Braiding and Charging Majorana Zero Modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is an all-to-all interacting Majorana fermion model for many-body quantum chaos and the holographic correspondence. Here we construct fermionic all-to-all Floquet quantum circuits of random four-body gates designed to capture key features of SYK dynamics. Our circuits can be built using local ingredients in Majorana devices, namely, charging-mediated interactions and braiding Majorana zero modes. This offers an analog-digital route to SYK quantum simulations that reconciles all-to-all interactions with the topological protection of Majorana zero modes, a key feature missing in existing proposals for analog SYK simulation. We also describe how dynamical, including out-of-time-ordered, correlation functions can be measured in such analog-digital implementations by employing foreseen capabilities in Majorana devices.

TI Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference with Imperfect Single Photon Sources

AB Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is a cornerstone of optical quantum technologies. We explore both theoretically and experimentally how unwanted multiphoton components of single-photon sources affect the interference visibility, and find that the overlap between the single photons and the noise photons significantly impacts the interference. We apply our approach to quantum dot single-photon sources to access the mean wave packet overlap of the single-photon component. This study provides a consistent platform with which to diagnose the limitations of current single-photon sources on the route towards the ideal device.

We solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation starting with initial separable states and analyze the evolution of quantum correlations across the lattice. We report examples of evolutions leading to all-entangled chains and/or to time oscillating entangling structures and characterize them by means of entanglement and network measures. The quantum patterns result in structures quite different from the classical ones, even in the dynamics of local observables. A peculiar instance is a structure behaving as the quantum analog of a blinker, but that has no classical counterpart.

Here, we propose and demonstrate a magnetic-free optical nonreciprocal amplification based on a far-detuned four-wave mixing process in hot atoms. The absorption of the probe field can be significantly reduced by the large detuning. In our experiment, with just one pump field, an ultra-strong forward gain of 45 dB is achieved while the backward one keeps a near unit transmission. The experimental realization of ultra-strong nonreciprocal amplification may have applications for the generation of strong nonreciprocal quantum correlations.

We investigate the quantum correlations between subsystems by calculating bipartite and tripartite entanglement.

We estimate the range of interaction parameter values for which the strongest bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be produced. Additionally, we show that the discussed system can be a source of stable entangled states.

AB We propose a classical simulation method for quantum circuits based on decomposing unitary gates into a sum of stabilizer projectors. By only decomposing the non-Clifford gates, we take advantage of the Gottesman-Knill theorem and build a bridge between stabilizer-based simulation and Feynman-path-type simulation. We give two variants of this method: stabilizer-based path-integral recursion (SPIR) and stabilizer projector contraction (SPC). We also analyze further advantages and disadvantages of our method compared to the Bravyi-Gosset algorithm and recursive Feynman path-integral algorithms. We construct a parametrized circuit ensemble and identify the parameter regime in this ensemble where our method offers superior performance. We also estimate the time cost for simulating quantum supremacy experiments with our method and motivate potential improvements of the method.

TI Error bounds for variational quantum time evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Variational quantum time evolution allows us to simulate the time dynamics of quantum systems with near-term compatible quantum circuits. Due to the variational nature of this method the accuracy of the simulation is a priori unknown. We derive a posteriori global phase agnostic error bounds for the state simulation accuracy with variational quantum time evolution that improve the tightness of fidelity esti-mates over existing a posteriori error bounds. These analysis tools are practically crucial for assessing the quality of the simulation and making informed choices about simulation hyperparameters. The effi-cient, a posteriori evaluation of the bounds can be tightly integrated with the variational time simulation and, hence, results in a minor resource overhead, which is governed by the system's energy variance. The performance of the error bounds is demonstrated on numerical examples.

TI Domain wall melting across a defect

AB - We study the melting of a domain wall in a free-fermionic chain with a localised impurity. We find that the defect enhances quantum correlations in such a way that even the smallest scatterer leads to a linear growth of the entanglement entropy contrasting the logarithmic behaviour in the clean system. Exploiting the hydrodynamic approach and the quasiparticle picture, we provide exact predictions for the evolution of the entanglement entropy for arbitrary bipartitions. In particular, the steady production of pairs at the defect gives rise to non-local correlations among distant points. We also characterise the subleading logarithmic corrections, highlighting some universal features.

AB We propose a formulation of quantum mechanics in an extended Fock space in which a tensor product structure is applied to time. Subspaces of histories consistent with the dynamics of a particular theory are defined by a direct quantum generalization of the corresponding classical action. The diagonalization of such quantum actions enables us to recover the predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and reveals an extended unitary equivalence between all physical theories. Quantum correlations and coherent effects across time and between distinct theories acquire a rigorous meaning, which is encoded in the rich temporal structure of physical states. Connections with modem relativistic schemes and the path integral formulation also emerge.

TI Experimental verification of quantum battery capacity with an optical
   platform
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Quantum batteries, consisting of quantum cells, are anticipated to surpass their classical counterparts in performance because of the presence of quantum correlations. A recent theoretical study has introduced quantum battery capacity, which is defined according to the highest and the lowest energy during the charging and discharging procedures. Here, we present an experimental verification of quantum battery capacity and its relationships with other quantum characteristics of batteries using two-photon states. This reveals a distinguished feature of quantum battery capacity and its trade-off relationship with the entropy of the battery state, as well as with measures of coherence and entanglement.

TI Entanglement harvesting: Detector gap and field mass optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the protocol of entanglement harvesting, where two spacelike separated particle detectors extract quantum correlations from a quantum field. Specifically, we analyze the role of the mass of the field and the energy gap of the detectors in the protocol. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that there are regimes in which the entanglement harvested can increase with the mass of the field by decreasing the noise experienced by the detectors. Finally, we study the optimal relationship between the gap of the detectors and the other parameters of the setting that maximizes the entanglement harvested, showing that a small mass can improve the protocol even in this case.

TI Loss channels affecting lithium niobate phononic crystal resonators at
   cryogenic temperature
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We investigate the performance of microwave-frequency phononic crystal resonators fabricated on thin-film lithium niobate for integration with superconducting quantum circuits. For different design geometries at millikelvin temperatures, we achieve mechanical internal quality factors Q(i) above
   10 5 -
   10 6 at high microwave drive power, corresponding to
   5 x
   10 6 phonons inside the resonator. By sweeping the defect size of resonators with identical mirror cell designs, we are able to indirectly observe signatures of the complete phononic bandgap via the resonators' internal quality factors. Examination of quality factors' temperature dependence shows how superconducting and two-level system (TLS) loss channels impact device performance. Finally, we observe an anomalous low-temperature frequency shift consistent with resonant TLS decay and find that the material choice can help to mitigate these losses.

TI Large effects from quantum reference frames
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Reference frames are used to parameterize measurements of physical effects, but since their practical realization uses material objects, they may affect observations performed in a combined quantum state of the measured system together with the frame. Here, a procedure is used that makes it possible to describe non-monotonic reference scales in a quantum treatment, revealing large quantum effects in the measured system whenever a reference frame encounters a turning point. Subtle quantum correlations in the combined state of system and frame, and more broadly the concept of relational quantum mechanics, can be tested via a characteristic and surprisingly large shift in the measured value.

TI General spin systems without genuinely multipartite nonlocality
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB There are multipartite entangled states in many-body systems which may be potential resources in various quantum applications. In this paper, based on clustering theorems, we show that both the gapped ground state and thermal state at an upper-bounded inverse temperature have no genuine multipartite nonlocality when disjoint regions are far away from each other. The present n-particle system shows only biseparable quantum correlations when the propagation relations show exponential decay. Similar result holds for spin systems with product states as initial states. These results show interesting features of quantum many-body systems with exponential decay of correlations.

TI Stochastic Collisional Quantum Thermometry
SO ENTROPY
AB We extend collisional quantum thermometry schemes to allow for stochasticity in the waiting time between successive collisions. We establish that introducing randomness through a suitable waiting time distribution, the Weibull distribution, allows us to significantly extend the parameter range for which an advantage over the thermal Fisher information is attained. These results are explicitly demonstrated for dephasing interactions and also hold for partial swap interactions. Furthermore, we show that the optimal measurements can be performed locally, thus implying that genuine quantum correlations do not play a role in achieving this advantage. We explicitly confirm this by examining the correlation properties for the deterministic collisional model.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a quantum-enhanced lidar capable of performing confident target detection and rangefinding in the presence of strong, time-varying classical noise whilst operating with over five orders of magnitude separation between signal and background levels and target reflectivities down to -52 dB. We use a log-likelihood-based framework to introduce a new protocol for dynamic background tracking, verifying resilience of our system to both fast- and slow-modulation jamming in regimes where a classical illumination-based system fails to find a target. These results demonstrate the advantage of exploiting quantum correlations for lidar applications, providing a clear route to implementation in real-world scenarios.

TI Bosonic collective excitations in Fermi gases
SO REVIEWS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Hartree-Fock theory has been justified as a mean-field approximation for fermionic systems. However, it suffers from some defects in predicting physical properties, making necessary a theory of quantum correlations. Recently, bosonization of many-body correlations has been rigorously justified as an upper bound on the correlation energy at high density with weak interactions. We review the bosonic approximation, deriving an effective Hamiltonian. We then show that for systems with Coulomb interaction this effective theory predicts collective excitations (plasmons) in accordance with the random phase approximation of Bohm and Pines, and with experimental observation.

TI Multiclass classification using quantum convolutional neural networks
   with hybrid quantum-classical learning
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Multiclass classification is of great interest for various applications, for example, it is a common task in computer vision, where one needs to categorize an image into three or more classes. Here we propose a quantum machine learning approach based on quantum convolutional neural networks for solving the multiclass classification problem. The corresponding learning procedure is implemented via TensorFlowQuantum as a hybrid quantum-classical (variational) model, where quantum output results are fed to the softmax activation function with the subsequent minimization of the cross entropy loss via optimizing the parameters of the quantum circuit. Our conceptional improvements here include a new model for a quantum perceptron and an optimized structure of the quantum circuit. We use the proposed approach to solve a 4-class classification problem for the case of the MNIST dataset using eight qubits for data encoding and four ancilla qubits; previous results have been obtained for 3-class classification problems. Our results show that accuracies of our solution are similar to classical convolutional neural networks with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. We expect that our finding provide a new step towards the use of quantum neural networks for solving relevant problems in the NISQ era and beyond.

Explicit parameters in finite regimes can be extracted from theorems. We also generalize the semantic security capacity theorem, which shows that a strongly secure code guarantees a semantically secure code with the same secrecy rate, to any quantum channel, including the infinite-dimensional and non-Gaussian ones.

TI Persistent fermionic entanglement under decoherence
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider a system of two indistinguishable fermions (with four accessible states each) that suffers decoherence without dissipation due to its coupling with a global bosonic bath at a fixed temperature. Using an appropriate measure of fermionic entanglement, we identify families of two-fermion states whose entanglement persists throughout the evolution, either fully or partially, despite the noisy effects of the interaction with the bath, and independently of its temperature. The identified resilience to decoherence provides valuable insights into the entanglement dynamics of open systems of indistinguishable fermions, and into the conditions under which long-lived entanglement emerges under more general decoherence channels.

TI Observation of nonlocal Josephson effect on double InAs nanowires
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Short-range coherent coupling of two Josephson junctions (JJs) are predicted to generate a supercurrent in one JJ nonlocally modulated by the phase difference in the other. We report on observation of the nonlocal Josephson effect on double InAs nanowires as experimental evidence of the coherent coupling. We measure one JJ sharing one superconducting electrode with the other JJ and observe switching current oscillation as a control of the nonlocal phase difference. Our result will contribute to engineer novel superconducting phenomena with the short-range coherent coupling.
   Josephson junctions have applications in quantum circuits but producing and controlling the coupling between junctions is challenging. The authors characterize the electronic transport properties of two adjacent Josephson junctions, demonstrating short-range coherent coupling indicative of a nonlocal Josephson effect.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Data Classification with a Variational Entangled Sensor
   Network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) built upon noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, in conjunction with classical processing, constitute a promising architecture for quantum simulations, classical optimization, and machine learning. However, the required VQC depth to demonstrate a quantum advantage over classical schemes is beyond the reach of available NISQ devices. Supervised learning assisted by an entangled sensor network (SLAEN) is a distinct paradigm that harnesses VQCs trained by classical machine-learning algorithms to tailor multipartite entanglement shared by sensors for solving practically useful data-processing problems. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of SLAEN and show an entanglement-enabled reduction in the error probability for classification of multidimensional radio-frequency signals. Our work paves a new route for quantum-enhanced data processing and its applications in the NISQ era.

TI Acoustic spectral hole-burning in a two-level system ensemble
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Microscopic two-level system (TLS) defects at dielectric surfaces and interfaces are among the dominant sources of loss in superconducting quantum circuits, and their properties have been extensively probed using superconducting resonators and qubits. We report on spectroscopy of TLSs coupling to the strain field in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator. The narrow free spectral range of the resonator allows for two-tone spectroscopy where a strong pump is applied at one resonance, while a weak signal is used to probe a different mode. We map the spectral hole burnt by the pump tone as a function of frequency and extract parameters of the TLS ensemble. Our results suggest that detuned acoustic pumping can be used to enhance the coherence of superconducting devices by saturating TLSs.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Dynamical generation of strong and scalable quantum resources, like many-body entanglement and Bell correlations, in spin-1/2 chains is possible with all-to-all interactions, either for constant interaction strength realizing one-axis twisting protocol or for power-law decaying potentials. We show, however, that such quantum resources can also be dynamically generated with a finite range of interactions. We identify a threshold range and indicate a threshold time when scalable quantum correlations appear. Finally, we show that the certification of generated states is accessible in modern quantum simulator platforms.

TI Unified generation and fast emission of arbitrary single-photon
   multimode W states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a unified and deterministic scheme to generate arbitrary single-photon multimode W states in circuit QED. A three-level system (qutrit) is driven by a pump-laser pulse and coupled to N spatially separated resonators. The coupling strength for each spatial mode g(i) totally decide the generated single-photon N-mode W state vertical bar W-N > = 1/A Sigma N-i=(1)N/g(i)vertical bar 0(1)0(2) ... 1(i)0(i+1) ... 0(N)>, so arbitrary vertical bar W-N > can be generated inside resonators by adjusting g(i) and N. Moreover, such W states can be fast emitted in symmetric temporal waveform with a probability reaching 98.9%. The generation (or emission) time and fidelity can both be the same for arbitrary vertical bar W-N >, independent of mode numbers. Finally, the time evolution process is easy to control since only the pump pulse is time-dependent.

TI Intelligent Bio-Latticed Cryptography: A Quantum-Proof Efficient
   Proposal
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the tactile internet presents high-quality connectivity strengthened by next-generation networking to cover a vast array of smart systems. Quantum computing is another powerful enabler of the next technological revolution, which will improve the world tremendously, and it will continue to grow to cover an extensive array of important functions, in addition to it receiving recently great interest in the scientific scene. Because quantum computers have the potential to overcome various issues related to traditional computing, major worldwide technical corporations are investing competitively in them. However, along with its novel potential, quantum computing is introducing threats to cybersecurity algorithms, as quantum computers are able to decipher many complex mathematical problems that classical computers cannot. This research paper proposes a robust and performance-effective lattice-driven cryptosystem in the context of face recognition that provides lightweight intelligent bio-latticed cryptography, which will aid in overcoming the cybersecurity challenges of smart world applications in the pre- and post-quantum era and with sixth-generation (6G) networks. Since facial features are symmetrically used to generate encryption keys on the fly without sending or storing private data, our proposal has the valuable attribute of dramatically combining symmetric and asymmetric cryptography operations in the proposed cryptosystem. Implementation-based evaluation results prove that the proposed protocol maintains high-performance in the context of delay, energy consumption, throughput and stability on cellular network topology in classical Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) mode.

TI Convolution algebra of superoperators and nonseparability witnesses for
   quantum operations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We define a product between quantum superoperators which is preserved under the Choi-Jamiolkowski-Kraus-Sudarshan channel-state isomorphism. We then identify the product as the convolution on the space of superoperators, with respect to which the channel-state duality is also an algebra isomorphism. We find that any witness operator for detecting nonseparability of quantum operations on separated parties can be written entirely within the space of superoperators with the help of the convolution product.

TI Photocrosslinking Probes Proximity of Thymine Modifiers Tethering
   Excitonically Coupled Dye Aggregates to DNA Holliday Junction
SO MOLECULES
AB A DNA Holliday junction (HJ) has been used as a versatile scaffold to create a variety of covalently templated molecular dye aggregates exhibiting strong excitonic coupling. In these dye-DNA constructs, one way to attach dyes to DNA is to tether them via single long linkers to thymine modifiers incorporated in the core of the HJ. Here, using photoinduced [2 + 2] cycloaddition (photocrosslinking) between thymines, we investigated the relative positions of squaraine-labeled thymine modifiers in the core of the HJ, and whether the proximity of thymine modifiers correlated with the excitonic coupling strength in squaraine dimers. Photocrosslinking between squaraine-labeled thymine modifiers was carried out in two distinct types of configurations: adjacent dimer and transverse dimer. The outcomes of the reactions in terms of relative photocrosslinking yields were evaluated by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. We found that for photocrosslinking to occur at a high yield, a synergetic combination of three parameters was necessary: adjacent dimer configuration, strong attractive dye-dye interactions that led to excitonic coupling, and an A-T neighboring base pair. The insight into the proximity of dye-labeled thymines in adjacent and transverse configurations correlated with the strength of excitonic coupling in the corresponding dimers. To demonstrate a utility of photocrosslinking, we created a squaraine tetramer templated by a doubly crosslinked HJ with increased thermal stability. These findings provide guidance for the design of HJ-templated dye aggregates exhibiting strong excitonic coupling for exciton-based applications such as organic optoelectronics and quantum computing.

TI Measurement setup for the characterization of integrated semiconductor
   circuits at cryogenic temperatures
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Integrated semiconductor circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures can play a crucial role in scaling quantum computing architectures based on trapped-ion and superconducting qubits. Other technologies, such as low-temperature detectors, can also benefit significantly from these circuits. These applications demand high-frequency, cryogenic temperature measurement systems for the thorough characterization of semiconductor components and circuits. This work presents a customizable, high-frequency, fast, and reliable cryogenic measurement setup for measurement temperatures ranging from room temperature to 4.2 K. It features up to two dc probes or two ground-signal-ground probes for frequencies of up to 67 GHz, which can be configured in a 180 degrees or 90 degrees configuration. In addition, up to 48 BeCu wires configured as twisted pairs provide supply and control signals. Furthermore, up to four rf connections can be mounted directly to a printed circuit board. The setup features an optical microscope in the vacuum chamber to position the probes, which is further utilized by a machine vision algorithm, allowing the detection of pads and automatic positioning of the probes over the pads. The hardware is located in a 550 x 500 x 500 mm(3) large vacuum chamber with two independent pulse tube cryocoolers with cooling powers of up to 0.9 and 0.4 W at 4.2 K. Exemplary room temperature and cryogenic S-parameter, transient frequency (f(T)), time-domain, capacitance-voltage, and dc measurements of single transistors and integrated circuits fabricated by Infineon are presented, demonstrating the system's measurement capability for quantum computing and other applications.

TI A comparison of quantum-inspired GMDH-HS and GMDH-GWO approaches to soil
   hydraulic conductivity prediction
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
AB Study area: Southeastern Iran, namely the Sistan and Balochistan Province, covering 146 soil sampling points in various semi-arid agricultural environments with soil textures from sandy loam to silty clay loam. Study focus: Reliable estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is instrumental for water resource planning and agricultural management in semi-arid climates, but conventional pedotransfer functions frequently miss the intricate non-linear interrelationships among soil attributes and hydraulic behavior. The research formulates and tests two quantum-inspired hybrid models: Quantum Group Method of Data Handling with Harmony Search (Q-GMDH-HS) and Quantum Group Method of Data Handling with Grey Wolf Optimizer (Q-GMDH-GWO). The models incorporate quantum computing concepts (superposition, rotation gates, collapse mechanisms, and entanglement simulation) into the GMDH framework, complemented by natureinspired optimization algorithms for better parameter estimation. Model efficiency was examined on several statistical measures for training (70 %) and testing (30 %) datasets, along with extensive comparison with conventional pedotransfer functions like Rosetta, HYPRES, and standard GMDH approaches. New hydrological knowledge for the region: The quantum-inspired methods far exceeded conventional approaches, with Q-GMDH-HS providing outstanding accuracy (R2=0.99, RMSE=12.06 cm/day) over standard pedotransfer functions with 37-42 % greater prediction errors for fine-textured soils. The better performance in simulating low hydraulic conductivity values (characteristic of poorly-drained soils in southeastern Iran) allows for more accurate irrigation scheduling and drainage system planning, with potential agricultural water savings of 15-25 %. The breakthroughs offer essential tools for sustainable water management in semi-arid areas confronted with growing water scarcity, with implications for precision agriculture and groundwater protection in similar climatic zones.

TI Magnetically Suspended Control Sensitive Gyroscope Rotor High-Precision
   Deflection Decoupling Method using Quantum Neural Network and
   Fractional-Order Terminal Sliding Mode Control
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB To achieve high-precision deflection control of a Magnetically Suspended Control and Sensitive Gyroscope rotor under high dynamic conditions, a deflection decoupling method using Quantum Radial Basis Function Neural Network and fractional-order terminal sliding mode control is proposed. The convergence speed and time complexity of the neural network controller limit the control accuracy and stability of rotor deflection under high-bandwidth conditions. To solve the problem, a quantum-computing-based structure optimization method for the Radial Basis Function Neural Network is proposed for the first time, where the input and the center of hidden layer basis function of the neural network are quantum-coded, and quantum rotation gates are designed to replace the Gaussian function. The parallel characteristic of quantum computing is utilized to reduce the time complexity and improve the convergence speed of the neural network. On top of that, in order to further address the issue of input jitter, a fractional-order terminal sliding mode controller based on the Quantum Radial Basis Function Neural Network is designed, the fractional-order differential sliding mode surface and the fractional-order convergence law are proposed to reduce the input jitter and achieve finite-time convergence of the controller, and the Quantum Radial Basis Function Neural Network is used to approximate the residual coupling and external disturbances of the system, resulting in improving the rotor deflection control accuracy. The semi-physical simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

TI Approaches to Overpower Proof-of-Work Blockchains Despite Minority
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain (BC) technology has been established in 2009 by Nakamoto, using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) to reach consensus in public permissionless networks (Praveen et al., 2020). Since then, several consensus algorithms were proposed to provide equal (or higher) levels of security, democracy, and scalability, yet with lower levels of energy consumption. However, Nakamoto's model (a.k.a. Bitcoin) still dominates as the most trusted model in the described sittings since alternative solutions might provide lower energy consumption and higher scalability, but they would always require deviating the system towards unrecommended centralization or lower levels of security. That is, Nakamoto's model claims to tolerate (up to) < 50% of the network being controlled by a dishonest party (minority), which cannot be realized in alternative solutions without sacrificing the full decentralization property. In this paper, we investigate this tolerance claim, and we review several approaches that can be used to undermine/overpower PoW-based BCs, even with minority. We discuss those BCs taking Bitcoin as a representative application, where needed. However, the presented approaches can be applied in any PoW-based BC. Specifically, we technically discuss how a dishonest miner in minority, can take over the network using improved Brute-forcing, AI-assisted mining, Quantum Computing, Sharding, Partial Pre-imaging, Selfish mining, among other approaches. Our review serves as a needed collective technical reference (concluding more than 100 references), for practitioners and researchers, who either seek a reliable security implementation of PoW-based BC applications, or seek a comparison of PoW-based, against other BCs, in terms of adversary tolerance.

TI Recent progress of transport theory in Dirac quantum materials
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Dirac quantum materials comprise a broad category of condensed matter systems characterized by low-energy excitations described by the Dirac equation. These excitations, which can manifest as either collective states or band structure effects, have been identified in a wide range of systems, from exotic quantum fluids to crystalline materials. Over the past several decades, they have sparked extensive experimental and theoretical investigations in various materials, such as topological insulators and topological semimetals. The study of Dirac quantum materials has also opened up new possibilities for topological quantum computing, giving rise to a burgeoning field of physics and offering a novel platform for realizing rich topological phases, including various quantum Hall effects and topological superconducting phases. Furthermore, the topologically non-trivial band structures of Dirac quantum materials give rise to plentiful intriguing transport phenomena, including longitudinal negative magnetoresistance, quantum interference effects, helical magnetic effects, and others. Currently, numerous transport phenomena in Dirac quantum materials remain poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint, such as linear magnetoresistance in weak fields, anomalous Hall effects in nonmagnetic materials, and three-dimensional quantum Hall effects. Studying these transport properties will not only deepen our understanding of Dirac quantum materials, but also provide important insights for their potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing. In this paper, quantum transport theory and quantum anomaly effects related to the Dirac equation are summarized, with emphasis on massive Dirac fermions and quantum anomalous semimetals. Additionally, the realization of parity anomaly and half-quantized quantum Hall effects in semi-magnetic topological insulators are also put forward. Finally, the key scientific issues of interest in the field of quantum transport theory are reviewed and discussed.

AB We resort to the concepts of realism and indefiniteness introduced in Ref. [40], and based on the exploitation of ideal quantum tomography procedures. These concepts are connected to the existence of nonlocal correlations, and moreover allow to introduce a measure of nonlocality. In this paper we apply and test the approach of Ref. [40] in the physically relevant phenomenon of two-flavor neutrino oscillations, both in the plane-wave approximation and in the wave-packet approach, finding meaningful confirmations of the validity of the methodology, which allows to discriminate among distinct characters of different observables, and consequently on their physical relevance.

TI Spontaneous Vortex-Antivortex Pairs and Their Topological Transitions in
   a Chiral-Lattice Magnet
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex-antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, for example, from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, the on-demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge N = -1/2 and antimeron with N = 1/2, and a vortex-antivortex bundle, that is, a bimeron (meron pair) with N = -1 is reported. The mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy is demonstrated. It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.
   The emerging field of quantum computing, which relies on multiple electronic states, has recently garnered significant attention. Here, the on-demand creation of multiple states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including (anti)merons with N = +/- 1/2, bimerons, and skyrmions with N = -1 is presented. The transformations among these states through the application of magnetic fields and electric currents are demonstrated.image

TI X-ray parametric down-conversion at an XFEL
SO OPTICA
AB Understanding and harnessing X-ray quantum effects could open new, to our knowledge, frontiers in imaging and quantum optics. In this study, we measured the process of X-ray parametric down-conversion, where a single high-energy X-ray photon splits into two lower-energy photons. Using the SACLA X-ray free electron laser in Japan at 9.83 keV, we found clear evidence that pairs of photons were produced along the energy-angle relationship that conserved both energy and momentum, as predicted for down-conversion, and consistent with quantum entanglement of X-ray photons. By matching specific photon pairs for energy and momentum conservation, we observe a signal rate of 1250 pairs per hour, confirming that correlated photon pairs can be generated and observed in the absence of explicit time correlations. Our results show that with further refinement, the number of entangled photons produced per laser pulse could increase by an order of magnitude. This paves the way for demonstrating quantum-enhanced X-ray imaging, and confirmation of X-ray photon entanglement.

TI Wave packet dynamics of entangled q-deformed states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This paper explores the wave packet dynamics of a math-type q-deformed field interacting with atoms in a Kerr-type nonlinear medium. The primary focus is on the generation and dynamics of entanglement using the q-deformed field, with the quantification of entanglement accomplished through the von Neumann entropy. Two distinct initial q-deformed states, the q-deformed Fock state, and the q-deformed coherent state, are investigated. The entanglement dynamics reveal characteristics of periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic behaviour. Non-deformed initial states display wave packet near revivals and fractional revivals in entanglement dynamics while introducing q-deformation eliminates these features. The q-deformation significantly influences wave packet revivals and fractional revivals, with even a slight introduction causing their disappearance. For large values of q, the entanglement dynamics exhibit a chaotic nature. In the case of a beam splitter-type interaction applied to the initial deformed Fock state, an optimal deformation parameter q is identified, leading to maximum entanglement exceeding the non-deformed scenario.

TI Generation of high-efficiency, high-purity, and broadband
   Laguerre-Gaussian modes from a Janus optical parametric oscillator
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, carrying the orbital angular momentum of light, are critical for important applications, such as high-capacity optical communications, superresolution imaging, and multidimensional quantum entanglement. Advanced developments in these applications demand reliable and tunable LG mode laser sources, which, however, do not yet exist. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly efficient, highly pure, broadly tunable, and topological-charge-controllable LG modes from a Janus optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The Janus OPO featuring a two-faced cavity mode is designed to guarantee an efficient evolution from a Gaussian-shaped fundamental pump mode to a desired LG parametric mode. The output LG mode has a tunable wavelength between 1.5 and 1.6 mu m with a conversion efficiency >15 % , a controllable topological charge up to 4, and a mode purity as high as 97%, which provides a high-performance solid-state light source for high-end demands in multidimensional multiplexing/demultiplexing, control of spin-orbital coupling between light and atoms, and so on.

TI Schwinger effect and a uniformly accelerated observer
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB This article investigates the Schwinger effect for fermions with background electric and magnetic fields of constant strengths from the point of view of a uniformly accelerated or the Rindler observer. The Dirac equation is solved in a closed form, and the field quantisation in the (3 + 1)-dimensional Rindler spacetime is performed. The orthonormal local in and out modes for the causally disconnected right and left wedges and the Bogoliubov relations between them are obtained. Next, the global modes are constructed to cover the whole spacetime, and the Bogoliubov relationship between the local and global operators is found. Using them the squeezed state expansion of the global vacuum in terms of local states is acquired and accordingly, the spectra of created particles is found. Clearly, there are two sources of particle creation in this scenario - the Schwinger as well as the Unruh effects. Our chief aim is to investigate the role of the strength of the background electromagnetic fields on the spectra of created particles. We also discuss very briefly some possible implication of this result in the context of quantum entanglement.

We investigate such fluctuations in a subregion of the full system, focusing on geometries with sharp corners. We report that the angle dependence is super-universal: up to a numerical prefactor, this function does not depend on anything, provided the system under study is uniform, isotropic, and correlations do not decay too slowly. The prefactor contains important physical information: we show in particular that it gives access to the long-wavelength limit of the structure factor. We exemplify our findings with fractional quantum Hall states, topological insulators, scale invariant quantum critical theories, and metals. We suggest experimental tests, and anticipate that our findings can be generalized to other spatial dimensions or geometries. In addition, we highlight the similarities of the fluctuation shape dependence with findings relating to quantum entanglement measures.
   Fluctuations, both quantum and classical, contain important information about the underlying system. Here, the authors show that for measurements on a subregion with a sharp corner, fluctuations have the same shape dependence for a large variety of systems.

AB DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical artificial intelligence (Al)-based approaches such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum computing-based Al approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called " DeepVQC" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, the Deep VQC model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features.

TI A quantum-driven multi-stage framework integrating variational
   entanglement, reinforcement learning, and federated explainability for
   climate-resilient farming
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The increasing constraints of climate change and data privacy necessitate high-efficiency, sustainable agriculture, which is causing a shift in the paradigm of Agro-informatics. Most classical agricultural models fail to capture genotype, soil chemistry, and climate dynamics connections. Latent interactions, essential to intelligent agricultural treatments and explainability, are lost in many data processing pipelines that use linear dimensionality reduction or black-box learning. This paper presents a quantum computing architecture for a revolutionary agricultural application, utilizing quantum encoding, topological learning, reinforcement optimization, federated intelligence, and explainability to highlight the importance of this vital field. In Quantum Variational Crop-Soil Entanglement Encoding, crop-soil interaction datasets are encoded into quantum state vectors using variational circuits, preserving high-order entanglement properties (fidelity > 0.96, entropy similar to 0.9). Quantum-guided agri-topological dynamics mapping transforms encoded states into permanent topological maps using a hybrid quantum-classical Topological Data Analysis to track climate-induced agri-system dynamics (r = 0.84 with the yield index). Field-level decisions using Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Precision Intervention policy mappings to relate topological states to interventions produce 16.2% normalized yield. Quantum Federated Learning for Distributed Farm Intelligence uses privacy-preserving, encrypted quantum policy gradients to enable learning across farms in varied locations, lowering communication by 42% and improving accuracy by 9.3%. Quantum Explainability through Entropic Intervention Attribution generates causal graphs of yield drivers with 89% confidence intervals using entropy-based attributions. This integrated framework enhances the knowledge preservation, policy accuracy, expandability, and trust of agricultural Artificial Intelligence systems, enabling quantum-accelerated, information-based, future-ready farming decision support systems.

TI Understanding Technology Perception in Autism with Separate Analyses for
   Anxiety and Depression Using Quantum Circuit Simulation Approach
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB Background: This work explores the current use of technologies and the perception of their impact on people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other comorbidities-Chronic Anxiety (CA) and Chronic Depression (CD). Autistic people often experience anxiety and/or depression. These mental health issues are exacerbated by social stigma, affecting their quality of life (QoL) and well-being. Aims: The study aims to analyze how emerging technologies can reduce communication difficulties, as well as stress, anxiety, and depression, and thus improve QoL for individuals with ASD and comorbidities like CA and CD. Methods: This study analyzes data from the secondary questionnaire 'Encuesta de Discapacidad, Autonom & iacute;a Personal y situaciones de Dependencia (EDAD)' developed in 2020-2021 by the 'Instituto Nacional de Estad & iacute;stica (INE)' for people with ASD (n = 241), ASD and CA (n = 61), and ASD and CD (n = 29). The analysis includes Pearson correlation tests to examine the relationship between various factors affecting QoL. Results: The results highlight differences in difficulties affecting the QoL of ASD persons. Pearson correlation analysis showed significant negative correlations in communication and learning for ASD patients, with similar patterns in the separate analyses of CA and CD. More significant variables were found in the 'Learning' and 'Communication' indices for ASD, while CA and CD represented more significant variables in 'Mobility' index. Conclusions: This work suggests that technological interventions, such as the integration of advanced technologies, could enhance emotional regulation and social skills in individuals with ASD. In this sense, the quantum computing approach could help in the emerging technologies impact evaluation, analyzing devices adapted to the user to optimize their QoL and well-being.

TI Advanced Feature Selection Techniques in Medical Imaging-A Systematic
   Literature Review
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Feature selection (FS) plays a crucial role in medical imaging by reducing dimensionality, improving computational efficiency, and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Traditional FS techniques, including filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, have been widely used but often struggle with high-dimensional and heterogeneous medical imaging data. Deep learning-based FS methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and autoencoders, have demonstrated superior performance but lack interpretability. Hybrid approaches that combine classical and deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising solution, offering improved accuracy and explainability. Furthermore, integrating multi-modal imaging data (e.g., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and Ultrasound (US)) poses additional challenges in FS, necessitating advanced feature fusion strategies. Multi-modal feature fusion combines information from different imaging modalities to improve diagnostic accuracy. Recently, quantum computing has gained attention as a revolutionary approach for FS, providing the potential to handle high-dimensional medical data more efficiently. This systematic literature review comprehensively examines classical, Deep Learning (DL), hybrid, and quantum-based FS techniques in medical imaging. Key outcomes include a structured taxonomy of FS methods, a critical evaluation of their performance across modalities, and identification of core challenges such as computational burden, interpretability, and ethical considerations. Future research directions-such as explainable AI (XAI), federated learning, and quantum-enhanced FS-are also emphasized to bridge the current gaps. This review provides actionable insights for developing scalable, interpretable, and clinically applicable FS methods in the evolving landscape of medical imaging.

TI Conversational and generative artificial intelligence and human-chatbot
   interaction in education and research
SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) as a disruptive technology is not new. However, its recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data analytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI (CGAI/GenAI) and human-like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and methods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape of CGAI and human-chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases, benefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education and allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4% (n = 75) occurred during 2006-2018, while 2019-2023 experienced astronomical growth (n = 1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science (multidisciplinary and AI; 32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%), and business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration among eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, information systems, and other areas. The thematic structure highlights prominent CGAI use cases, including improved user experience in human-computer interaction, computer programs/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for teachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation, testing aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse (plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about misinformation, danger of self-diagnoses, and patient privacy in medical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and policies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice are priorities. Developing discipline-based automatic detection of GenAI contents to check abuse is proposed. In operational/operations research areas, proper CGAI/GenAI integration with modeling and decision support systems requires further studies.

TI Quantum-inspired deep learning optimisation for real-time student
   engagement analysis in virtual classrooms
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Quantum computing (QC) employs quantum-mechanical principles such as superposition and entanglement to solve specific problems far more efficiently than classical computers. E-learning is the only option for students and teachers during the pandemic. Conversely, it is challenging for an instructor to observe every student's engagement while educating online. Students are distracted during such activities. The teachers want to identify their students' states, whether they are concentrated or concerned with teaching. Hence, from a teacher's viewpoint, it is significant to assess students' levels of engagement to understand their actual reactions and take the necessary steps to involve students and help them achieve goals, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) is deployed for predictive analytics of a student's performance and engagement depending upon interactions, contribution in class, etc. In this paper, the Deep Learning-Driven Quantum Inspired Moth Flame Optimizer for Real-Time Student Engagement Analysis (DLQIMFO-RSEA) method is proposed. The DLQIMFORSEA method aims to categorise student engagement in online classes. To accomplish this, the DLQIMFORSEA method uses the YOLOv5 object detection model with backbones SPPF, CBS, and CSPI-X. Next, the image pre-processing stage employs the Wiener filter (WF) to remove the noise. For feature extraction, the InceptionResNetV2 technique is used. Furthermore, a stacked autoencoder (SAE) is applied for detection. At last, the parameter tuning process is performed by the quantum-inspired moth flame optimiser (QIMFO) model to improve the classification performance of the SAE model. The comparison analysis of the DLQIMFO-RSEA approach showed superior accuracy of 94.34 % compared to other models on the student engagement dataset.

TI Quantum Resistance Saber-Based Group Key Exchange Protocol for IoT
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Quantum computing poses a threat on current cryptography methods, prompting initiatives such as the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process toward developing post-quantum cryptographic tools. This process concentrates on deploying "key encapsulation mechanisms" and "signature schemes", mainly focusing on Group Authenticated key exchange (GAKE), which is crucial for secure group communication while ensuring authentication is immune to quantum attacks. Despite various two-party key exchange designs adaptable for group key exchange protocols with multiple parties, experts face challenges in secure group interactions in a post-quantum environment due to the lack of such group protocols solutions. Addressing the necessity of secure group communication in IoTs, we proposed a GAKE protocol. This paper presents its design and implementation secure under QROM; we compared our initial findings on the "Saber-based GAKE" with a Kyber-based GAKE implementation named "Complied Kyber" proposed by Pablos, focusing on IoTs. Our findings show better efficiency than "Compiled Kyber" regarding overall communication duration, especially when involving up to 2000 participants in group communication. Furthermore, thorough investigation and calculations confirm the Saber-GAKE protocol's interoperability with IoT contexts. The protocol has worthy computational efficiency, with execution speeds of 0.064 ms on ARM Cortex-M4 and 1.56 ms on ARM Cortex-M0 systems. The memory use is well below the allowed limits, with 50.86 KB on Cortex-M4 and 35.84 KB on Cortex-M0. The performance data validate that the Saber-GAKE protocol can effectively and safely function on IoT devices with limited resources, offering strong protection against quantum computing assaults.

TI An Extended Analysis of the Correlation Extraction Algorithm in the
   Context of Linear Cryptanalysis
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB In cryptography, techniques and tools developed in the subfield of linear cryptanalysis have previously successfully been used to allow attackers to break many sophisticated cryptographic ciphers. Since these linear cryptanalytic techniques require exploitable linear approximations to relate the input and output of vectorial Boolean functions, e.g., the plaintext, ciphertext, and key of the cryptographic function, finding these approximations is essential. For this purpose, the Correlation Extraction Algorithm (CEA), which leverages the emerging field of quantum computing, appears promising. However, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the CEA regarding finding an exploitable linear approximation for linear cryptanalysis. In this paper, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis of the CEA. We aim to investigate its potential in finding a linear approximation with prescribed statistical characteristics. To support our theoretical work, we also present the results of a small empirical study based on a computer simulation. The analysis in this paper shows that an approach that uses the CEA to find exploitable linear approximations has an asymptotic advantage, reducing a linear factor to a logarithmic one in terms of time complexity, and an exponential advantage in terms of space complexity compared to a classical approach that uses the fast Walsh transform. Furthermore, we show that in specific scenarios, CEA can exponentially reduce the search space for exploitable linear approximations in terms of the number of input bits of the cipher. Neglecting the unresolved issue of efficiently checking the property of linear approximations measured by the CEA, our results indicate that the CEA can support the linear cryptanalysis of vectorial Boolean functions with relatively few (e.g., n <= 32) output bits.

TI Analysis of electron configurations in terms of parity-supporting
   rotations returns the hydrogen spectrum with consequences for the
   orbital model
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB A centrally symmetric variant of Bohr's atomic model was constructed according to first geometric principles, and entanglement of pairs of subatomic particles through invariant rotations that stabilize the system. Its base symmetry was constrained to 2-fold rotational symmetry corresponding to 2 electrons associated with the atomic ground energy state. The theory was constructed using two sets of invariant rotations of distinguishable and indistinguishable type, derived from spherical approximations, with information regarding the initial state of the system preserved throughout the geometric transformation. Superposition of alternating structures of the two types indicates that closing of electron shells may take place via formation of mirror symmetry through rotational invariance, and quantization of energy can be reconciled with observables in quantum mechanics. The resulting solution correlates subshells s-g with unique parity-supporting states, and subsequent subshells with their imitations, having double the number of electrons of the preceding subshell of a corresponding type.

TI Beating the Fault-Tolerance Bound and Security Loopholes for Byzantine
   Agreement with a Quantum Solution
SO RESEARCH
AB Byzantine agreement, the underlying core of blockchain, aims to make every node in a decentralized network reach consensus. Classical Byzantine agreements unavoidably face two major problems. One is 1/3 fault-tolerance bound, which means that the system to tolerate f malicious players requires at least 3f + 1 players. The other is the security loopholes from its classical cryptography methods. Here, we propose a Byzantine agreement framework with unconditional security to break this bound with nearly 1/2 fault tolerance due to multiparty correlation provided by quantum digital signatures. It is intriguing that quantum entanglement is not necessary to break the 1/3 fault-tolerance bound, and we show that weaker correlation, such as asymmetric relationship of quantum digital signature, can also work. Our work strictly obeys two Byzantine conditions and can be extended to any number of players without requirements for multiparticle entanglement. We experimentally demonstrate three-party and five-party consensus for a digital ledger. Our work indicates the quantum advantage in terms of consensus problems and suggests an important avenue for quantum blockchain and quantum consensus networks.

TI Topological approach to electron correlations at fractional quantum Hall
   effect
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB The classification of homotopy invariants in interacting multi electron 2D systems at quantizing magnetic fields is presented, explaining the topologically protected correlations occurring at integer and fractional quantum Hall effects. The long-range quantum entanglement is essential for homotopy correlated phases in contrast to the binary entanglement for conventional phases with local order parameters. The classification of homotopy longrange correlated phases induced by the Coulomb interaction of electrons has been derived in terms of homotopy invariants, which are universal and robust against local disorder and single particle crystal field, as illustrated by experimental observations in various materials with different microscopic structure, like GaAs 2DES, graphene monolayer and bilayer and in Chern topological insulators. The homotopy phases are demonstrated to be topologically protected and immune to single-particle perturbations, temperature chaos and variation of the electron interaction strength. The nonzero repulsive interaction between electrons is shown, however, to be essential for the definition of the homotopy invariants, which disappear in gaseous systems. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI Entanglement microscopy and tomography in many-body systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum entanglement uncovers the essential principles of quantum matter, yet determining its structure in realistic many-body systems poses significant challenges. Here, we employ a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to reveal the multipartite entanglement encoded in the full reduced density matrix of the microscopic subregion in spin and fermionic many-body systems. We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement with our two witnesses in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We further establish the singular scaling of general multipartite entanglement measures at criticality and present an explicit analysis in the tripartite case.

TI Automatic evolutionary design of quantum rule-based systems and
   applications to quantum reinforcement learning
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Explainable artificial intelligence is a research topic whose relevance has increased in recent years, especially with the advent of large machine learning models. However, very few attempts have been proposed to improve interpretability in the case of quantum artificial intelligence, and many existing quantum machine learning models in the literature can be considered almost as black boxes. In this article, we argue that an appropriate semantic interpretation of a given quantum circuit that solves a problem can be of interest to the user not only to certify the correct behavior of the learned model, but also to obtain a deeper insight into the problem at hand and its solution. We focus on decision-making problems that can be formulated as classification tasks and propose a method for learning quantum rule-based systems to solve them using evolutionary optimization algorithms. The approach is tested to learn rules that solve control and decision-making tasks in reinforcement learning environments, to provide interpretable agent policies that help to understand the internal dynamics of an unknown environment. Our results conclude that the learned policies are not only highly explainable, but can also help detect non-relevant features of problems and produce a minimal set of rules.

TI Graph-theoretic characterization of unextendible product bases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Unextendible product bases (UPBs) play a key role in the study of quantum entanglement and nonlocality. Here we provide an equivalent characterization of UPBs in graphtheoretic terms. Different from previous graph-theoretic investigations of UPBs, which focused mostly on the orthogonality relations between different product states, our characterization includes a graph-theoretic reformulation of the unextendibility condition. Building on this characterization, we develop a constructive method for building UPBs in low dimensions and shed light on the open question of whether there exist genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPBs), that is, multipartite product bases that are unextendible with respect to every possible bipartition. We derive a lower bound on the size of any candidate GUPB, significantly improving over the state of the art. Moreover, we show that every minimal GUPB saturating our bound must be associated to regular graphs and discuss a possible path towards the construction of a minimal GUPB in a tripartite system of minimal local dimension. Finally, we apply our characterization to the problem of distinguishing UPB states under local operations and classical communication, deriving a necessary condition for reliable discrimination in the asymptotic limit.

TI Quantization of nonlocal fields via fractional calculus
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this study, we investigate the effect of nonlocality in quantum mechanics and propose a fractional approach the theory of quantized fields. For this purpose, we embedded the fractional calculus to broaden theory of quantum fields since the integral and derivative operators are nonlocal in fractional calculus.Additionally, quantum entanglement is discussed to gain comprehension of nonlocality in the foundation of quantum mechanics. Besides, fractional Lagrangian formalism was presented due to fact that the Lagrangian density is the starting point to establish a field theory.Furthermore, to make fractional field operators quantum mechanical, equal-time commutator have been defined for the these operators in terms of Caputo fractional derivative. Thus, a scheme of quantization of fractional fields is introduced and general aspects of the method is illustrated with the theory of massive scalar fields. This approach laid out to a successful generalization of the quantum field theory which is coherent with the standard formalism. Consequently, we developed promising concept for a quantum field theory by introducing nonlocality into standard mathematical formalism.

TI Quantum mechanical dataset of 836k neutral closed-shell molecules with
   up to 5 heavy atoms from C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB We introduce the Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset comprehensively covering all possible neutral closed-shell small organic and inorganic molecules with up to five heavy (p-block) atoms: C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. All valid stoichiometries, Lewis-rule-consistent graphs, and stable conformers (identified via GFN2-xTB) were enumerated combinatorially, yielding 577k conformational isomers spanning 258k constitutional isomers and 5,599 unique stoichiometries. DFT (omega B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) optimizations were performed for all, and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are provided for 10,793 lowest-energy conformers with up to 4 heavy atoms. VQM24 includes structures, vibrational modes, rotational constants, thermodynamic properties (Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, ZPVEs, entropies, heat capacities), and electronic properties such as atomization, electron interaction, exchange-correlation, dispersion energies, multipole moments (dipole to hexadecapole), alchemical potentials, Mulliken charges, and wavefunctions. Machine learning models of atomization energies on this dataset reveal significantly higher complexity than QM9, with none achieving chemical accuracy. VQM24 offers a rigorous, high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating quantum machine learning models.

TI Experimental photonic quantum memristor
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Memristive devices are a class of physical systems with history-dependent dynamics characterized by signature hysteresis loops in their input-output relations. In the past few decades, memristive devices have attracted enormous interest in electronics. This is because memristive dynamics is very pervasive in nanoscale devices, and has potentially groundbreaking applications ranging from energy-efficient memories to physical neural networks and neuromorphic computing platforms. Recently, the concept of a quantum memristor was introduced by a few proposals, all of which face limited technological practicality. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel quantum-optical memristor (based on integrated photonics) that acts on single-photon states. We fully characterize the memristive dynamics of our device and tomographically reconstruct its quantum output state. Finally, we propose a possible application of our device in the framework of quantum machine learning through a scheme of quantum reservoir computing, which we apply to classical and quantum learning tasks. Our simulations show promising results, and may break new ground towards the use of quantum memristors in quantum neuromorphic architectures.
   A quantum-optical memristor is realized by means of a laser-written integrated photonic circuit. The memristive dynamics of the device is fully characterized. A memristor-based quantum reservoir computer is proposed as a possible application.

TI Uncovering phase transitions that underpin the flat-planes in the tilted
   Hubbard model using subsystems and entanglement measures
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The failure of many approximate electronic structure methods can be traced to their erroneous description of fractional charge and spin redistributions in the asymptotic limit toward infinity, where violations of the flat-plane conditions lead to delocalization and static correlation errors. Although the energetic consequences of the flat-planes are known, the underlying quantum phase transitions that occur when (spin)charge is redistributed have not been characterized. In this study, we use open subsystems to redistribute (spin)charges in the tilted Hubbard model by imposing suitable Lagrange constraints on the Hamiltonian. We computationally recover the flat-plane conditions and quantify the underlying quantum phase transitions using quantum entanglement measures. The resulting entanglement patterns quantify the phase transition that gives rise to the flat-plane conditions and quantify the complexity required to accurately describe charge redistributions in strongly correlated systems. Our study indicates that entanglement patterns can uncover those phase transitions that have to be modeled accurately if the delocalization and static correlation errors of approximate methods are to be reduced.

TI Kalman filter based local local oscillator continuous-variable quantum
   secret sharing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In a practical continuous-variable quantum secret sharing system, the local oscillator transmitted via an insecure channel may be subjected to security threats due to various targeted attacks. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a continuous-variable quantum secret sharing scheme with local intrinsic oscillator, in which the intrinsic oscillator is generated locally at the trusted end without being sent by each user, thus completely plugging the relevant security loopholes. The scheme consists of three stages: preparation, where users generate estimate the minimum mean square error for each reference phase separately, reducing the phase drift estimation errors. The excess noise of the filtered system including modulation noise, phase noise, photon leakage noise, and ADC quantization noise is modeled, with KF reducing phase measurement noise via dynamic gain optimization. Security bound against eavesdroppers and dishonest users is derived. Numerical simulations by 40% at 60 km. The scheme's robustness is further validated under varying reference signal amplitudes, showing stable performance even at lower levels, minimizing interference with quantum signals. These results highlight that the proposed scheme has significant advantages in terms of maximum transmission distance and maximum number of supported users, and has the potential to build adaptive KF algorithms for dynamic user scenarios and quantum machine learning integration.

TI Learning linear optical circuits with coherent states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We analyze the energy and training data requirements for supervised learning of an M-mode linear optical circuit by minimizing an empirical risk defined solely from the action of the circuit on coherent states. When the linear optical circuit acts non-trivially only on k < M unknown modes (i.e. a linear optical k-junta), we provide an energy-efficient, adaptive algorithm that identifies the junta set and learns the circuit. We compare two schemes for allocating a total energy, E, to the learning algorithm. In the first scheme, each of the T random training coherent states has energy E/T . In the second scheme, a single random MT-mode coherent state with energy E is partitioned into T training coherent states. The latter scheme exhibits a polynomial advantage in training data size sufficient for convergence of the empirical risk to the full risk due to concentration of measure on the (2MT-1)-sphere. Specifically, generalization bounds for both schemes are proven, which indicate that for epsilon-approximation of the full risk by the empirical risk with high probability, O((EM2/3)-M-2/3/& varepsilon;(2/3)) training states are sufficient for the first scheme and O((EM1/3)-M-1/3/& varepsilon;(2/3)) training states are sufficient for the second scheme.

TI SPAHM: the spectrum of approximated Hamiltonian matrices
   representations
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Physics-inspired molecular representations are the cornerstone of similarity-based learning applied to solve chemical problems. Despite their conceptual and mathematical diversity, this class of descriptors shares a common underlying philosophy: they all rely on the molecular information that determines the form of the electronic Schrodinger equation. Existing representations take the most varied forms, from non-linear functions of atom types and positions to atom densities and potential, up to complex quantum chemical objects directly injected into the ML architecture. In this work, we present the spectrum of approximated Hamiltonian matrices (SPA(H)M) as an alternative pathway to construct quantum machine learning representations through leveraging the foundation of the electronic Schrodinger equation itself: the electronic Hamiltonian. As the Hamiltonian encodes all quantum chemical information at once, SPA(H)M representations not only distinguish different molecules and conformations, but also different spin, charge, and electronic states. As a proof of concept, we focus here on efficient SPA(H)M representations built from the eigenvalues of a hierarchy of well-established and readily-evaluated "guess" Hamiltonians. These SPA(H)M representations are particularly compact and efficient for kernel evaluation and their complexity is independent of the number of different atom types in the database.

TI A quantum inspired machine learning approach for multimodal Parkinson's
   disease screening
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Parkinson's disease, currently the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder globally, has seen a 50% increase in cases within just two years. As disease progression impairs speech, memory, and motor functions over time, early diagnosis is crucial for preserving patients' quality of life. Although machine-learning-based detection has shown promise for detecting Parkinson's disease, most studies rely on a single feature for classification and can be error-prone due to the variability of symptoms between patients. To address this limitation we utilized the mPower dataset, which includes 150,000 samples across four key biomarkers: voice, gait, tapping, and demographic data. From these measurements, we extracted 64 features and trained a baseline Random Forest model to select the features above the 80th percentile. For classification, we designed a simulatable quantum support vector machine (qSVM) that detects high-dimensional patterns, leveraging recent advancements in quantum machine learning. With this novel and simulatable architecture that can be run on standard hardware rather than resource-intensive quantum computers, our model achieves an accuracy of 90%, F-1 score of 0.90, and an AUC of 0.98-surpassing benchmark models. Utilizing an innovative classification framework built on a diverse set of features, our model offers a pathway for accessible global Parkinson's screening.

TI Solving the quantum many-body Hamiltonian learning problem with neural
   differential equations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Understanding and characterising quantum many-body dynamics remains a significant challenge due to both the exponential complexity required to represent quantum many-body Hamiltonians, and the need to accurately track states in time under the action of such Hamiltonians. This inherent complexity limits our ability to characterise quantum many-body systems, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to unlock their full potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to solve the Hamiltonian learning (HL) problem -inferring quantum dynamics from many-body state trajectories. Our approach has the unprecedented advantage of distilling and filtering an estimator Hamiltonian from a Neural ODE representation of state trajectories. By distilling Hamiltonian information from Neural ODE onto an ansatz Hamiltonian, our method is reliably convergent, experimentally friendly, and interpretable. In addition to this, we propose a new quantitative benchmark based on power laws, which can objectively compare the reliability and generalisation capabilities of any two HL algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our method against state-of-the-art HL algorithms with a 1D spin- 1/2 chain proof of concept, giving a stable solution for HL on a set of Hamiltonians previously unlearnable in the literature. Code for our method is available and open source.

TI Training quantum Boltzmann machines with the β-variational
   quantum eigensolver
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM) is a generative machine learning model for both classical data and quantum states. Training the QBM consists of minimizing the relative entropy from the model to the target state. This requires QBM expectation values which are computationally intractable for large models in general. It is therefore important to develop heuristic training methods that work well in practice. In this work, we study a heuristic method characterized by a nested loop: the inner loop trains the beta-variational quantum eigensolver (beta-VQE) by Liu et al (2021 Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. 2 025011) to approximate the QBM expectation values; the outer loop trains the QBM to minimize the relative entropy to the target. We show that low-rank representations obtained by beta-VQE provide an efficient way to learn low-rank target states, such as classical data and low-temperature quantum tomography. We test the method on both classical and quantum target data with numerical simulations of up to 10 qubits. For the cases considered here, the obtained QBMs can model the target to high fidelity. We implement a trained model on a physical quantum device. The approach offers a valuable route towards variationally training QBMs on near-term quantum devices.

In this paper, the authors develop a framework to model quantum extreme learning machines, showing that they can be concisely described via single effective measurements, and provide an explicit characterization of the information that can be exactly retrieved using such protocols.
   Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) aim to efficiently post-process the outcome of fixed - generally uncalibrated - quantum devices to solve tasks such as the estimation of the properties of quantum states. The characterisation of their potential and limitations, which is currently lacking, will enable the full deployment of such approaches to problems of system identification, device performance optimization, and state or process reconstruction. We present a framework to model QELMs, showing that they can be concisely described via single effective measurements, and provide an explicit characterisation of the information exactly retrievable with such protocols. We furthermore find a close analogy between the training process of QELMs and that of reconstructing the effective measurement characterising the given device. Our analysis paves the way to a more thorough understanding of the capabilities and limitations of QELMs, and has the potential to become a powerful measurement paradigm for quantum state estimation that is more resilient to noise and imperfections.

TI Quantum degeneracy and spin entanglement in ideal quantum gases
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum degeneracy is the central many-body feature of ideal quantum gases stemming from quantum mechanics. In this work we address its relationship to the most fundamental form of non-classicality in many-body system, i.e. many-body entanglement. We aim at establishing a quantitative link between quantum degeneracy and entanglement in spinful ideal gases, using entanglement witness criteria based on the variance of the collective spin of the spin ensemble. We show that spin-1/2 ideal Bose gases do not possess entanglement which can be revealed from such entanglement criteria. On the contrary, ideal spin-1/2 Fermi gases exhibit spin entanglement revealed by the collective-spin variances upon entering quantum degeneracy, due to the formation of highly non-local spin singlets. We map out the regime of detectable spin entanglement for Fermi gases in free space as well as in a parabolic trap, and probe the robustness of spin entanglement to thermal effects and spin imbalance. Spin entanglement in degenerate Fermi gases is amenable to experimental observation using state-of-the-art spin detection techniques in ultracold atoms.

TI High orbital angular momentum lasing with tunable degree of chirality in
   a symmetry-broken microcavity
SO OPTICA
AB Chiral lasers with orbital angular momenta (OAM) are building blocks in developing high-dimensional integrated photonic devices. However, it remains demanding to arbitrarily manipulate the precise degree of chirality (DOC) and quantum numbers of OAM in microscale lasers. This study reports a strategy to generate OAM microlasers with tunable DOCs and large quantum numbers through a ring-structured Fabry-Perot microcavity with nanoscale symmetry-broken geometry. By exploiting the uneven potential of photons distributed in a microcavity, the dissymmetry factor of OAM laser can be continuously tuned from 1 to C1 by manipulating optical pump positions. High-order OAM with tunable quantum numbers were also demonstrated, in which the largest quantum number reached up to 352. Finally, multivortex laser generation on-chip in spatial and temporal domains was accomplished. This study reveals the fundamental physics of symmetry-broken cavity and provides a simple yet scalable approach for manipulating the chirality of OAM microlasers, offering insights for high-dimensional information processing and optical communications.

TI Kupczynski's Contextual Locally Causal Probabilistic Models Are
   Constrained by Bell's Theorem
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB In a sequence of papers, Marian Kupczynski has argued that Bell's theorem can be circumvented if one takes correct account of contextual setting-dependent parameters describing measuring instruments. We show that this is not true. Despite first appearances, Kupczynksi's concept of a contextual locally causal probabilistic model is mathematically a special case of a Bell local hidden variables model. Thus, even if one takes account of contextuality in the way he suggests, the Bell-CHSH inequality can still be derived. Violation thereof by quantum mechanics cannot be easily explained away: quantum mechanics and local realism (including Kupczynski's claimed enlargement of the concept) are not compatible with one another. Further inspection shows that Kupczynski is actually falling back on the detection loophole. Since 2015, numerous loophole-free experiments have been performed, in which the Bell-CHSH inequality is violated, so, despite any other possible imperfections of such experiments, Kupczynski's escape route for local realism is not available.

TI Chaos and Thermalization in the Spin-Boson Dicke Model
SO ENTROPY
AB We present a detailed analysis of the connection between chaos and the onset of thermalization in the spin-boson Dicke model. This system has a well-defined classical limit with two degrees of freedom, and it presents both regular and chaotic regions. Our studies of the eigenstate expectation values and the distributions of the off-diagonal elements of the number of photons and the number of excited atoms validate the diagonal and off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the chaotic region, thus ensuring thermalization. The validity of the ETH reflects the chaotic structure of the eigenstates, which we corroborate using the von Neumann entanglement entropy and the Shannon entropy. Our results for the Shannon entropy also make evident the advantages of the so-called "efficient basis" over the widespread employed Fock basis when investigating the unbounded spectrum of the Dicke model. The efficient basis gives us access to a larger number of converged states than what can be reached with the Fock basis.

TI Growth of entanglement of generic states under dual-unitary dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Dual-unitary circuits are a class of locally interacting quantum many-body systems displaying unitary dynam-ics also when the roles of space and time are exchanged. These systems have recently emerged as a remarkable framework where certain features of many-body quantum chaos can be studied exactly. In particular, they admit a class of "solvable" initial states for which, in the thermodynamic limit, one can access the full nonequilibrium dynamics. This reveals a surprising property: when a dual-unitary circuit is prepared in a solvable state the quantum entanglement between two complementary spatial regions grows at the maximal speed allowed by the local structure of the evolution. Here we investigate the fate of this property when the system is prepared in a generic pair-product state. We show that in this case, the entanglement increment during a time step is submaximal for finite times, however, it approaches the maximal value in the infinite-time limit. This statement is proven rigorously for dual-unitary circuits generating high enough entanglement, while it is argued to hold for the entire class.

TI Characterizing quantum criticality in the transverse field Ising model
   with staggered Γ interaction
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This study investigates the quantum phase transitions and critical behaviors in the transverse Ising model with staggered Gamma interaction by utilizing the infinite-time evolving block decimation method in the infinite matrix product states representation. The ground-state phase diagram shows that the system exhibits a phase transition from the transverse N & eacute;el phase to the paramagnetic phase as the transverse magnetic field increases, which are characterized by the local magnetization and non-local transverse N & eacute;el order. The chiral order and nematic order are calculated to explore the helical and nematic magnetic structure caused by the Gamma interaction. From the spin-spin correlation, a modulated commensurate power-law oscillating decay behavior provides insight in analyzing the ground state characteristics of each phase. In order to study the quantum criticality, the critical exponents beta, nu and central charge c are extracted and numerically consistent with the Ising class transition, demonstrating that the critical behavior in our model occurs is independent of the emergent Gamma interaction.

TI Non-Hermitian topological quantum states in a reservoir-engineered
   transmon chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Dissipation in open systems enriches the possible symmetries of the Hamiltonians beyond the Hermitian framework, allowing the possibility of novel non-Hermitian topological phases which exhibit long-living end states that are protected against disorder. So far, non-Hermitian topology has been explored in settings where probing genuine quantum effects has been challenging. We theoretically show that a non-Hermitian topological quantum phase can be realized in a reservoir-engineered transmon chain. The spatial modulation of dissipation is obtained by coupling each transmon to a quantum circuit refrigerator, allowing in situ tuning of dissipation strength in a wide range. By solving the many-body Lindblad master equation using a combination of the density matrix renormalization group and Prosen-Seligman third quantization approaches, we show that the topological end modes and the associated phase transition are visible in simple reflection measurements with experimentally realistic parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that genuine quantum effects are observable in this system via robust and slowly decaying long-range quantum entanglement of the topological end modes, which can be generated passively starting from a locally excited transmon.

TI Entanglement and minimal Hilbert space in the classical dual states of
   quantum theory
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
AB A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper, we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach, APL Quantum 2 (2025) 016104, https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0247698 on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are two-fold: entanglement and classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the metaplectic group Mp(n) (minimal representation group, double covering of the symplectic group). The results of this paper are: (1) We compute and analyze entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non-coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: entanglement probabilities P++, P--, P+- (e.g. in the same or in the different subspaces), and the total sum of them. (2) Entanglements in the circle: (i) of orthogonal states are not equal 0 even for the control phase rho = 0 and are preserved for any phase rho not equal pi/2. P+- is separable (entanglement is broken) only if rho = 0. (ii) For coincident states, entanglements are not equal 0 and separable for any control parameter rho not equal 0. If rho = 0, all three P++, P--, P+- vanish. (iii) The entanglements of coset circle states depend on the angles and the coherent complex displacement parameter alpha through a single variable z ' which condition on the disk |z '| < 1 guarantees both analyticity and normalization. (iv) Entanglement classicalization in the circle is stronger for coset states than for non-coset ones: a tail decreasing with increasing n is absent in the non-coset case. (3) Entanglement in the cylinder depends weakly on the angles (phi - phi ') and strongly classicalizes: rapid exponential decay suppression e(-n2) for large n, stronger than in the circle (be coset or not). It expresses in terms of Theta functions & vartheta;(2)(0, e(-8)) and & vartheta;(3)(0,e(-8)) in all classicalization projections in the degeneracy (equal states) limit. (4) Comparison with other (non-Mp(2)) entanglements, as the Schrodinger cat states, show very clear differences (e.g. Figs. [4] and [5]). (5) The antipodal and non-antipodal entanglements (as regulated by the phase control parameter rho = pi and rho = 0, respectively), are clearly different in all types (circle, cylinder, coset or not) of orthogonal states studied here. The antipodal entanglement is the minimal. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.

TI The roles of Kerr nonlinearity in a bosonic quantum neural network
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The emerging technology of quantum neural networks (QNNs) offers a quantum advantage over classical artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of speed or efficiency of information processing tasks. It is well established that nonlinear mapping between input and output is an indispensable feature of classical ANNs, while in a QNN the roles of nonlinearity are not yet fully understood. As one tends to think of QNNs as physical systems, it is natural to think of nonlinear mapping originating from a physical nonlinearity of the system, such as Kerr nonlinearity. Here we investigate the effect of Kerr nonlinearity on a bosonic QNN in the context of both classical (simulating an XOR gate) and quantum (generating Schrodinger cat states) tasks. Aside offering a mechanism of nonlinear input-output mapping, Kerr nonlinearity reduces the effect of noise or losses, which are particularly important to consider in the quantum setting. We note that nonlinear mapping may also be introduced through a nonlinear input-output encoding rather than a physical nonlinearity: for example, an output intensity is already a nonlinear function of input amplitude. While in such cases Kerr nonlinearity is not strictly necessary, it still increases the performance in the face of noise or losses.

TI Universal neural network potentials as descriptors: towards scalable
   chemical property prediction using quantum and classical computers
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Accurate prediction of diverse chemical properties is crucial for advancing molecular design and materials discovery. Here we present a versatile approach that uses the intermediate information of a universal neural network potential as a general-purpose descriptor for chemical property prediction. Our method is based on the insight that by training a sophisticated neural network architecture for universal force fields, it learns transferable representations of atomic environments. We show that transfer learning with graph neural network potentials such as M3GNet and MACE achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods for predicting the NMR chemical shifts by using quantum machine learning as well as a standard classical regression model, despite the compactness of its descriptors. In particular, the MACE descriptor demonstrates the highest accuracy to date on the 13C NMR chemical shift benchmarks for drug molecules. This work provides an efficient way to accurately predict properties, potentially accelerating the discovery of new molecules and materials.
   Using outputs from a pre-trained universal neural network potential's graph layer as descriptors enables efficient and accurate predictions of molecular properties. These descriptors are compact yet perform as well as the best current descriptors.

TI Recursive quantum eigenvalue and singular-value transformation: Analytic
   construction of matrix sign function by Newton iteration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum eigenvalue transformation (QET) and its generalization, quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), are versatile quantum algorithms that allow us to apply broad matrix functions to quantum states, which cover many significant quantum algorithms such as Hamiltonian simulation. However, finding a parameter set which realizes preferable matrix functions in these techniques is difficult for large-scale quantum systems: there is no analytical result other than trivial cases as far as we know and we often suffer also from numerical instability. In this Letter, we propose recursive QET or QSVT (R-QET or R-QSVT) in which we can execute complicated matrix functions by recursively organizing block -encoding by low -degree QET or QSVT. Owing to the simplicity of recursive relations, it works only with a few parameters with exactly determining the parameters, while its iteration results in complicated matrix functions. In particular, by exploiting the recursive relation of Newton iteration, we construct the matrix sign function, which can be applied for eigenstate filtering for example, in a tractable way. We show that an analytically obtained parameter set composed of only eight different values is sufficient for executing QET of the matrix sign function with an arbitrarily small error epsilon. Our protocol will serve as an alternative protocol for constructing QET or QSVT for some useful matrix functions without numerical instability.

AB Designing performant and noise-robust circuits for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is challenging - the design space scales exponentially with circuit size, and there are few well-supported guiding principles for QML circuit design. Although recent Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) methods attempt to search for such circuits, they directly adopt designs from classical Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that are mis-aligned with the unique constraints of quantum hardware, resulting in high search overheads and severe performance bottlenecks.
   We present Elivagar, a novel resource-efficient, noise-guided QCS framework. Elivagar innovates in all three major aspects of QCS - search space, search algorithm and candidate evaluation strategy - to address the design flaws in current classically-inspired QCS methods. Elivagar achieves hardware-efficiency and avoids an expensive circuit-mapping co-search via noise- and device topology-aware candidate generation. By introducing two cheap-to-compute predictors, Clifford noise resilience and representational capacity, Elivagar decouples the evaluation of noise robustness and performance, enabling early rejection of low-fidelity circuits and reducing circuit evaluation costs. Due to its resource-efficiency, Elivagar can further search for data embeddings, significantly improving performance. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of Elivagar on 12 real quantum devices and 9QMLapplications, Elivagar achieves 5.3% higher accuracy and a 271x speedup compared to state-of-the-art QCS methods.

TI Competition between decoherence and purification: Quaternionic
   representation and quaternionic fractals
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB We consider the competition between decoherence processes and an iterated quantum purification protocol. We show that this competition can be modelled by a nonlinear map onto the quaternion space. This nonlinear map has complicated behaviours, inducing a fractal border between the area of the quantum states dominated by the effects of the purification and the area of the quantum states dominated by the effects of the decoherence. The states on the border are unstable. The embedding in a 3D space of this border is like a quaternionic Julia set or a Mandelbulb with a fractal inner structure. Qubits are the resource of the quantum information as bits for the classical information, and are the main subject for future technologies as quantum computers. In contrast with bits, qubits exhibit states which are impossible at a classical level as Schrodinger cat states (the qubit is in a superposition of 0 and 1). These purely quantum properties are the resource to drastically increase the performance of the computing. But the noises of the environ-ment generate a physical process called decoherence which suppresses the purely quantum properties. There is a protocol, called purification, which permits to restore the quantum behaviour. The result of the competition be-tween a permanent decoherence process and a repeated purification protocol is not simple because this generates a chaotic process. We show that this one is a generalisation of the famous Julia map (which generates the famous fractals known as the Julia and the Mandelbrot sets). More precisely, in place of a map of the complex plane, the decoherence-purification competition map is a map of the quaternionic space (so-called Hamilton's number set, which are numbers which do not commute, i.e. zw1/4 wz with z and w two quaternions). The decoherence-purification map generates 3D fractal sets similar to a Mandelbulb (3D generalisation of a Mandel-brot set) with a fractal inner structure.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Turing video-based cognitive tests to handle entangled concepts
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We have proved in both human-based and computer-based tests that natural concepts generally 'entangle' when they combine to form complex sentences, violating the rules of classical compositional semantics. In this article, we present the results of an innovative video-based cognitive test on a specific conceptual combination, which significantly violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt version of Bell's inequalities ('CHSH inequality'). We also show that collected data can be faithfully modelled within a quantum-theoretic framework elaborated by ourselves and a 'strong form of entanglement' occurs between the component concepts. While the video-based test confirms previous empirical results on entanglement in human cognition, our empirical approach surpasses language barriers and eliminates the need for prior knowledge, enabling universal accessibility. Finally, this transformative methodology allows one to unravel the underlying connections that drive our perception of reality. As a matter of fact, we provide a novel explanation for the appearance of entanglement in both physics and cognitive realms.

TI Thermally controlled optical resonator for vacuum squeezed states
   separation
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB Future gravitational-wave detectors will use frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum states to obtain broadband reduction of quantum noise. Quantum noise is one of the major limitations to the sensitivity of these detectors. Advanced LIGO+, Advanced Virgo+, and KAGRA plan to generate frequency-dependent squeezed states by coupling a frequency-independent squeezed light state with a filter cavity. An alternative technique is under consideration, based on conditional squeezing with quantum entanglement: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) squeezing. In the EPR scheme, two vacuum entangled states, the signal field at omega(0) and the idler field at omega(0) + Delta, must be spatially separated with an optical resonator and sent to two separate homodyne detectors. In this framework, we have designed and tested a solid Fabry-Perot etalon, to be used in an EPR table-top experiment prototype, thermally controlled without the use of a control probe optical beam. This device can also be used in optical experiments where the use of a bright beam to control an optical resonator is not possible, or where a simpler optical device is preferred.

TI Characterizations of strongly entanglement breaking channels for
   infinite-dimensional quantum systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Entanglement breaking (EB) channels, as completely positive and trace-preserving linear operators, sever the entanglement between the input system and other systems. In the realm of infinite-dimensional systems, a related concept known as strongly EB (SEB) channels emerges. This paper delves into characterizations of SEB channels, delineating sufficient conditions for a channel to be classified as SEB, especially with respect to the commutativity of its range. Moreover, we demonstrate that every closed self-adjoint subspace of trace-zero operators, with the trace norm, is the null space of a SEB channel.

TI Residual matrix product state for machine learning
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Tensor network, which originates from quantum physics, is emerging as an efficient tool for classical and quantum machine learning. Nevertheless, there still exists a consider-able accuracy gap between tensor network and the sophisticated neural network models for classical machine learning. In this work, we combine the ideas of matrix product state (MPS), the simplest tensor network structure, and residual neural network and propose the residual matrix product state (ResMPS). The ResMPS can be treated as a network where its layers map the "hidden" features to the outputs (e.g., classifications), and the variational parameters of the layers are the functions of the features of the sam-ples (e.g., pixels of images). This is different from neural network, where the layers map feed-forwardly the features to the output. The ResMPS can equip with the non-linear ac-tivations and dropout layers, and outperforms the state-of-the-art tensor network models in terms of efficiency, stability, and expression power. Besides, ResMPS is interpretable from the perspective of polynomial expansion, where the factorization and exponential machines naturally emerge. Our work contributes to connecting and hybridizing neu-ral and tensor networks, which is crucial to further enhance our understanding of the working mechanisms and improve the performance of both models.

TI Quantum variational algorithms are swamped with traps
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB One of the most important properties of classical neural networks is how surprisingly trainable they are, though their training algorithms typically rely on optimizing complicated, nonconvex loss functions. Previous results have shown that unlike the case in classical neural networks, variational quantum models are often not trainable. The most studied phenomenon is the onset of barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically when the models are very deep. This focus on barren plateaus has made the phenomenon almost synonymous with the trainability of quantum models. Here, we show that barren plateaus are only a part of the story. We prove that a wide class of variational quantum models-which are shallow, and exhibit no barren plateaus-have only a superpolynomially small fraction of local minima within any constant energy from the global minimum, rendering these models untrainable if no good initial guess of the optimal parameters is known. We also study the trainability of variational quantum algorithms from a statistical query framework, and show that noisy optimization of a wide variety of quantum models is impossible with a sub-exponential number of queries. Finally, we numerically confirm our results on a variety of problem instances. Though we exclude a wide variety of quantum algorithms here, we give reason for optimism for certain classes of variational algorithms and discuss potential ways forward in showing the practical utility of such algorithms.

TI Entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology: From standard quantum limit to
   Heisenberg limit
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology explores the utilization of quantum entanglement to enhance measurement precision. When particles in a probe are prepared into a suitable quantum entangled state, they may collectively accumulate information about the physical quantity to be measured, leading to an improvement in measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit and approaching the Heisenberg limit. The rapid advancement of techniques for quantum manipulation and detection has enabled the generation, manipulation, and detection of multi-particle entangled states in synthetic quantum systems such as cold atoms and trapped ions. This article aims to review and illustrate the fundamental principles and experimental progresses that demonstrate multi-particle entanglement for quantum metrology, as well as discuss the potential applications of entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors.

TI Energy preservation of a motion-assisted quantum battery in a lossy
   cavity
SO CHINESE OPTICS
AB As a potential alternative energy source in the quantum regime, a quantum battery inevitably experiences a process where the extracted work decreases due to the environmental decoherence. To inhibit the energy dissipation, we have put forward a scheme of a moving atom battery in a lossy cavity coupled to a structured environment. We investigate the dynamics of the maximally extracted work called the ergotropy by the open quantum system approach. It is found out that the decay of quantum work is significantly retarded in the non-Markovian environment. In contrast to the static case, the storage performance of the quantum battery is improved when the atom is in motion. The effect of energy preservation becomes more pronounced at higher velocities. Both the momery effect and motion control can play a positive role in extending the discharge lifetime. In addition, we have investigated the effects of environmental temperature, random noises, and quantum entanglement. These present results provides a feasible protocol for the open quantum battery.

TI Structural and electronic properties of NV0 and
   NV- centers in diamond under uniaxial strain: a
   first-principles study
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB Strain engineering, a pivotal method for tuning material properties, shows great promise in extending the application scope of wide-band-gap semiconductors such as diamond. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, an important defect system in diamond, are generally present in either a neutral (NV0) or a negative charge state (NV-). The spin-triplet nature of the NV- state makes it a powerful platform for quantum sensing. However, the reliability of NV-center-based quantum sensing is subjected to the charge state transition between NV0 and NV- states, and it is of fundamental importance to provide precise control of the charge state of NV centers and to enhance the stability of the NV- state. Here, we systematically investigated the influence of uniaxial strain applied in the [100], [110], and [111] crystallographic directions on the electronic structure and charge state stability of NV color centers through first-principles calculations. We found that uniaxial strain can exert a significant impact on the stability of the NV0 and NV- centers, and the impact is highly dependent on the crystallographic orientation. In particular, the application of tensile strain along the [100] and [110] directions can result in a remarkable enhancement of the stability of the desired NV- state. Based on thorough analyses of the band structure and density of states (DOS), we elucidated the underlying electronic mechanism by which strain modulates the properties of NV centers.

TI Minimizing Estimation Runtime on Noisy Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The number of measurements demanded by hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is prohibitively high for many problems of practical value. For such problems, realizing quantum advantage will require methods that dramatically reduce this cost. Previous quantum algorithms that reduce the measurement cost (e.g., quantum amplitude and phase estimation) require error rates that are too low for near-term implementation. Here we propose methods that take advantage of the available quantum coherence to maximally enhance the power of sampling on noisy quantum devices, reducing the measurement number and runtime compared to the standard sampling method of the VQE. Our scheme derives inspiration from quantum metrology, phase estimation, and the more recent "alpha-VQE" proposal, arriving at a general formulation that is robust to error and does not require ancilla qubits. The central object of this method is what we call the "engineered likelihood function" (ELF), used for carrying out Bayesian inference. We show how the ELF formalism enhances the rate of information gain in sampling as the physical hardware transitions from the regime of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers to that of quantum error-corrected ones. This technique speeds up a central component of many quantum algorithms, with applications including chemistry, materials, finance, and beyond. Similar to the VQE, we expect small-scale implementations to be realizable on today's quantum devices.

TI Kernel density matrices for probabilistic deep learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper introduces a novel approach to probabilistic deep learning, kernel density matrices, which provide a simpler yet effective mechanism for representing joint probability distributions of both continuous and discrete random variables. In quantum mechanics, a density matrix is the most general way to describe the state of a quantum system. This work extends the concept of density matrices by allowing them to be defined in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This abstraction allows the construction of differentiable models for density estimation, inference, and sampling, and enables their integration into end-to-end deep neural models. In doing so, we provide a versatile representation of marginal and joint probability distributions that allows us to develop a differentiable, compositional, and reversible inference procedure that covers a wide range of machine learning tasks, including density estimation, discriminative learning, and generative modeling. The broad applicability of the framework is illustrated by two examples: an image classification model that can be naturally transformed into a conditional generative model, and a model for learning with label proportions that demonstrates the framework's ability to deal with uncertainty in the training samples. The framework is implemented as a library and is available at: https://github.com/fagonzalezo/kdm.

TI Android-SEM: Generative Adversarial Network for Android Malware Semantic
   Enhancement Model Based on Transfer Learning
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Currently, among the millions of Android applications, there exist numerous malicious programs that pose significant threats to people's security and privacy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop approaches for detecting Android malware. Recently developed malware detection methods usually rely on various features, such as application programming interface (API) sequences, images, and permissions, thereby ignoring the importance of source code and the associated comments, which are not usually included in malware. Therefore, we propose Android-SEM, which is an Android source code semantic enhancement model based on transfer learning. Our proposed model is built upon the Transformer architecture to achieve a pretraining framework for generating code comments from malware source code. The performance of the pretraining framework is optimized using a generative adversarial network. Our proposed model relies on a novel regression model-based filter to retain high-quality comments and source code for feature fusion pertinent to semantic enhancement. Creatively, and contrary to conventional methods, we incorporated a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) for classifying malicious Android code by combining quantum machine learning and classical deep learning models. The results proved that Android-SEM achieves accuracy levels of 99.55% and 99.01% for malware detection and malware categorization, respectively.

TI Anomaly detection with variational quantum generative adversarial
   networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a machine learning framework comprising a generative model for sampling from a target distribution and a discriminative model for evaluating the proximity of a sample to the target distribution. GANs exhibit strong performance in imaging or anomaly detection. However, they suffer from training instabilities, and sampling efficiency may be limited by the classical sampling procedure. We introduce variational quantum-classical Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to address these issues and embed this model in a classical machine learning framework for anomaly detection. Classical WGANs improve training stability by using a cost function better suited for gradient descent. Our model replaces the generator of WGANs with a hybrid quantum-classical neural net and leaves the classical discriminative model unchanged. This way, high-dimensional classical data only enters the classical model and need not be prepared in a quantum circuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a credit card fraud dataset. For this dataset our method shows performance on par with classical methods in terms of the F-1 score. We analyze the influence of the circuit ansatz, layer width and depth, neural net architecture parameter initialization strategy, and sampling noise on convergence and performance.

TI Lowering the exponential wall: accelerating high-entropy alloy catalysts
   screening using local surface energy descriptors from neural network
   potentials
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. We established a correlation between LSE and adsorption energies using monometallic systems. Using this correlation in a linear regression model, we successfully estimated molecular adsorption energies on HEAs with significantly higher accuracy than a conventional descriptor (i.e., generalized coordination numbers). Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.

TI Selected machine learning of HOMO-LUMO gaps with improved
   data-efficiency
SO MATERIALS ADVANCES
AB Despite their relevance for organic electronics, quantum machine learning (QML) models of molecular electronic properties, such as HOMO-LUMO-gaps, often struggle to achieve satisfying data-efficiency as measured by decreasing prediction errors for increasing training set sizes. We demonstrate that partitioning training sets into different chemical classes prior to training results in independently trained QML models with overall reduced training data needs. For organic molecules drawn from previously published QM7 and QM9-data-sets we have identified and exploited three relevant classes corresponding to compounds containing either aromatic rings and carbonyl groups, or single unsaturated bonds, or saturated bonds The selected QML models of band-gaps (considered at GW and hybrid DFT levels of theory) reach mean absolute prediction errors of similar to 0.1 eV for up to an order of magnitude fewer training molecules than for QML models trained on randomly selected molecules. Comparison to Delta-QML models of band-gaps indicates that selected QML exhibit superior data-efficiency. Our findings suggest that selected QML, e.g. based on simple classifications prior to training, could help to successfully tackle challenging quantum property screening tasks of large libraries with high fidelity and low computational burden.

AB Marvel's cinematic depiction of the Infinity Stones, six powerful artifacts capable of reshaping reality, offers a unique lens through which to explore the convergence of science, philosophy, and popular culture. In this article, we investigate the cosmological significance of the Infinity Stones within the Marvel multiverse, drawing parallels between their fictional abilities and real scientific phenomena. Our analysis reveals speculative yet intriguing connections between the Stones and scientific concepts, such as wormholes, quantum entanglement, and the nature of time. Additionally, we explore profound philosophical implications stemming from the Stones' existence, including moral dilemmas, questions of personal identity, and the nature of consciousness. This exploration challenges conventional thinking, prompting contemplation on the essence of life and the consequences of wielding immense power. Marvel's incorporation of science, philosophy, and popular culture not only captivates a broad audience but also inspires curiosity, critical thinking, and cultural discourse. By uniting these themes in compelling narratives, the Marvel Cinematic Universe enriches our comprehension of the mysteries and wonders of the cosmos.

TI Multipartite information of free fermions on Hamming graphs
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB We investigate multipartite information and entanglement measures in the ground state of a free-fermion model defined on a Hamming graph. Using the known diagonalization of the adjacency matrix, we solve the model and construct the ground-state correlation matrix. Moreover, we find all the eigenvalues of the chopped correlation matrix when the subsystem consists of n disjoint Hamming subgraphs embedded in a larger one. These results allow us to find an exact formula for the entanglement entropy of disjoint graphs, as well as for the mutual and tripartite information. We use the exact formulas for these measures to extract their asymptotic behavior in two distinct thermodynamic limits, and find excellent match with the numerical calculations. In particular, we find that the entanglement entropy admits a logarithmic violation of the area law which decreases the amount of entanglement compared to the area law scaling. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI Essential Role of Destructive Interference in the Gravitationally
   Induced Entanglement
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB The gravitationally induced entanglement is a type of quantum entanglement that can be generated between two mesoscopic particles using their Newtonian gravitational interaction. It has attracted a great deal of attention as a new platform for studying quantum aspects of gravity. The present paper analyzes the gravitationally induced entanglement as a pure interference effect and shows that the entanglement is induced solely by a sign change associated with the destructive quantum interference. It is also shown that when the entanglement is non-maximal, the preparation for destructive interference for one of the particles can recover a maximum visibility interference pattern for the other particle. Therefore, the non-maximally entangled state can be extremely effective for experimental testing since it can help in reducing requirements (on masses of the particles and their interaction duration, separation distances and sources) and preserve the information about entanglement at the same time. As a result, the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio is demonstrated and a parameter that determines minimal requirements for experimental testing is defined.

TI Modeling Non-adiabatic Dynamics in Nanoscale and Condensed Matter
   Systems
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB Rapid, far-from-equilibrium processes involving excitation of electronic, vibrational, spin, photon, topological, and other degrees of freedom form the basis of modem technologies, including electronics and optoelectronics, solar energy harvesting and conversion to electrical and chemical energy, quantum information processing, spin- and valleytronics, chemical detection, and medical therapies. Such processes are studied experimentally with various time-resolved spectroscopies that allow scientists to track system's evolution on ultrafast time scales and at close to atomistic level of detail. The availability of various forms of lasing has made such measurements easily accessible to many experimental groups worldwide, to study atoms and small molecules, nanoscale and condensed matter systems, proteins, cells, and mesoscopic materials. The experimental work necessitates parallel theoretical efforts needed to interpret the experiments and to provide insights that cannot be gained through measurements due to experimental limitations.
   Non-adiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics (MD) allows one to study processes at the atomistic level and in the time domain most directly mimicking the time-resolved experiments. Atomistic modeling takes full advantage of chemical intuition and principles that guide design and fabrication of molecules and materials. It provides atomistic origins of quasi-particles, such as holes, excitons, trions, plasmons, phonons, polarons, polaritons, spin-waves, momentum-resolved and topological states, electrically and magnetically polarized structures, and other abstract concepts. An atomistic description enables one to study realistic aspects of materials, which necessarily contain defects, dopants, surfaces, interfaces, passivating ligands, and solvent layers. Often, such realistic features govern material properties and are hard to account for phenomenologically. NA-MD requires few approximations and assumptions. It does not need to assume that atomic motions are harmonic, that electrons are Drude oscillators, that coupling between different degrees of freedom is weak, that dynamics is Markovian or has short memory, or that evolution occurs by exponential kinetics of transitions between few states. The classical or semiclassical treatment of atomic motions constitutes the main approximation of NA-MD and is used because atoms are 3-5 orders of magnitude heavier than electrons. NA-MD is limited by system size, typically hundreds or thousands of atoms, and time scale, picoseconds to nanoseconds. The quality of NA-MD simulations depends on the electronic structure method used to obtain excited state energies and NA couplings.
   NA-MD has been largely popularized and advanced in the chemistry community that focuses on molecules. Modeling far-from-equilibrium dynamics in nanoscale and condensed matter systems often has to account for other types of physics. At the same time, condensed phase NA-MD allows for approximations that may not work in molecules. Focusing on the recent NA-MD developments aimed at studying excited state processes in nanoscale and condensed phases, this Account considers how the phenomena important on the nanoscale can be incorporated into NA-MD and what approximations can be made to increase its efficiency with complex systems and processes.

TI Non-Hermitian interacting quantum walks of correlated photons
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), referring to the anomalous localization of eigenstates, has been widely discussed in single-particle systems. However, the interplay between the interacting NHSE and the quantum optical phenomena remains elusive. Here, We present the non-Hermitian quantum walks of strongly correlated photon pairs. Through studying the dynamic behavior of the photon pairs in the nonreciprocal Bose-Hubbard chain, we theoretically demonstrate the interplay between interactions and the NHSE. When launching two non-entangled photons, the photons exhibit the nonreciprocal bunching effect, which can be suppressed by the interactions. When launching two path-entangled photons, the interactions can not only suppress but reverse the nonreciprocal bunching. In stark contrast to the common wisdom that the NHSE suppresses the entanglement of the quantum many-body system, the entanglement of the photons here can be significantly enhanced. Our results reveal that many-body interactions and entanglement significantly restrain the non-Hermitian nonreciprocal quantum dynamics, offering insights into the interplay between many-body quantum entanglement and non-Hermitian physics.

TI Holographic entanglement negativity and replica symmetry breaking
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Since the work of Ryu and Takayanagi, deep connections between quantum entanglement and spacetime geometry have been revealed. The negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of a bipartite density operator is a useful diagnostic of entanglement. In this paper, we discuss the properties of the associated entanglement negativity and its Renyi generalizations in holographic duality. We first review the definition of the Renyi negativities, which contain the familiar logarithmic negativity as a special case. We then study these quantities in the random tensor network model and rigorously derive their large bond dimension asymptotics. Finally, we study entanglement negativity in holographic theories with a gravity dual, where we find that Renyi negativities are often dominated by bulk solutions that break the replica symmetry. From these replica symmetry breaking solutions, we derive general expressions for Renyi negativities and their special limits including the logarithmic negativity. In fixed-area states, these general expressions simplify dramatically and agree precisely with our results in the random tensor network model. This provides a concrete setting for further studying the implications of replica symmetry breaking in holography.

TI Enhancing Financial Time Series Prediction with Quantum-Enhanced
   Synthetic Data Generation: A Case Study on the S&P 500 Using a Quantum
   Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Approach with a Gradient
   Penalty
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This study introduces a novel Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network approach with a Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP) model that leverages a quantum generator alongside a classical discriminator to synthetically generate time series data. This approach aims to accurately replicate the statistical properties of the S&P 500 index. The synthetic data generated by this model were compared to the original series using various metrics, including Wasserstein distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, and entropy measures, among others. The outcomes demonstrate the model's robustness, with the generated data exhibiting a high degree of fidelity to the statistical characteristics of the original data. Additionally, this study explores the applicability of the synthetic time series in enhancing prediction models. An LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)-based model was developed to evaluate the impact of incorporating synthetic data on forecasting accuracy, particularly focusing on general trends and extreme market events. The findings reveal that models trained on a mix of synthetic and real data significantly outperform those trained solely on historical data, improving predictive performance.

TI Quantum autoencoder implementation of high-dimensional steganographic
   encoding for arbitrary quantum states
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB While classical steganography achieves maturity in digital media, hiding arbitrary quantum states (alpha|0 >+beta|1 >) has emerged as an intriguing frontier. To address this problem, we establish a formal model of controllable random perturbation unitaries for single/multi-stego state tasks. We progressively explore Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) structures through three stages: starting from single-state scenarios without perturbation, advancing to perturbed conditions, and finally extending to multi-state tasks. We design two perturbation-based encoding schemes using Quantum Autoencoders (QAE): the simple scheme (QAE-DD) leverages the inverse application of encoding-decoding modules, while the improved scheme (QAE-OSP) incorporates orthogonal projection routing and parallel subnetworks to restructure the hidden-layer architecture. In 3-qubit entangled-state simulations with data scales n <= 10 and perturbation strengths epsilon is an element of [0,1], QAE-DD performs well under low perturbation, whereas QAE-OSP maintains higher fidelity between the carrier and secret states under high perturbation conditions (e.g., n=5, epsilon=0.6), with fidelity values F(rho(stego),rho(stego)=0.91/ F(rho S,rho S)=0.84 providing a reference for network design. Finally, we extend the single-carrier ("1+1") task to the multi-carrier ("1+N") scenario by constructing a "centroid" state training set based on the principal component of carrier-state groups and validating the applicability of both models. Under the conditions n=5 and epsilon=0.6, the QAE-OSP model successfully improves the average fidelity between multiple secret states and carrier states from 0.68 to 0.90, demonstrating its capability to aggregate multiple carriers to enhance overall concealment. Although the present study covers only small-scale data and networks, it lays the groundwork for a neural network framework that covertly embeds arbitrary quantum states into high-dimensional quantum states, providing a basis for future exploration.

TI On the power of one pure steered state for EPR-steering with a pair of
   qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB As originally introduced, the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) phenomenon was the ability of one party (Alice) to steer, by her choice between two measurement settings, the quantum system of another party (Bob) into two distinct ensembles of pure states. As later formalized as a quantum information task, EPR-steering can be shown even when the distinct ensembles comprise mixed states, provided they are pure enough and different enough. Consider the scenario where Alice and Bob each have a qubit and Alice performs dichotomic projective measurements. In this case, the states in the ensembles to which she can steer form the surface of an ellipsoid E in Bob's Bloch ball. Further, let the steering ellipsoid e have nonzero volume (as it must if the qubits are entangled). It has previously been shown that if Alice's first measurement setting yields an ensemble comprising two pure states, then this, plus any one other measurement setting, will demonstrate EPR-steering. Here we consider what one can say if the ensemble from Alice's first setting contains only one pure state p ? e, occurring with probability p(p). Using projective geometry, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition analytically for Alice to be able to demonstrate EPR-steering of Bob's state using this and some second setting, when the two ensembles from these lie in a given plane. Based on this, we show that, for a given e, if p(p) is high enough [p(p) > p(max)(e) ? [0, 1)] then any distinct second setting by Alice is sufficient to demonstrate EPR-steering. Similarly, we derive a p(min)(e) such that p(p) > p(min)(e) is necessary for Alice to demonstrate EPR-steering using only the first setting and some other setting. Moreover, the expressions we derive are tight; for spherical steering ellipsoids, the bounds coincide: p(max)(e) = p(min)(e).

TI Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of
   tensor networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent z of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.

TI Entanglement and Fisher Information for Atoms-Field System in the

SO ENTROPY
AB We developed a quantum scheme of two atoms (TAs) and field initially in a negative binomial state (NBS). We displayed and discussed the physical implications of the obtained results in terms of the physical parameters of the model. By considering that the TAs were initially prepared in a maximally entangled state, and that the single-mode field was in the NBS, the dynamics of quantum phenomena such TAs-field entanglement, TAs entanglement, and parameter estimation were examined. We found that the quantum quantifiers exhibited randomly quasi-periodic and periodic oscillations that depended on the success probability, photon number transition, and the intensity-dependent coupling effect. Furthermore, we analyzed the connection between the dynamical behavior of the quantifiers. This system can be compared with some other ones that are being discussed in the literature, in order to realize the quantum entanglement, and to control the precision of the parameter estimation.

SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We provide a graphical calculus for computing averages of tensor network diagrams with respect to the distribution of random vectors containing independent uniform complex phases. Our method exploits the order structure of the partially ordered set of uniform block permutations. A similar calculus is developed for random vectors consisting of independent uniform signs, based on the combinatorics of the partially ordered set of even partitions. We employ our method to extend some of the results by Johnston and MacLean on the family of local diagonal unitary invariant matrices. Furthermore, our graphical approach applies just as well to the real (orthogonal) case, where we introduce the notion of triplewise complete positivity to study the condition for separability of the relevant bipartite matrices. Finally, we analyze the twirling of linear maps between matrix algebras by independent diagonal unitary matrices, showcasing another application of our method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI Many-body physics in small systems: Observing the onset and saturation
   of correlation in linear atomic chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The exact study of small systems can guide us toward relevant measures for extracting information about many-body physics as we move to larger and more complex systems capable of quantum information processing or quantum analog simulation. We use exact diagonalization to study many electrons in short one-dimensional atom chains represented by long-range extended Hubbard-like models. We introduce a measure, the single-particle excitation content (SPEC) of an eigenstate and show that the functional dependence of the SPEC on the eigenstate number reveals the nature of the ground state (ordered phases), and the onset and saturation of correlation between the electrons as Coulomb interaction strength increases. We use this SPEC behavior to identify five regimes as interaction is increased: A noninteracting single-particle regime, a regime of perturbative Coulomb interaction in which the SPEC is a nearly universal function of eigenstate number, the onset and saturation of correlation, a regime of fully correlated states in which hopping is a perturbation, and the SPEC is a different universal function of state number and the regime of no hopping. In particular, the behavior of the SPEC shows that when electron-electron correlation plays a minor role, all of the lowest-energy eigenstates are made up primarily of single-particle excitations of the ground state, and as the Coulomb interaction increases, the lowest-energy eigenstates increasingly contain many-particle excitations. In addition, the SPEC highlights a fundamental distinct difference between a noninteracting system and one with minute very weak interactions. Although the SPEC is a quantity that can be calculated for small exactly diagonalizable systems, it guides our intuition for larger systems, suggesting the nature of excitations and their distribution in the spectrum. Thus, this function, such as correlation functions or order parameters, provides us with a window of intuition about the behavior of a physical system.

TI Hole spectral function of a chiral spin liquid in the triangular lattice
   Hubbard model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum spin liquids are fascinating phases of matter, hosting fractionalized spin excitations and unconventional long-range quantum entanglement. These exotic properties, however, also render their experimental characterization challenging, and finding ways to diagnose quantum spin liquids is therefore a pertinent challenge. Here, we numerically compute the spectral function of a single hole doped into the half-filled Hubbard model on the triangular lattice using techniques based on matrix product states. At half-filling the system has been proposed to realize a chiral spin liquid at intermediate interaction strength, surrounded by a magnetically ordered phase at strong interactions and a superconducting/metallic phase at weak interactions. We find that the spectra of these phases exhibit distinct signatures. By developing appropriate parton mean-field descriptions, we gain insight into the relevant low-energy features. While the magnetic phase is characterized by a dressed hole moving through the ordered spin background, we find indications of spinon dynamics in the chiral spin liquid. Our results suggest that the hole spectral function, as measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, provides a useful tool to characterize quantum spin liquids.

TI Quantum optical reservoir computing powered by boson sampling
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB It is well known that boson sampling, a restricted non-universal quantum computation model, enables one to perform tasks that are hard to accomplish with digital computers. Boson sampling is associated with sampling the probability distribution of identical bosons passing through a random interferometer, and its quantum advantage has been demonstrated. It has, however, proven elusive to use such a model for practical applications. In this work, we show that the random interferometer powering boson sampling can be used to generate the complex dynamics necessary for quantum reservoir computing. We use these dynamics to perform various image recognition problems, illustrating the utility of the approach even for modest-size systems.

TI Low overhead universality and quantum supremacy using only Z control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider a model of quantum computation we call "varying Z" (VZ), defined by applying controllable Z-diagonal Hamiltonians in the presence of a uniform and constant external X field, and prove that it is universal, even in one dimension. Universality is demonstrated by construction of a universal gate set with O(1) depth overhead. We then use this construction to describe a circuit whose output distribution cannot be classically simulated unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, with the goal of providing a low-resource method of demonstrating quantum supremacy. The VZ model can achieve quantum supremacy in O(n) depth in one dimension, equivalent to the random circuit sampling models despite a higher degree of homogeneity: it requires no individually addressed X control.

TI Near-Zero Index Photonic Crystals with Directive Bound States in the
   Continuum
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Near-zero-index platforms arise as a new opportunity for light manipulation with boosting of optical nonlinearities, transmission properties in waveguides, and constant phase distribution. In addition, they represent a solution to impedance mismatch faced in photonic circuitry offering several applications in quantum photonics, communication, and sensing. However, their realization is limited to the availability of materials that could exhibit such low index. For materials used in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, the intrinsic losses annihilate most of near-zero index properties. The design of all-dielectric photonic crystals with specific electromagnetic modes overcomes the issue of intrinsic losses while showing effective mode index near zero. Nonetheless, these modes strongly radiate to the surrounding environment, greatly limiting the devices applications. Here, a novel all-dielectric photonic crystal structure is explored that is able to sustain effective near-zero-index modes coupled to directive bound-states in the continuum in order to decrease radiative losses, opening extraordinary opportunities for radiation manipulation in nanophotonic circuits. Moreover, its relatively simple design and phase stability facilitate integration and reproducibility with other photonic components.

TI Enhancing a Many-Body Dipolar Rydberg Tweezer Array with Arbitrary Local
   Controls
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We implement and characterize a protocol that enables arbitrary local controls in a dipolar atom array, where the degree of freedom is encoded in a pair of Rydberg states. Our approach relies on a combination of local addressing beams and global microwave fields. Using this method, we directly prepare two different types of three-atom entangled states, including a W state and a state exhibiting finite chirality. We verify the nature of the underlying entanglement by performing quantum state tomography. Finally, leveraging our ability to measure multibasis, multibody observables, we explore the adiabatic preparation of low-energy states in a frustrated geometry consisting of a pair of triangular plaquettes. By using local addressing to tune the symmetry of the initial state, we demonstrate the ability to prepare correlated states distinguished only by correlations of their chirality (a fundamentally six-body observable). Our protocol is generic, allowing for rotations on arbitrary sub-groups of atoms within the array at arbitrary times during the experiment; this extends the scope of capabilities for quantum simulations of the dipolar XY model.

TI Effects of quantum quench on entanglement dynamics in antiferromagnetic
   Ising model
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We study the relationship between quench dynamics of entanglement and quantum phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Ising model with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction by using the quantum renormalization-group method and the definition of negativity. Two types of quench protocols (i) adding the DM interaction suddenly and (ii) rotating the spins around x axis are considered to drive the dynamics of the system, respectively. By comparing the behaviors of entanglement in both types of quench protocols, the effects of quench on dynamics of entanglement are studied. It is found that there is the same characteristic time at which the negativity firstly reaches its maximum although the system shows different dynamical behaviors. Especially, the characteristic time can accurately reflect the quantum phase transition from antiferromagnetic to saturated chiral phases in the system. In addition, the correlation length exponent can be obtained by exploring the nonanalytic and scaling behaviors of the derivative of the characteristic time.

TI Fabrication of quantum dot and ring arrays by direct laser interference
   patterning for nanophotonics
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Epitaxially grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rings (QRs) have been demonstrated to be excellent sources of single photons and entangled photon pairs enabling applications within quantum photonics. The emerging field of QD-based nanophotonics requires the deterministic integration of single or multiple QD structures into photonic architectures. However, the natural inhomogeneity and spatial randomness of self-assembled QDs limit their potential, and the reliable formation of homogeneous and ordered QDs during epitaxy still presents a challenge. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of regular arrays of single III-V QDs and QRs using molecular beam epitaxy assisted by in situ direct laser interference patterning. Both droplet epitaxy (DE) GaAs/AlGaAs QDs and QRs and Stranski-Krastanov (SK) InAs/GaAs QDs are presented. The resulting QD structures exhibit high uniformity and good optical quality, in which a record-narrow photoluminescence linewidth of similar to 17 meV from patterned GaAs QD arrays is achieved. Such QD and QR arrays fabricated through this novel optical technique constitute a next-generation platform for functional nanophotonic devices and act as useful building blocks for the future quantum revolution.

TI Temperature Fluctuations Compensation with Multi-Frequency Synchronous
   Manipulation for a NV Magnetometer in Fiber-Optic Scheme
SO SENSORS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds play a large role in advanced quantum sensing with solid-state spins for potential miniaturized and portable application scenarios. With the temperature sensitivity of NV centers, the temperature fluctuations caused by the unknown environment and the system itself will mix with the magnetic field measurement. In this research, the temperature-sensitive characteristics of different diamonds, alongside the temperature noise generated by a measurement system, were tested and analyzed with a homemade NV magnetometer in a fiber-optic scheme. In this work, a multi-frequency synchronous manipulation method for resonating with the NV centers in all axial directions was proposed to compensate for the temperature fluctuations in a fibered NV magnetic field sensing scheme. The symmetrical features of the resonance lines of the NV centers, the common-mode fluctuations including temperature fluctuations, underwent effective compensation and elimination. The fluorescence change was reduced to 1.0% by multi-frequency synchronous manipulation from 5.5% of the single-frequency manipulation within a +/- 2 degrees C temperature range. Additionally, the multi-frequency synchronous manipulation improved the fluorescence contrast and the magnetic field measurement SNR through an omnidirectional manipulation scheme. It was very important to compensate for the temperature fluctuations, caused by both internal and external factors, to make use of the NV magnetometer in fiber-optic schemes' practicality. This work will promote the rapid development and widespread applications of quantum sensing based on various systems and principles.

TI Characterizing the generalized Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state and
   extensions
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB In their seminal paper, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) had introduced a momentum-entangled state for two particles. That state, referred to as the EPR state, has been widely used in studies on entangled particles with continuous degrees of freedom. Later that state was generalized to a form that allows varying degree of entanglement, known as the generalized EPR state. In a suitable limit it reduces to the EPR state. The generalized EPR state is theoretically analyzed here and its entanglement quantified in terms of a recently introduced generalized entanglement measure. This state can also be applied to entangled photons produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The present analysis is then used in quantifying the entanglement of photons produced from the SPDC process, in terms of certain experimental parameters. A comparison is also made with the Schmidt number, which is normally used as an entanglement measure in such situations. A procedure for experimentally determining the entanglement of SPDC photons has also been described. Furthermore, an additional state exhibiting non-Gaussian entanglement has been examined, and its entanglement has been quantified.

TI Partial-norm of entanglement: entanglement monotones that are not
   monogamous
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement is known to be monogamous, i.e. it obeys strong constraints on how the entanglement can be distributed among multipartite systems. Almost all the entanglement monotones so far are shown to be monogamous. We explore here a family of entanglement monotones with the reduced functions are concave but not strictly concave and show that they are not monogamous. They are defined by four kinds of the 'partial-norm' of the reduced state, which we call them partial-norm of entanglement, minimal partial-norm of entanglement, reinforced minimal partial-norm of entanglement, and partial negativity, respectively. This indicates that, the previous axiomatic definition of the entanglement monotone needs supplemental agreement that the reduced function should be strictly concave since such a strict concavity can make sure that the corresponding convex-roof extended entanglement monotone is monogamous. Here, the reduced function of an entanglement monotone refers to the corresponding function on the reduced state for the measure on bipartite pure states.

   chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Cluster states were introduced in the context of measurement-based quantum computing. In one dimension, the cluster Hamiltonian possesses topologically protected states. We investigate the Floquet dynamics of the cluster spin chain in an external field, interacting with a particle. We explore the entanglement properties of the topological and magnetic phases, first in the integrable spin lattice case and then in the interacting quantum walk case. We find, in addition to thermalization, dynamical phase transitions separating low-and high-entanglement nonthermal states, reminiscent of the ones present in the integrable case, but differing in their magnetic properties. The nonergodic phases are characterized by the emergence of magnetic order, persistent at long times.

TI Chaotic Entanglement: Entropy and Geometry
SO ENTROPY
AB In chaotic entanglement, pairs of interacting classically-chaotic systems are induced into a state of mutual stabilization that can be maintained without external controls and that exhibits several properties consistent with quantum entanglement. In such a state, the chaotic behavior of each system is stabilized onto one of the system's many unstable periodic orbits (generally located densely on the associated attractor), and the ensuing periodicity of each system is sustained by the symbolic dynamics of its partner system, and vice versa. Notably, chaotic entanglement is an entropy-reversing event: the entropy of each member of an entangled pair decreases to zero when each system collapses onto a given period orbit. In this paper, we discuss the role that entropy plays in chaotic entanglement. We also describe the geometry that arises when pairs of entangled chaotic systems organize into coherent structures that range in complexity from simple tripartite lattices to more involved patterns. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions.

TI A Fast Rearrangement Method for Defect-Free Atom Arrays
SO PHOTONICS
AB Defect-free atom arrays provide new possibilities for exploring exotic quantum phenomena and realizing quantum computing. However, quickly and efficiently preparing defect-free atom arrays poses challenges. This paper proposes an innovative parallel rearrangement method, namely the parallel compression filling algorithm (PCFA), wherein multiple movable optical tweezers operate simultaneously. By limiting the shape of the initial loading, the method reduces movement complexity. The simulation comparisons show that this algorithm is more efficient in preparing defect-free atom arrays and can also be applied to the generation of other periodic structure arrays. The simulation results show that, in most cases, preparing a defect-free array of 400 atoms requires no more than 30 steps.

TI Room-temperature quantum emission from interface excitons in
   mixed-dimensional heterostructures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The development of van der Waals heterostructures has introduced unconventional phenomena that emerge at atomically precise interfaces. For example, interlayer excitons in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides show intriguing optical properties at low temperatures. Here we report on room-temperature observation of interface excitons in mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of two-dimensional tungsten diselenide and one-dimensional carbon nanotubes. Bright emission peaks originating from the interface are identified, spanning a broad energy range within the telecommunication wavelengths. The effect of band alignment is investigated by systematically varying the nanotube bandgap, and we assign the new peaks to interface excitons as they only appear in type-II heterostructures. Room-temperature localization of low-energy interface excitons is indicated by extended lifetimes as well as small excitation saturation powers, and photon correlation measurements confirm antibunching. With mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures where band alignment can be engineered, new opportunities for quantum photonics are envisioned.
   Interlayer excitons in 2D homo- and heterostructures have been intensively investigated due to their emerging optical properties. Here, the authors report the observation of interface excitons in 1D/2D carbon nanotube/WSe2 heterostructures, showing evidence of photon antibunching at room temperature.

TI Semi-Quantum Identification without Information Leakage
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In 2019, Zhou et al. proposed semi-quantum identification (also known as semi-quantum authentication, SQA), which proceeds under a measure-resend and measurement-free environment. However, Zhou et al.'s SQA protocol suffers from severe information leakages. An eavesdropper can obtain an intact authentication key without being detected under this environment. In particular, Zhou et al.'s measure-resend SQA protocol is vulnerable to double CNOT attacks, while the measurement-free SQA protocol is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Hence, this study reveals the severe security issues of Zhou et al.'s SQA protocol and proposes an improved protocol with guaranteed security. The proposed measure-resend SQA protocol is immune to double CNOT attacks. Since the photons sent back and forth are identical, Eve cannot obtain any information by cross-comparing these photons. In the proposed measurement-free SQA protocol, the eavesdropper cannot obtain the order of the transmitted photons because it was previously a pre-shared key to decide the order of the photons. Hence, the proposed measurement-free SQA protocol can withstand man-in-the-middle attacks.

AB We introduce PQNoise, a post-quantum variant of the Noise framework. We demonstrate that it is possible to replace the Diffie-Hellman key-exchanges in Noise with KEMs in a secure way. A challenge is the inability to combine key pairs of KEMs, which can be resolved by certain forms of randomness-hardening for which we introduce a formal abstraction. We provide a generic recipe to turn classical Noise patterns into PQNoise patterns. We prove that the resulting PQNoise patterns achieve confidentiality and authenticity in the fACCE model. Moreover we show that for those classical Noise-patterns that have been conjectured or proven secure in the fACCE model our matching PQNoise patterns eventually achieve the same security. Our security proof is generic and applies to any valid PQNoise pattern. This is made possible by another abstraction, called a hash-object, which hides the exact workings of how keying material is processed in an abstract stateful object that outputs pseudorandom keys under different corruption patterns. We also show that the hash chains used in Noise are a secure hash-object. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of PQNoise delivering benchmarks for several base patterns.

TI Controlling polarization entanglement in biphotons generated with
   partially spatially coherent pump beam
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We theoretically study the polarization entanglement and the non-local correlations manifested by biphotons using measures as concurrence and CHSH Bell test, generated in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process for partially spatially coherent pump, affected by the spatial walk-off effects of the extraordinary beam. The study has been carried out for a well-known scheme for generating polarization entanglement utilizing non-collinear, frequency degenerate SPDC process in paired type-I uniaxial crystals. It is found that the polarization entanglement changes drastically with variation in spatial coherence of the pump, offering a possibility to realize a tunable source of polarization entanglement. The study reveals the overriding role of aperture size in compensation of the effect of spatial coherence of pump on the polarization entanglement and non-local correlations, especially in the conservation of polarization entanglement for incoherent and partially coherent pump beams. Free-space quantum secure communication utilizing these quantum states possessing maximal entanglement and partially spatially coherent properties would essentially offer robustness to the losses on propagation through atmospheric turbulence, resulting in a significant enhancement in the key rate.

All of these gates have matrix entries in the ring Z[1/2, i], the smallest subring of the complex numbers containing 1/2 and i. Amy, Glaudell, and Ross proved the converse, i.e., any unitary matrix with entries in Z[1/2, i] can be realized by a quantum circuit over the above gate set using at most one ancilla. In this paper, we give a finite presentation by generators and relations of U-n(Z[1/2, i]), the group of unitary n x n-matrices with entries in Z[1/2, i]

TI Decoding Quantum Tanner Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We introduce sequential and parallel decoders for quantum Tanner codes. When the Tanner code construction is applied to a sufficiently expanding square complex with robust local codes, we obtain a family of asymptotically good quantum low-density parity-check codes. In this case, our decoders provably correct arbitrary errors of weight linear in the code length, respectively in linear or logarithmic time. The same decoders are easily adapted to the expander lifted product codes of Panteleev and Kalachev. Along the way, we exploit recently established bounds on the robustness of random tensor codes to give a tighter bound on the minimum distance of quantum Tanner codes.

TI Quantum control of tunable-coupling transmons using dynamical invariants
   of motion
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We analyze the implementation of a fast nonadiabatic CZ gate between two transmon qubits with tunable coupling. The gate control method is based on a theory of dynamical invariants which leads to reduced leakage and robustness against decoherence. The gate is based on a description of the resonance between the |11) and |20) using an effective Hamiltonian with the six lowest energy states. A modification of the protocol allows us to take into account the higher-order perturbative corrections of this effective model. This enables a gate fidelity several orders of magnitude higher than other quasiadiabatic protocols, with gate times that approach the theoretical limit.

TI Enhanced quantum signature scheme using quantum amplitude amplification
   operators
SO PLOS ONE
AB Quantum signature is the use of the principles of quantum computing to establish a trusted communication between two parties. In this paper, a quantum signature scheme using amplitude amplification techniques will be proposed. To secure the signature, the proposed scheme uses a partial diffusion operator and a diffusion operator to hide/unhide certain quantum states during communication. The proposed scheme consists of three phases, preparation phase, signature phase and verification phase. To confuse the eavesdropper, the quantum states representing the signature might be hidden, not hidden or encoded in Bell states. It will be shown that the proposed scheme is more secure against eavesdropping when compared with relevant quantum signature schemes.

TI Radical pair mechanism in magnetobiology: state of the art
SO PHYSICS-USPEKHI
AB We discuss the biological effects of weak magnetic fields, a problem that has gone unresolved for nearly half a century. We consider the spin-chemical mechanism of radical pairs, which is prevalent in the literature aiming to explain the observed phenomena. The effectiveness of this mechanism is limited by spin relaxation. The relaxation rate is estimated for a radical in a protein via the Zeeman, hyperfine, spin-orbit, and exchange interactions. Taking the relaxation and chemical kinetics into account, we present an analytic solution of the Liouville-von Neumann equation for two electrons and a nucleus, which relates the magnitude of the effects to the relaxation rate. Various aspects of the solution are discussed: the influence of the radiofrequency and hypomagnetic fields, the role of quantum entanglement, theoretical challenges and prospects, and others.

TI Recent Advances in Polarization-Encoded Optical Metasurfaces
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB In recent years, optical metasurfaces, i.e., surface-confined arrays of engineered nanostructured elements (meta-atoms), have become an emerging research area due to their unprecedented capabilities of manipulating light with subwavelength spatial resolutions. The metasurfaces revolutionize thereby conventional bulky optics with compact planar elements. As the polarization is one of the intrinsic properties of light and of crucial importance for fundamental sciences and practical applications, the polarization-encoded functional optical metasurfaces featuring compactness, integration compatibility, and multiple functionalities have been in the focus of intensive research and development. Herein, the basic principles and emerging applications of polarization-encoded functional metasurfaces operating in the optical range are reviewed. Starting with the description of different polarization states, the review proceeds with considerations of how to interconvert and detect the state of polarization. The main achievements in polarization-multiplexing metasurface components (metadevices) are then summarized. Finally, a personal outlook on potential directions in this fast-growing research area is provided in the conclusions.

TI Enhanced Squeezing and Entanglement in Nondegenerate Three-Level Laser
   Coupled to Squeezed Vacuum Reservoir
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Squeezing and entanglement of a two-mode cascade laser, produced by a three-level atom which is initially prepared by a coherent superposition of the top and bottom levels then injected into a cavity coupled to a two-mode squeezed vacuum reservoir is discussed. I obtain stochastic differential equations associated with the normal ordering using the pertinent master equation. Making use of the solutions of the resulting differential equations, we determined the mean photon number for the cavity mode and their correlation, EPR variables, smallest eigenvalue of the symplectic matrix, intensity difference fluctuation, and photon number correlation. It is found that the squeezed vacuum reservoir increases the degree of the statistical and nonclassical features of light produced by the system. Furthermore, using the criteria developed by logarithm negativity and Hillery-Zubairy criteria, the quantum entanglement of the cavity mode is quantified. It is found that the degree of the entanglement for the system under consideration increases with the squeezing parameter of the squeezed vacuum reservoir.

TI Niobium in the clean limit: An intrinsic type-I superconductor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Niobium is one of the most researched superconductors, both theoretically and experimentally. It is enormously significant in all branches of superconducting applications, from powerful magnets to quantum computing. It is therefore imperative to understand its fundamental properties in great detail. Here, we use the results of recent microscopic calculations of anisotropic electronic, phonon, and superconducting properties, and apply a thermodynamic criterion for the type of superconductivity, more accurate and straightforward than a conventional Ginzburg-Landau parameter K-based delineation, to show that pure niobium is a type-I superconductor in the clean limit. However, disorder (impurities, defects, strain, stress) pushes it to become a type-II superconductor.

   semimetal EuAgAs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We report the observation of a light-induced subpicosecond phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs, achieved through ultrafast optical excitation. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we probe the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics, discovering distinct fluence-dependent responses in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, and revealing a possible magnetic order-driven transition between different topological states. Our results demonstrate that EuAgAs, with its highly tunable magnetic structure, possibly offers a unique platform for exploring topological phase transitions. These results underscore the potential of ultrashort optical pulses as powerful tools for the real-time control of topological phases, opening pathways for advances in spintronics, quantum computing, and energy-efficient information technologies.

TI Topological transformation of synthetic ferromagnetic skyrmions: thermal
   assisted switching of helicity by spin-orbit torque
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB This study demonstrates the controllable switching of skyrmion helicity using spin-orbit torque, enhanced by thermal effects. Electric current pulses applied to a [Pt/Co]3/Ru/[Co/Pt]3 multilayer stripe drive skyrmions in a direction opposite to the current flow. Continuous pulsing results in an unexpected reversal of skyrmion motion. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that skyrmions in the upper and lower ferromagnetic layers exhibit distinct helicities, forming a hybrid synthetic skyrmion. The helicity switch of this hybrid structure accounts for the motion reversal. This study introduces innovative helicity control methods, advancing spintronic device applications, including data storage and quantum computing based on skyrmion helicity.

TI Identifying Majorana bound states by tunneling shot-noise tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Majorana fermions are promising building blocks of forthcoming technology in quantum computing. However, their nonambiguous identification has remained a difficult issue because of the concomitant competition with other topologically trivial fermionic states, which poison their detection in most spectroscopic probes. By employing numerical and analytical methods, here we show that the Fano factor tomography is a key distinctive feature of a Majorana bound state, displaying a spatially constant Poissonian value equal to one. In contrast, the Fano factor of other trivial fermionic states, like the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov or Andreev ones, is strongly spatially dependent and exceeds one as a direct consequence of the local particle-hole symmetry breaking.

AB Quantum copy protection, introduced by Aaronson, enables giving out a quantum program-description that cannot be meaningfully duplicated. Despite over a decade of study, copy protection is only known to be possible for a very limited class of programs. As our first contribution, we show how to achieve "best-possible" copy protection for all programs. We do this by introducing quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation (qsiO), a notion of obfuscation for quantum descriptions of classical programs. We show that applying qsiO to a program immediately achieves best-possible copy protection.
   Our second contribution is to show that, assuming injective one-way functions exist, qsiO is concrete copy protection for a large family of puncturable programs --- significantly expanding the class of copy-protectable programs. A key tool in our proof is a new variant of unclonable encryption (UE) that we call coupled unclonable encryption (cUE). While constructing UE in the standard model remains an important open problem, we are able to build cUE from one-way functions. If we additionally assume the existence of UE, then we can further expand the class of puncturable programs for which qsiO is copy protection.
   Finally, we construct qsiO relative to an efficient quantum oracle.

TI Genuine Tripartite Entanglement as a Probe of Quantum Phase Transitions
   in a Spin-1 Heisenberg Chain with Single-Ion Anisotropy
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The quantum phase transitions of spin-1 Heisenberg chains with an easy-axis anisotropy Delta and a uniaxial single-ion anisotropy D are studied using a multipartite entanglement approach. The genuine tripartite entanglement between the spin blocks, measured by the tripartite qutrit hyperdeterminant, is calculated within the quantum renormalization group method. Using this approach, the phase boundaries between the topological Haldane, large-D, and anti-ferromagnetic Neel phases are determined in the half Delta - D plane with Delta > 0. When the size of the spin blocks increases, the genuine tripartite entanglement between the blocks exhibits a nonzero plateau in the topological Haldane phase, and experiences abrupt drops at both the phase boundaries between the Haldane-large-D and Haldane-Neel phases, which suggests the usage of genuine multipartite entanglement as a probe of topological phases in spin systems.

We assess whether the advanced computational capabilities of QGANs can enhance the modeling of complex stochastic distribution beyond the traditional mathematical models, particularly the Markov model. The findings indicate that while QGANs demonstrate potential in approximating complex distributions, the Markov model consistently outperforms in accurately replicating the real data distribution. This comparison underlines the challenges and avenues for refinement in time series data generation using quantum computing techniques. It emphasizes the need for further optimization of quantum models to better align with real-world data characteristics.

TI Phase Signature of Topological Transition in Josephson Junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Topological superconductivity holds promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While planar Josephson junctions are attractive candidates to realize this exotic state, direct phase measurements as the fingerprint of the topological transition are missing. By embedding two gate-tunable Al/InAs Josephson junctions in a loop geometry, we measure a pi jump in the junction phase with an increasing in-plane magnetic field B-parallel to. This jump is accompanied by a minimum of the critical current, indicating a closing and reopening of the superconducting gap, strongly anisotropic in B-parallel to. Our theory confirms that these signatures of a topological transition are compatible with the emergence of Majorana bound states.

TI SQUID oscillations in PbTe nanowire networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Network structures by semiconductor nanowires hold great promise for advanced quantum devices, especially for applications in topological quantum computing. In this paper, we created networks of PbTe nanowires arranged in loop configurations. Using shadow-wall epitaxy, we defined superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) using the superconductor Pb. These SQUIDs exhibit oscillations in supercurrent upon the scanning of a magnetic field. Most of the oscillations can be fitted assuming a sinusoidal current-phase relation for each Josephson junction. Under certain conditions, the oscillations are found to be skewed, suggesting a possible deviation from a sinusoidal behavior. Our results highlight the potential of PbTe nanowires for building complex quantum devices in the form of networks.

Regardless of the crystal orientation, a phosphorene nanoribbon containing a monovacancy is found to exhibit a topological quasi-flatband that emerges within the bandgap. The electronic properties of QDs, including spatial confinement and energy level distribution, can be strongly tuned by controlling the topological structure of the QDs and by applying electric fields. Additionally, these QDs exhibit remarkable spin-selective properties under a ferromagnetic exchange field, enabling the manipulation of QD features. This opens up the potential for novel applications such as quantum computing, magnetic sensing, spin-based light emission.

TI Nonlinear squeezing generation via multimode PDC and single photon
   measurement
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Nonlinear squeezing is a property of non-Gaussian states of light with an important application in continuous variable quantum computing. We study the generation of nonlinear squeezing in multimode systems produced by the photon-added coherent state technique. We present a protocol and find a regime in which the nonlinear squeezing appears in two modes simultaneously, even for a weak non-Gaussianity induced by the single-photon addition. We explore the properties of nonlinear squeezing depending on the modal structure of light, as well as the seed and local oscillator profiles, and present an optimal measurement strategy.

TI Tensor Based Multivariate Polynomial Modulo Multiplier for Cryptographic
   Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Modulo polynomial multiplication is an essential mathematical operation in the area of finite field arithmetic. Polynomial functions can be represented as tensors, which can be utilized as basic building blocks for various lattice-based post-quantum cryptography schemes. This paper presents a tensor-based novel modulo multiplication method for multivariate polynomials over GF(2(m)) and is realized on the hardware platform (FPGA). The proposed method consumes 6.5x less power and achieves more than 6x speedup compared to other contemporary single variable polynomial multiplication implementations. Our method is embarrassingly parallel and easily scalable for multivariate polynomials. Polynomial functions of nine variables, where each variable is of degree 128, are tested with the proposed multiplier, and its corresponding area, power, and power-delay-area product (PDAP) are presented. The computational complexity of single variable and multivariate polynomial multiplications are O(n) and O(np), respectively, where n is the maximum degree of a polynomial having p variables. Due to its high speed, low latency, and scalability, the proposed modulo multiplier can be used in a wide range of applications.

SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The Scanning Quantum Cryogenic Atom Microscope (SQCRAMscope) is a quantum sensor in which a quasi-1D quantum gas images electromagnetic fields emitted from a nearby sample. We report improvements to the microscope. Cryogen usage is reduced by replacing the liquid cryostat with a closed-cycle system and modified cold finger, and cryogenic cooling is enhanced by adding a radiation shield. The minimum accessible sample temperature is reduced from 35 K to 5.7 K while maintaining low sample vibrations. A new sample mount is easier to exchange, and quantum gas preparation is streamlined.

TI Flexible constraint compilation in the parity architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present tools and methods to generalize parity compilation to digital quantum computing devices with arbitrary connectivity graphs and construct circuit implementations for the constraint Hamiltonian of higher order constrained binary optimization problems. In particular, we show how even nonlocal constraints can be efficiently implemented without expensive SWAP gates. We show how the presented tools can be used to optimize the total circuit depth and CNOT count of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in the parity architecture and highlight the advantages of the flexible compilation using various examples. We derive the relation between the developed gate sequences and the traditional approach that uses SWAP gates. The result can be applied to improve the implementation of many other nonlocal operators.

AB The side-channel cryptanalysis of Post-Quantum (PQ) key encapsulation schemes has been a topic of intense activity over the last years. Many attacks have been put forward: Simple Power Analysis (SPAs) against the re-encryption of schemes using the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform are known to be very powerful; Differential Power Analysis (DPAs) against the decryption are also possible. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic and quantitative investigation of their impact for designers is still missing. In this paper, we propose to capture these attacks with shortcut formulas in order to compare their respective strength in function of the noise level. Taking the case of Kyber for illustration, we then evaluate the (high) cost of preventing them with masking and the extent to which different parts of an implementation could benefit from varying security levels. We finally discuss tweaks to improve the situation and enable a better leveling of the countermeasures. Our conclusions confirm that current solutions for side-channel secure PQ key encapsulation schemes like Kyber are unlikely to be efficient in low-noise settings without (design or countermeasures) improvements.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB In this study, the Seebeck coefficient of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) was evaluated using a nitrogen vacancy center in nanodiamonds as a thermometer. A temperature gradient was established across the SWCNT, and the temperatures of the nanodiamonds on the electrodes, along with the electromotive force between these electrodes, were measured. The Seebeck coefficient for a metallic SWCNT was determined to be 14.0 +/- 1.1 mu V K-1, which is consistent with results reported in previous studies. This methodology offers a promising approach for evaluating the thermoelectric properties of various nanomaterials.

TI A 3C-SiC-on-Insulator-Based Integrated Photonic Platform Using an Anodic
   Bonding Process with Glass Substrates
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Various crystalline silicon carbide (SiC) polytypes are emerging as promising photonic materials due to their wide bandgap energies and nonlinear optical properties. However, their wafer forms cannot readily provide a refractive index contrast for optical confinement in the SiC layer, which makes it difficult to realize a SiC-based integrated photonic platform. In this paper, we demonstrate a 3C-SiC-on-insulator (3C-SiCoI)-based integrated photonic platform by transferring the epitaxial 3C-SiC layer from a silicon die to a borosilicate glass substrate using anodic bonding. By fine-tuning the fabrication process, we demonstrated nearly 100% area transferring die-to-wafer bonding. We fabricated waveguide-coupled microring resonators using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)-based dry etching and demonstrated a moderate loaded quality (Q) factor of 1.4 x 10(5). We experimentally excluded the existence of the photorefractive effect in this platform at sub-milliwatt on-chip input optical power levels. This 3C-SiCoI platform is promising for applications, including large-scale integration of linear, nonlinear and quantum photonics.

TI Topological Silicon Photonics
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB The field of topological photonics has seen tremendous and wide-ranging developments in recent years. Evolving from the broader field of topological insulators, topological photonics systems today harness a variety topological phases. These include the Su-Schreifer-Heeger, quantum Hall, quantum valley Hall and quantum spin Hall topologies. Importantly, the latter two generate edge states with opposite group velocities and opposite spin, respectively, allowing unidirectional light propagation and advanced photonic routing to occur. Amongst these exciting developments is a subset of advancements made in topological silicon photonics, which could potentially lend its appeal to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) photonics applications, including telecommunications, data communications, quantum photonics, future exascale supercomputers, photonic neuromorphic computing, and infrared sensing. The fundamental underpinnings of these topological phases lead to interesting features, including chirality, scatter-free light propagation around sharp bends, and importantly topological protection against defects, disorder, and scattering. This topological protection may be harnessed toward tunable light propagation, photon-pair generation, quantum spatial entanglement, robust photonic routing, and beyond. Herein, the recent advancements made in the burgeoning field of topological silicon photonics are discussed.

TI 422 Million intrinsic quality factor planar integrated all-waveguide
   resonator with sub-MHz linewidth
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High quality-factor (Q) optical resonators are a key component for ultra-narrow linewidth lasers, frequency stabilization, precision spectroscopy and quantum applications. Integration in a photonic waveguide platform is key to reducing cost, size, power and sensitivity to environmental disturbances. However, to date, the Q of all-waveguide resonators has been relegated to below 260 Million. Here, we report a Si3N4 resonator with 422 Million intrinsic and 3.4 Billion absorption-limited Qs. The resonator has 453kHz intrinsic, 906kHz loaded, and 57kHz absorption-limited linewidths and the corresponding 0.060dBm(-1) loss is the lowest reported to date for waveguides with deposited oxide upper cladding. These results are achieved through a careful reduction of scattering and absorption losses that we simulate, quantify and correlate to measurements. This advancement in waveguide resonator technology paves the way to all-waveguide Billion Q cavities for applications including nonlinear optics, atomic clocks, quantum photonics and high-capacity fiber communications. Integrated photonic all-waveguide resonators are a critical component in many future applications. Here the authors develop an optimized photonic all-waveguide resonator with an ultra-high quality factor, Q, of almost half a billion, and a narrow sub-MHz linewidth.

TI Coupling conduction-band valleys in SiGe heterostructures via shear
   strain and Ge concentration oscillations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Engineering conduction-band valley couplings is a key challenge for Si-based spin qubits. Recent work has shown that the most reliable method for enhancing valley couplings entails adding Ge concentration oscillations to the quantum well. However, ultrashort oscillation periods are difficult to grow, while long oscillation periods do not provide useful improvements. Here, we show that the main benefits of short-wavelength oscillations can be achieved in long-wavelength structures through a second-order coupling process involving Brillouin-zone folding induced by shear strain. We finally show that such strain can be achieved through common fabrication techniques, making this an exceptionally promising system for scalable quantum computing.

TI Scalable trapping of single nanosized extracellular vesicles using
   plasmonics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Heterogeneous nanoscale extracellular vesicles (EVs) are of significant interest for disease detection, monitoring, and therapeutics. However, trapping these nano-sized EVs using optical tweezers has been challenging due to their small size. Plasmon-enhanced optical trapping offers a solution. Nevertheless, existing plasmonic tweezers have limited throughput and can take tens of minutes for trapping for low particle concentrations. Here, we present an innovative approach called geometry-induced electrohydrodynamic tweezers (GET) that overcomes these limitations. GET generates multiple electrohydrodynamic potentials, allowing parallel transport and trapping of single EVs within seconds. By integrating nanoscale plasmonic cavities at the center of each GET trap, single EVs can be placed near plasmonic cavities, enabling instant plasmon-enhanced optical trapping upon laser illumination without detrimental heating effects. These non-invasive scalable hybrid nanotweezers open new horizons for high-throughput tether-free plasmon-enhanced single EV trapping and spectroscopy. Other potential areas of impact include nanoplastics characterization, and scalable hybrid integration for quantum photonics.
   Manipulation of nano-sized extracellular vesicles are of significant interest for disease detection, monitoring, and therapeutics, yet it is still challenging to expedite the process. Here, the authors presented geometry-induced electrohydrodynamic tweezers, which enable fast parallel transport and trapping of single vesicle within seconds.

TI Secured Real-Time Machine Communication Protocol
SO NETWORK
AB In this paper, we introduce the Secured Real-Time Machine Communication Protocol (SRMCP), a novel industrial communication protocol designed to address the increasing demand for security and performance in Industry 4.0 environments. SRMCP integrates post-quantum cryptographic techniques, including the Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (Kyber-KEM) and AES-GCM encryption, to ensure robust protection against both current and future cryptographic threats. We also present an innovative "Port Hopping" mechanism inspired by frequency hopping, enhancing security by distributing communication across multiple channels. Comparative performance analysis was conducted with widely-used protocols such as ModBus and the OPC UA, focusing on key metrics such as connection, reading, and writing times across local and remote networks. Results demonstrate that SRMCP outperforms ModBus in reading and writing operations while offering enhanced security, although it has a higher connection time due to its dual-layer encryption. The OPC UA, while secure, lags significantly in performance, making it less suitable for real-time applications. The findings suggest that SRMCP is a viable solution for secure and efficient machine communication in modern industrial settings, particularly where quantum-safe security is a concern.

AB Abelian group actions appear in several areas of cryptography, especially isogeny-based post-quantum cryptography. A natural problem is to relate the analogues of the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) and discrete logarithm (DLog) problems for abelian group actions. Galbraith, Panny, Smith and Vercauteren (Mathematical Cryptology '21) gave a quantum reduction of DLog to CDH, assuming a CDH oracle with perfect correctness. Montgomery and Zhandry (Asia-crypt '22, best paper award) showed how to convert an unreliable CDH oracle into one that is correct with overwhelming probability. However, while a theoretical breakthrough, their reduction is quite inefficient: if the CDH oracle is correct with probability epsilon then their algorithm to amplify the success requires on the order of 1/epsilon(21) calls to the CDH oracle.
   We revisit this line of work and give a much simpler and tighter algorithm. Our method only takes on the order of 1/epsilon(4) CDH oracle calls and is conceptually simpler than the Montgomery-Zhandry reduction. Our algorithm is also fully black-box, whereas the Montgomery-Zhandry algorithm is slightly non-black-box. Our main tool is a thresholding technique that replaces the comparison of distributions in Montgomery-Zhandry with testing equality of thresholded sets.

TI QUANTUM-SAFE IDENTITY-BASED BROADCAST ENCRYPTION WITH PROVABLE SECURITY
   FROM MULTIVARIATE CRYPTOGRAPHY
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is a novel concept that can efficiently and securely transmit confidential content to a group of authorized users without the traditional Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI). After carefully exploring these areas, we have observed that none of the existing works have adopted the quantum-attack resistant cryptographic machinery Multivariate Public-Key Cryptography (MPKC) with provable security. We are the first to design a quantum-safe IBBE that solely relies on the MPKC framework. Our proposed protocol has achieved O(n)-size communication bandwidth and n(3) . O( max {N, delta(4)})-size overhead storage without any security breach. Here, n is the number of variables for each multivariate polynomial, N represents the total number of system users, and delta denotes a positive fixed-length. More positively, our design has achieved the adaptive INDistinguishable Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA) security in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) under the hardness of standard Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem. We emphasize that our system can also be immune against collusion attacks where several users come together to create an illicit decryption box.

TI Weight equalization algorithm for tree parity machines
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Key agreement plays a crucial role in ensuring secure communication in public networks. Although algorithms developed many years ago are still being used, the emergence of quantum computing has prompted the search for new solutions. Tree parity machines have been put forward as a potential solution. However, they possess inherent shortcomings, one of which is the uneven distribution of values in the secured key obtained after the key agreement process, especially when non-binary vectors are used during the synchronization process. This paper introduces a novel algorithm designed to address this issue. The results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the quality of the secured key obtained.

TI Quantum phase diagrams of matter-field Hamiltonians II: Wigner function
   analysis
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Non-classical states are of practical interest in quantum computing and quantum metrology. These states can be detected through their Wigner function negativity in some regions. We show that the surfaces of minimum fidelity or maximum Bures distance constitute a signature of quantum phase transitions. Additionally the behaviour of the Wigner function associated to the field modes carry the information of both, the entanglement properties between matter and field sectors, and the regions of the parameter space where the quantum phase transitions take place. A finer classification for the continuous phase transitions is obtained through the computation of the surface of maximum Bures distance.

TI Analytical Modeling of Source-to-Drain Tunneling Current Down to
   Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS
AB The subthreshold swing (SS) of MOSFETs decreases with temperature and then saturates below a critical temperature. Hopping conduction via the band tail has been proposed as the possible cause for the SS saturation. On the other hand, numerical simulations have shown the source-to-drain tunneling (SDT) current limits the SS at low temperatures. It has been argued which transport mechanism dominates the cryogenic subthreshold current. Hence, for the first time, this letter presents an analytical model of the SDT current and the corresponding SS, which is validated by cryogenic measurement on devices from an advanced 16 nm FinFET technology.

AB The recent literature reveals a dichotomy formed by a coevolution between cryptography and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This dichotomy consists of two sides, namely Crypto-Influenced AI (CIAI) and AI-Influenced Cryptography (AIIC). While it is pertinent to investigate this dichotomy from both sides, the first side has already been studied. In this review, we focused on AIIC. We identified and analyzed the stages on the evolutionary path of AIIC. Moreover, we attempted to anticipate what the future may hold for AIIC given the impact of quantum computing on the present and the future of AI.

We provide an in-depth examination of leakage sources to elucidate RT behaviour across different temperatures, and we conduct a study on the mismatch between DRAM cells, highlighting various trade-offs, including cell area, mismatch, retention time, and power consumption. Our findings offer valuable insights for circuit designers working on large-scale quantum computing or superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) arrays, especially those aiming to store data at 4 K to avoid the wiring bottleneck associated with outputting each pixel from 4 K to room temperature for data analysis.

TI Antibunched N-photon bundles from dark states assisted by ac
   Stark shift
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we propose an interesting scheme to generate antibunched N-photon bundles from dark states by using a single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics system. The dispersive coupling between the atom and cavity introduces a Stark shift to one of the ground states, while the resonant coupling, along with a control field, forms a coherent N-excitation dark state assisted by the shift. Consequently, super-Rabi oscillation is established between the vacuum state and the N-excitation dark state when a probe field weakly couples to two ground states, enabling antibunched N-photon bundle emission within long-lived atomic coherence. As a byproduct, the generated high-efficiency single-photon source with a large mean photon number and high fidelity is of great value in quantum information processing.

TI Magneto-optical trap performance for high-bandwidth applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the dynamics of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating at high bandwidth. We find the absolute importance of high recapture efficiency between cycles to maintain a practical atom number. We develop a simple one-dimensional model accounting for MOT trapping forces and pressure-induced collisions and verify with experimental data using Rb-87. This is then applied to quantum sensing, predicting a shot noise limited sensitivity of 1x10(-7) g/root Hz for a gravimeter at 100 Hz operation. The results are useful for understanding MOT operation at high bandwidth, particularly in the context of developing mobile high-bandwidth quantum inertial sensors targeting dynamic environments and navigation applications.

TI A Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Exhibiting Room Temperature
   Spin-Correlated Radical Pair Character for Biological Sensing
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We report a water-soluble conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) composed of carbazole-benzophenone, COE-CbzBP, that exhibits photogenerated spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP) behavior sensitive to static electric fields from DNA but not from lipid bilayers. The SCRP forms from a thermally activated, spin-polarized state enabled by partial pi-conjugation disruption at the donor-acceptor (carbazole-benzophenone) nitrogen-carbon (N-C) junction, which facilitates a twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) geometry. This state minimizes the singlet-triplet energy gap (Delta E ST = 0.12 eV), radical-pair exchange coupling (J RP similar to Delta E ST/2), and charge separation free energy (Delta G CS) in both DNA (-0.19 eV) and lipid bilayers (-0.55 eV). Room-temperature continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) reveals a photogenerated spin-polarized singlet for COE-CbzBP that splits upon DNA association, consistent with modulation of J RP and hyperfine coupling (A x), presumably via electric field-spin coupling. No spin-polarized signal was observed under dark, cryogenic conditions, or in liposomes, but was quenched by the spin trap 4-POBN. Transient absorption and spectroelectrochemistry confirmed magnetic-field sensitive long-lived excited-state absorption features attributed to charge-separated states 3[Cbz center dot+-BP center dot-]*, which were lengthened by DNA, and quenched in lipid bilayers and 4-POBN. Quantum chemical simulations show that planar geometries (lipid-like) increase Delta E ST by 0.31 eV compared to TICT-optimized structures. This geometry-dependent modulation explains the absence of SCRP signatures in rigid environments, underscoring the importance of TICT states, minimized Delta E ST, and favorable Delta G CS for achieving room-temperature SCRP generation. These findings establish design principles for TICT-enabled molecules exhibiting qubit-like behavior that operate under ambient and biologically relevant conditions, with direct implications for quantum information science (QIS).

TI Engineering the electro-optic effect in HfO2 and
   ZrO2 through strain and polarization control
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The ability to control the optical properties of a material with an electric field has led to optical memory devices, communication systems, optical signal processing, or quantum cryptography. Understanding electro-optic effects, especially in thin films, would improve the efficiency of these applications. In particular, the influence of epitaxial strains is of prime importance. In addition, the active control of these effects would be of great interest to tailor the material to the desired performance. Here, we demonstrate through first-principle calculations that the linear electro-optic response (Pockels effect) of two silicon-compatible ferroelectrics is stable with respect to bi-axial strain and that the electro-optic response can be strongly enhanced through the electrical control of the polarization. We attribute the former to the lack of optical phonon softening and a weak elasto-optic response and the latter to the externally induced softening of a phonon of symmetry A 1. Our results are readily applicable to other polar materials and show that the electro-optic effect can be efficiently engineered to meet the performance criteria of future technologies.

TI Measurement-device-independent quantum random number generation over 23
   Mbps with imperfect single-photon sources
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum randomness relies heavily on the accurate characterization of the generator implementation, where the device imperfection or inaccurate characterization can lead to incorrect entropy estimation and practical bias, significantly affecting the reliability of the generated randomness. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum random number generation (QRNG) endeavors to produce certified randomness, utilizing uncharacterized and untrusted measurement devices that are vulnerable to numerous attack schemes targeting measurement loopholes. However, existing implementations have shown insufficient performance thus far. Here, we propose a high-speed MDI-QRNG scheme based on a robust measurement tomography approach against the imperfection of single-photon sources. Compared with the conventional approach, the decoy-state method is introduced to obtain more accurate tomography results and a tighter lower bound of randomness. Finally, by using a high-speed time-bin encoding system, we experimentally demonstrated the scheme and obtained a reliable min-entropy lower bound of 7.37 x 10 - 2 bits per pulse, corresponding to a generation rate over 23 Mbps, which substantially outperforms the existing realizations and makes a record in discrete-variable semi-device-independent QRNGs.

TI Provably secure lightweight certificateless lattice-based authenticated
   key exchange scheme for IIoT
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the manufacturing enterprises have significantly enhanced the production efficiency. The transmission of data in IIoT over public channels has brought about information leakage issues. Therefore, it is crucial to agree on a session key among the participants. In recent years, numerous authenticated key exchange (AKE) schemes have been designed. However, those AKE schemes which adopt the certificateless approach to tackle certificate management and key escrow may remain vulnerable to quantum attacks, and other AKE schemes which are based on lattice hard problem so as to achieve the post quantum security may incur key management issues. To simultaneously address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a lightweight certificateless lattice-based authenticated key exchange (C2LAKE) scheme. Upon the hardness assumptions of the inhomogeneous small integer solution (ISIS) and computational bilateral inhomogeneous small integer solution (CBi-ISIS) problems, the C2LAKE scheme has been demonstrated to be secure in the eCK model and the random oracle model (ROM). Better trade-off among security and functionality features, and communication and computation costs make the C2LAKE scheme suitable and applicable in the IIoT environment.

AB NTRU was first introduced by J. Hoffstein, J. Pipher and J.H Silverman in 1998. Its security, efficiency and compactness properties have been carefully studied for more than two decades. A key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) version was even submitted to the NIST standardization competition and made it to the final round. Even though it has not been chosen to be a new standard, NTRU remains a relevant, practical and trustful post-quantum cryptographic primitive.
   In this paper, we investigate the side-channel resistance of the NTRU Decrypt procedure. In contrast with previous works about side-channel analysis on NTRU, we consider a weak attacker model and we focus on an implementation that incorporates some side-channel countermeasures. The attacker is assumed to be unable to mount powerful attacks by using templates or by forging malicious ciphertexts for instance. In this context, we show how a non-profiled side-channel analysis can be done against a core operation of NTRU decryption. Despite the considered countermeasures and the weak attacker model, our experiments show that the secret key can be fully retrieved with a few tens of traces.

TI Quantum error mitigation by Pauli check sandwiching
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We describe and analyze an error mitigation technique that uses multiple pairs of parity checks to detect the presence of errors. Each pair of checks uses one ancilla qubit to detect a component of the error operator and represents one layer of the technique. We build on the results on extended flag gadgets and put it on a firm theoretical foundation. We prove that this technique can recover the noiseless state under the assumption of noise not affecting the checks. The method does not incur any encoding overhead and instead chooses the checks based on the input circuit. We provide an algorithm for obtaining such checks for an arbitrary target circuit. Since the method applies to any circuit and input state, it can be easily combined with other error mitigation techniques. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods using extensive numerical simulations on 1850 random input circuits composed of Clifford gates and non-Clifford single-qubit rotations, a class of circuits encompassing most commonly considered variational algorithm circuits. We observe average improvements in fidelity of 34 percentage points with six layers of checks.

TI Non-Markovian thermal operations boosting the performance of quantum
   heat engines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB It is investigated whether non-Markovianity, i.e., the memory effects resulting from the coupling of the system to its environment, can be beneficial for the performance of quantum heat engines. Specifically, two physical models are considered. The first one is a well-known single-qubit Otto engine; the non-Markovian behavior is there implemented by replacing standard thermalization strokes with so-called extremal thermal operations which cannot be realized without the memory effects. The second one is a three-stroke engine in which the cycle consists of two extremal thermal operations and a single qubit rotation. It is shown that the non-Markovian Otto engine can generate more work-per-cycle for a given efficiency than its Markovian counterpart, whereas performance of both setups is superior to the three-stroke engine. Furthermore, both the non-Markovian Otto engine and the three-stroke engine can reduce the work fluctuations in comparison with the Markovian Otto engine, with their relative advantage depending on the performance target. This demonstrates the beneficial influence of non-Markovianity on both the average performance and the stability of operation of quantum heat engines.

TI Pulse-efficient circuit transpilation for quantum applications on
   cross-resonance-based hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show a pulse-efficient circuit transpilation framework for noisy quantum hardware. This is achieved by scaling cross-resonance pulses and exposing each pulse as a gate to remove redundant single-qubit operations with the transpiler. Crucially, no additional calibration is needed to yield better results than a CNOT-based transpilation. This pulse-efficient circuit transpilation therefore enables a better usage of the finite coherence time without requiring knowledge of pulse-level details from the user. As demonstration, we realize a continuous family of cross-resonance-based gates for SU(4) by leveraging Cartan's decomposition. We measure the benefits of a pulse-efficient circuit transpilation with process tomography and observe up to a 50% error reduction in the fidelity of R-zz(theta) and arbitrary SU(4) gates on IBM Quantum devices. We apply this framework for quantum applications by running circuits of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm applied to MAXCUT. For an 11-qubit nonhardware native graph, our methodology reduces the overall schedule duration by up to 52% and errors by up to 38%.

TI Engineering and polarization properties of erbium-implanted lithium
   niobate films for integrated quantum applications
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Rare-earth-doped materials have garnered significant attention as material platforms in emerging quantum information and integrated photonic technologies. Concurrently, advances in its nanofabrication processes have unleashed thin film lithium niobate (LN) as a leading force of research in these technologies, encompassing many outstanding properties in a single material. Leveraging the scalability of ion implantation to integrate rare-earth erbium (Er3+), which emits at 1532 nm, into LN can enable a plethora of exciting photonic and quantum technologies operating in the telecom C-band. Many of these technologies rely on coupling via polarization-sensitive photonic structures such as waveguides and optical nanocavities, necessitating fundamental material studies. Toward this goal, we have conducted an extensive study on the role of implantation and post-implantation processing in minimizing implantation-induced defectivity in x-cut thin film LN on an insulator. By leveraging this, we have demonstrated a cutting-edge ensemble optical linewidth of 140 GHz for Er emission in x-cut thin-film LN at 77 K. This finding highlights the significant progress in minimizing implantation-induced defects through careful ion implantation engineering and post-implantation processing. To the best of our knowledge, this linewidth measured at a higher temperature (77 K) is the narrowest when compared to the values reported for bulk-doped and implanted LN crystals at liquid helium temperatures (similar to 3 K), showcasing the potential of our approach for higher-temperature operation devices. Furthermore, we show that the Er photoluminescence (PL) is highly polarized perpendicular to the x-cut LN c-axis through systematic and combinational PL and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) studies. These results indicate that using Er emitters in thin film LN, along with their polarization characteristics and related ion implantation engineering, presents an opportunity to produce highly luminescent Er-doped LN photonic integrated devices and circuits for quantum and nanophotonic applications at telecom wavelengths.

TI Switching current distributions in ferromagnetic anomalous Josephson
   junctions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We investigate the switching current distributions of ferromagnetic anomalous Josephson junctions subjected to a linearly increasing bias current. Our study uncovers a significant correlation between the position of the switching current distributions and crucial system parameters, such as the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the Gilbert damping parameter. This indicates that these parameters can be directly determined through experimental measurements. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the interplay among noise, magnetization, phase dynamics, and the statistical properties of the switching current distribution, we deepen our understanding of these intriguing cryogenic spintronics devices. These findings hold potential for applications in the field of quantum computing architectures and information processing technologies.

TI Heterogeneously Integrated Photonic Chip on Lithium Niobate Thin-Film
   Waveguide
SO CRYSTALS
AB Lithium niobate thin film represents as an ideal material substrate for quantum photonics due to its strong electro-optic effect and high-speed modulation capability. Here, we propose a novel platform which heterogeneously integrates single self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots for a single-photon source on a lithium niobate photonic chip. The InAs/GaAs quantum dots can be transferred to the lithium niobate waveguide via a substrate transfer procedure with nanometer precision and be integrated through van der Waals force. A down-tapered structure is designed and optimized to deliver the photon flux generated from the InAs quantum dots embedded in a GaAs waveguide to the lithium niobate waveguide with an overall efficiency of 42%. In addition, the electro-optical effect is used to tune, and therefore to tune the beam splitting ratio of the integrated lithium niobate directional coupler, which can simultaneously route multiple photons to different spatial modes, and subsequently fan out through grating couplers to achieve single-photon sub-multiplexing. The proposed device opens up novel opportunities for achieving multifunctional hybrid integrated photonic chips.

TI Experimental Observation of Non-Markovian Quantum Exceptional Points
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB One of the most remarkable features that distinguish open systems from closed ones is the presence of exceptional points (EPs), where two or more eigenvectors of a non-Hermitian operator coalesce, accompanying the convergence of the corresponding eigenvalues. So far, EPs have been demonstrated on a number of platforms, ranging from classical optical systems to fully quantum-mechanical spin-boson models. In these demonstrations, the reservoir that induced the non-Hermiticity was treated as a Markovian one, without considering its memory effect. We here present the first experimental demonstration of nonMarkovian quantum EPs, engineered by coupling a Josephson-junction-based qubit to a leaky electromagnetic resonator, which acts as a non-Markovian reservoir. We map out the spectrum of the extended Liouvillian superoperator by observing the quantum state evolution of the qubit and the pseudomode, in which the memory of the reservoir is encoded. We identify a twofold second-order EP and a third-order EP in the Liouvillian spectrum, which cannot be realized with a Markovian reservoir. Our results pave the way for experimental exploration of exotic phenomena associated with non-Markovian quantum EPs.

TI Individual versus simultaneous estimation of two parameters in a
   correlated noisy environment
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Recently, the phase parametric estimation for a single qubit system driven by a phase noisy laser under non-Markovian dynamics has been reported [Annals of Physics 351, 952 (2014)]. We here generalize the single-parameter estimation to the two-parameter scenario where a two-qubit system is influenced by the classical correlated noisy laser, and compare the performances of two-parameter estimation in both individual and simultaneous strategies by using the quantum Fisher information and the quantum Fisher information matrix, respectively. Our results show the phase parametric estimation precision can be significantly improved due to the memory effect arising from successive applications of the noisy laser. With the memory coefficient mu increasing, the precision of parameter estimation becomes more accurate. Besides, the phase parameter estimation precision can be drastically enhanced by engineering the ratios of classical phase diffusion rate and system-environment coupling strength in both Markovian and non-Markovian regions. Remarkably, we find the simultaneous estimation of two-phase parameters is not always advantageous over the individual strategy.

TI Lattice-Based Commitment Scheme for Low Communication Costs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Commitment schemes are cryptographic schemes that can be applied to zero-knowledge proof construction and blockchain construction. Recently, lattice-based cryptography has been intensively investigated due to the promising potential in quantum cryptography. Accordingly, commitment schemes based on lattice assumptions have been studied for practical applications. Notably, applications often require committing an arbitrary message with low communication costs, so commitment schemes must be satisfied with fewer length restrictions and fewer extensions to the messages. Several studies have been conducted to achieve the problem, including the study published by Baum et al. in 2018. However, the output length of their scheme is large in relation to the input length. We design a length-extension-free commitment scheme Com(MWM) in which the length of the message string is large relative to the length of the commitment string, improving on the commitment scheme of Baum et al. Furthermore, we prove that the hiding and binding properties of Com(MWM) are based on the hardness of the decisional search knapsack problem and extended search knapsack problems, respectively. Finally, we evaluate the computation costs of generating commitment value between ours and Baum et al.'s commitment scheme.

TI Network nonlocality via rigidity of token counting and color matching
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Network nonlocality is the study of the network nonlocal correlations created by several independent entangled states shared in a network. In this paper, we provide two generic strategies to produce nonlocal correlations in large classes of networks without input. In the first one, called token counting (TC), each source distributes a fixed number of tokens and each party counts the number of received tokens. In the second one, called color matching (CM), each source takes a color and a party checks if the color of neighboring sources match. Using graph theoretic tools and Finner's inequality, we show that TC and CM distributions are rigid in wide classes of networks, meaning that there is essentially a unique classical strategy to simulate such correlations. Using this rigidity property, we show that certain quantum TC and CM strategies produce correlations that cannot be produced classicality. This leads us to several examples of network nonlocality without input. These examples involve creation of coherence throughout the whole network, which we claim to be a fingerprint of genuine forms of network nonlocality. This work extends a more compact parallel work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 060401 (2022)] on the same subject and provides all the required technical proofs.

TI Integrated metasurfaces on silicon photonics for emission shaping and
   holographic projection
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The emerging applications of silicon photonics in free space, such as LiDARs, free-space optical communications, and quantum photonics, urge versatile emission shaping beyond the capabilities of conventional grating couplers. In these applications, silicon photonic chips deliver free-space emission to detect or manipulate external objects. Light needs to emit from a silicon photonic chip to the free space with specific spatial modes, which produce focusing, collimation, orbital angular momentum, or even holographic projection. A platform that offers versatile shaping of free-space emission, while maintaining the CMOS compatibility and monolithic integration of silicon photonics is in pressing need. Here we demonstrate a platform that integrates metasurfaces monolithically on silicon photonic integrated circuits. The metasurfaces consist of amorphous silicon nanopillars evanescently coupled to silicon waveguides. We demonstrate experimentally diffraction-limited beam focusing with a Strehl ratio of 0.82. The focused spot can be switched between two positions by controlling the excitation direction. We also realize a meta-hologram experimentally that projects an image above the silicon photonic chip. This platform can add a highly versatile interface to the existing silicon photonic ecosystems for precise delivery of free-space emission.

TI Elementary excitations of single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron
   nitride
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Single-photon emitters serve as building blocks for many emerging concepts in quantum photonics. The recent identification of bright, tunable and stable emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has opened the door to quantum platforms operating across the infrared to ultraviolet spectrum. Although it is widely acknowledged that defects are responsible for single-photon emitters in hBN, crucial details regarding their origin, electronic levels and orbital involvement remain unknown. Here we employ a combination of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy in defective hBN, unveiling an elementary excitation at 285 meV that gives rise to a plethora of harmonics correlated with single-photon emitters. We discuss the importance of N pi* anti-bonding orbitals in shaping the electronic states of the emitters. The discovery of elementary excitations in hBN provides fundamental insights into quantum emission in low-dimensional materials, paving the way for future investigations in other platforms.
   Combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy, an elementary excitation in hexagonal-boron-nitride-based single-photon emitters has been demonstrated, giving rise to multiple regular harmonics that can explain the wide frequency range of these emitters.

TI How Smart is the Grid?
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Ancient Romans called urbs the set of buildings and infrastructures, and civitas the Roman citizens. Today instead, while the society is surfing the digital tsunami, urbs and civitas tend to become much closer, almost merging, that we might attempt to condensate these into a single concept: smart grid. Internet of things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum cryptography are only a few of the technologies that are likely to contribute to determining the final portrait of the future smart grid. However, to understand the effective sustainability of complex grids, specific tools are required. To this end, in this article, a new taxonomic framework has been developed starting from a general analysis of the emerging solutions, identifying intersectoral synergies and limitations with respect to the 'smart grid' concept. Finally, from the scenario portrayed, a set of issues involving engineering, regulation, security, and social frameworks have been derived in a theoretical fashion. The findings are likely to suggest the urgent need for multidisciplinary cooperation to address engineering and ontological challenges gravitating around the smart grid concept.

AB Proper device identity management and authentication is a must for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a well-known solution for identifying IoT devices. However, they can be attacked using both intrusive and non-intrusive physical attacks. In this work, we propose a multimodal device authentication scheme using Behavioral and Physical Unclonable Functions (BPUFs), which is a more secure option than PUFs. Adequate server-side security is achieved because BPUF responses are processed in the encrypted domain using homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, helper data attacks are avoided and the solution is quantum-safe. The proposal has been evaluated on an ESP32 microcontroller considering the security against false acceptance attacks and the security level of the Kyber public key encryption used. Fixing the first security to more than 192 bits for the behavioral and physical functions, the execution times of the cryptographic operations range from 41.30 to 205.70 ms, working at 160 MHz, with communication bandwidths from 3,840 to 15,680 bytes, and non-volatile memory occupation from 800 to 1,568 bytes.

TI Verifiable quantum secret sharing scheme based on orthogonal product
   states
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB In the domain of quantum cryptography, the implementation of quantum secret sharing stands as a pivotal element. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable quantum secret sharing protocol using the d-dimensional product state and Lagrange interpolation techniques. This protocol is initiated by the dealer Alice, who initially prepares a quantum product state, selected from a predefined set of orthogonal product states within the C-d circle times C-d framework. Subsequently, the participants execute unitary operations on this product state to recover the underlying secret. Furthermore, we subject the protocol to a rigorous security analysis, considering both eavesdropping attacks and potential dishonesty from the participants. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of our protocol against existing schemes. Our scheme exhibits economies of scale by exclusively employing quantum product states, thereby realizing significant cost-efficiency advantages. In terms of access structure, we adopt a (t,n)-threshold architecture, a strategic choice that augments the protocol's practicality and suitability for diverse applications. Furthermore, our protocol includes a rigorous integrity verification mechanism to ensure the honesty and reliability of the participants throughout the execution of the protocol.

AB Rydberg excitons are, with their ultrastrong mutual interactions, giant optical nonlinearities, and very high sensitivity to external fields, promising for applications in quantum sensing and nonlinear optics at the singlephoton level. To design quantum applications it is necessary to know how Rydberg excitons and other excited states relax to lower-lying exciton states. Here, we present photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy as a method to probe transition probabilities from various excitonic states in cuprous oxide. We show giant Rydberg excitons at T = 38 mK with principal quantum numbers up to n = 30, corresponding to a calculated diameter of 3 mu m.

SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems (NOEMS), considered as new platforms to study electronic and mechanical freedoms in the field of nanophotonics, have gained rapid progress in recent years. NOEMS offer exciting opportunities to manipulate information carriers using optical, electrical, and mechanical degrees of freedom, where the flow of light, dynamics of electrons, and mechanical vibration modes can be explored in both classical and quantum domains.

TI Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later: A Temporal Cybersecurity Risk in the Quantum
   Transition
SO TELECOM
AB Telecommunication infrastructures rely on cryptographic protocols designed for long-term confidentiality, yet data exchanged today faces future exposure when adversaries acquire quantum or large-scale computational capabilities. This harvest-now, decrypt-later (HNDL) threat transforms persistent communication records into time-dependent vulnerabilities. We model HNDL as a temporal cybersecurity risk, formalizing the adversarial process of deferred decryption and quantifying its impact across sectors with varying confidentiality requirements. Our framework evaluates how delayed post-quantum cryptography (PQC) migration amplifies exposure and how hybrid key exchange and forward-secure mechanisms mitigate it. Results show that high-retention sectors such as satellite and health networks face exposure windows extending decades under delayed PQC adoption, while hybrid and forward-secure approaches reduce this risk horizon by over two-thirds. We demonstrate that temporal exposure is a measurable function of data longevity and migration readiness, introducing a network-centric model linking quantum vulnerability to communication performance and governance. Our findings underscore the urgent need for crypto-agile infrastructures that maintain confidentiality as a continuous assurance process throughout the quantum transition.

TI A New Quantum Sealed-Bid Auction Protocol with a Set of Local
   Indistinguishable Orthogonal Product States
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum sealed-bid auction (QSA) is a special form of transaction with significant applications in the economic and financial fields. Using a unique set of locally indistinguishable orthogonal product (LIOP) states, we propose a new QSA protocol in this paper. In the protocol, the bid message is encoded as a quantum sequence of LIOP states, and the different particles of LIOP states are transmitted separately. Even though an attacker obtains a portion of the particles, they cannot recover the entire bid message because of the local indistinguishability of LIOP states. Once the auctioneer announces the winner's bid, all bidders are able to confirm the authenticity of their bid. With the help of a semi-honest third party, collusion between the auctioneer and a malicious bidder can be discovered. Finally, our protocol is capable of meeting all requirements for secure sealed-bid auctions through security and completeness analysis. Additionally, the proposed protocol does not require any entangled resources and complicated operations, so it can be easily implemented in practice.

TI On maps which preserve semipositivity and quantifier elimination theory
   for real numbers
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICS
AB Assume that Phi : M-n(C) -> M-n(C) is a superoperator which preserves hermiticity. We give an algorithm determining whether Phi preserves semipositivity (we call Phi positive in this case). Our approach to the problem has a model-theoretic nature, namely, we apply techniques of quantifier elimination theory for real numbers. An approach based on these techniques seems to be the only one that allows to decide whether an arbitrary hermiticity-preserving Phi is positive. Before we go to detailed analysis of the problem, we argue that quantifier elimination for real numbers (and also for complex numbers) can play a significant role in quantum information theory and other areas as well.

TI SpinGlassPEPS.jl: Tensor-network package for Ising-like optimization on
   quasi-two-dimensional graphs
SO SOFTWAREX
AB This work introduces SpinGlassPEPS.jl, a software package implemented in Julia, designed to find low-energy configurations of generalized Potts models, including Ising and QUBO problems, utilizing heuristic tensor network contraction algorithms on quasi-2D geometries. In particular, the package employs the Projected Entangled-Pairs States to approximate the Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the model's cost function. This enables an efficient branch-and-bound search (within the probability space) that exploits the locality of the underlying problem's topology. As a result, our software enables the discovery of low-energy configurations for problems on quasi-2D graphs, particularly those relevant to modern quantum annealing devices. The modular architecture of SpinGlassPEPS.jl supports various contraction schemes and hardware acceleration.

TI Adiabatic dynamical-decoupling-based control of nuclear spin registers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The use of the nuclear spins surrounding electron spin qubits as quantum registers and long-lived memories opens the way to new applications in quantum information and biological sensing. Hence, there is a need for generic and robust forms of control of the nuclear registers. Although adiabatic gates are widely used in quantum information, they can become too slow to outpace decoherence. Here, we introduce a technique whereby adiabatic gates arise from the dynamical decoupling protocols that simultaneously extend coherence. We illustrate this pulse-based adiabatic control for nuclear spins around NV centers in diamond. We obtain a closed-form expression from Landau-Zener theory and show that it reliably describes the dynamics. By identifying robust Floquet states, we show that the technique enables polarization, one-shot flips, and state storage for nuclear spins. These results introduce a control paradigm that combines dynamical decoupling with adiabatic evolution.

TI Hole-spin qubits in Ge nanowire quantum dots: Interplay of orbital
   magnetic field, strain, and growth direction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hole-spin qubits in quasi-one-dimensional structures are a promising platform for quantum information processing because of the strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI). We present analytical results and discuss device designs that optimize the SOI in Ge semiconductors. We show that at the magnetic field values at which qubits are operated, orbital effects of magnetic fields can strongly affect the response of the spin qubit. We study one-dimensional hole systems in Ge under the influence of electric and magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the device. In our theoretical description, we include these effects exactly. The orbital effects lead to a strong renormalization of the g factor. We find a sweet spot of the nanowire (NW) g factor where charge noise is strongly suppressed and present an effective low-energy model that captures the dependence of the SOI on the electromagnetic fields. Moreover, we compare properties of NWs with square and circular cross sections with ones of gate-defined one-dimensional channels in two-dimensional Ge heterostructures. Interestingly, the effective model predicts a flat band ground state for fine-tuned electric and magnetic fields. By considering a quantum dot (QD) harmonically confined by gates, we demonstrate that the NW g-factor sweet spot is retained in the QD. Our calculations reveal that this sweet spot can be designed to coincide with the maximum of the SOI, yielding highly coherent qubits with large Rabi frequencies. We also study the effective g factor of NWs grown along different high-symmetry axes and find that our model derived for isotropic semiconductors is valid for the most relevant growth directions of nonisotropic Ge NWs. Moreover, a NW grown along one of the three main crystallographic axes shows the largest SOI. Our results show that the isotropic approximation is not justified in Ge in all cases.

TI Robust poling and frequency conversion on thin-film periodically poled
   lithium tantalate
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB We explore a robust poling method for periodically poled thin-film lithium tantalate (PP-TFLT) by systematically varying poling parameters and confirming the quality of inverted domains with second-harmonic microscopy. We find a periodic poling process that is insensitive to acoustic-grade or optical-grade thin film, electrode material, and the presence of an oxide interlayer. By using a single high-voltage electrical pulse with a peak voltage time of 100 ms or less and a ramp-down time of 90 s, rectangular poling domains are established and stabilized in the PP-TFLT. We employ our robust periodic poling process in a pole-after-etch approach to produce PP-TFLT ridge waveguides with normalized second-harmonic generation (SHG) conversion efficiencies of 208% W-1 cm(-2) from 1550 to 775 nm, which is in line with the theoretical value of 244% W-1 cm(-2). This work establishes a reliable poling process and demonstrates SHG from the telecommunications band to the near-visible band using thin-film lithium tantalate, expanding the capabilities of the platform for frequency mixing applications in quantum photonics, sensing, and spectroscopy.

TI State Classification via a Random-Walk-Based Quantum Neural Network
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In quantum information technology, crucial information is regularly encoded in different quantum states. To extract information, the identification of one state from the others is inevitable. However, if the states are non-orthogonal and unknown, this task will become awesomely tricky, especially when our resources are also limited. Here, we introduce the quantum stochastic neural network (QSNN), and show its capability to accomplish the binary discrimination of quantum states. After a handful of optimizing iterations, the QSNN achieves a success probability close to the theoretical optimum, no matter whether the states are pure or mixed. Other than binary discrimination, the QSNN is also applied to classify an unknown set of states into two types: entangled ones and separable ones. After training with four samples, it can classify a number of states with acceptable accuracy. Our results suggest that the QSNN has the great potential to process unknown quantum states in quantum information.

TI The Need for Being Explicit: Failed Attempts to Construct Implicit
   Certificates from Lattices
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Global efforts such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s post-quantum standardization center on cryptographic primitives like public-key encryption and signature schemes that are secure even in the presence of quantum adversaries. In addition, one must also consider efficient certificate management as new technologies like the Internet of Things and 5G wireless networks rely on them. For example, the IEEE Standard for vehicle-to-vehicle communication depends on implicit certificates. However, the only efficient construction available is over elliptic curves, and hence not quantum-secure. This paper investigates approaches to construct implicit certificate schemes from lattices, employing the NIST Round 3 signature schemes Dilithium and Falcon. We consider emulation of the existing implicit certificate scheme and proceed to more innovative techniques like combining the two schemes or pairing them with encryption. Unfortunately, we encounter problems with each design, due to recurring causes like conflicting secret key and signature sizes, unique sampler requirements and the rigidity of the parameter sets. By explaining each of these issues, this paper will hopefully spark ideas for more successful constructions.

TI Entanglement wedge minimum cross-section in holographic massive gravity
   theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS) in holographic massive gravity theory, in which a first and second-order phase transition can occur. We find that the mixed state entanglement measures, the EWCS and mutual information (MI) can characterize the phase transitions. The EWCS and MI show exactly the opposite behavior in the critical region, which suggests that the EWCS captures distinct degrees of freedom from that of the MI. More importantly, EWCS, MI and HEE all show the same scaling behavior in the critical region. We give an analytical understanding of this phenomenon. By comparing the quantum information behavior in the thermodynamic phase transition of holographic superconductors, we analyze the relationship and difference between them and provide two mechanisms of quantum information scaling behavior in the thermodynamic phase transition.

AB Driven by technological progress and, above all, software, our world is becoming ever faster, more flexible and more complex. Vehicles in particular are complex systems due to the number of components, communication, and millions of lines of code. Recent trends such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence further accelerate these developments. As a result, the attack surface of vehicles is constantly increasing. To proactively address future security risks, we present the Automotive Cybersecurity Trend Radar (ACTR), an approach that applies the Innovation Radar methodology to identify and temporally classify emerging technologies relevant for the automotive cybersecurity sector. By systematically analyzing technology trends, academic research, and industry reports, this radar provides a structured view of upcoming challenges and opportunities. Our research highlights key topics for the future, including the impact of post-quantum cryptography, AI-driven security mechanisms, and confidential computing technologies. By incorporating these insights into early-stage strategic planning, manufacturers and suppliers can improve their preparedness for emerging cybersecurity-relevant technologies as well as benefit from technology developments, allowing strategic investments. The ACTR thus serves as a tool for industry stakeholders to anticipate, prioritize, and address automotive cybersecurity challenges before they become critical.

TI Beyond Causal Explanation: Einstein's Principle Not Reichenbach's
SO ENTROPY
AB Our account provides a local, realist and fully non-causal principle explanation for EPR correlations, contextuality, no-signalling, and the Tsirelson bound. Indeed, the account herein is fully consistent with the causal structure of Minkowski spacetime. We argue that retrocausal accounts of quantum mechanics are problematic precisely because they do not fully transcend the assumption that causal or constructive explanation must always be fundamental. Unlike retrocausal accounts, our principle explanation is a complete rejection of Reichenbach's Principle. Furthermore, we will argue that the basis for our principle account of quantum mechanics is the physical principle sought by quantum information theorists for their reconstructions of quantum mechanics. Finally, we explain why our account is both fully realist and psi-epistemic.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Previously, higher-order Hamiltonians (HoH) had been shown to offer an advantage in both metrology and quantum energy storage. Here, we axiomatize a model of computation that allows us to consider such Hamiltonians for the purposes of computation. From this axiomatic model, we formally prove that an HoH-based algorithm can gain up to a quadratic speed-up over classical sequential algorithms-for any possible classical computation. We show how our axiomatic model is grounded in the same physics as that used in HoH-based quantum advantage for metrology and battery charging. Thus we argue that any advance in implementing HoH-based quantum advantage in those scenarios can be co-opted for the purpose of speeding up computation.

TI Topological nematic phase transition in Kitaev magnets under applied

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a scenario of realizing the toric code phase, which can be potentially utilized for fault-tolerant quantum computation, in candidate materials of Kitaev magnets. It is demonstrated that four-body interactions among Majorana fermions in the Kitaev spin liquid state, which are induced by applied magnetic fields as well as non-Kitaev-type exchange interactions, trigger a nematic phase transition of Majorana bonds without magnetic orders, accompanying the change of the Chern number from +/- 1 to zero. This gapful spin liquid state with zero Chern number is simply the toric code phase. Our result potentially explains the topological nematic transition recently observed in alpha-RuCl3 via heat capacity measurements (O. Tanaka et al., arXiv:2007.06757).

AB The quantum component in uncertainty relation can be naturally characterized by the quantum coherence of a quantum state, which is of paramount importance in quantum information science. Here, we experimentally investigate quantum uncertainty relations construed with relative entropy of coherence, l 1 norm of coherence, and coherence of formation. Instead of quantum state tomographic technology, we employ the classical shadow algorithm for the detection of lower bounds in quantum uncertainty relations. With an all-optical setup, we prepare a family of quantum states whose purity can be fully controlled. We experimentally explore the tightness of various lower bounds in different reference bases on the prepared states. Our results indicate that the tightness of quantum coherence lower bounds depends on the reference bases and the purity of the quantum state.

These programs are inherently convergent, complex, often resource intensive and likely require collaboration with a broad variety of stakeholders. In order to address this combination of challenges, we have captured ideas from many members in the community. This manuscript not only addresses policy makers and funding agencies (both public and private and from the regional to the international level) but also contains needs identified by industry leaders and discusses the difficulties inherent in creating an inclusive QISE curriculum. We report on the status of eighteen post-secondary education programs in QISE and provide guidance for building new programs. Lastly, we encourage the development of a comprehensive strategic plan for quantum education and workforce development as a means to make the most of the ongoing substantial investments being made in QISE.

TI Qade: solving differential equations on quantum annealers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB title Abstract We present a general method, called Qade, for solving differential equations using a quantum annealer. One of the main advantages of this method is its flexibility and reliability. On current devices, Qade can solve systems of coupled partial differential equations that depend linearly on the solution and its derivatives, with non-linear variable coefficients and arbitrary inhomogeneous terms. We test this through several examples that we implement in state-of-the-art quantum annealers. The examples include a partial differential equation and a system of coupled equations. This is the first time that equations of these types have been solved in such devices. We find that the solution can be obtained accurately for problems requiring a small enough function basis. We provide a Python package implementing the method at gitlab.com/jccriado/qade.

TI Enhanced quantum hypothesis testing via the interplay between coherent
   evolution and noises
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Previous studies in quantum information have recognized that specific types of noise can encode information in certain applications. However, the role of noise in quantum hypothesis testing, traditionally assumed to undermine performance, has not been thoroughly explored. Our study provides sufficient conditions for general noisy dynamics to surpass noiseless (unitary) dynamics within certain time interval. We then design and experimentally implement a noise-assisted quantum hypothesis testing protocol on ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance systems, which demonstrates that the success probability under certain noisy dynamics can indeed surpass the ceiling set by unitary evolution. Moreover, we show that in cases where noise initially hampers performance, strategic application of coherent controls on the system can transform those previously detrimental noises into advantageous ones. Our results, both theoretical and experimental, demonstrates the potential to leveraging noise in quantum hypothesis testing, which pushes the boundaries of quantum hypothesis testing and general quantum information processing.

TI Unconventional parametric spin-wave pumping in single-crystal iron films
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin waves hold promise for expanding the magnonics research field to include quantum information processing and classical information devices. Parametric pumping is considered a key technique to achieve this important advancement. Recently, a single-crystal iron has shown potential as a spin-wave excitation medium; however, parametric pumping in single-crystal iron films has not been investigated. In this study, we explored computationally and experimentally the characteristics of parametrically pumped spin waves in single-crystal iron thin films by respectively using large-scale micromagnetic simulations and a high-precision spectrum analyzer. The results demonstrate unconventional parametric pumping attributed to the competition between the anisotropic and excitation fields, emerging at external magnetic field and low power levels that would be insufficient to induce parametric pumping in isotropic materials. Systematic research on parametric pumping in iron could pave the way for low-energy spin-wave devices, enhancing quantum information device technology.

TI Arrow of Time and Quantum Physics
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB Based on the hypothesis that the (non-reversible) arrow of time is intrinsic in any system, no matter how small, the consequences are discussed. Within the framework of local quantum physics it is shown how such a semi-group action of time can consistently be extended to that of the group of spacetime translations in Minkowski space. In presence of massless excitations, however, there arise ambiguities in the theoretical extensions of the time translations to the past. The corresponding loss of quantum information on states upon time is determined. Finally, it is explained how the description of operations in classical terms combined with constraints imposed by the arrow of time leads to a quantum theoretical framework. These results suggest that the arrow of time is fundamental in nature and not merely a consequence of statistical effects on which the Second Law is based.

TI Efficient generation of a high-uniformity orbital angular momentum comb
   via cross-phase modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons provides an additional degree of freedom by accessing the spatial structure of light and has benefited applications from classical to quantum photonics. Here we develop a simple scheme to produce an OAM comb-a structured mode comprising multiple, equally spaced OAM components with near-uniform power-using a single cross-phase (CP) modulation. We show that embedding a CP term into a pure OAM mode converts it into a beam with a broadened, tunable OAM spectrum, whose modal distribution is governed by the CP coefficient and the beam waist. Increasing either parameter not only broadens the spectrum but also drives the modal weights toward equalization, leading to a highly uniform OAM comb. Experiments agree well with theory and yield an OAM comb with 93.5% spectral uniformity. This approach is convenient to implement, avoids amplitude-modulation loss, and opens new opportunities for OAM spectrum manipulation in high-security holographic encryption, high-capacity data transfer, and other advanced photonic systems.

   rules
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Cellular automata are interacting classical bits that display diverse emergent behaviors, from fractals to random-number generators to Turing-complete computation. We discover that quantum cellular automata (QCA) can exhibit complexity in the sense of the complexity science that describes biology, sociology, and economics. QCA exhibit complexity when evolving under 'Goldilocks rules' that we define by balancing activity and stasis. Our Goldilocks rules generate robust dynamical features (entangled breathers), network structure and dynamics consistent with complexity, and persistent entropy fluctuations. Present-day experimental platforms-Rydberg arrays, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits-can implement our Goldilocks protocols, making testable the link between complexity science and quantum computation exposed by our QCA.

TI Strongly subradiant states in planar atomic arrays
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The optically trapped ensembles of atoms provide a versatile platform for storing and coherent manipulation of quantum information. However, efficient realization of quantum information processing requires long-lived quantum states protected from the decoherence e.g. via spontaneous emission. Here, we theoretically study collective dipolar oscillations in finite planar arrays of quantum emitters in free space and analyze mechanisms that govern the emergence of strongly subradiant collective states. We demonstrate that the external coupling between the collective states associated with the symmetry of the array and with the quasi-flat dispersion of the corresponding infinite lattice plays a crucial role in the boost of their radiative lifetime. We show that among different regular arrangements of the atoms the square atomic arrays support eigenstates with minimal radiative losses proportional to N (-5)(tot) scaled with the total number of atoms N-tot.

TI Radical Polymers for Simultaneous Singlet, Doublet, and Triplet Emission
   and Extended Spin Coherence Time
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB Luminescent radical materials with multiple spin states hold immense potential for applications in quantum information processing and spin optoelectronics, however research in this area remains limited. In this work, we report the first example of radical polymers that simultaneously exhibit singlet, doublet, and triplet state emissions at room temperature. We observed that incorporating radicals into polymers significantly amplifies the emission of triplet states, likely due to the facilitation of intersystem crossing by the radicals, efficiently mediating transitions from excited singlet states to triplet states. The direct optical readout of triplet state luminescence suggests the potential for building a spin-optical interface. Furthermore, these polymers demonstrate an extended spin coherence time of approximately 400 ns at room temperature. These findings indicate the promise of these materials for advancing quantum information storage and spin optoelectronics.

AB The Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a key feature for the efficiency of numerous lattice-based cryptographic schemes. The arithmetic structure of that operation makes it an important target for soft-analytical side-channel attacks, that are powerful single-trace side-channel attacks exploiting known arithmetic structure to improve noise tolerance. Among others, Pessl et al. used the belief-propagation technique to attack a software implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism for Arm Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. However, that implementation has since been thoroughly optimized, in particular through the use of an improved version of Plantard modular arithmetic. In this paper, we describe how we successfully attack the latest available version of this implementation. We show that precise knowledge of the implementation at hand allows for better performance of the belief-propagation technique. By modeling each individual arithmetic operation performed by the microcontroller, we are able to recover the secret values processed during the NTT, even with very noisy side-channel leakage. We also study some strategies for the attacker to either maximize the success rate, or minimize the runtime of the attack.

AB CRYSTALS-Kyber has been selected by the NIST as a public-key encryption and key encapsulation mechanism to be standardized. It is also included in the NSA's suite of cryptographic algorithms recommended for national security systems. This makes it important to evaluate the resistance of CRYSTALS-Kyber's implementations to side-channel attacks. The unprotected and first-order masked software implementations have been already analysed. In this paper, we present deep learning-based message recovery attacks on the omega-order masked implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber in ARM Cortex-M4 CPU for omega <= 5. The main contribution is a new neural network training method called recursive learning. In the attack on an omega-order masked implementation, we start training from an artificially constructed neural network M-omega whose weights are partly copied from a model M omega-1 trained on the (omega - 1)-order masked implementation, and then extended to one more share. Such a method allows us to train neural networks that can recover a message bit with the probability above 99% from high-order masked implementations.

TI Fractional Shapiro steps in a cavity-coupled Josephson ring condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Josephson effect presents a fundamental example of macroscopic quantum coherence as well as a crucial enabler for metrology (e.g., voltage standard), sensing (e.g., superconducting quantum interference device), and quantum information processing (Josephson qubits). Recently, there has been a major renewal of interest in the effect, following its observation in Bose, Fermi, and dipolar atomic condensates, in exciton-polariton condensates, and in momentum space. We present theoretically a nondestructive, in situ, and real time protocol for observing the ac and dc Josephson effects including integer (recently observed in cold atoms) and fractional (hitherto unobserved in cold atoms) Shapiro steps, using a ring condensate coupled to an optical cavity. Our analysis presents a single-shot metrology standard that does not require measurement of atomic number and that challenges the conventional wisdom that quantum computations cannot be observed without being destroyed. Our results have implications for the fields of atomtronics, sensing, metrology, and quantum information processing.

TI Interpolating Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and their complex
   conjugates:characterization and quantification
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distributions serve as quantum analog representations of the classical phase-space probability, capable of exhibiting nonclassical behavior through negativity or nonreal values. Recent studies have demonstrated that the nonclassicality of KD quasiprobability distributions plays a crucial role in quantum information tasks and provides deep insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics. In this work, we introduce an interpolated KD quasiprobability distribution parametrized by a continuous variable alpha, which smoothly connects different KD quasiprobability representations. Based on the interpolated KD quasiprobability distribution, we propose a quantitative measure of nonclassicality and rigorously analyze its key properties, including unitary covariance, convexity, and monotonicity. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for this measure and conduct a comparison with other nonclassicality measures. Finally, we evaluate the nonclassicality measures for several prototypical interpolated KD quasiprobability distributions, illustrating their applicability in quantum information theory.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecular qubits offer an attractive basis for quantum information processing, but challenges remain with regard to sustained coherence. Qubits based on clock transitions offer a method to improve the coherence times. We propose a general strategy for identifying molecules with high-frequency clock transitions in systems where a d electron is coupled to a crystal-field singlet state of an f configuration, resulting in an M-J = +/- 1/2 ground state with strong hyperfine coupling. Using this approach, a 9.834 GHz clock transition was identified in a molecular Pr complex, [K(crypt)][Cp ' Pr-3(II)], leading to 3-fold enhancements in T-2 relative to other transitions in the spectrum. This result indicates the promise of the design principles outlined here for the further development of f-element systems for quantum information applications.

TI State estimation with quantum extreme learning machines beyond the

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) leverage untrained quantum dynamics to efficiently process information encoded in input quantum states, avoiding the high computational cost of training more complicated nonlinear models. On the other hand, quantum information scrambling (QIS) quantifies how the spread of quantum information into correlations makes it irretrievable from local measurements. Here, we explore the tight relation between QIS and the predictive power of QELMs. In particular, we show efficient state estimation is possible even beyond the scrambling time, for many different types of dynamics - in fact, we show that in all the cases we studied, the reconstruction efficiency at long interaction times matches the optimal one offered by random global unitary dynamics. These results offer promising venues for robust experimental QELM-based state estimation protocols, as well as providing novel insights into the nature of QIS from a state estimation perspective.

TI Dual-Isometric Projected Entangled Pair States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this Letter, we propose a new class of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computation and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.

TI Gaining confidence on the correct realization of arbitrary quantum
   computations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present verification protocols to gain confidence in the correct performance of a device implementing an arbitrary quantum computation. The derivation of the protocols is based on the fact that matchgate computations, which are classically efficiently simulable, become universal if supplemented with additional resources. We combine tools from weak simulation, randomized compiling, and statistics to derive verification circuits that (i) strongly resemble the original circuit and (ii) can be classically efficiently simulated not only in the ideal, i.e., error free scenario, but also in the realistic situation where errors are present. In fact, in one of the protocols we apply exactly the same circuit as in the original computation, however, to a slightly modified input state.

TI Computational self-testing for entangled magic states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the seminal paper [Metger and Vidick, Quantum '21], they proposed a computational self-testing protocol for Bell states in a single quantum device. Their protocol relies on the fact that the target states are stabilizer states, and hence it is highly non-trivial to reveal whether the other class of quantum states, non-stabilizer states, can be self-tested within their framework. Among non-stabilizer states, magic states are indispensable resources for universal quantum computation. In this letter, we show that a magic state for the CCZ gate can be self-tested while that for the T gate cannot. Our result is applicable to a proof of quantumness, where we can classically verify whether a quantum device generates a quantum state having non-zero magic.

TI Impact of the valley orbit coupling on exchange gate for spin qubits in
   silicon
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The mixing of conduction band valleys plays a critical role in determining electronic spectrum and dynamics in a silicon nanostructure. Here, we investigate theoretically how valley-orbit coupling affects the exchange interaction in a silicon double quantum dot. We find that exchange splitting can be strongly suppressed at finite valley phase differences between the dots because of the valley-phase-dependent dressing of the ground states and Coulomb exchange integrals, and a small valley splitting can render the exchange Hamiltonian incomplete in describing low-energy dynamics due to nearby excited valley states. The higher orbital states are also vital in calculating the exchange splitting, which is crucial for applications such as exchange gates for spin qubits.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials have attracted intense research efforts due to their promise for applications ranging from field-effect transistors and low-power electronics to fault-tolerant quantum computation. One key challenge is to fabricate 2D Dirac materials hosting Dirac electrons. Here, monolayer germanene is successfully fabricated on a Ag2Ge surface alloy. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed a linear energy dispersion relation. The latter was supported by density functional theory calculations. These results demonstrate that monolayer germanene can be realistically fabricated on a Ag2Ge surface alloy. The finding opens the door to exploration and study of 2D Dirac material physics and device applications.

SO SENSORS

This variety will allow the user to take the advantages of quantum computation while solving the problems which are suitable for two-dimensional (2D) representation or can be represented in tabular form. The performance of 2D-QGA is compared to two-dimensional GA (2D-GA), which is used to solve two-dimensional problems as well. The comparison study is performed by applying both the algorithm to the task allocation problem. The performance of 2D-QGA is better than 2D-GA while comparing execution time, convergence iteration, minimum cost generated, and population size.

TI On spectral distribution of sample covariance matrices from large

SO ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY
AB We study the eigenvalue distributions for sums of independent rank-one k-fold tensor products of large n-dimensional vectors. Previous results in the literature assume that k = o(n) and show that the eigenvalue distributions converge to the celebrated Marcenko-Pastur law under appropriate moment conditions on the base vectors. In this paper, motivated by quantum information theory, we study the regime where k grows faster, namely k = O(n). We show that the moment sequences of the eigenvalue distributions have a limit, which is different from the Marcenko-Pastur law, and the Marcenko-Pastur law limit holds if and only if k = o(n) for this tensor model. The approach is based on the method of moments.

TI A side-channel attack on a masked and shuffled software implementation
   of Saber
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, we show that a software implementation of IND-CCA-secure Saber key encapsulation mechanism protected by first-order masking and shuffling can be broken by deep learning-based power analysis. Using an ensemble of deep neural networks trained at the profiling stage, we can recover the session key and the secret key from 257 x N and 24 x 257 x N traces, respectively, where N is the number of repetitions of the same measurement. The value of N depends on the implementation of the algorithm, the type of device under attack, environmental factors, acquisition noise, etc.; in our experiments N = 10 is sufficient for a successful attack. The neural networks are trained on a combination of 80% of traces from the profiling device with a known shuffling order and 20% of traces from the device under attack captured for all-0 and all-1 messages. "Spicing" the training set with traces from the device under attack helps us minimize the negative effect of inter-device variability.

TI A tensor norm approach to quantum compatibility
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Measurement incompatibility is one of the most striking examples of how quantum physics is different from classical physics. Two measurements are incompatible if they cannot arise via classical post-processing from a third one. A natural way to quantify incompatibility is in terms of noise robustness. In the present article, we review recent results on the maximal noise robustness of incompatible measurements, which have been obtained by the present authors using free spectrahedra, and rederive them using tensor norms. In this way, we make them accessible to a broader audience from quantum information theory and mathematical physics and contribute to the fruitful interactions between Banach space theory and quantum information theory. We also describe incompatibility witnesses using the tensor norm and matrix convex set duality, emphasizing the relation between the different notions of witnesses.

TI Nonlinear spin-orbit coupling in optical thin films
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Tunable generation of vortex beams holds relevance in various fields, including communications and sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of nonlinear spin-orbit interactions in thin films of materials with second-order nonlinear susceptibility. Remarkably, the nonlinear tensor can mix the longitudinal and transverse components of the pump field. We observe experimentally our theoretical predictions in the process of second-harmonic generation from a thin film of aluminum gallium arsenide, a material platform widely spread for its role in the advancement of active, nonlinear, and quantum photonic devices. In particular, we prove that a nonlinear thin film can be used to produce vector vortex beams of second-harmonic light when excited by circularly-polarized Gaussian beams.
   Spin-orbit interaction, and the associated phenomena, is commonly observed in crystalline structure pumped with circularly polarised beam. Here, the authors showed that this is not the case, and used nonlinear thin film to produce vortex beams of second-harmonic light.

As this interpretation is not usually explored in the literature that discusses/introduces the concept of lattice gauge theory, but some recent works have been exploring Hamiltonian models in order to support some kind of quantum computation, we use this interpretation to, for example, present a brief geometric view of one class of these models: the Kitaev Quantum Double Models.

TI Optimization of Protein Quantification From Soil Samples
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB Protein profiling of soil samples has the potential to enhance our understanding of soil ecosystems and guide the development of sustainable soil management practices. In that context, there is a need to develop robust proteomic workflows, starting with reliable protein quantification. Total protein quantification with the Lowry assay is a relatively easy, rapid, and cheap method, but requires interference corrections due to reactivity with a wide range of compounds that occur in soil, plant, and other biological matrices. Here, we propose sample-specific corrections for soil protein extracts. We benchmarked our approach against other protein quantification methods, including other Lowry corrections, total hydrolysable amino acids, and Qubit total protein assay. Our sample-specific Lowry corrections did not overestimate or underestimate protein content when compared to the other methods tested. As a practical contribution, this work provides a calibration method for the Lowry assay using protein reference values in a multivariate regression approach to enable simple and high-throughput total protein quantification of soil samples.

TI Quantum multi-state Swap Test: an algorithm for estimating overlaps of
   arbitrary number quantum states
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Estimating the overlap between two states is an important task with several applications in quantum information. However, the typical swap test circuit can only measure a sole pair of quantum states at a time. In this study, a recursive quantum circuit is designed to measure overlaps of n quantum states ||phi(1)>,|phi(2)>,...|phi(n)> concurrently with O(k2k) controlled-swap(CSWAP) gates and O(k) ancillary qubits, where k = (sic)log n(sic). All pairwise overlaps among input quantum states |<phi(i)|phi(j)>|(2) can be obtained in this circuit. Compared with existing scheme for measuring the overlap of multiple quantum states, the circuit provides higher precision and less consumption of ancillary qubits. In addition, some simulation experiments are performed on IBM quantum cloud platform to verify the superiority of this algorithm.

TI Context-aware fidelity estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present context-aware fidelity estimation (CAFE), a framework for benchmarking quantum operations that offers several practical advantages over existing methods such as randomized benchmarking (RB) and crossentropy benchmarking. In CAFE, a gate or a subcircuit from some target experiment is repeated n times before being measured. By using a subcircuit, we account for effects from the spatial and temporal circuit context. Since coherent errors accumulate quadratically while incoherent errors grow linearly, we can separate them by fitting the measured fidelity as a function of n. One can additionally interleave the subcircuit with dynamical decoupling sequences to remove certain coherent error sources from the characterization when desired. We have used CAFE to experimentally validate our single- and two-qubit unitary characterizations by measuring fidelity against estimated unitaries. In numerical simulations, we find that CAFE produces fidelity estimates at least as accurate as interleaved RB while using significantly fewer resources. We also introduce a compact formulation for preparing an arbitrary two-qubit state with a single entangling operation and use it to present a concrete example using CAFE to study controlled-Z gates in parallel on a Sycamore processor.

TI On-chip parallel processing of quantum frequency comb
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The frequency degree of freedom of optical photons has been recently explored for efficient quantum information processing. Significant reduction in hardware resources and enhancement of quantum functions can be expected by leveraging the large number of frequency modes. Here, we develope an integrated photonic platform for the generation and parallel processing of quantum frequency combs (QFCs). Cavity-enhanced parametric down-conversion with Sagnac configuration is implemented to generate QFCs with identical spectral distributions. On-chip quantum interference of different frequency modes is simultaneously realized with the same photonic circuit. High interference visibility is maintained across all frequency modes with the identical circuit setting. This enables the on-chip reconfiguration of QFCs. By deterministically separating QFCs without spectral filtering, we further demonstrate high-dimensional Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. Our work provides the critical step for the efficient implementation of quantum information processing with integrated photonics using the frequency degree of freedom.

TI Observation of Wave-Packet Branching through an Engineered Conical
   Intersection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Analog quantum simulators, which efficiently represent model systems, have the potential to provide new insight toward naturally occurring phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Incorporating dissipation as a resource unlocks a wider range of out-of-equilibrium processes such as chemical reactions. Here, we operate a hybrid qubit-oscillator circuit quantum electrodynamics simulator and model nonadiabatic molecular dynamics through a conical intersection. We identify dephasing of the electronic qubit as the mechanism that drives wave-packet branching when the corresponding oscillator undergoes large amplitude motion. Furthermore, we directly observe enhanced branching when the wave-packet passes through the conical intersection. Thus, the forces that influence a chemical reaction can be viewed from the perspective of measurement backaction in quantum mechanics-there is an effective measurement-induced dephasing rate that depends on the position of the wave packet relative to the conical intersection. Our results set the groundwork for more complex simulations of chemical dynamics using quantum simulators, offering deeper insight into the role of dissipation in determining macroscopic quantities of interest such as the quantum yield of a chemical reaction.

TI Ultra-Low Threshold Resonance Switching by Terahertz Field
   Enhancement-Induced Nanobridge
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Ongoing efforts spanning decades aim to enhance the efficiency of optical devices, highlighting the need for a pioneering approach in the development of next-generation components over a broad range of electromagnetic wave spectra. The nonlinear transport of photoexcited carriers in semiconductors at low photon energies is crucial to advancements in semiconductor technology, communication, sensing, and various other fields. In this study, ultra-low threshold resonance mode switching by strong nonlinear carrier transport beyond the semi-classical Boltzmann transport regime using terahertz (THz) electromagnetic waves are demonstrated, whose energy is thousands of times smaller than the bandgap. This is achieved by employing elaborately fabricated 3D tip structures at the nanoscale, and nonlinear effects are directly observed with the THz resonance mode switching. The nanotip structure intensively localizes the THz field and amplifies it by more than ten thousand times, leading to the first observation of carrier multiplication phenomena in these low-intensity THz fields. This experimental findings, confirmed by concrete calculations, shed light on the newly discovered nonlinear behavior of THz fields and their strong interactions with nanoscale structures, with potential implications and insights for advanced THz technologies beyond the quantum regime.

TI Single-shot characterization of photon indistinguishability with
   dielectric metasurfaces
SO OPTICA
AB Characterizing the indistinguishability of photons is a key task in quantum photonics, underpinning the tuning and stabilization of the photon sources and thereby increasing the accuracy of quantum operations. The protocols for measuring the degree of indistinguishability conventionally require photon -coincidence measurements at several different time or phase delays, which is a fundamental bottleneck towards fast measurements and real-time monitoring of indistinguishability. Here, we develop a static dielectric metasurface grating without any reconfigurable elements that realizes a tailored multiport transformation in the free -space configuration without the need for phase locking and enables single -shot characterization of the indistinguishability between two photons in multiple degrees of freedom including time, spectrum, spatial modes, and polarization. Topology optimization is employed to design a silicon metasurface with polarization independence, high transmission, and high tolerance to measurement noise. We fabricate the metasurface and experimentally quantify the indistinguishability of photons in the time domain with fidelity over 98.4%. We anticipate that the developed framework based on ultrathin metasurfaces can be further extended for multi -photon states and additional degrees of freedom associated with spatial modalities.

TI Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Reconstruction Using Continuous Weak
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Reconstructing the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is an essential task for characterizing and certifying quantum processors and simulators. Existing techniques either rely on projective measurements of the system before and after coherent time evolution and do not explicitly reconstruct the full time-dependent Hamiltonian or interrupt evolution for tomography. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that an a priori unknown, time-dependent Hamiltonian can be reconstructed from continuous weak measurements concurrent with coherent time evolution in a system of two superconducting transmons coupled by a flux-tunable coupler. In contrast to previous work, our technique does not require interruptions, which would distort the recovered Hamiltonian. We introduce an algorithm, which recovers the Hamiltonian and density matrix from an incomplete set of continuous measurements, and demonstrate that it reliably extracts amplitudes of a variety of single-qubit and entangling two-qubit Hamiltonians. We further demonstrate how this technique reveals deviations from a theoretical control Hamiltonian, which would otherwise be missed by conventional techniques. Our work opens up novel applications for continuous weak measurements, such as studying nonidealities in gates, certifying analog quantum simulators, and performing quantum metrology.

TI Massive spatial qubits: Testing macroscopic nonclassicality and Casimir
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An open challenge in physics is to expand the frontiers of the validity of quantum mechanics by evidencing nonclassicality of the center of mass state of a macroscopic object. Yet another equally important task is to evidence the essential nonclassicality of the interactions which act between macroscopic objects. Here we introduce a new tool to meet these challenges: massive spatial qubits. In particular, we show that if two distinct localized states of a mass are used as the |0) and |1) states of a qubit, then we can measure this encoded spatial qubit with a high fidelity in the ax, ay, and a, bases simply by measuring its position after different duration of free evolution. This technique can be used reveal the irreducible nonclassicality of the spin and center of mass entangled state of a nanocrystal implying macrocontextuality. Further, in the context of Casimir interaction, this offers a powerful method to create and certify non-Gaussian entanglement between two neutral nano-objects. The entanglement such produced provides an empirical demonstration of the Casimir interaction being inherently quantum.

TI Orientation of the NV centers are determined using the cylindrical
   vector beam array
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The determination of nitrogen-vacancy centers plays an important role in quantum information sensing. Efficiently and rapidly determining the orientation of multiple nitrogen-vacancy center s in a low-concentration diamond is challenging due to its size. Here, we solve this scientific problem by using an azimuthally polarized beam array as the incident beam. In this paper, the optical pen is used to modulate the position of beam array to excite distinctive fluorescence characterizing multiple and different orientations of nitrogen-vacancy centers. The important result is that in a low concentration diamond layer, the orientation of multiple NV centers can be judged except when they are too close within the diffraction limit. Hence, this efficient and rapid method has a good application prospect in quantum information sensing. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Unitary-invariant method for witnessing nonstabilizerness in quantum
   processors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Nonstabilizerness, also known as 'magic', is a crucial resource for quantum computation. The growth in complexity of quantum processing units (QPUs) demands robust and scalable techniques for characterizing this resource. We introduce the basis-independent notion of set magic: a set of states has this property if at least one state in the set is a magic state. We show that certain two-state overlap inequalities, recently introduced as witnesses of basis-independent coherence, are also witnesses of set magic. Finally, we show that using such witnesses one can robustly certify nonstabilizerness in a network of QPUs without having to entangle the different devices and with reduced demands compared to the individual certification of each QPU.

TI Transitions in Computational Complexity of Continuous-Time Local Open
   Quantum Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We analyze the complexity of classically simulating continuous-time dynamics of locally interacting quantum spin systems with a constant rate of entanglement breaking noise. We prove that a polynomial time classical algorithm can be used to sample from the state of the spins when the rate of noise is higher than a threshold determined by the strength of the local interactions. Furthermore, by encoding a 1D fault tolerant quantum computation into the dynamics of spin systems arranged on two or higher dimensional grids, we show that for several noise channels, the problem of weakly simulating the output state of both purely Hamiltonian and purely dissipative dynamics is expected to be hard in the low-noise regime.

TI High Fidelity State Preparation and Measurement of Ion Hyperfine Qubits

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a method for achieving high fidelity state preparation and measurement (SPAM) using trapped ion hyperfine qubits with nuclear spins higher than I = 1/2. The ground states of these higher nuclear spin isotopes do not afford a simple frequency-selective state preparation scheme. We circumvent this limitation by stroboscopically driving strong and weak transitions, blending fast optical pumping using dipole transitions, and narrow microwave or optical quadrupole transitions. We demonstrate this method with the I = 3/2 isotope 137Ba+ to achieve a SPAM infidelity of (9.0 +/- 1.3) x 10-5 (-40.5 +/- 0.6 dB), facilitating the use of a wider range of ion isotopes with favorable wavelengths and masses for quantum computation.

TI Observation of topological Dirac fermions and surface states in
   superconducting BaSn3
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The interplay between topological electronic structure and superconductivity has attracted tremendous research interests recently as they could induce topological superconductivity (TSCs) which may be used to realize topological qubits for quantum computation. Among various TSC candidates, superconducting BaSn3 (T-c similar to 4.4 K) has been predicted to be a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) hosting two pairs of Dirac points along the Gamma-A direction. Here, by combining the use of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we identified the predicted topological Dirac fermions and confirmed the TDS nature of the compound. In addition, we observed surface states connecting the Dirac points. Our observations demonstrate BaSn3 as a superconductor with nontrivial topological electronic structures.

TI Squeezing microwaves by magnetostriction
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB A new mechanism is proved to be effective in reducing quantum noise of the electromagnetic field by exploiting the nonlinear magnetostriction in a ferrimagnet in cavity magnomechanics.
   Squeezed light finds many important applications in quantum information science and quantum metrology, and has been produced in a variety of physical systems involving optical non-linear processes. Here, we show how a non-linear magnetostrictive interaction in a ferrimagnet in cavity magnomechanics can be used to reduce quantum noise of the electromagnetic field. We show optimal parameter regimes where a substantial and stationary squeezing of the microwave output field can be achieved. Realization of the scheme is within reach of current technology in cavity electromagnonics and magnomechanics. Our work provides a new and practicable approach for producing squeezed vacuum states of electromagnetic fields, and may find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

TI Second quantised information distance
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the minimum length of a programme that can produce that string. Information distance between two strings based on Kolmogorov complexity is defined as the minimum length of a programme that can transform either string into the other one, both ways. The second quantised Kolmogorov complexity of a quantum state is the minimum average length of a quantum programme that can reproduce that state. In this paper, a second quantised information distance is defined based on the second quantised Kolmogorov complexity. It is described as the minimum average length of a transformation quantum programme between two quantum states. This distance's basic properties are discussed. A practical analogue of quantum information distance is also developed based on quantum data compression.

TI Taming the Recoil Effect in Cavity-Assisted Quantum Interconnects
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings, such as polarization, time-bin, and frequency encodings, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operation in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding the atom-photon coupling rate and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1 are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite-temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path toward fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.

TI Sharing quantum nonlocality in the noisy scenario
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB It was showed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 090401 (2020)] that there exist unbounded number of independent Bobs who can share quantum nonlocality with a single Alice by performing sequentially measurements on the Bob's half of the maximally entangled pure two-qubit state. However, from practical perspectives, errors in entanglement generation and noises in quantum measurements will result in the decay of nonlocality in the scenario. In this paper, we analyze the persistency and termination of sharing nonlocality in the noisy scenario. We first obtain the two sufficient conditions under which there exist n independent Bobs who can share nonlocality with a single Alice under noisy measurements and the noisy initial two qubit entangled state. Analyzing the two conditions, we find that the influences on persistency under different kinds of noises can cancel each other out. Furthermore, we describe the change patterns of the maximal nonlocality-sharing number under the influence of different noises. Finally, we extend our investigation to the case of arbitrary finite-dimensional systems.

TI Taking the temperature of a pure quantum state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Temperature is a deceptively simple concept that still raises deep questions at the forefront of quantum physics research. The observation of thermalization in completely isolated quantum systems, such as cold-atom quantum simulators, implies that a temperature can be assigned even to individual, pure quantum states. Here, we propose a scheme to measure the temperature of such pure states through quantum interference. Our proposal involves interferometry of an auxiliary qubit probe, which is prepared in a superposition state and subsequently decoheres due to weak coupling with a closed, thermalized many-body system. Using only a few basic assumptions about chaotic quantum systems, namely, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and the emergence of hydrodynamics at long times, we show that the qubit undergoes pure exponential decoherence at a rate that depends on the temperature of its surroundings. We verify our predictions by numerical experiments on a quantum spin chain that thermalizes after absorbing energy from a periodic drive. Our Letter provides a general method to measure the temperature of isolated, strongly interacting systems under minimal assumptions.

TI Collisional scattering of strongly interacting D-band Feshbach
   molecules in optical lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The excited bands in optical lattices manifest an important tool for studying quantum simulation and many-body physics, making it crucial to measure high-band scattering dynamics under strong interactions. This work investigates both experimentally and theoretically the collisional scattering of 6Li2 molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the D band of a one-dimensional optical lattice, with interaction strength directly tunable via magnetic Feshbach resonance. We find a clear dependence of the D-band lifetimes on the interaction strength within the strongly interacting regime, which arises from the fact that the scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the scattering length. The maximum lifetime versus lattice depth is measured to reveal the effects of interactions. We also investigate the scattering channels of D-band molecules under different interaction levels and develop a reliable two-body scattering rate equation. This work provides insight into the interplay between interaction and the collisional scattering of high-band bosons in optical lattices, paving the way for research into strong correlation effects in high-band lattice systems.

TI General simulation method for spontaneous parametric down- and
   parametric up-conversion experiments
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources are an important technology for quantum sensing and imaging. We demonstrate a general simulation method, based on modeling from first principles, reproducing the spectrally and spatially resolved abso-lute counts of a SPDC experiment. By additionally simulating parametric up-and down-conversion processes with thermal photons as well as effects of the optical system we accomplish good agreement with the experimental results. This method is broadly ap-plicable and allows for the separation of contributing processes, virtual characterization of SPDC sources, and enables the simulation of many quantum based applications.

TI Detecting confined and deconfined spinons in dynamical quantum
   simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Dynamical spin-structure factor (DSF) contains fingerprint information of collective excitations in interacting quantum spin systems. In solid state experiments, DSF can be measured through neutron scatterings. However, it is in general challenging to compute the spectral properties accurately via many-body simulations. Currently, quantum simulation and computation constitute a thriving research field, which are believed to provide a very promising platform for simulating quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a link between the many-body dynamics and quantum simulations by studying the nonequilibrium DSF (nDSF) measured on direct product states, which are accessible in contemporary quantum simulators with Rydberg atoms, superconducting qubits, etc. Based on the many-body calculations of transverse field Ising chains, we find the nDSF can be used to sensitively probe the multispinon continua associated with the two-spinon creation and spinon-antispinon process, etc. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the low-energy spinons can be confined-forming spinon bound states-under a finite longitudinal field. Our results pave the way of quantum simulation and manipulation of fractional excitations in highly entangled quantum many-body systems.

TI Prospects of single-cell nuclear magnetic resonance with sensors
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Single-cell analysis can unravel functional heterogeneity within cell populations otherwise obscured by ensemble measurements. However, noninvasive techniques that probe chemical entities and their dynamics are still lacking. This challenge could be overcome by novel sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, which enable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on unprecedented sample volumes. In this perspective, we briefly introduce NV-based quantum sensing and review the progress made in microscale NV-NMR spectroscopy. Last, we discuss approaches to enhance the sensitivity of NV ensemble magnetometers to detect biologically relevant concentrations and provide a roadmap toward their application in single-cell analysis.

TI Reveal long-lived hot electrons in 2D indium selenide and
   ferroelectric-regulated carrier dynamics of
   InSe/α-In2Se3/InSe heterostructure
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB As typical representatives of group III chalcogenides, InSe, alpha -In2Se3, and beta ' -In2Se3 have drawn considerable interest in the domain of photoelectrochemistry. However, the microscopic mechanisms of carrier dynamics in these systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that hot electrons in the three systems have different cooling rate stages and long-lived hot electrons, through the utilization of density functional theory calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization of alpha -In2Se3 weakens the nonadiabatic coupling of the nonradioactive recombination, successfully competing with the narrow bandgap and slow dephasing process, and achieving both high optical absorption efficiency and long carrier lifetime. In addition, we demonstrate that the ferroelectric polarization of alpha -In2Se3 not only enables the formation of the double type-II band alignment in the InSe/alpha -In2Se3/InSe heterostructure, with the top and bottom InSe sublayers acting as acceptors and donors, respectively, but also eliminates the hindrance of the built-in electric field at the interface, facilitating an ultrafast interlayer carrier transfer in the heterojunction. This work establishes an atomic mechanism of carrier dynamics in InSe, alpha -In2Se3, and beta ' -In2Se3 and the regulatory role of the ferroelectric polarization on the charge carrier dynamics, providing a guideline for the design of photoelectronic materials.

TI Master equations for Wigner functions with spontaneous collapse and
   their relation to thermodynamic irreversibility
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ELECTRONICS
AB Wigner functions, allowing for a reformulation of quantum mechanics in phase space, are of central importance for the study of the quantum-classical transition. A full understanding of the quantum-classical transition, however, also requires an explanation for the absence of macroscopic superpositions to solve the quantum measurement problem. Stochastic reformulations of quantum mechanics based on spontaneous collapses of the wavefunction are a popular approach to this issue. In this article, we derive the dynamic equations for the four most important spontaneous collapse models-Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory, continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model, Diosi-Penrose model, and dissipative GRW model-in the Wigner framework. The resulting master equations are approximated by Fokker-Planck equations. Moreover, we use the phase-space form of GRW theory to test, via molecular dynamics simulations, David Albert's suggestion that the stochasticity induced by spontaneous collapses is responsible for the emergence of thermodynamic irreversibility. The simulations show that, for initial conditions leading to anti-thermodynamic behavior in the classical case, GRW-type perturbations do not lead to thermodynamic behavior. Consequently, the GRW-based equilibration mechanism proposed by Albert is not observed.

TI History entanglement entropy
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A formalism is proposed to describe entangled quantum histories, and their entanglement entropy. We define a history vector, living in a tensor space with basis elements corresponding to the allowed histories, i.e. histories with nonvanishing amplitudes. The amplitudes are the components of the history vector, and contain the dynamical information. Probabilities of measurement sequences, and resulting collapse, are given by generalized Born rules: they are all expressed by means of projections and scalar products involving the history vector. Entangled history states are introduced, and a history density matrix is defined in terms of ensembles of history vectors. The corresponding history entropies (and history entanglement entropies for composite systems) are explicitly computed in two examples taken from quantum computation circuits.

TI Pump-tailored alternative Bell state generation in the first-order
   Hermite-Gaussian basis
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We demonstrate entangled-state swapping, within theHermite-Gaussian (HG) basis of first-order modes, directly from the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion within a nonlinear crystal. The method works by explicitly tailoring the spatial structure of the pump photon such that it resembles the product of the desired entangled spatial modes exiting the crystal. Importantly, the result is an entangled state of balanced HG modes, which may be beneficial in applications that depend on symmetric accumulations of geometric phase through optics or in applications of quantum sensing and imaging with azimuthal sensitivity. Furthermore, the methods are readily adaptable to other spatial mode bases.

TI Experimentally Ruling Out Joint Reality Based on Locality with
   Device-Independent Steering
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB As an essential concept to understand the world, whether the real values (or physical realities) of observables are suitable to physical systems beyond the classic has been debated for many decades. Although standard no-go results based on Bell inequalities have ruled out the joint reality of incompatible quantum observables, the possibility of giving simple yet strong arguments to rule out joint reality in any physical system (not necessarily quantum) with weaker assumptions and less observables has been explored and proposed recently. Here, we perform a device-independent experiment on a two-qubit superconducting system to show that the joint reality of two observables is incompatible with locality under the weaker assumption of the reality of observables in a single space-time region (or single qubit). Our results clearly show the violation of certain inequalities derived from both linear and nonlinear criteria. In addition, we study the robustness of the linear and nonlinear criterion against the effect of systematic decoherence. Our demonstration opens up the possibility of delineating classical and non-classical boundaries with simpler nontrivial quantum system.

TI RETRACTED: Heuristic Reordering Strategy for Quantum Circuit Mapping on
   LNN Architectures (Retracted Article)
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Because of the connection constraints of quantum devices, the quantum gate cannot operate directly on nonadjacent qubits. Quantum circuit mapping transforms a logical quantum circuit to a circuit that satisfies the connection constraints by adding SWAP gates for nonadjacent qubits. Global and local heuristic reordering strategies are proposed in this paper for quantum circuit mapping over linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architectures, which are one-dimensional topology structures, to reduce the number of SWAP gates added. Experiment results show that the average improvements of the two methods are 13.19% and 15.46%, respectively. In this paper, we consider the quantum circuit mapping problem for linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architectures. We propose a global heuristic qubit reordering optimization algorithm and a local heuristic qubit reordering optimization algorithm. Compared with the other algorithm results, the average improvements of the two methods for quantum cost are 13.19% and 15.46%, respectively. The two methods apply to the realization of quantum circuit neighboring over one-dimensional quantum architectures and can be extended to algorithms that work for other quantum architectures of different topologies.

TI Dynamic generation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with coupled
   charge qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we present a proof of principle of the formation of pure maximally entangled states from the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) class, in the experimental context of charged quantum dots. Each qubit must be identified as a pair of quantum dots, sharing an excess electron, coupled by tunneling. The electron-electron interaction is accounted for and is responsible for the coupling between the qubits. The interplay between coherent tunneling events and many-body interaction gives rise to the formation of highly entangled states. We begin by treating the problem of encoding three qubits in a system with three pairs of quantum dots, and the numerical analysis of the exact quantum dynamics to find the conditions for the generation of the GHZ states. An effective two-level model sheds light on the role of a high-order tunneling process behind the dynamics. The action of the main decoherence process, the charge dephasing, is quantified in the process. We then evaluate the physical requirements for the dynamical generation of GHZ states in an N-qubit scenario, and its challenges.

TI Construction of two-dimensional arbitrary shape 87Rb atomic array based

AB The ultra-cold atomic system is a clean and highly controllable quantum system, which can be used for quantum simulation of important physical problems in many fields such as condensed matter physics, highenergy physics, astrophysics, and chemical reactions. The constructions of optical lattices with different configurations are an important prerequisite for simulating diverse complex quantum systems, especially solid materials. In this work, we use weighted Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to generate holograms. By using liquid crystal spatial light modulator and high-resolution imaging system, holograms (in momentum space) are transformed into images in real space for constructing various two-dimensional (2D) optical trap arrays, such as simple triangular, hexagonal, square lattice and more complex honeycomb lattice. We load 87Rb ultra-cold atoms into the 2D optical trap arrays with a minimal spacing of 3 mu m in between. This method is versatile and flexible, which is helpful in expanding the application scope of quantum simulation with optical lattices.

Here, using the photoexcited triplet state of organic chromophores (pentacene doped in p- terphenyl), we optically detect coherent spin manipulation with photoluminescence contrasts exceeding 15% at room temperature, both in a molecular crystal and thin film. We further demonstrate how multifrequency spin control could enhance such systems. These results open opportunities for room-temperature quantum sensors that capitalize on the versatility of synthetic chemistry.

Namely, we improve on a result by [6] showing a quantum-inspired interactive protocol (IP) for PreciseBQP where the prover is only assumed to be a PreciseBQP machine, and show that the result can be strengthened to show an IP for NPPP with a prover which is only assumed to be an NPPP machine - which was not known before. We also show how the protocol can be used to directly verify QMA computations, thus connecting the sum-check protocol by [2] with the result of [6, 29]. Our results shed light on a quantum-inspired proof for IP = PSPACE, as PreciseQMA captures the full PSPACE power.

TI Time-dependent unbounded Hamiltonian simulation with vector norm scaling
SO QUANTUM
AB The accuracy of quantum dynamics simulation is usually measured by the error of the unitary evolution operator in the operator norm, which in turn depends on certain norm of the Hamiltonian. For unbounded operators, after suitable discretization, the norm of the Hamiltonian can be very large, which significantly increases the simulation cost. However, the operator norm measures the worst-case error of the quantum simulation, while practical simulation concerns the error with respect to a given initial vector at hand. We demonstrate that under suitable assumptions of the Hamiltonian and the initial vector, if the error is measured in terms of the vector norm, the computational cost may not increase at all as the norm of the Hamiltonian increases using Trotter type methods. In this sense, our result outperforms all previous error bounds in the quantum simulation literature. Our result extends that of [Jahnke, Lubich, BIT Numer. Math. 2000] to the time-dependent setting. We also clarify the existence and the importance of commutator scalings of Trotter and generalized Trotter methods for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulations.

Here, a combined experimental and modeling study of the ESR of a single hydrogenated Ti atom that is exchange-coupled to a Fe adatom positioned 0.6-0.8 nm away by means of atom manipulation is presented. Continuous wave and pulsed ESR of the Ti spin show a Rabi rate with two contributions, one from the tip and the other from the Fe, whose spin interactions with Ti are modulated by the radio-frequency electric field. The Fe contribution is comparable to the tip, as revealed by its dominance when the tip is retracted, and tunable using a vector magnetic field. The new ESR scheme allows on-surface individual spins to be addressed and coherently controlled without the need for magnetic interaction with a tip. This study establishes a feasible implementation of spin-based multi-qubit systems on surfaces.

TI Hook-and-Loop laser fastening of an optical frequency comb to a strongly
   driven two-level quantum system
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In order to control the state of a two-level quantum system (e.g. the spin state of an ion qubit), optical frequency combs perform a two-photon stimulated Raman process through stimulated absorption from one comb tooth and stimulated emission into another comb tooth. If the two-level energy gap is an integer multiple of the repetition rate of the laser, resonant Rabi oscillations are excited. When these latter have a frequency close to the qubit's transition one, a strongly anharmonic phase-locked cycle may exist on the Bloch sphere, which generates a sub-harmonic series of very narrow, equally spaced, spectral lines. If the repetition rate of an optical frequency comb is appropriately tuned to these latter (up to the average carrier envelope frequency), a highly resonant dynamical regime of the two-level system should be reached where the Raman stimulated absorption and emission processes would occur for any pair of adjacent comb teeth.

TI Magnetic bilayer qubits: A bipartite quantum system
SO MATERIALS TODAY ADVANCES
AB An exfoliated monolayer CrI3 possessing the ferromagnetic (FM) nature of out-of-plane Ising spin-up (or spin-do Psi n) electrons can be considered as a qubit Psi ith a quantum state of |Psi>=|up arrow>=|0> (or |Psi>=|down arrow>=|1>) due to the theory of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, here a bipartite quantum system of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and FM bilayer CrI3 is proposed for four fundamental t Psi o-qubit (2Q) quantum states (-|Psi Psi>) of |up arrow down arrow>=|01>, |down arrow up arrow>=|10>, |up arrow up arrow>=|00> and |down arrow down arrow>=|11>, respectively. Energy-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectropolarimetry was used to detect d-d transitions of the FM and AFM bilayer CrI3 for the four fundamental quantum states. The obtained MCD spectra of the d-d transitions with spin-frustration and spin-parallelism possess quantum signals of the four fundamental 2Q quantum states at BB = 0, Psi here BB is the angle between the magnetic field and the surface normal. Hence, the bilayer CrI3 is a potential candidate for use in quatum computer.

TI State Estimation and Control for Stochastic Quantum Dynamics With
   Homodyne Measurement: Stabilizing Qubits Under Uncertainty
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper introduces a Lyapunov-based control strategy alongside two filtering methods for controlling and estimating the evolution of coherence vector elements from sequential homodyne measurements. The methods include traditional quantum filtering and a novel extended Kalman filter, which explicitly addresses the dynamics of a stochastic master equation with correlated noise, thereby ensuring the quantum properties of the estimated state variable by design. We also explore scenarios where the system's Hamiltonian is unknown, demonstrating that both filters exhibit reduced performance with increased estimation errors. To address this, we propose a multiple model estimation scheme applicable to either filter. The estimated density operator is then controlled using the proposed switching-based Lyapunov scheme, which guarantees noise-to-state practical stability in probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in stabilizing a qubit coupled to a leaky cavity under homodyne detection, even with uncertainty in the resonance frequency.

AB A critical feature in today's quantum circuit is that they have permutable two-qubit operators. The flexibility in ordering the permutable two-qubit gates leads to more compiler optimization opportunities. However, it also imposes significant challenges due to the additional degree of freedom. Our Contributions are two-fold. We first propose a general methodology that can find structured solutions for scalable quantum hardware. It breaks down the complex compilation problem into two sub-problems that can be solved at small scale. Second, we show how such a structured method can be adapted to practical cases that handle sparsity of the input problem graphs and the noise variability in real hardware. Our evaluation evaluates our method on IBM and Google architecture coupling graphs for up to 1,024 qubits and demonstrate better result in both depth and gate count - by up to 72% reduction in depth, and 66% reduction in gate count. Our real experiments on IBM Mumbai show that we can find better expected minimal energy than the state-of-the-art baseline.

TI High Quality Quasinormal Modes of Phononic Crystals for Quantum
   Acoustodynamics
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Phononic crystals are a promising platform for the study of quantum acoustodynamics. In a recent experiment, the interaction of a superconducting quantum bit with modes of a phononic crystal has been demonstrated. The field of these modes is localized in a compact area, providing high values of the coupling constant with the qubit. However, the Q-factor of phononic crystal modes is strongly limited (similar to 1050) due to a phonon emission from the crystal ends. For further use of phononic crystals in research in the field of quantum acoustodynamics, it is desirable to overcome this limitation in the quality factor. In this work, we have proposed a structure consisting of a phononic crystal placed between the Bragg mirrors. Our simulations predict that the Q-factor in such a structure can reach (similar to 100000). We demonstrate experimental results in which this structure has a Q-factor (similar to 60,000), which is 60 times higher than that of an acoustic crystal of the same size.

TI Entangling operations in nonlinear two-atom Tavis-Cummings models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We derive an analytical approximate solution of the time-dependent state vector in terms of material Bell states and coherent states of the field for a generalized two-atom Tavis-Cummings model with nonlinear intensity-dependent matter-field interaction. Using this solution, we obtain simple expressions for the atomic concurrence and purity in order to study the entanglement in the system at specific interaction times. We show how to implement entangling atomic operations through measurement of the field. We illustrate how these operations can lead to a complete Bell measurement. Furthermore, when considering two orthogonal states of the field as levels of a third qubit, it is possible to implement a unitary three-qubit gate capable of generating authentic tripartite entangled states such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and the W state. As an example of the generic model, we present an ion-trap setting employing the quantized mode of the center-of-mass motion instead of the photonic field, showing that the implementation of realistic entangling operations from intrinsic nonlinear matter-field interactions is indeed possible.

AB NIST has recently selected CRYSTALS-Kyber as a newpublic key encryption and key establishment algorithm to be standardized. This makes it important to evaluate the resistance of CRYSTALS-Kyber implementations to side-channel attacks. Software implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber have already been thoroughly analysed. The discovered vulnerabilities helped improve the subsequently released versions and promoted stronger countermeasures against side-channel attacks. In this paper, we present the first attack on a protected hardware implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber. We demonstrate a practical message (shared key) recovery attack on the first-order masked FPGA implementation of Kyber-512 by Kamucheka et al. (2022) using power analysis based on the Hamming distance leakage model. The presented attack exploits a vulnerability located in the masked message decoding procedure which is called during the decryption step of the decapsulation. The message recovery is performed using a profiled deep learning-based method which extracts the message directly, without extracting each share explicitly. By repeating the same decapsulation process multiple times, it is possible to increase the success rate of full shared key recovery to 99%.

TI A Survey of Analog Computing for Domain-Specific Accelerators
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Analog computing has re-emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems in various domains due to its energy efficiency and inherent parallelism. This paper summarizes recent advancements in analog computing, exploring discrete time and continuous time methods for solving combinatorial optimization problems, solving partial differential equations and systems of linear equations, accelerating machine learning (ML) inference, multi-beam beamforming, signal processing, quantum simulation, and statistical inference. We highlight CMOS implementations that leverage switched-capacitor, switched-current, and radio-frequency circuits, as well as non-CMOS implementations that leverage non-volatile memory, wave physics, and stochastic processes. These advancements demonstrate high-speed, energy-efficient computations for computational electromagnetics, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solvers, artificial intelligence (AI) inference engines, wireless systems, and related applications. Theoretical foundations, experimental validations, and potential future applications in high-performance computing and signal processing are also discussed.

TI Nonlocality for Generic Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Bell's theorem shows that correlations created by a single entangled quantum state cannot be reproduced classically. Such correlations are called nonlocal. They are the elementary manifestation of a broader phenomenon called network nonlocality, where several entangled states shared in a network create network nonlocal correlations. In this Letter, we provide the first class of strategies producing nonlocal correlations in generic networks. In these strategies, called color matching (CM), any source takes a color at random or in superposition, where the colors are labels for a basis of the associated Hilbert space. A party (besides other things) checks if the color of neighboring sources match. We show that in a large class of networks without input, well-chosen quantum CM strategies result in nonlocal correlations that cannot be produced classically. For our construction, we introduce the graph theoretical concept of rigidity of classical strategies in networks, and using the Finner inequality, establish a deep connection between network nonlocality and graph theory. In particular, we establish a link between CM strategies and the graph coloring problem. This work is extended in a longer paper [M.-O. Renou, Phys. Rev. A 105, 022408 (2022)], where we introduce a second family of rigid strategies called token counting, leading to network nonlocality.

TI Reproducible families of codes and cryptographic applications
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB Structured linear block codes such as cyclic, quasi-cyclic and quasi-dyadic codes have gained an increasing role in recent years both in the context of error control and in that of code-based cryptography. Some well known families of structured linear block codes have been separately and intensively studied, without searching for possible bridges between them. In this article, we start from well known examples of this type and generalize them into a wider class of codes that we call F-reproducible codes. Some families of T-reproducible codes have the property that they can be entirely generated from a small number of signature vectors, and consequently admit matrices that can be described in a very compact way. We denote these codes as compactly reproducible codes and show that they encompass known families of compactly describable codes such as quasi-cyclic and quasi-dyadic codes. We then consider some cryptographic applications of codes of this type and show that their use can be advantageous for hindering some current attacks against cryptosystems relying on structured codes. This suggests that the general framework we introduce may enable future developments of code-based cryptography.

TI Sympathetically cooled highly charged ions in a radio-frequency trap
   with superconducting magnetic shielding
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We sympathetically cool highly charged ions (HCI) in Coulomb crystals of Doppler-cooled Be+ ions confined in a cryogenic linear Paul trap that is integrated into a fully enclosing radio-frequency resonator manufactured from superconducting niobium. By preparing a single Be+ cooling ion and a single HCI, quantum logic spectroscopy toward frequency metrology and qubit operations with a great variety of species are enabled. While cooling down the assembly through its transition temperature into the superconducting state, an applied quantization magnetic field becomes persistent, and the trap becomes shielded from subsequent external electromagnetic fluctuations. Using a magnetically sensitive hyperfine transition of Be+ as a qubit, we measure the fractional decay rate of the stored magnetic field to be at the 10(-10) s(-1) level. Ramsey interferometry and spin-echo measurements yield coherence times of >400 ms, demonstrating excellent passive magnetic shielding at frequencies down to DC. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Bipartite quantum measurements with optimal single-sided
   distinguishability
SO QUANTUM
AB We analyse orthogonal bases in a composite N x N Hilbert space describing a bipartite quantum system and look for a basis with optimal single-sided mutual state distinguishability. This condition implies that in each subsystem the N-2 reduced states form a regular simplex of a maximal edge length, defined with respect to the trace distance. In the case N = 2 of a two-qubit system our solution coincides with the elegant joint measurement introduced by Gisin. We derive explicit expressions of an analogous constellation for N = 3 and provide a general construction of N-2 states forming such an optimal basis in H-N circle times H-N. Our construction is valid for all dimensions for which a symmetric informationally complete (SIC) generalized measurement is known. Furthermore, we show that the one-party measurement that distinguishes the states of an optimal basis of the composite system leads to a local quantum state tomography with a linear reconstruction formula. Finally, we test the introduced tomographical scheme on a complete set of three mutually unbiased bases for a single qubit using two different IBM machines.

TI Stable and efficient charging of superconducting capacitively shunted
   flux quantum batteries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum batteries, as miniature energy storage devices, have sparked significant research interest in recent years. However, achieving rapid and stable energy transfer in quantum batteries while obeying quantum speed limits remains a critical challenge. In this work, we experimentally optimize the charging process by leveraging the unique energy level structure of a superconducting capacitively shunted flux qubit, using counterdiabatic pulses in the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. Compared to previous studies, we impose two different norm constraints on the driving Hamiltonian, achieving optimal charging without exceeding the overall driving strength. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a charging process that achieves the quantum speed limit. In addition, we introduce a dimensionless parameter S to unify charging speed and stability, offering a universal metric for performance optimization. In contrast to metrics such as charging power and thermodynamic efficiency, the S criterion quantitatively captures the stability of ergotropy while also considering the charging speed. Our results highlight the potential of the capacitively shunted qubit platform as an ideal candidate for realizing three-level quantum batteries and deliver novel strategies for optimizing energy transfer protocols.

TI Thermodynamics of decoherence
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB We investigate the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of pure decoherence. In a pure decoherence process, the system Hamiltonian is a constant of motion and there is no direct energy exchange between the system and its surroundings. Nevertheless, the environment's energy is not generally conserved and in this work we show that this leads to non-trivial heat dissipation as a result of decoherence alone. This heat has some very distinctive properties: it obeys an integral fluctuation relation and can be interpreted in terms of the entropy production associated with populations in the energy eigenbasis of the initial state. We show that the heat distribution for a pure decoherence process is different from the distribution of work done by the initial system-bath interaction quench. Instead, it corresponds to a mixture of work distributions of cyclical processes, each conditioned on a state of the open system. Inspired by recent experiments on impurities in ultracold gases, we demonstrate our general results by studying the heat generated by the decoherence of a qubit immersed within a degenerate Fermi gas in the lowest band of a species-selective optical lattice.

TI Spin Polarization, Electron-Phonon Coupling, and Zero-Phonon Line of the
   NV Center in 3C-SiC
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 3C-SiC, the analog of the NV center in diamond, has recently emerged as a solid-state qubit with competitive properties and significant technological advantages. Combining first-principles calculations and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide thorough insight into its magneto-optical properties. By applying resonantly excited electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified the zerophonon absorption line of the (3)A(2) -> E-3 transition at 1289 nm (within the telecom 0-band) and measured its phonon sideband, the analysis of which reveals a Huang-Rhys factor of S = 2.85 and a Debye-Waller factor of 5.8%. The low-temperature spin-lattice relaxation time was found to be exceptionally long (T-1 = 17 s at 4 K). All these properties make NV in 3C-SiC a strong competitor for qubit applications. In addition, the strong variation of the zero- field splitting in the range 4-380 K allows its application for nanoscale thermal sensing.

TI Continuous automatic polarization channel stabilization from heterodyne
   detection of coexisting dim reference signals
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum networking continues to encode information in polarization states due to ease and precision. The variable environmental polarization transformations induced by deployed fiber need correction for deployed quantum networking. Here, we present a method for automatic polarization compensation (APC) and demonstrate its performance on a metropolitan quantum network. Designing an APC involves many design decisions as indicated by the diversity of previous solutions in the literature. Our design leverages heterodyne detection of wavelength- multiplexed dim classical references for continuous high-bandwidth polarization measurements used by newly developed multi-axis (non-)linear control algorithm(s) for complete polarization channel stabilization with no downtime. This enables continuous relatively high-bandwidth correction without significant added noise from classical reference signals. We demonstrate the performance of our APC using a variety of classical and quantum characterizations. Finally, we use C-band and L-band APC versions to demonstrate continuous high-fidelity entanglement distribution on a metropolitan quantum network with an average relative fidelity of 0.94 +/- 0.03 for over 30 hrs.

TI Integrated Janus dipole source for selective coupling to silicon
   waveguide networks
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The efficient selective and directional coupling of light to waveguiding circuitry at the nanoscale is one of the key challenges in nanophotonics, as it constitutes a prerequisite for many applications, including information processing, routing, and quantum technologies. Various exotic nanostructures and nanoparticle arrangements have been designed to achieve directional coupling with compact on-chip integration remaining one of the foremost hurdles to realizing many real-world devices. At the same time, selective coupling to one of several neighboring waveguides is much more difficult to achieve and control. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a subwavelength selective coupler integrated in a waveguide network, with selectivity controlled by wavelength, polarization, and angle of incidence. We utilize a Janus source, which is composed of a superposition of electric and magnetic dipoles, supported by a silicon nanocylinder. By placing the nanocylinder between identical single mode silicon waveguides, we successfully achieve selective coupling with a high contrast ratio between the waveguides. The operating wavelength of the Janus dipolar source can be easily tailored, and the coupling efficiency is also shown to be conveniently boosted by the addition of multiple nanocylinders. Our compact approach provides a direct path toward on-chip highly directional nanoscale sources for a plethora of applications, including information routing, metrology, and quantum technologies.

TI Isotope-Purification-Induced Reduction of Spin-Relaxation and
   Spin-Coherence Times in Semiconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Paramagnetic defects and nuclear spins are often the major sources of decoherence and spin relaxation in solid-state qubits realized by optically addressable point defect spins in semiconductors. It is commonly accepted that a high degree of depletion of nuclear spins can enhance the coherence time by reducing magnetic noise. Here we show that the isotope purification beyond a certain optimal level can become contraproductive when both electron and nuclear spins are present in the vicinity of the qubits, particularly for half-spin systems. Using state-of-the-art numerical tools and considering the silicon-vacancy qubit in various spin environments, we demonstrate that the coupling of the spin-3/2 qubit to a spin bath of spin-1/2 point defects in the lattice can be significantly enhanced by isotope purification. The enhanced coupling shortens the spin-relaxation time that in turn may limit the coherence time of spin qubits. Our results can be generalized to triplet point defect qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and the divacancy in silicon carbide.

TI Unitary Transformation of the Electronic Hamiltonian with an Exact
   Quadratic Truncation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Expansion
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The application of current and near-term quantum hardware to the electronic structure problem is highly limited by qubit counts, coherence times, and gate fidelities. To address these restrictions within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework, many recent contributions have suggested dressing the electronic Hamiltonian to include a part of electron con-elation, leaving the rest to VQE state preparation. We present a new dressing scheme that combines the preservation of the Hamiltonian hermiticity and an exact quadratic truncation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. The new transformation is constructed as the exponent of an involutory linear combination (ILC) of anti-commuting Pauli products. It incorporates important strong correlation effects in the dressed Hamiltonian and can be viewed as a classical preprocessing step to alleviate the resource requirements of the subsequent VQE application. The assessment of the new computational scheme for the electronic structure of the LiH, H2O, and N-2 molecules shows a significant increase in efficiency compared to the conventional qubit coupled cluster dressings.

TI Nonadiabatic Dynamics in a Continuous Circularly Polarized Laser Field
   with Floquet Phase-Space Surface Hopping
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Nonadiabatic chemical reactions involving continuous circularly polarized light (cw CPL) have not attracted as much attention as dynamics in unpolarized/linearly polarized light. However, including circularly (in contrast to linearly) polarized light allows one to effectively introduce a complex-valued time-dependent Hamiltonian, which offers a new path for control or exploration through the introduction of Berry forces. Here, we investigate several inexpensive semiclassical approaches for modeling such nonadiabatic dynamics in the presence of a time-dependent complex-valued Hamiltonian, beginning with a straightfor-ward instantaneous adiabatic fewest-switches surface hopping (IA-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position and time), continuing to a standard Floquet fewest switches surface hopping (F-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position and frequency), and ending with an exotic Floquet phase-space surface hopping (F-PSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position, frequency, and momentum). Using a set of model systems with time-dependent complex-valued Hamiltonians, we show that the Floquet phase-space adiabats are the optimal choice of basis as far as accounting for Berry phase effects and delivering accuracy. Thus, the F-PSSH algorithm sets the stage for future modeling of nonadiabatic dynamics under strong externally pumped circular polarization.

TI Evidence of ∅0-Josephson junction from skewed diffraction
   patterns in Sn-InSb nanowires
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study Josephson junctions based on InSb nanowires with Sn shells. We observe skewed critical current diffraction patterns: the maxima in forward and reverse current bias are at different magnetic flux, with a displacement of 20-40 mT. The skew is greatest when the external field is nearly perpendicular to the nanowire, in the substrate plane. This orientation suggests that spin-orbit interaction plays a role. We develop a phenomenological model and perform tight-binding calculations, both methods reproducing the essential features of the experiment. The effect modeled is the 40-Josephson junction with higher-order Josephson harmonics. The system is of interest for Majorana studies: the effects are either precursor to or concomitant with topological superconductivity. Current-phase relations that lack inversion symmetry can also be used to design quantum circuits with engineered nonlinearity.

TI Random circuit block-encoded matrix and a proposal of quantum LINPACK
   benchmark
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The UNPACK benchmark reports the performance of a computer for solving a system of linear equations with dense random matrices. Although this task was not designed with a real application directly in mind, the UNPACK benchmark has been used to define the list of TOP500 supercomputers since the debut of the list in 1993. We propose that a similar benchmark, called the quantum UNPACK benchmark, could be used to measure the whole machine performance of quantum computers. The success of the quantum UNPACK benchmark should be viewed as the minimal requirement for a quantum computer to perform a useful task of solving linear algebra problems, such as linear systems of equations. We propose an input model called the Random Circuit Block-Encoded Matrix (RACBEM), which is a proper generalization of a dense random matrix in the quantum setting. The RACBEM model is efficient to be implemented on a quantum computer and can be designed to optimally adapt to any given quantum architecture, with relying on a black-box quantum compiler. Besides solving linear systems, the RACBEM model can be used to perform a variety of linear algebra tasks relevant to many physical applications, such as computing spectral measures, time series generated by a Hamiltonian simulation, and thermal averages of the energy. We implement these linear algebra operations on IBM Q quantum devices as well as quantum virtual machines, and demonstrate their performance in solving scientific computing problems.

TI Unconditional mechanical squeezing via backaction-evading measurements
   and nonoptimal feedback control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Backaction-evading (BAE) measurements of a mechanical resonator, by continuously monitoring a single quadrature of motion, can achieve precision below the zero-point uncertainty. When this happens, the measurement leaves the resonator in a quantum squeezed state. The squeezed state so generated is however conditional on the measurement outcomes, while for most applications it is desirable to have a deterministic, i.e., unconditional, squeezed state with the desired properties. In this work we apply feedback control to achieve deterministic manipulation of mechanical squeezing in an optomechanical system subject to a continuous BAE measurement. We study in details two strategies, direct (Markovian) and state-based (Bayesian) feedback. We show that both are capable to achieve optimal performances, i.e., a vanishing noise added by the feedback loop. Moreover, even when the feedback is restricted to be a time-varying mechanical force (experimentally friendly scenario) and an imperfect BAE regime is considered, the ensuing nonoptimal feedback may still obtain significant amount of squeezing. In particular, we show that Bayesian feedback control is nearly optimal for a wide range of sideband resolution. Our analysis is of direct relevance for ultrasensitive measurements and quantum state engineering in state-of-the-art optomechanical devices.

TI Device-independent and semi-device-independent entanglement
   certification in broadcast Bell scenarios
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB It has recently been shown that by broadcasting the subsystems of a bipartite quantum state, one can activate Bell nonlocality and significantly improve noise tolerance bounds for device-independent entanglement certification. In this work we strengthen these results and explore new aspects of this phenomenon. First, we prove new results related to the activation of Bell nonlocality. We construct Bell inequalities tailored to the broadcast scenario, and show how broadcasting can lead to even stronger notions of Bell nonlocality activation. In particular, we exploit these ideas to show that bipartite states admitting a local hidden-variable model for general measurements can lead to genuine tripartite nonlocal correlations. We then study device-independent entanglement certification in the broadcast scenario, and show through semidefinite programming techniques that device-independent entanglement certification is possible for the two-qubit Werner state in essentially the entire range of entanglement. Finally, we extend the concept of EPR steering to the broadcast scenario, and present novel examples of activation of the two-qubit isotropic state. Our results pave the way for broadcast-based device-independent and semi-device-independent protocols.

TI Quantum magic and computational complexity in the neutrino sector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider the quantum magic in systems of dense neutrinos undergoing coherent flavor transformations, relevant for supernova and neutron-star binary mergers. Mapping the three-flavor-neutrino system to qutrits, the evolution of quantum magic is explored in the single scattering angle limit for a selection of initial tensor-product pure states for N nu 8 neutrinos. For |nu e)(R) N nu initial states, the magic, as measured by the alpha = 2 stabilizer Renyi entropy M2, is found to decrease with radial distance from the neutrino sphere, reaching a value that lies below the maximum for tensor-product qutrit states. Further, the asymptotic magic per neutrino, M2/N nu, decreases with increasing N nu. In contrast, the magic evolving from states containing all three flavors reaches values only possible with entanglement, with the asymptotic M2/N nu increasing with N nu. These results highlight the connection between the complexity in simulating quantum physical systems and the parameters of the Standard Model.

TI Non-Local Parallel Processing and Database Settlement Using Multiple
   Teleportation Followed by Grover Post-Selection
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum information applications emerged decades ago, initially introducing a parallel development that mimicked the approach and development of classical computer science. However, in the current decade, novel computer-science concepts were rapidly extended to the fields of quantum processing, computation, and communication. Thus, areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks have their quantum versions; furthermore, the quantum brain properties of learning, analyzing, and gaining knowledge are discussed. Quantum properties of matter conglomerates have been superficially explored in such terrain; however, the settlement of organized quantum systems able to perform processing can open a new pathway in the aforementioned domains. In fact, quantum processing involves certain requisites as the settlement of copies of input information to perform differentiated processing developed far away or in situ to diversify the information stored there. Both tasks at the end provide a database of outcomes with which to perform either information matching or final global processing with at least a subset of those outcomes. When the number of processing operations and input information copies is large, parallel processing (a natural feature in quantum computation due to the superposition) becomes the most convenient approach to accelerate the database settlement of outcomes, thus affording a time advantage. In the current study, we explored certain quantum features to realize a speed-up model for the entire task of processing based on a common information input to be processed, diversified, and finally summarized to gain knowledge, either in pattern matching or global information availability. By using superposition and non-local properties, the most valuable features of quantum systems, we realized parallel local processing to set a large database of outcomes and subsequently used post-selection to perform an ending global processing or a matching of information incoming from outside. We finally analyzed the details of the entire procedure, including its affordability and performance. The quantum circuit implementation, along with tentative applications, were also discussed. Such a model could be operated between large processing technological systems using communication procedures and also on a moderately controlled quantum matter conglomerate. Certain interesting technical aspects involving the non-local control of processing via entanglement were also analyzed in detail as an associated but notable premise.

With the increase of the well-defined depletion region, the breakdown voltages of three variants are 17.1, 20.6, and 23.0 V, respectively, the peak PDP wavelengths are 450 nm, 540 nm, and 640 nm, respectively. The timing jitter below 50 ps (FWHM) at 5 V excess bias voltage are achieved in SPAD1 and SPAD2. SPAD3 shows a high PDP over a wide spectral range, with a peak PDP of 41.3% at 640 nm, and 22.3% at 850 nm, and the timing jitter 96 ps at 3 V excess bias voltage. The proposed SPADs are suitable to low-pitch, large-format image sensors for high-speed, time-resolved applications and quantum imaging.

TI Integrated array of coupled exciton-polariton condensates
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB A central challenge for advancing polariton-based circuits is the controlled and scalable coupling of individual condensates. Existing approaches based on etched or epitaxially grown microcavities are fabrication-intensive and restrict in-plane coupling. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a lithographically defined silicon-based platform of high-contrast grating (HCG) microcavities with a ladder-type pi-conjugated polymer. In this system, doublet cavities exhibit mode hybridization into bonding and antibonding states, where coupling is mediated across shared HCG mirrors. Extending the design to arrays, N-coupled condensates exhibit systematic red-shifts of the condensate energy, due to delocalization, and a progressive threshold reduction, consistent with extended binding modes. Our experimental results are quantitatively supported by transition-matrix multi-scattering simulations, together with tight-binding modelling. First-order coherence measurements using Michelson interferometry confirm the existence of spatially extended condensates with exponentially decaying temporal coherence. Altogether, these results establish a scalable route toward integrated polariton devices and quantum photonic networks.

TI SiN integrated photonic components in the visible to near-infrared
   spectral region
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated photonics has emerged as one of the most promising platforms for quantum applications. The performances of quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPIC) necessitate a demanding optimization to achieve enhanced properties and tailored characteristics with more stringent requirements with respect to their classical counterparts. In this study, we report on the simulation, fabrication, and characterization of a series of fundamental components for photons manipulation in QPIC based on silicon nitride. These include crossing waveguides, multimodeinterferometer-based integrated beam splitters (MMIs), asymmetric integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) based on MMIs, and micro-r ing resonators. Our investigation revolves primarily around the visible to near-infrared spectral region, as these integrated structures are meticulously designed and tailored for optimal operation within this wavelength range. By advancing the development of these elementary building blocks, we aim to pave the way for significant improvements in QPIC in a spectral region only little explored so far.

TI On-chip interference of scattering from two individual molecules
SO OPTICA
AB Integrated photonic circuits offer a promising route for studying coherent cooperative effects of a controlled collection of quantum emitters. However, spectral inhomogeneities, decoherence, and material incompatibilities in the solid state make this a nontrivial task. Here, we demonstrate efficient coupling of a pair of Fourier-limited organic molecules embedded in a polyethylene film to aTiO(2) microdisc resonator on a glass chip. Moreover, we tune the resonance frequencies of the emitters with respect to that of the microresonator by employing nanofabricated electrodes. For two molecules separated by a distance of about 8 mu m and an optical phase difference of about pi/2, we report on a large collective extinction of the incident light in the forward direction and the destructive interference of its scattering in the backward direction. Our work sets the ground for coherent coupling of several quantum emitters via a common mode and realization of polymer-based hybrid quantum photonic circuits.

TI Distance-four quantum codes with combined postselection and error
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB When storing encoded qubits, if single faults can be corrected and double faults can be postselected against, logical errors occur due to at least three faults. At current noise rates, having to restart when two errors are detected prevents very long-term storage, but that should not be an issue for low-depth computations. We consider distance-four efficient encodings of multiple qubits into a modified planar patch of the 16-qubit surface code. We simulate postselected error correction for up to 12 000 rounds of parallel stabilizer measurements and subsequently estimate the cumulative probability of logical error for up to 12 encoded qubits. Our results demonstrate a combination of low logical error rate and low physical overhead. For example, the distance-four surface code, using postselection, accumulates 25 times less error than its distance-five counterpart. For six encoded qubits, a distance-four code using 25 qubits protects as well as the distance-five surface code using 246 qubits. Hence, distance-four codes, using postselection in a planar geometry, are qubit-efficient candidates for fault-tolerant, moderate-depth computations.

TI Simultaneous type-I and type-II phase matching for second-order
   nonlinearity in integrated lithium niobate waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Second-order optical nonlinearity is widely used for both classical and quantum photonic applications. Due to material dispersion and phase matching requirements, the polarization of optical fields is pre-defined during the fabrication. Only one type of phase matching condition is normally satisfied, and this limits the device flexibility. Here, we demonstrate that phase matching for both type-I and type-II second-order optical nonlinearity can be realized simultaneously in the same waveguide fabricated from thin-film lithium niobate. This is achieved by engineering the geometry dispersion to compensate for the material dispersion and birefringence. The simultaneous realization of both phase matching conditions is verified by the polarization dependence of second-harmonic generation. Correlated photons are also generated through parametric down conversion from the same device. This work provides a novel approach to realize versatile photonic functions with flexible devices.

TI Mode-Matched Resonant Excitation of a Nanowire Quantum Dot in a
   Nanophotonic Waveguide
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nanowire-based quantum dots as sources of single photons are promising candidates for the implementation of quantum photonic technologies. Achieving coherent control of these sources is essential for generating indistinguishable single photons-a key requirement for quantum interference. However, coherent excitation of nanowire quantum dots via resonant pumping has remained a long-standing challenge due to high laser suppression requirements. Here we establish a reliable technique to implement resonant excitation of a quantum dot in a tapered single-mode nanowire waveguide by complementing polarization-rejection with mode-matching to minimize the amount of backscattered laser. We demonstrate low multiphoton emission [g X (2)(0) = 0.019] and multiple Rabi oscillations under pulsed resonant excitation. We also report on two-photon indistinguishability under resonant excitation, achieving an interference visibility of 41%. This is a significant improvement over incoherent excitation and represents an important step in the development of a scalable approach for producing coherent single-photon sources.

TI Semideterministic quantum dot placement in heteroepitaxy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge, owing to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QD distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.

TI Highly uniform GaSb quantum dots with indirect-direct bandgap crossover
   at telecom range
SO APL MATERIALS
AB We demonstrate a new quantum-confined semiconductor material based on GaSb quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a single-crystalline AlGaSb matrix by filling droplet-etched nanoholes. The droplet-mediated growth mechanism allows formation of low QD densities required for non-classical single-QD light sources. The photoluminescence (PL) experiments reveal that the GaSb QDs have an indirect-direct bandgap crossover at telecom wavelengths. This is due to the alignment of the Gamma and L valleys in the conduction band as a result of the quantum confinement controlled by the dimensions of the nanostructure. We show that in the direct bandgap regime close to 1.5 mu m wavelength, the GaSb QDs have a type I band alignment and exhibit excitonic emission with narrow spectral lines and very low inhomogeneous broadening of PL emission owing to the high material quality and dimensional uniformity. These properties are extremely promising in terms of applications in infrared quantum optics and quantum photonic integration.

TI Beyond the Four-Level Model: Dark and Hot States in Quantum Dots Degrade
   Photonic Entanglement
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Entangled photon pairs are essential for a multitude of quantum photonic applications. To date, the best performing solid-state quantum emitters of entangled photons are semiconductor quantum dots operated around liquidhelium temperatures. To favor the widespread deployment of these sources, it is important to explore and understand their behavior at temperatures accessible with compact Stirling coolers. Here we study the polarization entanglement among photon pairs from the biexciton-exciton cascade in GaAs quantum dots at temperatures up to -,65 K. We observe entanglement degradation accompanied by changes in decay dynamics, which we ascribe to thermal population and depopulation of hot and dark states in addition to the four levels relevant for photon pair generation. Detailed calculations considering the presence and characteristics of the additional states and phononassisted transitions support the interpretation. We expect these results to guide the optimization of quantum dots as sources of highly entangled photons at elevated temperatures.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE EDINBURGH MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY
AB For a state omega on a C*-algebra A, we characterize all states rho in the weak* closure of the set of all states of the form omega circle phi, where phi is a map on A of the form phi(x) = Sigma(n)(i=1) a*(i)xa(i), Sigma(n)(i=1) a*(i)a(i) = 1 (a(i) is an element of A, n is an element of N). These are precisely the states rho that satisfy parallel to rho vertical bar J parallel to <= parallel to omega vertical bar J parallel to for each ideal J of A. The corresponding question for normal states on a von Neumann algebra R (with the weak* closure replaced by the norm closure) is also considered. All normal states of the form omega circle psi, where psi is a quantum channel on R (that is, a map of the form psi(x) = Sigma(j) a*(j)xa(j), where a(j) is an element of R are such that the sum Sigma(j) a*(j)a(j) converge to 1 in the weak operator topology) are characterized. A variant of this topic for hermitian functionals instead of states is investigated. Maximally mixed states are shown to vanish on the strong radical of a C*-algebra and for properly infinite von Neumann algebras the converse also holds.

TI Enhancing Design and Performance Analysis of Satellite

AB Satellite QKD/FSO systems, which facilitate quantum key distribution (QKD) over free-space optical (FSO) links between satellites and ground stations, present a promising pathway toward achieving global security in upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications. Our study focuses on a superior type of these systems, the satellite EB/CV-QKD/FSO, which utilizes the continuous-variable (CV) method for quantum state representation and the entanglement-based (EB) scheme for QKD implementation. We propose the use of optical phase-shift keying (QPSK) signaling and dual-threshold/heterodyne detection (DT/HD) receivers to bolster the reliability and feasibility of satellite EB/CV-QKD/FSO systems. Closed-form expressions for key system performance metrics are derived using improved channel modeling. Numerical results are presented to showcase the effects of channel impairments on the system performance. We also provide recommendations for optimal system setup parameters, aiming to enhance performance.

TI Metro-scale QKD using multimode fiber
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We report a proof-of-principle realization of a decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol with phase encoding over a record-breaking 17 km of multimode fiber (MMF) at a rate of 193 kbits/s, as well as over 1 Mbit/s at a distance of 1 km. These results suggest that QKD can be deployed over MMF in metropolitan-scale telecommunication connections. Such MMF metropolitan networks are ubiquitous-thus, this advance could pave the way to wide scale metropolitan deployment. We also assess the advantages of adapting the OM3 channel using mode-matching photonic lanterns on the quantum bit error rate, signal gain, and key rate and compare different encoding techniques in light of MMF propagation effects. This work confirms the suitability of current QKD technology for use in existing MMF links, unlocking new opportunities for quantum applications using legacy fiber.

TI Gravitational Forces Between Nonclassical Mechanical Oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Interfacing quantum mechanics and gravity is one of the great open questions in natural science. Micromechanical oscillators have been suggested as a plausible platform to carry out these experiments. We present an experimental design aiming at these goals, inspired by Schmole et al. [Class. Quantum Grav. 33, 125031 (2016)]. Gold spheres weighing of the order of a milligram will be positioned on large silicon nitride membranes, which are spaced at submillimeter distances from each other. These massloaded membranes are mechanical oscillators that vibrate at about 2 kHz frequencies in a drum mode. They are operated and measured by coupling to microwave cavities. First, we show that it is possible to measure the gravitational force between the oscillators at deep cryogenic temperatures, where thermal mechanical noise is strongly suppressed. We investigate the measurement of gravity when the positions of the gravitating masses exhibit significant quantum fluctuations, including preparation of the massive oscillators in the ground state, or in a squeezed state. We also present a plausible scheme to realize an experiment where the two oscillators are prepared in a two-mode squeezed motional quantum state that exhibits nonlocal quantum correlations and gravity at the same time. Although the gravity is classical, the experiment will pave the way for testing true quantum gravity in related experimental arrangements. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we operate a 1.7 mm diameter Si3N4 membrane loaded by a 1.3 mg gold sphere. At a temperature of 10 mK, we observe the drum mode with a quality factor above half a million at 1.7 kHz, showing strong promise for the experiments. Following implementation of vibration isolation, cryogenic positioning, and phase noise filtering, we foresee that realizing the experiments is in reach by combining known pieces of current technology.

TI Dispersive coupling between MoSe2 and an integrated
   zero-dimensional nanocavity
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Establishing a coherent interaction between a material resonance and an optical cavity is a necessary first step to study semiconductor quantum optics. Here we report on the signature of a coherent interaction between a two-dimensional excitonic transition in monolayer MoSe2 and a zero-dimensional, ultra-low mode volume (Vm similar to 2(lambda/n)3) on-chip photonic crystal nanocavity. This coherent interaction manifests as a dispersive shift of the cavity transmission spectrum, when the exciton-cavity detuning is decreased via temperature tuning. The exciton-cavity coupling is estimated to be approximate to 6.5 meV, with a cooperativity of approximate to 4.0 at 80 K, showing our material system is on the verge of strong coupling. The small mode-volume of the resonator is instrumental in reaching the strongly nonlinear regime, while on-chip cavities will help create a scalable quantum photonic platform.

TI Quantum direct communication protocol using recurrence in k-cycle
   quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The ability of quantum walks to evolve in a superposition of distinct quantum states has been used as a resource in quantum communication protocols. Under certain settings, the k-cycle discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) are known to recur to its initial state after every tr steps. We first present a scheme to optically realize any k-cycle DTQW using J-plate, orbital angular momentum (OAM) sorters, optical switch, and optical delay line. This entangles the polarization and OAM degrees of freedom (DoF) of a single photon. Making use of this recurrence phenomena of k-cycle DTQW and the entanglement generated during the evolution, we present an alternate quantum direct communication protocol. The recurrence and entanglement in the k-cycle walk are effectively used to retrieve and secure the information, respectively, in the proposed protocol. We investigate the security of the protocol against intercept and the resend attack. We also quantify the effect of amplitude damping and depolarizing noises on recurrence and mutual information between polarization and the OAM DoF of a single photon. Finally, we indicated an optimal attack strategy by which an Eavesdropper can tamper part of the message without revealing her presence. However, when the quantum communication channel is less noisy, any attempt by the Eavesdropper to tamper the message would end up in exposing her to the receiver.

TI Quantum Error Mitigation using Symmetry Expansion
SO QUANTUM
AB Even with the recent rapid developments in quantum hardware, noise remains the biggest challenge for the practical applications of any near-term quantum devices. Full quantum error correction cannot be implemented in these devices due to their limited scale. Therefore instead of relying on engineered code symmetry, symmetry verification was developed which uses the inherent symmetry within the physical problem we try to solve. In this article, we develop a general framework named symmetry expansion which provides a wide spectrum of symmetry-based error mitigation schemes beyond symmetry verification, enabling us to achieve different balances between the estimation bias and the sampling cost of the scheme. We show that certain symmetry expansion schemes can achieve a smaller estimation bias than symmetry verification through cancellation between the biases due to the detectable and undetectable noise components. A practical way to search for such a small-bias scheme is introduced. By numerically simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model for energy estimation, the small-bias symmetry expansion we found can achieve an estimation bias 6 to 9 times below what is achievable by symmetry verification when the average number of circuit errors is between 1 to 2. The corresponding sampling cost for random shot noise reduction is just 2 to 6 times higher than symmetry verification. Beyond symmetries inherent to the physical problem, our formalism is also applicable to engineered symmetries. For example, the recent scheme for exponential error suppression using multiple noisy copies of the quantum device is just a special case of symmetry expansion using the permutation symmetry among the copies.

TI Advanced fractional calculus, differential equations and neural
   networks: analysis, modeling and numerical computations
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Most physical systems in nature display inherently nonlinear and dynamical properties; hence, it would be difficult for nonlinear equations to be solved merely by analytical methods, which has given rise to the emerging of engrossing phenomena such as bifurcation and chaos. Conjointly, due to nonlinear systems' exhibiting more exotic behavior than harmonic distortion, it becomes compelling to test, classify and interpret the results in an accurate way. For this reason, avoiding preconceived ideas of the way the system is likely to respond is of pivotal importance since this facet would have effect on the type of testing run and processing techniques used in nonlinear systems. Paradigms of nonlinear science may suggest that it is 'the study of every single phenomenon' due to its interdisciplinary nature, which is another challenge encountered and needs to be addressed by generating and designing a systematic mathematical framework where the complexity of natural phenomena hints the requirement of identifying their commonalties and classifying their various manifestations in different nonlinear systems. Studying such common properties, concepts or paradigms can enable one to gain insight into nonlinear problems, their essence and consequences in a broad range of disciplines all forthwith. Fractional differential equations associated with non-local phenomena in physics have arisen as a powerful mathematical tool within a multidisciplinary research framework. Fractional differential equations, as one extension of the fractional calculus theory, can yield the evolution of various systems properly, which reinforces its position in mathematics and science while setting stage for the description of dynamic, complicated and nonlinear events. Through the reflection of the systems' actual properties, fractional calculus manifests unforeseeable and hidden variations, and thus, enables integration and differentiation, with the solutions to be approximated by numerical methods along with modeling and predicting the dynamics of multiphysics, multiscale and physical systems. Neural Networks (NNs), consisting of hidden layers with nonlinear functions that have vector inputs and outputs, are also considerably employed owing to their versatile and efficient characteristics in classification problems as well as their sophisticated neural network architectures, which make them capable of tackling complicated governing partial differential equation problems. Furthermore, partial differential equations are used to provide comprehensive and accurate models for many scientific phenomena owing to the advancements of data gathering and machine learning techniques which have raised opportunities for data-driven identification of governing equations derived from experimentally observed data. Given these considerations, while many problems are solvable and have been solved, efforts are still needed to be able to respond to the remaining open questions in the fields that have a broad range of spectrum ranging from mathematics, physics, biology, virology, epidemiology, chemistry, engineering, social sciences to applied sciences.
   With a view of different aspects of such questions, our special issue provides a collection of recent research focusing on the advances in the foundational theory, methodology and topical applications of fractals, fractional calculus, fractional differential equations, differential equations (PDEs, ODEs, to name some), delay differential equations (DDEs), chaos, bifurcation, stability, sensitivity, machine learning, quantum machine learning, and so forth in order to expound on advanced fractional calculus, differential equations and neural networks with detailed analyses, models, simulations, data-driven approaches as well as numerical computations.

TI Generation of polarization-entangled counter-propagating photons with
   high orbital angular momentum
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Spin and orbital angular momenta of light are attractive resources to harness for encoding, and manipulating information, with applications in various quantum photonic technologies. However, to fully harness that potential, we require robust sources of high-order angular momentum photons exhibiting nonclassical correlations. Here, we propose a fiber-based source of polarization-entangled photons in high-order orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. In our setup the pairs of photons are generated in a cylindrical fiber through a four-wave mixing process, which induces polarization, or spin entanglement. The photons are then converted to modes exhibiting large OAM by two helical gratings inscribed in the core of the fiber. We present a complete theoretical framework used to consistently describe this process, and demonstrate a robust control over the joint spectral amplitude of the generated photons.

TI Multi-Attack Detection: General Defense Strategy Based on Neural
   Networks for CV-QKD
SO PHOTONICS
AB The security of the continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system is subject to various attacks by hackers. The traditional detection method of parameter estimation requires professionals to judge known attacks individually, so the general detection model emerges to improve the universality of detection; however, current universal detection methods only consider the independent existence of attacks but ignore the possible coexistence of multiple attacks in reality. Here, we propose two multi-attack neural network detection models to handle the coexistence of multiple attacks. The models adopt two methods in multi-label learning: binary relevance (BR) and label power (LP) to deal with the coexistence of multiple attacks and can identify attacks in real-time by autonomously learning the features of known attacks in a deep neural network. Further, we improve the model to detect unknown attacks simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve high-precision detection for most known and unknown attacks without reducing the key rate and maximum transmission distance.

TI Photon-pair generation using inverse-designed thin-film lithium niobate
   mode converters
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has become a key method for generating entangled photon pairs. Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguides induce strong SPDC but require complex fabrication processes. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate efficient SPDC and second harmonic generation using modal phase matching methods. This is achieved with inverse-designed optical mode converters and low-loss optical waveguides in a single nanofabrication process. Inverse design methods provide enhanced functionalities and compact footprints for the converter. Despite the extensive achievements in inverse-designed photonic integrated circuits, the potential of inverse-designed TFLN quantum photonic devices has been seldom explored. The device shows an on-chip conversion efficiency of 3.95% W-1 cm(-2) in second harmonic generation measurements and a coincidence count rate up to 21.2 kHz in SPDC experiments. This work highlights the potential of the inverse-designed TFLN photonic devices and paves the way for their applications in on-chip nonlinear or quantum optics.

TI Photo-assisted spin transport in double quantum dots with spin-orbit
   interaction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS
AB We investigate the effect of spin-orbit interaction on the intra- and interdot particle dynamics of a double quantum dot (QD) under ac electric fields. The former is modeled as an effective ac magnetic field that produces electric-dipole spin resonance transitions, while the latter is introduced via spin-flip tunneling amplitudes. We observe the appearance of non-trivial spin-polarized dark states (DSs), arising from an ac-induced interference between photo-assisted spin-conserving and spin-flip tunneling processes. These DSs can be employed to precisely measure the spin-orbit coupling in QD systems. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between photo-assisted transitions and spin-flip tunneling enables the system to operate as a highly tunable spin filter. Finally, we investigate the operation of the system as a resonant flopping-mode qubit for arbitrary ac voltage amplitudes, allowing for high tunability and enhanced qubit control possibilities.

TI Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory for Chromium(IV)
   Molecular Qubits
SO JACS AU
AB Pseudotetrahedral organometallic complexes containing chromium(IV) and aryl ligands have been experimentally identified as promising molecular qubit candidates. Here we present a computational protocol based on multiconfiguration pair density functional theory for computing singlet-triplet gaps and zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters in Cr(IV) aryl complexes. We find that two multireference methods, multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) and hybrid multistate pair-density functional theory (HMS-PDFT), perform better than Kohn-Sham density functional theory for singlet- triplet gaps. Despite the very small values of the ZFS parameters, both multireference methods performed qualitatively well. MSCASPT2 and HMS-PDFT performed particularly well for predicting the trend in the ratio of the rhombic and axial ZFS parameters, |E/D|. We have also investigated the dependence and sensitivity of the calculated ZFS parameters on the active space and the molecular geometry. The methodologies outlined here can guide future prediction of ZFS parameters in molecular qubit candidates.

TI Constructing an entangled Unruh Otto engine and its efficiency
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Uniformly accelerated frame mimics a thermal bath whose temperature is proportional to the proper acceleration. Using this phenomenon we give a detailed construction of an Otto cycle between two energy eigenstates of a system, consists of two entangled qubits. In the isochoric stages the thermal bath is being provided via the vacuum fluctuations of the background field for a monopole interaction by accelerating them. We find that making of Otto cycle is possible when one qubit is accelerating in the right Rindler wedge and other one is moving in the left Rindler wedge; i.e. in anti-parallel motion, with the initial composite state is a non-maximally entangled one. However, the efficiency greater than that of the usual single qubit quantum Otto engine is not possible. We provide values of the available parameters which make Otto cycle possible. On the other hand, Otto cycle is not possible if one considers the non-maximally entangled state for parallel motion. Moreover, for both initial symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell states we do not find any possibility of the cycle for qubits' parallel and anti-parallel motion.

TI Weakly invasive metrology: quantum advantage and physical
   implementations
SO QUANTUM
AB We consider the estimation of a Hamiltonian parameter of a set of highly photosensitive samples, which are damaged after a few photons Nabs are absorbed, for a total time T. The samples are modelled as a two mode photonic system, where photons simultaneously acquire information on the unknown parameter and are absorbed at a fixed rate. We show that arbitrarily intense coherent states can obtain information at a rate that scales at most linearly with Nabs and T, whereas quantum states with finite intensity can overcome this bound. We characterise the quantum advantage as a function of Nabs and T, as well as its robustness to imperfections (non-ideal detectors, finite preparation and measurement rates for quantum photonic states). We discuss an implementation in cavity QED, where Fock states are both prepared and measured by coupling atomic ensembles to the cavities. We show that superradiance, arising due to a collective coupling between the cavities and the atoms, can be exploited for improving the speed and efficiency of the measurement.

Fog Computing is the extension of cloud with decentralized structure which stores the data in locations somewhere between the data source and cloud. The goal of fog computing is to provide high security, improve performance and network efficiency. We use quantum key distribution to produce and distribute key which change its quantum state and key, when key is known by mediator and it has ability to detect presence of mediator trying to gain lore of the key. In this paper, we introduced sugar-salt encryption which overcomes brute-force attack in effect delivers phony data in return to every incorrect guess of the password or key.

TI Optimization of ATP System Based on Quantum Secure Communication and Its
   Tracking Control Strategy
SO SHOCK AND VIBRATION
AB In quantum key distribution experiments, ground motion is usually used to simulate satellite-based motion. The posture fluctuation of the platform affects the normal operation of the acquisition, tracking, and pointing (abbreviated as ATP) system seriously. To achieve the verification of the ground motion platform, the ATP parameters of the ground simulation motion system cannot be designed only according to the satellite-based ATP parameters. To solve this problem, a set of initial pointing system and inertial stabilization system is added to the simulation ATP system. This provides a technical solution for the ground simulation ATP system similar to the satellite-based motion platform. In the meanwhile, a tracking control strategy based on the identification method is proposed by establishing identification symbols. Compared with traditional proportion, integral, and differential (abbreviated as PID) control, this method overcomes the shortcoming of tentative modification of the control parameters and improves the stability and adaptability of the tracking control process. Tracking accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees is achieved under heavy-load conditions. This guarantees the success of the quantum key distribution (QKD) verification test of the ground motion platform.

TI On-Chip Ultra-Compact Hexagonal Boron Nitride Topological Ring-Resonator
   in Visible Region
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Ultra-compact topological ring-resonators with chirality are important devices for quantum optics. However, there are limited demonstrations of chiral resonators, especially in the visible region. We proposed a topological photonic ring-resonator based on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) valley photonic crystal (VPC). The spin-valley locking effect in VPC allows achieving robust unidirectional transmission of edge states in the visible region (600 nm-650 nm). As a result, a high quality factor (Q factor) (679.3) with a free spectral range of 15 nm in the visible region can be achieved in a hBN all-pass notch filter (APNF) with a compact size (2.3 mu m*2.0 mu m). In addition, we investigated the transmission properties of hBN ring-resonators with different shapes and combinations, confirming the flexibility of designing topological ring-resonators based on this principle. This design can be readily integrated with quantum photonic chips for broad applications.

TI Compressive Single-Pixel Read-Out of Single-Photon Quantum Walks on a
   Polymer Photonic Chip
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Quantum photonic devices operating in the single photon regime require the detection and characterization of quantum states of light. Chip-scale, waveguide-based devices are a key enabling technology for increasing the scale and complexity of such systems. Collecting single photons from multiple outputs at the end-face of such a chip is a core task that is frequently non-trivial, especially when output ports are densely spaced. We demonstrate a novel, inexpensive method to efficiently image and route individual output modes of a polymer photonic chip, where single photons undergo a quantum walk. The method makes use of single-pixel imaging (SPI) with a digital micromirror device (DMD). By implementing a series of masks on the DMD and collecting the reflected signal into single-photon detectors, the spatial distribution of the single photons can be reconstructed with high accuracy. We also demonstrate the feasibility of optimization strategies based on compressive sensing.

TI Anomaly inflow for CSS and fractonic lattice models and dualities via
   cluster state measurement
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-WannierWegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.

TI Spatially patterned light amplification without inversion
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this paper a method is proposed for achieving spatially dependent amplification without inversion (AWI) by exposing a quantum emitter to two weak probe beams carrying orbital angular momentum. The emitter has a double-V level scheme consisting of four energy levels in two interlinked V subsystems and possesses a closely spaced doublet of upper energy levels. Depending on the initial state, the system exhibits spatially patterned AWI, optical transparency, and light amplification with population inversion, which are contingent on the presence of quantum interference in spontaneous emission from the doublet. In a scenario when the emitter is positioned in proximity to a plasmonic nanostructure, the degree of AWI can be controlled by adjusting the metasurface-emitter separation. This allows precise control over light-matter interactions at the nanoscale and can lead to advanced quantum photonic devices.

TI Deterministic Localization of Strain-Induced Single-Photon Emitters in
   Multilayer GaSe
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The nanoscale strain has emerged as a powerful tool forcontrollingsingle-photon emitters (SPEs) in atomically thin transition metaldichalcogenides (TMDCs). However, quantum emitters in monolayer TMDCsare typically unstable in ambient conditions. Multilayer TMDCs couldbe a solution, but they suffer from low quantum efficiency, resultingin low brightness of the SPEs. Here, we report the deterministic spatiallocalization of strain-induced SPEs in multilayer GaSe by nanopillararrays. The strain-controlled quantum confinement effect introduceswell-isolated sub-bandgap photoluminescence and corresponding suppressionof the broad band edge photoluminescence. Clear photon-antibunchingbehavior is observed from the quantum dot-like GaSe sub-bandgap excitonemission at 3.5 K. The strain-dependent confinement potential andthe brightness are found to be strongly correlated, suggesting a promisingroute for tuning and controlling SPEs. The comprehensive investigationsof strain-engineered GaSe SPEs provide a solid foundation for thedevelopment of 2D devices for quantum photonic technologies.

TI Brightening of Dark States in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots Caused by
   Light-Induced Magnetism
SO SMALL
AB Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have shown great potential for optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications. Although controversy remains about the electronic fine structures of bulk perovskites due to the strong spin-orbit coupling affecting the conduction bands, compelling evidence indicates that the ground states of perovskite QDs remain dark, limiting their applications in optoelectronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated that photoexcitation can induce large intrinsic magnetic fields in Mn-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs. Equivalent to applying an external magnetic field, the light-induced field causes giant Zeeman splitting to the bright triplet states and brightens the dark singlet ground state, thus effectively rendering a partially bright ground state in the doped QDs. These findings here may contribute to the understanding of the electronic fine structures in perovskite QDs and demonstrate a potential approach for creating semiconductor nanostructures that can serve as bright light sources.

TI Apparent heating due to imperfect calorimetric measurements
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Performing imperfect or noisy measurements on a quantum mechanical system both impacts the measurement outcome and the state of the system after the measurement. In this paper we are concerned with imperfect calorimetric measurements. In calorimetric measurements one typically measures the energy of a thermal environment to extract information about the system. In our setting the measurement is imperfect due to noise directly acting on the detector. Concretely, we consider an additional noise bath such that its energy is measured simultaneously with the calorimeter energy. Under weak coupling assumptions, we derive a hybrid master equation for the state of the system and the detected energy and find that the presence of the noise bath manifests itself by modifying the jump rates of the reduced system dynamics. We study an example of a driven qubit interacting with a resonant boson calorimeter and demonstrate that increasing the additional noise leads to an apparent reduction in the power flowing from qubit to calorimeter and thus to a seemingly detected heating up of the calorimeter.

TI All-electrical control of hole singlet-triplet spin qubits at
   low-leakage points
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the effect of the spin-orbit interaction on heavy holes confined in a double quantum dot in the presence of a magnetic field of arbitrary direction. Rich physics arise as the two hole states of different spin are not only coupled by the spin-orbit interaction but additionally by the effect of site-dependent anisotropic g tensors. It is demonstrated that these effects may counteract in such a way as to cancel the coupling at certain detunings and tilting angles of the magnetic field. This feature may be used in singlet-triplet qubits to avoid leakage errors and implement an electrical spin-orbit switch, suggesting the possibility of task-tailored two-axes control. Additionally, we investigate systems with a strong spin-orbit interaction at weak magnetic fields. By exact diagonalization of the dominant Hamiltonian we find that the magnetic field may be chosen such that the qubit ground state is mixed only within the logical subspace for realistic system parameters, hence reducing leakage errors and providing reliable control over the qubit.

TI Arbitrary bias control of LiNbO3 based Mach-Zehnder intensity
   modulators for QKD system
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can help distant agents to share unconditional secret keys, and the achievable secret key rate can be enhanced with the help of decoy-state protocol. To implement QKD experimentally, the agents are supposed to accurately transmit a number of different intensity pulses with the LiNbO3 based Mach-Zehnder (LNMZ) intensity modulator. However, the bias drift of LNMZ intensity modulator may affect the performance of a QKD system. In this letter, we reveal a simple RC circuit model to demonstrate the bias drift in the LNMZ intensity modulator. And based on the model, we propose a multi-step bias stable scheme to control the bias working point. Experimental result shows that our scheme can eliminate the bias drift of at arbitrary working point within a long time range. Besides, there is no need of any feedback mechanisms in the scheme. This means our scheme will not lead to any increasement in system complexity, making it more suitable for a QKD system.

AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) offers information-theoretic secure key sharing between two parties. The sharing of a phase reference frame is an essential requirement for coherent detection in CV-QKD. Due to the potential attacks related to transmitting the local oscillator (LO) alongside quantum signals, there has been a focus on using local LOs (LLOs) to establish a shared phase reference. In this work, we develop a new noise model of a current state-of-the-art LLO scheme in the context of the satellite-to-Earth channel. In doing this, we encapsulate detailed phase-screen calculations that determine the coherent efficiency - a critical parameter in free-space CV-QKD that characterizes the wavefront aberrations caused by atmospheric turbulence. Using our new noise model we then determine the CV-QKD key rates for the satellite-to-Earth channel, secure under general attacks in the finite-size regime of the LLO scheme. Our results are of practical importance for next-generation quantum-enabled satellites that utilize multi-photon technology as opposed to single-photon technology.

TI Non-Markovianity in the time evolution of open quantum systems assessed
   by means of quantum state distance
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We provide a quantitative evaluation of non-Markovianity (NM) for an XX chain of interacting qubits with one end coupled to a reservoir. The NM of several non-Markovian spectral densities is assessed in terms of various quantum state distance (QSD) measures. Our approach is based on the construction of the density matrix of the open chain, without the necessity of a master equation. For the quantification of NM we calculate the dynamics of the QSD measures between the Markovian-damped and various types of non-Markovian-damped cases. Since in the literature several QSD measures, appear in forms that imply trace preserving density matrices, we introduced appropriate modifications so as to render them applicable to the case of decaying traces. The results produce remarkable consistency between the various QSD measures. They also reveal a subtle and potentially useful interplay between qubit-qubit interaction and non-Markovian damping. Our calculations have also uncovered a surprisingly dramatic slowing-down of dissipation by the squared Lorentzian reservoir.

TI Generalized adiabatic approximation to the quantum Rabi model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum Rabi model (QRM) describes the interaction between a two-level system (qubit) and a quantum harmonic oscillator. In the limit where the qubit frequency is smaller than the harmonic frequency, the QRM can be well approximated by the adiabatic approximation (AA). The AA is widely used due to its simplicity and explicit physical interpretation. However, the level crossings in the spectrum of the QRM predicted by the AA are determined by the zeros of Laguerre polynomials, which deviate from the exact points. We propose an approximation to the QRM that predicts the level crossings correctly. This is done by exploiting a surprising connection between isolated exact solutions to the QRM and the Laguerre polynomials in the AA. We thus refer to this approach as the generalized adiabatic approximation (GAA). By construction, the GAA always predicts the exact exceptional spectrum and approximates the regular spectrum remarkably well in a much larger parameter regime than the AA. This generalized approach offers a framework to deal with the family of Rabi-type light-matter interaction models in a simple but accurate manner.

TI Second-Order Topological States in Non-Hermitian Square Photonic
   Crystals
SO PHOTONICS
AB Non-Hermitian photonic crystals offer a versatile platform for observing exotic phenomena, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and higher-order topological phases. In this work, we construct non-Hermitian photonic crystals by embedding balanced gain and loss into a magneto-optical photonic medium. Within the associated supercell, we demonstrate the emergence of second-order topological corner states whose degeneracies are selectively lifted by non-Hermitian effects, while others remain protected. Remarkably, the bulk states exhibit strong unidirectional localization toward a single corner, providing unambiguous evidence of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The coexistence of higher-order corner states and the NHSE within the same photonic platform reveals an intricate interplay between crystalline symmetry and non-Hermitian topology. Beyond its fundamental intrigue, our approach offers a versatile means of engineering and controlling the non-Hermitian skin effect in realistic photonic architectures, paving the way for applications in topological nanolasers, robust light localization, and quantum photonic emulators.

TI Two-dimensional natural hyperbolic materials: from polaritons modulation
   to applications
SO NANOSCALE
AB Natural hyperbolic materials (HMs) in two dimensions (2D) have an extraordinarily high anisotropy and a hyperbolic dispersion relation. Some of them can even sustain hyperbolic polaritons with great directional propagation and light compression to deeply sub-wavelength scales due to their inherent anisotropy. Herein, the anisotropic optical features of 2D natural HMs are reviewed. Four hyperbolic polaritons (i.e., phonon polaritons, plasmon polaritons, exciton polaritons, and shear polaritons) as well as their generation mechanism are discussed in detail. The natural merits of 2D HMs hold promise for practical quantum photonic applications such as valley quantum interference, mid-infrared polarizers, spontaneous emission enhancement, near-field thermal radiation, and a new generation of optoelectronic components, among others. The conclusion of these analyses outlines existing issues and potential interesting directions for 2D natural HMs. These findings could spur more interest in anisotropic 2D atomic crystals in the future, as well as the quick generation of natural HMs for new applications.

TI Nonlinear Imaging of Nanoscale Topological Corner States
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Topological states of light represent counter-intuitive optical modes localized at boundaries of finite-size optical structures that originate from the properties of the bulk. Being defined by bulk properties, such boundary states are insensitive to certain types of perturbations, thus naturally enhancing robustness of photonic circuitries. Conventionally, the N-dimensional bulk modes correspond to (N - 1)-dimensional boundary states. The higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence relates N-dimensional bulk to boundary states with dimensionality reduced by more than 1. A special interest lies in miniaturization of such higher-order topological states to the nanoscale. Here, we realize nanoscale topological corner states in metasurfaces with C-6-symmetric honeycomb lattices. We directly observe nanoscale topology-empowered edge and corner localizations of light and enhancement of light-matter interactions via a nonlinear imaging technique. Control of light at the nanoscale empowered by topology may facilitate miniaturization and on-chip integration of classical and quantum photonic devices.

TI Measurement-based long-range entangling gates in constant depth
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The depth of quantum circuits is a critical factor when running them on state-of-the-art quantum devices owing to their limited coherence times. Reducing circuit depth decreases noise in near-term quantum computations and reduces overall computation time. This also benefits fault-tolerant quantum computations. Here, we show how to reduce the depth of quantum subroutines that typically scale linearly with the number of qubits, such as quantum fan-out and long-range CNOT gates, to a constant depth using mid-circuit measurements and feedforward operations, while only requiring a 1D line topology. We compare our protocols with existing ones to highlight their advantages. Additionally, we verify the feasibility by implementing the measurement-based quantum fan-out gate and long-range CNOT gate on real quantum hardware, demonstrating significant improvements over their unitary implementations.

TI Noncommutative Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities
SO MATHEMATISCHE ANNALEN
AB Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities for Boolean cubes have been proven with dimension-free constants that grow subexponentially in the degree (Defant et al. in Math Ann 374(1):653-680, 2019). Such inequalities have found great applications in learning low-degree Boolean functions (Eskenazis and Ivanisvili in Proceedings of the 54th annual ACM SIGACT symposium on theory of computing, pp 203-207, 2022). Motivated by learning quantum observables, a qubit analogue of Bohnenblust-Hille inequality for Boolean cubes was recently conjectured in Rouze et al. (Quantum Talagrand, KKL and Friedgut's theorems and the learnability of quantum Boolean functions, 2022. arXiv preprint ). The conjecture was resolved in Huang et al. (Learning to predict arbitrary quantum processes, 2022. arXiv preprint ). In this paper, we give a new proof of these Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities for qubit system with constants that are dimension-free and of exponential growth in the degree. As a consequence, we obtain a junta theorem for low-degree polynomials. Using similar ideas, we also study learning problems of low degree quantum observables and Bohr's radius phenomenon on quantum Boolean cubes.

TI Highly integrated color center creation with cooled hydrogenated
   molecules irradiation
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Photoluminescent point defects, such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, have attracted much attention as solid-state qubits. In recent years, a method has been developed to dope ions one-by-one into a solid substrate with & Aring;ngstr & ouml;m position accuracy using a Paul trap. However, the dopant atoms must be laser-cooled, and the atoms that are promising dopants for solid-state quantum devices, such as nitrogen, cannot be directly applied. In the previous studies, the cooling of the dopant ions has been achieved using a sympathetic cooling technique, in which the laser-cooled atoms are sandwiched, but this method has several problems such as the need for a mechanism to remove the laser-cooled atoms and the inability to distinguish between the dopant atoms and contaminations. We show that these problems can be overcome by directly cooling the hydrogenated ions instead of sympathetically cooling the ions, and the position accuracy can be improved.

TI Nearly optimal time-independent reversal of a spin chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a time-independent Hamiltonian protocol for the reversal of qubit ordering in a chain of N spins. Our protocol has an easily implementable nearest-neighbor, transverse-field Ising model Hamiltonian with time -independent, nonuniform couplings. Under appropriate normalization, we implement this state reversal three times faster than a naive approach using SWAP gates, in time comparable to a protocol of Raussendorf [Phys. Rev. A 72, 052301 (2005)] that requires dynamical control. We also prove lower bounds on state reversal by using results on the entanglement capacity of Hamiltonians and show that we are within a factor 1.502(1 + 1/N) of the shortest time possible. Our lower bound holds for all nearest-neighbor qubit protocols with arbitrary finite ancilla spaces and local operations and classical communication. We give numerical evidence that the fast reversal protocols are more robust to noise than a SWAP-based reversal. Finally, we extend our protocol to an infinite family of nearest-neighbor, time-independent Hamiltonian protocols for state reversal. This includes chains with nearly uniform coupling that may be especially feasible for experimental implementation.

TI Pattern-based quantum text watermarking: Securing digital content with
   next-Gen quantum techniques
SO ISCIENCE
AB As pioneers of next-generation watermarking technologies, quantum methods offer advanced solutions securing digital text copyright. Quantum text representation is a prerequisite for realizing quantum watermarking. Thus we propose a generalized quantum text representation (GQTR) model for English text. can accurately represent and retrieve characters, words, and texts. Based on the proposed GQTR, multi-scale pattern-based quantum text watermarking (MPQTW) scheme is proposed, which embeds multi-scale images into quantum text simultaneously to protect digital text copyrights. To evaluate scheme, we design various metrics. The quantum circuits for GQTR and MPQTW are designed in detail. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the MPQTW scheme in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding rate. The results and analysis show that MPQTW has good performance.

TI Second Harmonic Generation from a Single Plasmonic Nanorod Strongly
   Coupled to a WSe2 Monolayer
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, coupled to metal plasmonic nanocavities, have recently emerged as new platforms for strong light-matter interactions. These systems are expected to have nonlinear-optical properties that will enable them to be used as entangled photon sources, compact wave-mixing devices, and other elements for classical and quantum photonic technologies. Here, we report the first experimental investigation of the nonlinear properties of these strongly coupled systems, by observing second harmonic generation from a WSe2 monolayer strongly coupled to a single gold nanorod. The pump-frequency dependence of the second-harmonic signal displays a pronounced splitting that can be explained by a coupled-oscillator model with second-order nonlinearities. Rigorous numerical simulations utilizing a nonperturbative nonlinear hydrodynamic model of conduction electrons support this interpretation and reproduce experimental results. Our study thus lays the groundwork for understanding the nonlinear properties of strongly coupled nanoscale systems.

TI Quantum Advantage in Information Retrieval
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Random access codes have provided many examples of quantum advantage in communication, but concern only one kind of information retrieval task. We introduce a related task-the Torpedo Game and show that it admits greater quantum advantage than the comparable random access code. Perfect quantum strategies involving prepare-and-measure protocols with experimentally accessible three-level systems emerge via analysis in terms of the discrete Wigner function. The example is leveraged to an operational advantage in a pacifist version of the strategy game Battleship. We pinpoint a characteristic of quantum systems that enables quantum advantage in any bounded-memory information retrieval task. While preparation contextuality has previously been linked to advantages in random access coding we focus here on a different characteristic called sequential contextuality. It is shown not only to be necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage, but also to quantify the degree of advantage. Our perfect qutrit strategy for the Torpedo Game entails the strongest type of inconsistency with noncontextual hidden variables, revealing logical paradoxes with respect to those assumptions.

TI Protocol designs for NOON states
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The ability to reliably prepare non-classical states will play a major role in the realization of quantum technology. NOON states, belonging to the class of Schrodinger cat states, have emerged as a leading candidate for several applications. Here we show how to generate NOON states in a model of dipolar bosons confined to a closed circuit of four sites. This is achieved by designing protocols to transform initial Fock states to NOON states through use of time evolution, application of an external field, and local projective measurements. The evolution time is independent of total particle number, offering an encouraging prospect for scalability. By variation of the external field strength, we demonstrate how the system can be controlled to encode a phase into a NOON state. We also discuss the physical feasibility, via ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical superlattice setup. Our proposal showcases the benefits of quantum integrable systems in the design of protocols.
   The ability to realize quantum systems for quantum technology relies on protocols capable of generating robust quantum states. The authors propose two protocols to generate arbitrary NOON states, one is deterministic, the other is probabilistic, and discuss their implementation in ultra-cold atom systems.
