TI Enhancing quantum state discrimination with indefinite causal order
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The standard quantum state discrimination problem can be understood as a communication scenario involving a sender and a receiver following these three steps: (i) the sender encodes information in pre-agreed quantum states, (ii) sends them over a noiseless channel, and (iii) the receiver decodes the information by performing appropriate measurements on the received states. In a practical setting, however, the channel is not only noisy but often also unknown, thus altering the states and making optimal decoding generally not possible. In this work, we study this noisy discrimination scenario using a protocol based on indefinite causal order. To this end, we consider the quantum switch and define its higher-order generalisations, which we call superswitches. We find that, for certain channels and ensembles, the guessing probability can be significantly improved compared to both single- and multiple-copy state discrimination.

TI Communication Complexity of Entanglement-Assisted Multi-Party
   Computation
SO ENTROPY
AB We consider a quantum and a classical version of a multi-party function computation problem with n players, where players 2,& mldr;,n need to communicate appropriate information to player 1 so that a "generalized" inner product function with an appropriate promise can be calculated. In the quantum version of the protocol, the players have access to entangled qudits but the communication is still classical. The communication complexity of a given protocol is the total number of classical bits that need to be communicated. When n is prime, and for our chosen function, we exhibit a quantum protocol (with complexity (n-1)(logn) bits) and a classical protocol (with complexity ((n-1)2(logn2) bits)). Furthermore, we present an integer linear programming formulation for determining a lower bound on the classical communication complexity. This demonstrates that our quantum protocol is strictly better than classical protocols.

TI A Poisson-Gaussian Noise Limited Quantum Iterative Multi-User System
   With Non-Ideal Photon-Counting Receiver
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Coherent state quantum communication is attracting extensive attention for its great value in terrestrial and satellite information networks. This paper proposes a new non-orthogonal quantum multi-user (MU) iterative detection scheme. At the receiving end, we develop a composite quantum receiver with multi-stage measurement instrument and soft iterative MU detector. Furthermore, based on a three-dimensional factor graph, a nonlinear Poisson-Gaussian noise limited coherent state iterative MU parallel interference cancellation (PIC) algorithm is derived. Our results demonstrate that this system can well support MU communication and achieve good performance. Quantitatively, for the 8 users scenario, the BER of 10(-6) can be obtained when the photon number is 19. Further numerical results show that the system we designed exhibits superior robustness against imperfections (e.g., quantum mode mismatch and quantum thermal noise).

TI Mutual information bounded by Fisher information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for the Bayesian quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to other inequalities in the literature (e.g., the van Trees inequality) that are useful also for cases where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We then generalize them to the quantum case, where they bound the Holevo information in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to adapt to mutual information (useful for global strategies where the prior plays an important role), the known and highly nontrivial bounds for the Fisher information in the presence of noise. The results are also useful in the context of quantum communication, both for continuous and discrete alphabets.

TI Silicon core fibers: A new platform for quantum light generation
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Integrated quantum sources are proving to be the most effective technology of sources for scalable quantum applications. A platform that satisfies all the requirements has not prevailed yet. In this framework, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of a photon pair source in a silicon core fiber. The fiber, only 58 mm long, works at room temperature and shows an intrinsic brightness of 570 kHz/nm/mW(2) and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 133 +/- 2 at around 1.55 mu m wavelength. The low propagation losses of the platform, similar to 0.3 dB/cm in our source, pave the way for effective fiber-based quantum sources in the telecom band. A comparison with state-of-the-art further confirms the potential of this platform for future applications, especially in the field of quantum communication.

TI Characterizing mixed-state entanglement through single-photon
   interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement verification and measurement is essential for experimental tests of quantum mechanics and also for quantum communication and information science. Standard methods of verifying entanglement in a bipartite mixed state require detection of both particles and involve coincidence measurement. We present a method that enables us to verify and measure entanglement in a two-photon mixed state without detecting one of the photons, i.e., without performing any coincidence measurement or postselection. We consider two identical sources, each of which can generate the same two-photon mixed state but they never emit simultaneously. We show that one can produce a set of single-photon interference patterns, which contain information about entanglement in the two-photon mixed state. We prove that it is possible to retrieve the information about entanglement from the visibility of the interference patterns. Our method reveals a distinct avenue for verifying and measuring entanglement in mixed states.

TI Multifunctional Superconducting Nanowire Quantum Sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) offer high-quantum-efficiency and lowdark-count-rate single-photon detection. In a growing number of cases, large magnetic fields are being incorporated into quantum microscopes, nanophotonic devices, and sensors for nuclear and high-energy physics that rely on SNSPDs, but superconducting devices generally perform poorly in large magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate robust performance of amorphous SNSPDs in magnetic fields of up to +/- 6 T with a negligible dark-count rate and unchanged quantum efficiency at typical bias currents. Critically, we also show that the SNSPD can be used as a magnetometer with a sensitivity of better than 100 mu T/root Hz and as a thermometer with a sensitivity of 20 mu K/root Hz at 1 K. Thus, a single-photon detector integrated into a quantum device can be used as a multifunctional quantum sensor capable of describing the temperature and magnetic field on chip simply by varying the bias current to change the operating modality from single-photon detection to thermometry or magnetometry.

TI Authentication of continuous-variable quantum messages
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We introduce the first quantum authentication scheme for continuous-variable (CV) states. Our scheme is based on trap states, and is an adaptation of a discrete-variable scheme by Broadbent et al. [15], but with more freedom in choosing the number of traps.The CV traps are squeezed states.As the CV variant of quantum one-time pad (QOTP) encryption we introduce gaussian-distributed displacements.We provide a security proof, mostly following the approach of Broadbent and Wainewright [13]. We take into account the inevitable imperfections due to the finite squeezing and the finite width of the gaussian QOTP distribution.As a necessary ingredient for the proof we derive the CV analogue of the Pauli Twirl. Since CV quantum systems fit well with existing optical communication infrastructure, they provide a promising platform for implementing quantum-cryptographic schemes and distributed quantum-computational tasks. This work expands the toolbox for securing CV quantum communication.

TI Composite vortex air laser
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Structured air laser generated through establishing high-gain air media in a cavity-free scheme by intense ultrashort pulses is promising for optical manipulation and quantum communication at standoff distances. However, the mechanism how the orbital angular momentum (OAM) information can be entangled into strong-field-induced gain media is still controversial, making manipulation of the topological charges of structured air laser remain a challenge. Here, we report the realization of a composite vortex N2+ air laser with controllable OAM by manipulating the relative positions, polarization directions, and intensity ratio between a Gaussian-shaped pump and an external vortex seed. Numerical simulations reveal the essential role of the interference between self-seeded Gaussian-shaped and externally-seeded vortex lasing emissions in the topological charge transformation. Our findings not only shed light on the generation mechanism of vortex air lasers, but also open up avenues for quantum manipulation of structured light through strong-field laser ionization of molecules remotely.

TI Photon Number Coherence in Quantum Dot-Cavity Systems can be Enhanced by
   Phonons
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile source of single photons with tunable properties to be used in quantum-cryptographic applications. A crucial figure of merit of the emitted photons is photon number coherence (PNC), which impacts the security of many quantum communication protocols. In the process of single-photon generation, the quantum dot as a solid-state object is subject to an interaction with phonons, which can therefore indirectly affect the PNC. In this study, the origin of PNC in optically excited quantum dots and its interaction with phonons are elaborated upon. In contrast to the expectation that phonons always deteriorate coherence, PNC can be increased in a quantum dot-cavity system due to the electron-phonon interaction.

TI Compact detector for vector vortex beams by polarization holography
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Vector vortex beams (VVBs) have garnered significant attention for their potential to revolutionize applications such as high-resolution imaging and quantum communication. The development of an easy-to-use and effective method for representing the spatially inhomogeneous polarization distribution of VVBs is imperative. In this paper, we propose what we believe to be a novel compact detector for quickly and accurately measuring the polarization distribution of arbitrary VVBs by means of polarization holography. When a VVB illuminates the detector, multiple diffracting beams appear simultaneously that can be used to get the VVB's polarization distribution. Incidentally, it can also measure the state of polarization of a scalar beam, which can be considered a special case of spatially inhomogeneous polarization. Experimental results confirm the detector's measurement accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for advanced optical applications.

TI Fourth-order moment of the light field in the atmosphere for moderate
   and strong turbulence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The collisionless Boltzmann equation is used to describe the intensity correlations in partially saturated and fully saturated regimes in terms of photon distribution function in the phase space. Explicit expression for fourth moment of the light fields is obtained for the case of moderate and strong turbulence. Such expression consists of two terms accounting for two regions in the phase space that independently contribute to the correlation function. It is shown that the present solution agrees with previous results for the fully saturated regime. Additionally it embodies the effect of partially saturated radiation where the correlations of photon trajectories are important and the magnitude of the scintillation index is well above the unity. The fourth moment is used to study the fluctuations of transmittance, which consider the effect of finite detector aperture.

TI Inverse binary optimization of convolutional neural network in active
   learning efficiently designs nanophotonic structures
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Binary optimization using active learning schemes has gained attention for automating the discovery of optimal designs in nanophotonic structures and material configurations. Recently, active learning has utilized factorization machines (FM), which usually are second-order models, as surrogates to approximate the hypervolume of the design space, benefiting from rapid optimization by Ising machines such as quantum annealing (QA). However, due to their second-order nature, FM-based surrogate functions struggle to fully capture the complexity of the hypervolume. In this paper, we introduce an inverse binary optimization (IBO) scheme that optimizes a surrogate function based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) within an active learning framework. The IBO method employs backward error propagation to optimize the input binary vector, minimizing the output value while maintaining fixed parameters in the pre-trained CNN layers. We conduct a benchmarking study of the CNN-based surrogate function within the CNN-IBO framework by optimizing nanophotonic designs (e.g., planar multilayer and stratified grating structure) as a testbed. Our results demonstrate that CNN-IBO achieves optimal designs with fewer actively accumulated training data than FM-QA, indicating its potential as a powerful and efficient method for binary optimization.

AB With the rapid development of IoT technology, securely querying sensitive data collected by devices within a specific range has become a focal concern for users. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving range query scheme based on quantum encryption, along with circuit simulations and performance analysis. We first propose a quantum private set similarity comparison protocol and then construct a privacy-preserving range query scheme for IoT environments. By leveraging the properties of quantum homomorphic encryption, the proposed scheme enables encrypted data comparisons, effectively preventing the leakage of sensitive data. The correctness and security analysis demonstrates that the designed protocol guarantees users receive the correct query results while resisting both external and internal attacks. Moreover, the protocol requires only simple quantum states and operations, and does not require users to bear the cost of complex quantum resources, making it feasible under current technological conditions.

TI Nanoscale Vector AC Magnetometry with a Single Nitrogen-Vacancy Center
   in Diamond
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Detection of AC magnetic fields at the nanoscale is critical in applications ranging from fundamental physics to materials science. Isolated quantum spin defects, such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, can achieve the desired spatial resolution with high sensitivity. Still, vector AC magnetometry currently relies on using different orientations of an ensemble of sensors, with degraded spatial resolution, and a protocol based on a single NV is lacking. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol that exploits a single NV to reconstruct the vectorial components of an AC magnetic field by tuning a continuous driving to distinct resonance conditions. We map the spatial distribution of an AC field generated by a copper wire on the surface of the diamond. The proposed protocol combines high sensitivity, broad dynamic range, and sensitivity to both coherent and stochastic signals, with broad applications in condensed matter physics, such as probing spin fluctuations.

TI Determination of optimal chain coupling made by embedding in D-wave
   quantum annealer
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The qubits in a D-wave quantum annealer (D-wave QA) are designed on a Pegasus graph that is different from the structure of a combinatorial optimization problem. This situation requires embedding with the chains connected by ferromagnetic coupling Jc between the qubits. Weak and strong Jc values induce chain breaking and enforcement of chain energy, which reduce the accuracy of quantum annealing (QA) measurements, respectively. In addition, we confirmed that even though the D-wave Ocean package provides a default coupling J(c)(default), it is not an optimal coupling J(c)(optimal) that maximizes the possible correct rate of QA measurements. In this paper, we present an algorithm how J(c)(optimal) with the maximum probability p for observing the possible lowest energy is determined. Finally, we confirm that the extracted J(c)(optimal) shows much better p than J(c)(default) in QA measurements of various parameters of frustrated and fully connected combinatorial optimization problems.

AB Gravitational redshift is discussed in the context of quantum photons propagating in curved spacetime. A brief introduction to modelling realistic photons is first presented and the effect of gravity on the spectrum computed for photons largely confined along the direction of propagation. It is then shown that redshift-induced transformations on photon operators with sharp momenta are not unitary, while a unitary transformation can be constructed for realistic photons with finite bandwidth. The unitary transformation obtained is then characterized as a multimode mixing operation, which is a generalized rotation of the Hilbert-space basis. Finally, applications of these results are discussed with focus on performance of quantum communication protocols, exploitation of the effects for quantum metrology and sensing, as well as potential for tests of fundamental science.

TI Projected entangled pair states with flexible geometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are a class of quantum many-body states that generalize matrix product states for one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions. In recent years, PEPS have advanced understanding of strongly correlated systems, especially in two dimensions, e.g., quantum spin liquids. Typically described by tensor networks on regular lattices (e.g., square, cubic), PEPS have also been adapted for irregular graphs; however, the computational cost becomes prohibitive for dense graphs with large vertex degrees. In this paper, we present a PEPS algorithm to simulate low-energy states and dynamics defined on arbitrary, fluctuating, and densely connected graphs. We introduce a cut-off, kappa is an element of N, to constrain the vertex degree of the PEPS to a set but tunable value, which is enforced in the optimization by applying a simple edge-deletion rule, allowing the geometry of the PEPS to change and adapt dynamically to the system's correlation structure. We benchmark our flexible PEPS algorithm with simulations of classical spin glasses and quantum annealing on densely connected graphs with hundreds of spins, and also study the impact of tuning kappa when simulating a uniform quantum spin model on a regular (square) lattice. Our paper opens the way to apply tensor network algorithms to arbitrary, even fluctuating, background geometries.

TI Adaptive hyperparameter updating for training restricted Boltzmann
   machines on quantum annealers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been proposed for developing neural networks for a variety of unsupervised machine learning applications such as image recognition, drug discovery, and materials design. The Boltzmann probability distribution is used as a model to identify network parameters by optimizing the likelihood of predicting an output given hidden states trained on available data. Training such networks often requires sampling over a large probability space that must be approximated during gradient based optimization. Quantum annealing has been proposed as a means to search this space more efficiently which has been experimentally investigated on D-Wave hardware. D-Wave implementation requires selection of an effective inverse temperature or hyperparameter (beta) within the Boltzmann distribution which can strongly influence optimization. Here, we show how this parameter can be estimated as a hyperparameter applied to D-Wave hardware during neural network training by maximizing the likelihood or minimizing the Shannon entropy. We find both methods improve training RBMs based upon D-Wave hardware experimental validation on an image recognition problem. Neural network image reconstruction errors are evaluated using Bayesian uncertainty analysis which illustrate more than an order magnitude lower image reconstruction error using the maximum likelihood over manually optimizing the hyperparameter. The maximum likelihood method is also shown to out-perform minimizing the Shannon entropy for image reconstruction.

TI Quantum Limits on the Capacity of Multispan Links With Phase-Sensitive
   Amplification
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Long-distance fiber communication stands as a cornerstone of modern technology. One of the underlying principles, preventing signal levels from diminishing below the detectability threshold, is optical amplification. In particular, phase-sensitive amplifiers offer a promising solution as ideally they do not introduce any excess additive noise. Since such devices in principle operate at the quantum noise level, a natural question is whether one can further improve the capacity of amplified links using principles of quantum mechanics as it offers a much broader scope of signal modulations and detection schemes. We derive ultimate limits determined by the laws of quantum mechanics on the capacity of multispan links with phase sensitive amplification. We show that the quantum advantage over the standard approach based on optical quadrature detection is small and vanishes for long links.

TI When Is a Genuine Multipartite Entanglement Measure Monogamous?
SO ENTROPY
AB A crucial issue in quantum communication tasks is characterizing how quantum resources can be quantified and distributed over many parties. Consequently, entanglement has been explored extensively. However, there are few genuine multipartite entanglement measures and whether it is monogamous is so far unknown. In this work, we explore the complete monogamy of genuine multipartite entanglement measure (GMEM) for which, at first, we investigate a framework for unified/complete GMEM according to the unified/complete multipartite entanglement measure we proposed in 2020. We find a way of inducing unified/complete GMEM from any given unified/complete multipartite entanglement measure. It is shown that any unified GMEM is completely monogamous, and any complete GMEM that is induced by given complete multipartite entanglement measure is completely monogamous. In addition, the previous GMEMs are checked under this framework. It turns out that the genuinely multipartite concurrence is not as good of a candidate as GMEM.

TI Feasibility study of frequency-encoded photonic qubits over a free-space
   channel
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Frequency-bin quantum encoding shows great promise for quantum communication, given its high-dimensional scaling, compatibility with photonic integrated circuits, and synergy with classical optical communication technology. However, to date, all demonstrations have been performed over single-spatial mode and static channels, while the transmission over fluctuating and turbulent channels has not been addressed. We propose and demonstrate a novel approach that leverages field-widened interferometers to decode frequency-bins transmitted over free-space channels without any adaptive optics or modal filtering. Moreover, we investigate the phase stability requirements so that frequency-bin encoding could be feasible for satellite-to-ground quantum links. Our passive approach expands the versatility of frequency-bin encoding, paving the way towards long-range and fluctuating channels.

TI Inter-generational comparison of quantum annealers in solving hard
   scheduling problems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We compare the performance of four quantum annealers, theD-Wave Two, 2X, 2000Q, and Advantage in solving an identical ensemble of a parametrized family of scheduling problems. These problems are NP-complete and, in fact, equivalent to vertex coloring problems. They are also practically motivated and closely connected to planning problems from artificial intelligence. We examine factors contributing to the performance differences while separating the contributions from hardware upgrades, support for shorter anneal times, and possible optimization of ferromagnetic couplings. While shorter anneal times can improve the time to solution (TTS) at any given problem size, the scaling of TTS with respect to the problem sizeworsens for shorter anneal times. In contrast, optimizing the ferromagnetic coupling improves both the absolute TTS and the scaling. There is a statistically significant improvement in performance between D-Wave Two and 2X and from all older generation annealers to Advantage, even when operated under identical anneal time and ferromagnetic couplings. However, the performance improvement from 2X to 2000Q requires the anneal time and ferromagnetic couplings to be optimized. Overall, owing to these inter-generational hardware improvements and optimizations, the scaling exponent reduces from 1.01 +/- 0.01 on Two to 0.259 +/- 0.008 on Advantage.

TI Super-Resolution Parameter Estimation Using Machine Learning-Assisted
   Spatial Mode Demultiplexing
SO SENSORS
AB We present the use of a light-weight machine learning (ML) model to estimate the separation and relative brightness of two incoherent light sources below the diffraction limit. We use a multi-planar light converter (MPLC) to implement spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) imaging. The ML model is trained, validated, and tested on data generated experimentally in the laboratory. The ML model accurately estimates the separation of the sources to up to two orders of magnitude below the diffraction limit when the sources are of comparable brightness, and provides accurate sub-diffraction separation resolution even when the sources differ in brightness by four orders of magnitude. The present results are limited by cross talk in the MPLC and support the potential use of ML-assisted SPADE for astronomical imaging below the diffraction limit.

TI Photonic Ising Machine Using Parallel Bandit Architecture Based on Laser
   Chaos
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Photonic computing has emerged as a transformative technology for overcoming the fundamental limitations of semiconductor technology. Among recent advancements, the laser chaos decision maker has been introduced for ultrafast decision making by leveraging chaotic time series, primarily to solve the multi-armed bandit problem. In this study, we propose applying a laser chaos decision maker to a fully-connected Ising machine. Our method extends the applicability of the laser chaos decision maker, and achieves a first-ever Ising machine that obtains high-quality soloutions on the order of nanoseconds. Our approach addresses two critical challenges: the vast search space and the design of an algorithm to map the multi-armed bandit problem to Ising problems. To address these issues, we employ a parallel bandit architecture and design an algorithm to set the ground truth of decision-making repeatedly. We develop a GPU-based simulator that implements our proposed method and enables large-scale experimentation across a variety of benchmark problems and time-series datasets. We also analyze the effect of autocorrelation and the distribution of time series used by the laser chaos decision maker.

TI Flexible source of correlated photons based on LNOI rib waveguides
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) material has great potential for photonic integrated circuits, providing substantial versatility in design of various integrated components. To properly use these components in the implementation of different quantum protocols, photons with different properties are required. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate a flexible source of correlated photons built on the LNOI waveguide with a special geometry. This source is based on the parametric down-conversion (PDC) process, in which the signal and idler photons are generated at the telecom wavelength and have different spatial profiles and polarizations, but the same group velocities. Distinguishability in polarizations and spatial profiles facilitates the routing and manipulating individual photons, while the equality of their group velocities leads to the absence of temporal walk-off between photons. We show how the spectral properties of the generated photons and the number of their frequency modes can be controlled depending on the pump characteristics and the waveguide length. Finally, we discuss special regimes, in which narrowband light with strong frequency correlations and polarization-entangled Bell states are generated at the telecom wavelength.

TI Quantum dynamics and correlations of indistinguishable anyons in
   one-dimensional lattices
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Anyons, namely particles obeying fractional quantum statistics that interpolate between bosons and fermions, possess a lot of new and exotic physical properties related to the particle exchange statistics. In this work, we explore the few-body quantum dynamics and quantum correlations of indistinguishable anyons withon-site interactions in one-dimensional lattices within the scheme of three-body continuous-time quantum walks. By employing a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we numerically calculate the dynamicalevolution process of the local density distribution of anyons among the whole lattice. Numerical simulationsshown in the main text mainly focus on a three-body initial state as , in which threeparticles are located on neighbouring sites at lattice centre. This choice of initial state features that the threeparticles influence one another most strongly, while we have also implemented numerical simulations on otherchoices of three-body initial states as are discussed in appendix. It is shown that the local density distribution ofanyons is dramatically altered by fractional particle statistics with new dynamical structure showing up duringthe time evolution. For free anyons, an inner cone emerges as the statistical parameter increases, while the outercone remains robust all along. When the on-site interaction joins in, the structure of the inner cone is furthermodified with new features. Specifically, for interaction of finite strength, an exotic dynamical asymmetry inreal space, is clearly demonstrated during the time evolution of the local density distribution for particles withinthe fractional statistics regime. However, for boson limit and pseudofermion limit, the time evolution of thelocal density distribution keeps symmetric as the three-body initial state. And remarkably, the dynamicalasymmetry is interaction-dependent manifested as the local density distribution of anyons favors opposite sideof the lattice for repulsive and attractive interaction, respectively. Moreover, when the on-site interaction isfurther increased to hard-core limit, the dynamical asymmetry will then be largely suppressed. We also calculatethe density-density correlations for anyons before they reach the lattice boundary to reveal the interesting effectof fractional statistics on quantum correlations. It is shown that the inner cone corresponds to co-walking ofanyons, while the outer cone is related to individual walking and is immune to the variation of statisticalparameter. Furthermore, the exotic real-space asymmetry originated from the interplay of fractional statistics and finite interaction is also shown up in the density-density correlations.

TI Extensive antibody search with whole spectrum black-box optimization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In designing functional biological sequences with machine learning, the activity predictor tends to be inaccurate due to shortage of data. Top ranked sequences are thus unlikely to contain effective ones. This paper proposes to take prediction stability into account to provide domain experts with a reasonable list of sequences to choose from. In our approach, multiple prediction models are trained by subsampling the training set and the multi-objective optimization problem, where one objective is the average activity and the other is the standard deviation, is solved. The Pareto front represents a list of sequences with the whole spectrum of activity and stability. Using this method, we designed VHH (Variable domain of Heavy chain of Heavy chain) antibodies based on the dataset obtained from deep mutational screening. To solve multi-objective optimization, we employed our sequence design software MOQA that uses quantum annealing. By applying several selection criteria to 19,778 designed sequences, five sequences were selected for wet-lab validation. One sequence, 16 mutations away from the closest training sequence, was successfully expressed and found to possess desired binding specificity. Our whole spectrum approach provides a balanced way of dealing with the prediction uncertainty, and can possibly be applied to extensive search of functional sequences.

TI Noise rejection through an improved quantum illumination protocol
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum illumination protocols can be implemented to improve imaging performance in the low photon flux regime even in the presence of both background light and sensor noise. However, the extent to which this noise can be rejected is limited by the rate of accidental correlations resulting from the detection of photon or noise events that are not quantum-correlated. Here we present an improved protocol that rejects up to >= 99.9% of background light and sensor noise in the low photon flux regime, improving upon our previous results by an order of magnitude. This improvement, which requires no information regarding the scene or noise statistics, will enable extremely low light quantum imaging techniques to be applied in environments previously thought difficult and be an important addition to the development of covert imaging, quantum microscopes, and quantum LIDAR.

TI Multiphoton correlations between quantum images
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Experimental demonstrations of entangled quantum images produced through parametric down conversion have so far been confined to studying two-photon correlations. Here we show that multiphoton correlations between quantum images are accessible experimentally and exhibit many new features including being sensitive to the phase of the biphoton wave function. As a concrete example, we consider a modification of existing quantum imaging experiments in which the charge-coupled device cameras are moved out of focus, provide detailed analytical predictions for the resulting four-photon interferences, and support these by numerical simulations. The proposed experiment can also be interpreted as entanglement swapping: Bob's photons are initially unentangled, but the joint detection of Alice's photons projects Bob's photons onto an entangled state. The general approach proposed here can be extended to other quantum optics experiments involving high-dimensional entanglement.

TI Enhanced triplet superconductivity in next-generation ultraclean
   UTe2
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The unconventional superconductor UTe2 exhibits numerous signatures of spin-triplet superconductivity-a rare state of matter which could enable quantum computation protected against decoherence. UTe2 possesses a complex phase landscape comprising two magnetic field-induced superconducting phases, a metamagnetic transition to a field-polarized state, along with pair- and charge-density wave orders. However, contradictory reports between studies performed on UTe2 specimens of varying quality have severely impeded theoretical efforts to understand the microscopic origins of the exotic superconductivity. Here, we report a comprehensive suite of high magnetic field measurements on a generation of pristine quality UTe2 crystals. Our experiments reveal a significantly revised high magnetic field superconducting phase diagram in the ultraclean limit, showing a pronounced sensitivity of field-induced superconductivity to the presence of crystalline disorder. We employ a Ginzburg-Landau model that excellently captures this acute dependence on sample quality. Our results suggest that in close proximity to a field-induced metamagnetic transition the enhanced role of magnetic fluctuations-that are strongly suppressed by disorder-is likely responsible for tuning UTe2 between two distinct spin-triplet superconducting phases.

TI Multi-Adaptive Strategies-Based Higher-Order Quantum Genetic Algorithm
   for Agile Remote Sensing Satellite Scheduling Problem
SO SENSORS
AB The agile remote sensing satellite scheduling problem (ARSSSP) for large-scale tasks needs to simultaneously address the difficulties of complex constraints and a huge solution space. Taking inspiration from the quantum genetic algorithm (QGA), a multi-adaptive strategies-based higher-order quantum genetic algorithm (MAS-HOQGA) is proposed for solving the agile remote sensing satellites scheduling problem in this paper. In order to adapt to the requirements of engineering applications, this study combines the total task number and the total task priority as the optimization goal of the scheduling scheme. Firstly, we comprehensively considered the time-dependent characteristics of agile remote sensing satellites, attitude maneuverability, energy balance, and data storage constraints and established a satellite scheduling model that integrates multiple constraints. Then, quantum register operators, adaptive evolution operations, and adaptive mutation transfer operations were introduced to ensure global optimization while reducing time consumption. Finally, this paper demonstrated, through computational experiments, that the MAS-HOQGA exhibits high computational efficiency and excellent global optimization ability in the scheduling process of agile remote sensing satellites for large-scale tasks, while effectively avoiding the problem that the traditional QGA has, namely low solution efficiency and the tendency to easily fall into local optima. This method can be considered for application to the engineering practice of agile remote sensing satellite scheduling for large-scale tasks.

TI Geometric property of off resonance error robust composite pulse
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The precision of quantum operations is affected by unavoidable systematic errors. A composite pulse (CP), which has been well investigated in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), is a technique that suppresses the influence of systematic errors by replacing a single operation with a sequence of operations. In one-qubit operations, there are two typical systematic errors, Pulse Length Error (PLE) and Off Resonance Error (ORE). Recently, it was found that PLE robust CPs have a clear geometric property. In this study, we show that ORE robust CPs also have a simple geometric property, which is associated with trajectories on the Bloch sphere of the corresponding operations. We discuss the geometric property of ORE robust CPs using two examples.

TI Position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing for quantum adaptive
   imaging
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counterintuitive phenomena, while a biphoton spatial aberration generally degrades its performance. Biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, a new method named position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing is introduced, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the back focal plane of a microlens array. Experimentally, biphoton phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film are demonstrated. This single-shot method is a more direct and efficient approach toward quantum adaptive optics, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy, remote imaging, and communication.

TI Orientation-dependent Rashba spin-orbit coupling of two-dimensional hole
   gases in semiconductor quantum wells: Linear or cubic
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) described by odd powers of k terms in semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) plays a critical role in spintronics and quantum computing. It was believed that the Rashba SOC in two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) is a k-cubic term as the lowest order, in sharp contrast to its electron counterpart in which the leading term is a k-linear term. Our recent work [Phys. Rev. 13 103, 085309 (2021)] uncovered the emergence of k-linear Rashba SOC in 2DHGs arising from their direct dipolar coupling to the external electric field in the presence of heavy-hole-light-hole (HH-LH) mixing. Here, we explore the upper and lower bounds of this k-linear Rashba SOC for 2DHGs in Ge/Si QWs by varying the growth orientations. By performing atomistic pseudopotential method calculations associated with symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that the upper bound of the k-linear Rashba SOC of 2DHGs is in the [110]-oriented QWs, and the lower bound is the vanishment of the k-linear Rashba term, giving rise to purely k-cubic Rashba SOC, in the [111]-oriented QWs with an even number of the well monolayers (MLs). The varying of the well MLs from even to odd can also change the symmetry of QWs and thus produce different types of SOC. In the odd-ML [001]-oriented QWs, we observe a strong Dresselhaus SOC, which is, however, absent leaving behind the k-linear Rashba SOC alone in the even-ML [001]-oriented QWs. We further illustrate that the k-linear Rashba SOC in [001]-oriented QWs and odd-ML [111]-oriented QWs completely arises from the local interface induced HH-LH mixing, whereas in other orientations it is dominated by the QW global symmetry allowed intrinsic HH-LH mixing, which is due to the orientation-dependent breaking of the axial symmetry but is irrelevant to the local interface. We prove that the strongest intrinsic HH-LH mixing appears in the [110] orientation by doing the transformation of the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian, explaining why the upper bound of the k-linear Rashba SOC occurred in the [110]-oriented QWs. Subsequently, we illustrate clearly the strong correlation between the HH-LH mixing and the k-linear Rashba SOC. The k-linear Rashba SOC occurring in odd-ML [001]-oriented QWs but purely k-cubic Rashba SOC in even-ML [111]-oriented QWs provides direct evidence for the hypothesis that the HH-LH mixing observed in [001]-oriented, e.g. GaAs/AlAs, QWs arises from the local interface symmetry C-2v despite it is the nominal prohibition by the QW global symmetry D-2d, considering the HH-LH mixing is forbidden by the global symmetry of both QWs and is allowed by the former rather than the latter local interfaces. Our findings clarify the physical mechanism underlying the orientation dependence of the Rashba SOC and provide design rules to realize k-linear or purely k-cubic Rashba SOC in 2D hole systems.

TI Effective temperature in approximate quantum many-body states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the pursuit of numerically identifying ground states of quantum many-body systems, approximate quantum wave function ansatzes are commonly employed. This study focuses on the spectral decomposition of these approximate quantum many-body states into exact eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian, which reflects the intricate physics at the interplay between quantum systems and numerical algorithms. Here, we examine various parametrized approximate quantum states constructed from neural networks, tensor networks, and quantum circuits, employing differentiable programming to numerically approximate ground states and imaginary-time evolved states. Our findings reveal a consistent exponential pattern in the energy eigenbasis decomposition contributions of approximate states across different ansatzes, optimization objectives, and quantum systems, characterized by remarkably small decay rates, i.e., high effective temperatures. This finding is counterintuitive for high-fidelity approximate ground states: While the total contribution from excited states can be made sufficiently small, the residual spectral weight does not decay rapidly with energy. This behavior is an intrinsic property of the variational ansatz, independent of the approximation's overall accuracy. The effective temperature is related to ansatz expressiveness and accuracy and shows phase transition behaviors in learning imaginary-time evolved states. The universal picture and unique features suggest the significance and potential of the effective temperature metric in characterizing approximate quantum states.

TI Waveguide quantum electrodynamics at the onset of spin-spin correlations
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Waveguide quantum electrodynamics studies interactions of matter with photons traveling via a transmission guide and how these can be exploited to control quantum emitters and to establish quantum correlations between them. Here, we explore the competition between such light-mediated interactions with intrinsic matter-matter interactions. For this, we couple a superconducting line to a magnetic material made of organic free radical molecules. We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls spin correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region (T > 0.7 K), the microwave transmission evidences a collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As T decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission also reflects a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single-spin flips to bosonic magnons.

TI Mpemba effects in nonequilibrium open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Mpemba effect was originally referred to as the faster icing of a higher-temperature system than a lower-temperature system, and was later generalized to anomalous decays of both classical and quantum observables to equilibrium states. Mpemba effect is mostly considered in classical systems and during cooling processes toward equilibrium states. We investigate the emergence of the effect in nonequilibrium quantum systems where the system has no asymptotic equilibrium state to approach. Instead, the system is put in contact with two different baths, and only a nonequilibrium state exists, sustained by constant energy injection from the surrounding thermal baths. First, we show that the nonequilibrium conditions can dramatically enlarge the parameter regimes where the MPE emerges. Second, we demonstrate that the anomalous MPEs and inverse MPEs emerge in the evolution of quantum correlations in the two-site fermionic system and that nonequilibrium conditions can expedite or delay the MPEs. Third, we show that the nonequilibrium-induced quantum coherence can have considerable contributions to the emergence of the MPE which the conventional Lindbladian dynamics fails to capture.

TI Witnessing Nonclassicality in a Causal Structure with Three Observable
   Variables
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Seen from the modern lens of causal inference, Bell's theorem is nothing other than the proof that a specific classical causal model cannot explain quantum correlations. It is thus natural to move beyond Bell's paradigmatic scenario and consider different causal structures. For the specific case of three observ-able variables, it is known that there are three nontrivial causal networks. Two of those are known to give rise to quantum nonclassicality: the instrumental and the triangle scenarios. Here we analyze the third and remaining one, which we name the Evans scenario, akin to the causal structure underlying the entanglement-swapping experiment. We prove a number of results about this elusive scenario and introduce new and efficient computational tools for its analysis that can also be adapted to deal with more general causal structures. We do not solve its main open problem-whether quantum nonclassical correlations can arise from it-but give a significant step in this direction by proving that postquantum correlations, analogous to the paradigmatic Popescu-Rohrlich box, do violate the constraints imposed by a classical description of the Evans causal structure.

AB We report the development of an all-optical approach that excites the fundamental compression mode in a diamond Lamb wave resonator with an optical gradient force and detects the induced vibrations via strain coupling to a silicon vacancy center, specifically, via phonon sidebands in the optical excitation spectrum of the silicon vacancy. Sideband optical interferometry has also been used for the detection of in-plane mechanical vibrations, for which conventional optical interferometry is not effective. These experiments demonstrate a gigahertz fundamental compression mode with a Q factor of >10(7) at temperatures near 7 K, providing a promising platform for reaching the quantum regime of spin mechanics, especially phononic cavity quantum electrodynamics of electron spins.

We show that the transfer is remarkably resilient against variations in the amplitudes of the pulses (scaling errors), thus demostrating that the superadiabatic process inherits certain robustness features from the adiabatic one. In particular, we provide new evidence of a plateau that appears at high values of the counterdiabatic pulse strength, which goes beyond the usual framework of saSTIRAP.This article is part of the theme issue 'Shortcuts to adiabaticity: theoretical, experimental and interdisciplinary perspectives'.

TI Quantum self-trapping on a star graph
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The attractive Bose-Hubbard model is applied for describing the two-exciton dynamics in a nonlinear quantum star graph. When the excitons are created on the core of the star, it is shown that the interplay between the complex architecture of the network and the nonlinearity favors the occurrence of a real quantum self-trapping. Quite weak in the small nonlinearity limit, this self-localization is enhanced as the nonlinearity increases. This feature originates in the restructuring of the two-exciton eigenstates whose localized nature intensifies with the nonlinearity. Nevertheless, the quantum self-trapping is never complete since it is impossible to localize the entire exciton density, even in the strong nonlinearity limit.

TI Contextuality and Dichotomizations of Random Variables
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB The Contextuality-by-Default approach to determining and measuring the (non)contextuality of a system of random variables requires that every random variable in the system be represented by an equivalent set of dichotomous random variables. In this paper we present general principles that justify the use of dichotomizations and determine their choice. The main idea in choosing dichotomizations is that if the set of possible values of a random variable is endowed with a pre-topology (V-space), then the allowable dichotomizations split the space of possible values into two linked subsets ("linkedness" being a weak form of pre-topological connectedness). We primarily focus on two types of random variables most often encountered in practice: categorical and real-valued ones (including continuous random variables, greatly underrepresented in the contextuality literature). A categorical variable (one with a finite number of unordered values) is represented by all of its possible dichotomizations. If the values of a random variable are real numbers, then they are dichotomized by intervals above and below a variable cut point.

TI Improved circuit implementation of the HHL algorithm and its simulations
   on QISKIT
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In 2019, Yong hae Lee et al. combined the circuit implementation of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm with a classical computer, and designed a hybrid HHL algorithm to reduce experimental errors caused by decoherence and so on. However, the improvement is achieved only in the auxiliary quantum coding phase, and no quantum resource reduction is done on the quantum phase estimation and inverse quantum phase estimation stages. At the same time, the circuit improvement illustration on a 2 x 2 linear system just has the result and no specific process. In this paper, based on the idea of the hybrid HHL algorithm and a generic circuit of HHL algorithm, an improved circuit implementation of the HHL algorithm is proposed. The feasibility of the improved circuit implementation of the HHL algorithm is verified by IBM's qiskit. The improved circuit illustrations on a 4 x 4 linear system show that the improved circuit implementation of the HHL algorithm can effectively reduce quantum resources without losing the fidelity of the results. Thus the improved circuit implementation of the HHL algorithm can further avoid some result errors than the existing implementation methods.

AB Quipper and Proto-Quipper are a family of quantum programming languages that, by their nature as circuit description languages, involve two runtimes: one at which the program generates a circuit and one at which the circuit is executed, normally with probabilistic results due to measurements. Accordingly, the language distinguishes two kinds of data: parameters, which are known at circuit generation time, and states, which are known at circuit execution time. Sometimes, it is desirable for the results of measurements to control the generation of the next part of the circuit. Therefore, the language needs to turn states, such as measurement outcomes, into parameters, an operation we call dynamic lifting. The goal of this paper is to model this interaction between the runtimes by providing a general categorical structure enriched in what we call "bisets". We demonstrate that the biset-enriched structure achieves a proper semantics of the two runtimes and their interaction, by showing that it models a variant of Proto-Quipper with dynamic lifting. The present paper deals with the concrete categorical semantics of this language, whereas a companion paper [7] deals with the syntax, type system, operational semantics, and abstract categorical semantics.

TI Extracting work from correlated many-body quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The presence of correlations in the input state of a noninteracting many-body quantum system can lead to an increase in the amount of work we can extract from it under global unitary processes (ergotropy). The present work explores such effect on translationally invariant systems relying on the matrix product operator formalism to define a measure of how much they are correlated. We observe that in the thermodynamic limit of large number of sites, complete work extraction can be attained for relatively small correlation strength (a reduction of a 2 factor in dB units). Most importantly, such an effect appears to not be associated with the presence of quantum correlations (e.g., entanglement) in the input state (classical correlation suffices), and to be attainable by only using incoherent ergotropy. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also present a rigorous formulation of the heuristic typicality argument first formulated by Alicki and Fannes [R. Alicki and M. Fannes, Phys. Rev. E 87, 042123 (2013)], which gives the maximum work that is extractable for a set of many identical quantum systems in the asymptotic limit.

TI Dynamics of Negativity of a Wannier-Stark Many-Body Localized System
   Coupled to a Bath
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB An interacting system subjected to a strong linear potential can host a many-body localized (MBL) phase when being slightly perturbed. This so-called Wannier-Stark or "tilted-field" MBL phase inherits many properties from the well-investigated disordered MBL phase, and provides an alternative route to experimentally engineer interacting localized systems without quenched disorder. Herein, the dynamics of entanglement in a Wannier-Stark MBL system coupled to a dephasing environment is investigated. As an accessible entanglement proxy, the third Renyi negativity R 3 is used, which reduces to the third Renyi entropy in case the system is isolated from the environment. This measure captures the characteristic logarithmic growth of interacting localized phases in the intermediate-time regime, where the effects of the coupling to the environment are not yet dominating the dynamics. Thus, it forms a tool to distinguish Wannier-Stark MBL from noninteracting Wannier-Stark localization up to intermediate time-scales, and to quantify quantum correlations in mixed-state dynamics.

TI Exploring Quantum Comprehension Through the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Testing
   Problem
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Elitzur-Vaidman bomb testing problem is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics that explores the concepts of quantum superposition and entanglement. The problem creates a scenario where a bomb is activated by absorbing a single photon and suggests testing that it works without exploding it, so that classically, it is impossible to know if the bomb works without disturbing the system. Therefore, an interferometer with two arms and two outputs is proposed, mounted in such a way that only one of them has positive interference. However, when placing a pump that works in one of the arms, the interference pattern breaks down, and it can be inferred that the pump works without interacting with it. In this work, a methodology is adopted that combines computational simulations and a simple experimental proposal to investigate the concept of interaction-free measurements. The IBM quantum cloud programming language (Qiskit Runtime) is utilized to simulate the experiments, and an experimental approach is proposed that uses simple laser sources to qualitatively test the theory, offering a practical perspective for developing an understanding of quantum concepts.

TI Robust macroscopic matter-wave interferometry with solids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Matter-wave interferometry with solids is highly susceptible to minute fluctuations of environmental fields, including gravitational effects from distant sources. Hence, experiments require a degree of shielding that is extraordinarily challenging to achieve in realistic terrestrial or even space-based setups. Here, we design protocols that exploit the spatial correlations that are inherent in perturbations due to distant sources to reduce significantly their impact on the visibility of interference patterns. We show that interference patterns that are robust to such type of noise can be encoded in the joint probability distribution of two or more interferometers, provided that these are initialized in suitable states. We develop a general framework that makes use of N + 1 interferometers, which may differ in their masses, to correct for environmental potential fields up to order N in their multipole expansion. Remarkably, our approach works for fields that fluctuate stochastically in any timescale and does not require the presence of quantum correlations among the different interferometers. Finally, we also show that the same ideas can be extended to the protection of entanglement between pairs of interferometers.

TI Quantum illumination using polarization-entangled photon pairs for
   enhanced object detection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entangled light sources for illuminating objects offer advantages over conventional illumination methods by enhancing the detection sensitivity of reflecting objects. The core of the quantum advantage lies in effectively exploiting quantum correlations to isolate noise and detect objects with low reflectivity. This work experimentally demonstrates the benefits of using polarization-entangled photon pairs for quantum illumination and shows that the quantum correlation measure, using CHSH value and normalized CHSH value, is robust against losses, noise, and depolarization. We report the detection of objects with reflectivity (eta) as low as 0.05 and an object submerged in noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.003 using quantum correlation and residual quantum correlation measures, surpassing previous results. Additionally, we demonstrate that the normalized CHSH value aids in estimating the reflectivity of the detected object. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the correlation measure under photon attenuation in atmospheric conditions to show the practical feasibility of real-time applications.

TI Subdynamics in a many-body system of quantum particles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB For a system of >> 1 spinless quantum particles, the projection operator is introduced, which, surprisingly, exactly transforms the inhomogeneous (with irrelevant initial correlations term) Nakajima-Zwanzig generalized master equation (GME) into completely closed (homogeneous) GME with initial correlations included into the kernel governing its evolution. The obtained equation is equivalent to the closed linear evolution equation for an -particle ( < ) statistical operator, which holds for any initial condition and all timescales. Thus, the introduced projector implements the idea of the subdynamics in the subspace of -particle complex. It also allows for precise treatment of the initial correlations on an equal footing with collisions. No "molecular chaos" -type approximation is used. The obtained homogeneous equation is further specialized in the linear approximation in the particles density for the kernel and considered in detail for the one-particle statistical operator. The influence of both the quantum correlations, caused by the particles' statistics, and initial correlations, related to the interparticle interaction, is considered in detail and at different timescales. Connection of the linear equation for a one-particle statistical operator to the nonlinear quantum Boltzmann equation is shown.

TI Dynamics of Entropy Production Rate in Two Coupled Bosonic Modes
   Interacting with a Thermal Reservoir
SO ENTROPY
AB The Markovian time evolution of the entropy production rate is studied as a measure of irreversibility generated in a bipartite quantum system consisting of two coupled bosonic modes immersed in a common thermal environment. The dynamics of the system is described in the framework of the formalism of the theory of open quantum systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups, for initial two-mode squeezed thermal states, squeezed vacuum states, thermal states and coherent states. We show that the rate of the entropy production of the initial state and nonequilibrium stationary state, and the time evolution of the rate of entropy production, strongly depend on the parameters of the initial Gaussian state (squeezing parameter and average thermal photon numbers), frequencies of modes, parameters characterising the thermal environment (temperature and dissipation coefficient), and the strength of coupling between the two modes. We also provide a comparison of the behaviour of entropy production rate and Renyi-2 mutual information present in the considered system.

TI Area laws and thermalization from classical entropies in a Bose-Einstein
   condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture many features of their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the postquench dynamics of a multiwell spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased k-nearest-neighbor method. We observe the dynamical buildup of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without reconstructing the underlying state or measurement distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.

TI Ergodic edge modes in the 4D quantum Hall effect
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The gapless modes on the edge of four-dimensional (4D) quantum Hall droplets are known to be anisotropic: they only propagate in one direction, foliating the 3D boundary into independent 1D conduction channels. This foliation is extremely sensitive to the confining potential and generically yields chaotic flows. Here we study the quantum correlations and entanglement of such edge modes in 4D droplets confined by harmonic traps, whose boundary is a squashed three-sphere. Commensurable trapping frequencies lead to periodic trajectories of electronic guiding centers; the corresponding edge modes propagate independently along S-1 fibers, forming a bundle of 1D conformal field theories over a 2D base space. By contrast, incommensurable frequencies produce quasi-periodic, ergodic trajectories, each of which covers its invariant torus densely; the corresponding correlation function of edge modes has fractal features. This wealth of behaviors highlights the sharp differences between 4D Hall droplets and their 2D peers; it also exhibits the dependence of 4D edge modes on the choice of trap, suggesting the existence of observable bifurcations due to droplet deformations.

TI Cyclic quantum causal models
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Causal reasoning is essential to science, yet quantum theory challenges it. Quantum correlations violating Bell inequalities defy satisfactory causal explanations within the framework of classical causal models. What is more, a theory encompassing quantum systems and gravity is expected to allow causally nonseparable processes featuring operations in indefinite causal order, defying that events be causally ordered at all. The first challenge has been addressed through the recent development of intrinsically quantum causal models, allowing causal explanations of quantum processes - provided they admit a definite causal order, i.e. have an acyclic causal structure. This work addresses causally nonseparable processes and offers a causal perspective on them through extending quantum causal models to cyclic causal structures. Among other applications of the approach, it is shown that all unitarily extendible bipartite processes are causally separable and that for unitary processes, causal nonseparability and cyclicity of their causal structure are equivalent. While unusual processes allowing indefinite causal order are gaining attention in quantum physics, formalisms describing definite causal structures have so far been limited to acyclic ones. Here the authors extend to the cyclic case, offering a causal perspective on causally indefinite processes.

TI Mobile impurity probing a two-dimensional superfluid phase transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The use of atomically sized quantum systems as highly sensitive measuring devices represents an exciting and quickly growing research field. Here we explore the properties of a quasiparticle formed by a mobile impurity interacting with a two-dimensional fermionic superfluid. The energy of the quasiparticle is shown to be lowered by superfluid pairing, as this increases the compressibility of the Fermi gas, thereby making it easier for the impurity to perturb its surroundings. We demonstrate that the fundamentally discontinuous nature of the superfluid-to-normal phase transition of a two-dimensional system leads to a rapid increase in the quasiparticle energy around the critical temperature. The magnitude of this increase exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the pairing strength with a sizable maximum in the crossover region, where the spatial extend of the Cooper pairs is comparable to the interparticle spacing. Since the quasiparticle energy is measurable with present experimental techniques, our results illustrate how impurities entangled with their environment can serve as useful probes for nontrivial thermal and quantum correlations.

TI Nonequilibrium dynamics and atom-pair coherence in strongly interacting
   Bose-Fermi mixtures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Theoretical treatments of nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures are complicated by the inherent non-Gaussian nature of the vacuum two-body physics, invalidating the typical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. Here we apply the cumulant expansion to study nonequilibrium BoseFermi mixtures, which allows us to explicitly include the missing non-Gaussian quantum correlations, leading to a consistent dynamical theory of a Bose-Fermi mixture near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. We first apply our theory to a study of atom-pair coherence in the gas, which is significantly enhanced by the competing influences of the Fermi sea and Bose-Einstein condensation, in agreement with analytical calculations. Then we study the depletion of a degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture following a quench to the unitary regime, characterizing the resulting depletion of the Bose-Einstein condensate, the deformation of the Fermi surface, and the production of molecules. We find that at early times, the population dynamics scale quadratically with the hold time, and define an associated characteristic timescale set by the parameters of the mixture and the width of the Feshbach resonance.

TI Local quantum Fisher information and Jensen-Shannon coherence dynamics
   of two-spin-qubits XYZ-Heisenberg state
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this study, we investigate the impact of the XYZ-DM-Heisenberg model on quantum resources, including local quantum Fisher information, concurrence, and Jensen-Shannon coherence, in the presence of intrinsic decoherence. By exploring various spin-exchange interactions, with a focus on the role of the y-DM interaction, we reveal how these interactions affect quantum correlations and coherence dynamics. We find that the system transitions from separability to the generation of quantum properties when spin interactions are introduced. The specific parameter choices significantly influence the dynamic map of quantum functions. Notably, strong y-DM interaction, in combination with equal spin interaction, leads to pronounced fluctuations, while weak DM interaction results in sudden death and rebirth in the x direction. Additionally, ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic regimes impact the quantum functions differently. In the presence of intrinsic decoherence, fluctuations decrease, and coherence remains robust compared to the local quantum Fisher information and entanglement, reducing loss.

TI Determination of ground states of one-dimensional quantum systems using
   the cluster iTEBD method
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Within the framework of imaginary-time evolution for matrix product states, we introduce a cluster version of the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm for simulating quantum many-body systems, addressing the computational accuracy challenges in strongly correlated physics. By redefining the wave-function ansatz to incorporate multiple physical degrees of freedom, we enhance the representation of entanglement, thereby improving the accuracy of the ground states. Utilizing the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and optimized truncation schemes, our method maintains roughly the same computational complexity while capturing more quantum correlations. We apply this approach to three nontrivial cases: the gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the spin-1 anisotropic XXZD chain with a higher-order Gaussian-type phase transition, and a spin-1/2 twisted triangular prism hosting a magnetic plateau phase. Improved accuracy in physical quantities, such as magnetization, ground-state energy, and entanglement entropy, has been demonstrated. This method provides a scalable framework for studying complex quantum systems with high precision, making it suitable for situations where a pure increase in bond dimension alone cannot guarantee satisfactory results.

TI Optimal energy storage in the Tavis-Cummings quantum battery
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Tavis-Cummings (TC) model, which serves as a natural physical realization of a quantum battery, comprises N(b )atoms as battery cells that collectively interact with a shared photon field, functioning as the charger, initially containing n0 photons. In this paper, we introduce the invariant subspace method to effectively represent the quantum dynamics of the TC battery. Our findings indicate that in the limiting case of n(0) >> N-b or N-b >> n(0), a distinct SU(2) symmetry emerges in the dynamics, thereby ensuring the realization of optimal energy storage. We also establish a negative relationship between the battery-charger entanglement and the energy storage capacity. As a result, we demonstrate that asymptotically optimal energy storage can be achieved in the scenario where Nb = n(0 )>> 1. Our approach not only enhances our comprehension of the algebraic structure inherent in the TC model but also contributes to the broader theoretical framework of quantum batteries. Furthermore, it provides crucial insights into the relation between energy transfer and quantum correlations.

TI Entanglement Spheres and a UV-IR Connection in Effective Field Theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We show that long-distance quantum correlations probe short-distance physics. Two disjoint regions of the latticized, massless scalar field vacuum are numerically demonstrated to become separable at distances beyond the negativity sphere, which extends to infinity in the continuum limit. The size of this quantum coherent volume is determined by the highest momentum mode supported in the identical regions, each of diameter d. More generally, effective field theories (EFTs), describing a system up to a given momentum scale Lambda, are expected to share this feature-entanglement between regions of the vacuum depends upon the UV completion beyond a separation proportional to Lambda. Through calculations extended to three dimensions, the magnitude of the negativity at which entanglement becomes sensitive to UV physics in an EFT (lattice or otherwise) is conjectured to scale as similar to e(-Lambda d), independent of the number of spatial dimensions. It is concluded that two-region vacuum entanglement at increasing separations depends upon the structure of the theory at increasing momentum scales. This phenomenon may be manifest in perturbative QCD processes.

TI Symmetry: A Fundamental Resource for Quantum Coherence and Metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a new paradigm for the preparation of deeply entangled states useful for quantum metrology. We show that, when the quantum state is an eigenstate of an operator A, observables G which are completely off diagonal with respect to A have purely quantum fluctuations, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, namely, FQ(G) = 4 < G(2)>. This property holds regardless of the purity of the quantum state, and it implies that off-diagonal fluctuations represent a metrological resource for phase estimation. In particular, for many-body systems such as quantum spin ensembles or bosonic gases, the presence of off-diagonal long-range order (for a spin observable or for bosonic operators) directly translates into a metrological resource, provided that the system remains in a well-defined symmetry sector. The latter is defined, e.g., by one component of the collective spin or by its parity in spin systems; and by the particle number for bosons. Our results establish the optimal use for metrology of arbitrarily non-Gaussian quantum correlations in a large variety of many-body systems.

TI Triple-quantum dual-comb two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy resolves
   velocity-synchronized Dicke states in hot atomic vapors
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) combined with dual-comb technology offers unprecedented resolution for probing many-body interactions in atomic vapors, yet its application to high-order multi-quantum transitions remains challenging due to weaker nonlinear signals and phase instability. Here, we demonstrate a triple-quantum dual-comb 2DCS technique that achieves lambda/110 phase stability through digital correction, enabling the observation of velocity-synchronized Dicke states in a thermal rubidium vapor. By resolving collective hyperfine resonances of Rb-8(5) and Rb-8(7) isotopes with 100 MHz spectral resolution, the titled and elongated ellipticity of the three-quantum peak line shape (0.94) is higher than that of the two-quantum (0.84), reveals that triple-quantum correlations (0.95) surpass double-quantum counterparts (0.90), indicating tighter velocity matching in higher-order Dicke states. This work provides a pathway for manipulating multi-atom correlations in Doppler-broadened systems, and greatly assists to characterize complex hyperfine many-body interaction in semiconductor exciton and two-dimensional materials.

TI Observation of oscillatory Raman gain associated with two-photon Rabi
   oscillations of nanofiber-coupled atoms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum emitters with a ?-type level structure enable numerous protocols and applications in quantum science and technology. Understanding and controlling their dynamics is, therefore, one of the central research topics in quantum optics. Here, we drive two-photon Rabi oscillations between the two ground states of cesium atoms and observe the associated oscillatory Raman gain and absorption that stems from the atom-mediated coherent photon exchange between the two drive fields. The atoms are efficiently and homogeneously coupled with the probe field by means of a nanofiber-based optical interface. We study the dependence of the two-photon Rabi frequency on the system parameters and observe Autler-Townes splitting in the probe transmission spectrum. Beyond shedding light on the fundamental processes underlying two-photon Rabi oscillations, our method could also be used to investigate (quantum) correlations between the two drive fields as well as the dynamical establishment of electromagnetically induced transparency.

TI Macroscopic quantum mechanics in gravitational-wave observatories and
   beyond
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The existence of quantum correlations affects both microscopic and macroscopic systems. On macroscopic systems, they are difficult to observe and usually irrelevant for the system's evolution due to the frequent energy exchange with the environment. The world-wide network of gravitational-wave (GW) observatories exploits optical as well as mechanical systems that are highly macroscopic and largely decoupled from the environment. The quasi-monochromatic light fields in the kilometer-scale arm resonators have photon excitation numbers larger than 1019, and the mirrors that are quasi-free falling in propagation direction of the light fields have masses of around 40 kg. Recent observations on the GW observatories LIGO and Virgo clearly showed that the quantum uncertainty of one system affected the uncertainty of the other. Here, we review these observations and provide links to research goals targeted with mesoscopic optomechanical systems in other fields of fundamental physical research. These may have Gaussian quantum uncertainties as the ones in GW observatories or even non-Gaussian ones, such as Schrodinger cat states.

TI Extracting electronic many-body correlations from local measurements
   with artificial neural networks
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB The characterization of many-body correlations provides a powerful tool for analyzing correlated quantum materials. However, experimental extraction of quantum entangle-ment in correlated electronic systems remains an open problem in practice. In particu-lar, the correlation entropy quantifies the strength of quantum correlations in interact-ing electronic systems, yet it requires measuring all the single-particle correlators of a macroscopic sample. To circumvent this bottleneck, we introduce a strategy to obtain the correlation entropy of electronic systems solely from a set of local measurements. We show that, by combining local particle-particle and density-density correlations with a neural-network algorithm, the correlation entropy can be predicted accurately. Specifi-cally, we show that for a generalized interacting fermionic model, our algorithm yields an accurate prediction of the correlation entropy from a set of noisy local correlators. Our work shows that the correlation entropy in interacting electron systems can be recon-structed from local measurements, providing a starting point to experimentally extract many-body correlations with local probes.

TI A 509 nm pulsed laser system for Rydberg excitation of cesium atoms
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Single photon source is a non-classical light field with anti-bunching effect, which has a potential applications in the research of fundamental physics problems, quantum precision measurement, quantum communication, quantum computing, etc. The strong interaction between highly excited Rydberg atoms presents an excitation blockade effect. In a dense Rydberg atomic ensemble, the excitation of more than one Rydberg atom within a blockade volume is suppressed, where the interactions of Rydberg atoms shift the atomic states out of resonance with an excitation laser.
   We consider here the generation of single photon source by using a four-wave mixing scheme in a room temperature atomic vapor cell. In a homemade micrometer-sized atomic vapor cell, one-dimensional size is smaller than the radius of Rydberg blockade and the other two-dimensional size is limited by the size of focused laser beam. The blockade radius is on the order of a few micrometers, depending on the Rydberg atom states. An excitation blockade effect can be used to realize single photon source in thermal cesium vapor microcells. The micron cesium-cell is used to spatially localize atomic groups, which results in the atomic decoherence time on the order of microseconds or even nanoseconds. This requires a high-power pulsed laser to prepare the Rydberg atomic state at a nanosecond scale.
   Four-photon excitation schemes with narrow linewidth lasers are also used experimentally. The cesiumRydberg state can usually be excited by the lasers with optical wavelengths 852 and 509 nm, respectively. The laser system is well-stabilized so that the detuning is small compared with the spontaneous linewidth of Rydberg state, while the laser power and temporal mode need to be specified for ns-time coherence in thermal cesium vapor microcells. The 852 nm laser can be achieved by modulating the continuous laser beam with the help of an electro-optic intensity modulator (EOIM). While this remains a technical challenge for 509 nm laser with ns-laser pulse. There is no EOIM to generate the ns-laser pulse with high power.
   We demonstrate a novel generation method of 509 nm laser system. In our experiments, a 1018 nm fiber laser is used to produce a continuous laser with a typical linewidth of similar to 8 kHz and power of 10 mW. The nanosecond pulse is generated with the help of an electro-optic intensity modulator (EOIM) by modifying the continuous laser beam. The peak power of modulated optical pulse is amplified to 4600 W by using a homemade fiber amplifier. The output beam of 1018 nm is then injected into a periodically poled lithium-niobate (PPLN) to generate the second harmonics laser of 509 nm. The typical peak power of 509 nm reaches 173 W by optimizing PPLN phase matching parameters. The pulse repetition frequency of the 509 nm laser can be continuously tuned in a range of 300 kHz-100 MHz, and the pulse width can be continuously tuned in a range of 1-100 ns. Peak power fluctuation of the pulses is about 1.3%. The power 509 nm laser with optimized pulse parameters can be used to excite the cesium atom with GHz bandwidth. Meanwhile the two seed source lasers is well established experimentally, which allows alternating pulses with a different wavelength. This is an essential capability for realizing a single photon source through four-wave mixing.

TI Irreversible work and Maxwell demon in terms of quantum thermodynamic
   force
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The second law of classical equilibrium thermodynamics, based on the positivity of entropy production, asserts that any process occurs only in a direction that some information may be lost (flow out of the system) due to the irreversibility inside the system. However, any thermodynamic system can exhibit fluctuations in which negative entropy production may be observed. In particular, in stochastic quantum processes due to quantum correlations and also memory effects we may see the reversal energy flow (heat flow from the cold system to the hot system) and the backflow of information into the system that leads to the negativity of the entropy production which is an apparent violation of the Second Law. In order to resolve this apparent violation, we will try to properly extend the Second Law to quantum processes by incorporating information explicitly into the Second Law. We will also provide a thermodynamic operational meaning for the flow and backflow of information. Finally, it is shown that negative and positive entropy production can be described by a quantum thermodynamic force.

TI The impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in charge-ordered systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We study the impact of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the stability of charge-density wave (CDW) in systems with large electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Here, the EPC is considered in the framework of the Holstein model at the half-filled square lattice. We obtain the phase diagram of the Rashba-Holstein model using the Hartree-Fock mean-field theory, and identify the boundaries of the CDW and Rashba metal phases. We notice that the RSOC disfavors the CDW phase, driving the system to a correlated Rashba metal. Also, we employ a cluster perturbation theory (CPT) approach to investigate the phase diagram beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation. The quantum correlations captured by CPT indicate that the RSOC is even more detrimental to CDW than previously anticipated. That is, the Rashba metal region is observed to be expanded in comparison to the mean-field case. Additionally, we investigate pairing correlations, and the results further strengthen the identification of critical points.

TI Resonance triplet dynamics in the quenched unitary Bose gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quenched unitary Bose gas is a paradigmatic example of a strongly interacting out -of -equilibrium quantum system, whose dynamics become difficult to describe theoretically due to the growth of non -Gaussian quantum correlations. We develop a conserving many -body theory capable of capturing these effects, allowing us to model the postquench dynamics in the previously inaccessible time regime where the gas departs from the universal prethermal stage. Our results show that this departure is driven by the growth of strong lossless three -body correlations, rather than atomic losses, thus framing the heating of the gas in this regime as a fully coherent phenomenon. We uncover the specific few -body scattering processes that affect this heating and show that the expected connection between the two -body and three -body contacts and the tail of the momentum distribution is obscured following the prethermal stage, explaining the absence of this connection in experiments. Our general framework, which reframes the dynamics of unitary quantum systems in terms of explicit connections to microscopic physics, can be broadly applied to any quantum system containing strong few -body correlations.

TI Quantum dynamics of Gaudin magnets
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum dynamics of many-body systems is a fascinating and significant subject for both theory and experiment. The question of how an isolated many-body system evolves to its steady state after a sudden perturbation or quench still remains challenging. In this paper, using the Bethe ansatz wave function, we study the quantum dynamics of an inhomogeneous Gaudin magnet. We derive explicit analytical expressions for various local dynamic quantities with an arbitrary number of flipped bath spins, such as: the spin distribution function, the spin-spin correlation function, and the Loschmidt echo. We also numerically study the relaxation behavior of these dynamic properties, gaining considerable insight into coherence and entanglement between the central spin and the bath. In particular, we find that the spin-spin correlations relax to their steady value via a nearly logarithmic scaling, whereas the Loschmidt echo shows an exponential relaxation to its steady value. Our results advance the understanding of relaxation dynamics and quantum correlations of long-range interacting models of the Gaudin type.

TI Fully Quantum Scalable Description of Driven-Dissipative Lattice Models
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Methods for modeling large driven-dissipative quantum systems are becoming increasingly urgent due to recent experimental progress in a number of photonic platforms. We demonstrate the positive-P method to be ideal for this purpose across a wide range of parameters, focusing on the archetypal driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model. Notably, these parameters include intermediate regimes where interactions and dissipation are comparable, and especially cases with low occupations for which common semiclassical approximations can break down. The presence of dissipation can alleviate instabilities in the method that are known to occur for closed systems, allowing the simulation of dynamics up to and including the steady state. Throughout the parameter space of the model, we determine the magnitude of dissipation that is sufficient to make the method useful and stable, finding its region of applicability to be complementary to that of the truncated Wigner method. We then demonstrate its use in a number of examples with non-trivial quantum correlations, including a demonstration of solving the urgent open problem of large and highly nonuniform systems with tens of thousands of sites.

TI Compressing continuous variable quantum measurements
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We generalize the notion of joint measurability to continuous variable systems by extending a recently introduced compression algorithm of quantum measurements to this realm. The extension results in a property that asks for the minimal dimensional quantum system required for representing a given set of quantum measurements. To illustrate the concept, we show that the canonical pair of position and momentum is completely incompressible. We translate the concept of measurement compression to the realm of quantum correlations, where it results in a generalization of continuous variable quantum steering. In contrast to the steering scenario, which detects entanglement, the generalization detects the dimensionality of entanglement. We illustrate the bridge between the concepts by showing that an analogue of the original EPR argument is genuinely infinite-dimensional with respect to our figure of merit, and that a fundamental discrete variable result on preparability of unsteerable state assemblages with separable states does not directly carry over to the continuous variable setting. We further prove a representation result for partially entanglement breaking channels that can be of independent interest.

TI Squeezing Oscillations in a Multimode Bosonic Josephson Junction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum simulators built from ultracold atoms promise to study quantum phenomena in interacting many-body systems. However, it remains a challenge to experimentally prepare strongly correlated continuous systems such that the properties are dominated by quantum fluctuations. Here, we show how to enhance the quantum correlations in a one-dimensional multimode bosonic Josephson junction, which is a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon field theory. Our approach is based on the ability to track the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum properties. After creating a bosonic Josephson junction at the stable fixed point of the classical phase space, we observe squeezing oscillations in the two conjugate variables. We show that the squeezing oscillation frequency can be tuned by more than one order of magnitude, and we are able to achieve a spin squeezing close to 10 dB by utilizing these oscillatory dynamics. The impact of improved spin squeezing is directly revealed by detecting enhanced spatial phase correlations between decoupled condensates. Our work provides new ways for engineering correlations and entanglement in the external degree of freedom of interacting many-body systems.

TI Dual Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Based on Improved
   Quantum Genetic Algorithm
SO MACHINES
AB Aiming at solving the problem of dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem (DRCFJSP) with differences in operating time between operators, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based DRCFJSP optimization model is developed in this paper. This model introduces the differences between the loading and unloading operation time of workers before and after the process. Subsequently, the quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) is used as the carrier; the process is coded through quantum coding; and the niche technology is used to initialize the population, adaptive rotation angle, and quantum mutation strategy to improve the efficiency of the QGA and avoid premature convergence. Lastly, through the Kacem standard calculation example and the reliability analysis of the factory workshop processing process example, performance evaluation is conducted to show that the improved QGA has good convergence and does not fall into premature ability, the improved QGA can solve the problem of reasonable deployment of machines and personnel in the workshop, and the proposed method is more effective for the DRCFJSP than some existing methods. The findings can provide a good theoretical basis for actual production and application.

AB We experimentally determine isotropic and anisotropic g-factor corrections in lateral GaAs single-electron quantum dots. We extract the Zeeman splitting by measuring the tunnel rates into the individual spin states of an empty quantum dot for an in-plane magnetic field with various strengths and directions. We quantify the Zeeman energy and find a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength that allows us to extract the g-factor. The measured g-factor is understood in terms of spin-orbit interaction induced isotropic and anisotropic corrections to the GaAs bulk g-factor. Experimental detection and identification of minute band-structure effects in the g-factor is of significance for spin qubits in GaAs quantum dots.

TI Directional spontaneous emission in photonic crystal slabs
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Spontaneous emission is one of the most fundamental out-of-equilibrium processes in which an excited quantum emitter relaxes to the ground state due to quantum fluctuations. In this process, a photon is emitted that can interact with other nearby emitters and establish quantum correlations between them, e.g., via super and subradiance effects. One way to modify these photon-mediated interactions is to alter the dipole radiation patterns of the emitter, e.g., by placing photonic crystals near them. One recent example is the generation of strong directional emission patterns - key to enhancing super and subradiance effects - in two dimensions by employing photonic crystals with band structures characterized by linear isofrequency contours and saddle points. However, these studies have predominantly used oversimplified toy models, overlooking the electromagnetic field's intricacies in actual materials, including aspects like geometrical dependencies, emitter positions, and polarization. Our study delves into the interaction between these directional emission patterns and the variables mentioned above, revealing the untapped potential to fine-tune collective quantum optical phenomena.

TI Nonclassical correlations of radiation in relation to Bell nonlocality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze nonclassical correlations between outcomes of measurements conducted on two spatial radiation modes. These correlations cannot be simulated with statistical mixtures of coherent states or, more generally, with non-negative phase-space functions of quantum states and measurements. We argue that nonclassical correlations are naturally related to Bell nonlocality, the former being a more general class of quantum correlations. Indeed, it is known that local realistic as well as noncontextual models correspond to non-negative solutions to a system of linear equations for the joint probability distributions of all observables. We demonstrate that nonclassical correlations correspond to a particular solution to this system, which may have negative values even if local realism is not violated. A modification of Bell inequalities enables us to test such correlations. At the same time, our approach leads to a formulation of Bell inequalities applicable also to continuous variables. The results are illustrated with two-mode squeezed vacuum states and with hybrid entangled states (Schr??dinger-Cat states), one mode being analyzed by balanced and the other one by unbalanced homodyne detection.

TI Perturbation-driven echo-like superfluorescence in perovskite
   superlattices
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB The collective response of macroscopic quantum states under perturbation is widely used to study quantum correlations and cooperative properties, such as defect-induced quantum vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates and the non-destructive scattering of impurities in superfluids. Superfluorescence (SF), as a collective effect rooted in dipole-dipole cooperation through virtual photon exchange, leads to the macroscopic dipole moment (MDM) in high-density dipole ensembles. However, the perturbation response of the MDM in SF systems remains unknown. Echo-like behavior is observed in a cooperative exciton ensemble under a controllable perturbation, corresponding to an initial collapse followed by a revival of the MDM. Such a dynamic response could refer to a phase transition between the macroscopic coherence regime and the incoherent classical state on a time scale of 10 ps. The echo-like behavior is absent above 100 K due to the instability of MDM in a strongly dephased exciton ensemble. Experimentally, the MDM response to perturbations is shown to be controlled by the amplitude and injection time of the perturbations.

TI Sensing the Spin State of Room-Temperature Switchable Cyanometallate
   Frameworks with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Nanodiamonds
SO ACS NANO
AB Room-temperature magnetically switchable materials play a vital role in current and upcoming quantum technologies, such as spintronics, molecular switches, and data storage devices. The increasing miniaturization of device architectures produces a need to develop analytical tools capable of precisely probing spin information at the single-particle level. In this work, we demonstrate a methodology using negatively charged nitrogen vacancies (NV-) in fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) particles to probe the magnetic switching of a spin crossover (SCO) metal-organic framework (MOF), [Fe(1,6-naphthyridine)(2)(Ag(CN)(2))(2)] material (1), and a single-molecule photomagnet [X(18-crown-6)(H2O)(3)]Fe(CN)(6)center dot 2H(2)O, where X = Eu and Dy (materials 2a and 2b, respectively), in response to heat, light, and electron beam exposure. We employ correlative light-electron microscopy using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) finder grids to accurately image and sense spin-spin interacting particles down to the single-particle level. We used surface-sensitive optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and magnetic modulation (MM) of FND photoluminescence (PL) to sense spins to a distance of ca. 10-30 nm. We show that ODMR and MM sensing was not sensitive to the temperature-induced SCO of Fe-II in 1 as formation of paramagnetic Fe-III through surface oxidation (detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) on heating obscured the signal of bulk SCO switching. We found that proximal FNDs could effectively sense the chemical transformations induced by the 200 keV electron beam in 1, namely, Ag-I -> Ag-0 and Fe-II -> Fe-III. However, transformations induced by the electron beam are irreversible as they substantially disrupt the structure of MOF particles. Finally, we demonstrate NV- sensing of reversible photomagnetic switching, Fe-III + (18-crown-6) reversible arrow Fe-II + (18-crown-6)(+center dot), triggered in 2a and 2b by 405 nm light. The photoredox process of 2a and 2b proved to be the best candidate for room-temperature single-particle magnetic switching utilizing FNDs as a sensor, which could have applications into next-generation quantum technologies.

TI High-fidelity Rydberg controlled-Z gates with optimized pulses
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB High-fidelity controlled-Z (CZ ) gates are essential and mandatory to build a large-scale quantum computer. In neutral atoms, the strong dipole-dipole interactions between their Rydberg states make them one of the pioneering platforms to implement CZ gates. Here we numerically investigate the optimized pulses to generate a high-fidelity Rydberg C Z gate in a three-level ladder-type atomic system. By tuning the temporal shapes of Gaussian or segmented pulses, the populations on the intermediate excited states are shown to be suppressed within the symmetric gate operation protocol, which leads to a C Z gate with a high Bell fidelity up to 99.92% . These optimized pulses are robust to thermal fluctuations and the excitation field variations. Our results promise a high-fidelity and fast gate operation under amenable and controllable experimental parameters, which goes beyond the adiabatic operation regime under a finite blockade strength.

TI Ring Signature Scheme Based on Lattice and Its Application on Anonymous
   Electronic Voting
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB With the development of quantum computers, ring signature schemes based on large integer prime factorization, discrete logarithm problem, and bilinear pairing are under threat. For this reason, we design a ring signature scheme based on lattice with a fixed verification key. Compared with the previous ring signature scheme based on lattice, our design has a fixed verification key and does not disclose the signer's identity. Meanwhile, we propose an anonymous electronic voting scheme by using our ring signature scheme based on lattice and (t,n) threshold scheme, which makes up for the lack of current anonymous electronic voting that cannot resist attacks of the quantum computer. Finally, under standard model (SM), we prove that our ring signature scheme based on lattice is anonymous against the full-key exposure, and existentially non-forgeable against insider corruption. Furthermore, we also briefly analyze the security of our anonymous electronic voting scheme.

TI Hyper-transport and superdiffusion in a non-interacting two-particle
   quantum walk with dynamic disorder
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this work, we report on a theoretical investigation of one-dimensional non-interacting two-particle quantum walk with discrete-time evolution, under the influence of a dynamic disorder. We have analyzed how the initial wavefunction symmetry and phase disorder distribution affect the quantum walk final coincidence probability and transport characteristics. By adjusting the disorder degree of randomness, we observe the emergence of various diffusion regimes, ranging from regular diffusion, characteristic of a classical stochastic process to the ballistic spreading of quantum systems. For the fermionic quantum walk, it is possible to go beyond the ballistic behavior and obtain the hyper-transport propagation regime.

TI Generalized Cycle Benchmarking Algorithm for Characterizing Midcircuit
   Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Midcircuit measurements (MCMs) are crucial ingredients in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While there have been rapid experimental progresses in realizing MCMs, a systematic method for characterizing noisy MCMs is still under exploration. In this work, we develop a cycle bench- marking (CB)-type algorithm to characterize noisy MCMs. The key idea is to use a joint Fourier transform on the classical and quantum registers and then estimate parameters in the Fourier space, analogous to Pauli fidelities used in CB-type algorithms for characterizing the Pauli-noise channel of Clifford gates. Furthermore, we develop a theory of the noise learnability of MCMs, which determines what information can be learned about the noise model (in the presence of state preparation and terminating measurement noise) and what cannot, which shows that all learnable information can be learned using our algorithm. As an application, we show how to use the learned information to test the independence between measurement noise and state-preparation noise in an MCM. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the practical applicability of the algorithm. Similar to other CB-type algorithms, we expect the algorithm to provide a useful toolkit that is of experimental interest.

TI Majorana zero modes induced by superconducting phase bias
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Majorana zero modes in condensed matter systems have been the subject of much interest in recent years. Their non-Abelian exchange statistics, making them a unique state of matter, and their potential applications in topological quantum computation, earned them attention from both theorists and experimentalists. It is generally understood that in order to form Majorana zero modes in quasi-one-dimensional topological insulators, time-reversal symmetry must be broken. The straightforward mechanisms for doing so-applying magnetic fields or coupling to ferromagnets-turned out to have many unwanted side effects, such as degradation of superconductivity and the formation of sub-gap states, which is part of the reason Majorana zero modes have been eluding direct experimental detection for a long time. Here we review several proposal that rely on controlling the phase of the superconducting order parameter, either as the sole mechanism for time-reversal-symmetry breaking, or as an additional handy knob used to reduce the applied magnetic field. These proposals hold practical promise to improve Majorana formation, and they shed light on the physics underlying the formation of the topological superconducting state.

TI Lowering Connectivity Requirements for Bivariate Bicycle Codes Using

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In reference Bravyi et al., [Nature (London) 627, 778 (2024)], Bravyi et al. found examples of bivariate bicycle (BB) codes with similar logical performance to the surface code but with an improved encoding rate. In this work, we generalize a novel parity-check circuit design principle called morphing circuits and apply it to BB codes. We define a new family of BB codes whose parity check circuits require a qubit connectivity of degree five instead of six while maintaining their numerical performance. Logical input or output to an ancillary surface code is also possible in a biplanar layout. Finally, we develop a general framework for designing morphing circuits and present a sufficient condition for its applicability to two- block group algebra codes.

TI Topological quantum floating phase of dipolar bosons in an optical
   ladder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit rung filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar spin ladders can be investigated in ongoing experiments.

TI Spatial inversion symmetry breaking of vortex current in a biased-ladder

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the quench dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder in the presence of a uniform Abelian gauge field. The model hosts a variety of emergent quantum phases, and we focus on the superfluid biased-ladder phase breaking the Z2 symmetry of two legs. We observe an asymmetric spreading of vortex current and particle density, i.e., the vortices propagate ballistically on the right and dissolve during the propagation on the left, indicating spontaneous breaking of the spatial inversion symmetry. By decreasing the repulsion strength, it is found that the ballistic propagating vortices are more robust than the dissolving ones on the other side.

TI Floquet prethermal phase protected by U(1) symmetry on a superconducting
   quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Periodically driven systems, or Floquet systems, exhibit many novel dynamics and interesting out-of-equilibrium phases of matter. Those phases arising with the quantum systems' symmetries, such as global U(1) symmetry, can even show dynamical stability with symmetry protection. Here we experimentally demonstrate a U(1) symmetry-protected prethermal phase, via performing a digital-analog quantum simulation on a superconducting quantum processor. The dynamical stability of this phase is revealed by its robustness against external perturbations. We also find that the site-averaged square of the two-spin correlation function in this phase is stabilized by the interaction between the spins. Our work reveals a promising prospect in discovering emergent quantum dynamical phases with digital-analog quantum simulators.

TI Many-body-localized discrete time crystal with a programmable spin-based
   quantum simulator
SO SCIENCE
AB The discrete time crystal (DTC) is a nonequilibrium phase of matter that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. Disorder-induced many-body localization can stabilize the DTC phase by breaking ergodicity and preventing thermalization. Here, we observe the hallmark signatures of the many-body-localized DTC using a quantum simulation platform based on individually controllable carbon-13 nuclear spins in diamond. We demonstrate long-lived period-doubled oscillations and confirm that they are robust for generic initial states, thus showing the characteristic time-crystalline order across the many-body spectrum. Our results are consistent with the realization of an out-of-equilibrium Floquet phase of matter and introduce a programmable quantum simulator based on solid-state spins for exploring many-body physics.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum simulation of quasicrystals in synthetic bosonic matter now paves the way for the exploration of these intriguing systems in wide parameter ranges. Yet thermal fluctuations in such systems compete with quantum coherence and significantly affect the zero-temperature quantum phases. Here we determine the thermodynamic phase diagram of interacting bosons in a two-dimensional, homogeneous quasicrystal potential. We find our results using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Finite-size effects are carefully taken into account and the quantum phases are systematically distinguished from thermal phases. In particular, we demonstrate stabilization of a genuine Bose glass phase against the normal fluid in sizable parameter ranges. We interpret our results for strong interactions using a fermionization picture and discuss experimental relevance.

TI Prediction of Tonic Code Topological Order from Rydberg Blockade
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The physical realization of Z(2) topological order as encountered in the paradigmatic tonic code has proven to be an elusive goal. We predict that this phase of matter can be realized in a two-dimensional array of Rydberg atoms placed on the ruby lattice, at specific values of the Rydberg blockade radius. First, we show that the blockade model-also known as a "PXP" model-realizes a monomer-dimer model on the kagome lattice with a single-site kinetic term. This model can be interpreted as a Z(2) gauge theory whose dynamics is generated by monomer fluctuations. We obtain its phase diagram using the numerical density matrix renormalization group method and find a topological quantum liquid (TQL) as evidenced by multiple measures including (i) a continuous transition between two featureless phases, (ii) a topological entanglement entropy of In 2 as measured in various geometries, (iii) degenerate topological ground states, and (iv) the expected modular matrix from ground state overlap. Next, we show that the TQL persists upon including realistic, algebraically decaying van der Waals interactions V(r) similar to 1/r(6) for a choice of lattice parameters. Moreover, we can directly access topological loop operators, including the Fredenhagen-Marcu order parameter. We show how these can be measured experimentally using a dynamic protocol, providing a "smoking gun" experimental signature of the TQL phase. Finally, we show how to trap an emergent anyon and realize different topological boundary conditions, and we discuss the implications for exploring fault-tolerant quantum memories.

TI Engineering spin-spin interactions with optical tweezers in trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method for generating programmable interactions in one- and two-dimensional trapped-ion quantum simulators. Here we consider the use of optical tweezers to engineer the sound-wave spectrum of trapped ion crystals. We show that this approach allows us to tune the interactions and connectivity of the ion qubits beyond the power-law interactions accessible in current setups. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our proposal using realistic tweezer settings and experimentally relevant trap parameters to generate the optimal tweezer patterns to create target spin-spin interaction patterns in both one- and two-dimensional crystals. Our approach will advance quantum simulation in trapped-ion platforms as it allows them to realize a broader family of quantum spin Hamiltonians.

TI Optical coherence and spin population dynamics in 171Yb3+:Y2SiO5 single
   crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB 171Yb3+-doped Y2SiO5 (YSO) crystals are a promising platform for optical quantum memories in longdistance quantum communications. The relevance of this material lies in 171Yb long optical and spin coherence times, along with a large hyperfine splitting, enabling long quantum storage over large bandwidths. Mechanisms affecting the optical decoherence are, however, not precisely known, especially since low-temperature measurements have so far focused on the 2 to 4 K range. In this work, we performed two- and three-pulse photon echoes and spectral hole burning to determine optical homogeneous linewidths in two 171Yb:YSO crystals doped at 2 and 10 ppm. Experiments were performed in the 40 mK to 18 K temperature range, leading to linewidths between 320 Hz, among the narrowest reported for rare-earth ions, and several MHz. Our results show that above similar to 6 K, the homogeneous linewidth I'h is mainly due to an elastic two-phonon process which results in a slow broadening with temperature, with I'h reaching only 25 kHz at 10 K. At lower temperatures, interactions with 89Y nuclear spin flips, paramagnetic defects or impurities, and also Yb-Yb interactions for the higher concentrated crystal are likely the main limiting factor to Ph. In particular, we conclude that the direct effect of a spin and optical excited state lifetime is a minor contribution to optical decoherence in the whole temperature range that is studied. Our results indicate possible paths and regimes for further decreasing homogeneous linewidths or maintaining narrow lines at higher 171Yb concentration.

TI Perturbational Decomposition Analysis for Quantum Ising Model with Weak
   Transverse Fields
SO ENTROPY
AB This work presents a perturbational decomposition method for simulating quantum evolution under the one-dimensional Ising model with both longitudinal and transverse fields. By treating the transverse field terms as perturbations in the expansion, our approach is particularly effective in systems with moderate longitudinal fields and weak to moderate transverse fields relative to the coupling strength. Through systematic numerical exploration, we characterize parameter regimes and evolution time windows where the decomposition achieves measurable improvements over conventional Trotter decomposition methods. The developed perturbational approach and its characterized parameter space may provide practical guidance for choosing appropriate simulation strategies in different parameter regimes of the one-dimensional Ising model.

TI Geometric squeezing of rotating quantum gases into the lowest Landau
   level
SO COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE
AB The simulation of quantum Hall physics with rotating quantum gases is witnessing a revival due to recent experimental advances that enabled the observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate entirely contained in its lowest kinetic energy state, i.e. the lowest Landau level. We theoretically describe this experimental result, and show that it can be interpreted as a squeezing of the geometric degree of freedom of the problem, the guiding center metric. This "geometric squeezing" offers an unprecedented experimental control over the quantum geometry in Landau-level analogues, and at the same time opens a realistic path towards achieving correlated quantum phases akin to quantum Hall states with neutral atoms.

TI On-demand single-microwave-photon source in a superconducting circuit

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In this article, we propose a method for generating single microwave photons in superconducting circuits. We theoretically show that pure single microwave photons can be generated on demand and tuned over a large frequency band by making use of Landau-Zener transitions under a rapid sweep of a control parameter. We devise a protocol that enables fast control of the frequency of the emitted photon over two octaves, without requiring extensive calibration. Additionally, we make theoretical estimates of the generation efficiency, tunability, purity, and linewidth of the photons emitted using this method for both chargeand flux-qubit-based architectures. We also provide estimates of the optimal device parameters required for these architectures to realize the device.

TI Direct Calculation of ZZ Interaction Rates in Multimode Circuit
   Quantum Electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Hamiltonians of the superconducting qubits of transmon type involve nonzero ZZ interaction terms due to their finite and small anharmonicities. These terms might lead to the unwanted accumulation of spurious phases during the execution of the two-qubit gates. Exact calculation of the ZZ interaction rates requires the full diagonalization of the circuit Hamiltonians, which very quickly becomes computationally demanding as the number of the modes in the coupler circuit increases. Here we propose a direct analytical method for the accurate estimation of the ZZ interaction rates between low-anharmonicity qubits in the dispersive limit of the multimode circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED). We observe very good agreement between the predictions of our method and the measurement data collected from the multiqubit devices.

TI Certifying Multilevel Coherence in the Motional State of a Trapped Ion
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum coherence is the foundation of almost all departures from classical physics and is exhibited when a quantum system is in a superposition of different basis states. Here, the coherent superposition of three motional Fock states of a single trapped ion is experimentally certified, with a procedure that does not produce false positives. As the motional state cannot be directly interrogated, our scheme uses an interference pattern generated by projective measurement of the coupled qubit state. The minimum number of coherently superposed states is inferred from a series of threshold values based on analysis of the interference pattern. This demonstrates that high-level coherence can be verified and investigated with simple nonideal control methods that are well suited to noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Long-range magnetic dipole-dipole interaction mediated by a
   superconductor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computations and simulations require strong coherent coupling between qubits, which may be spatially separated. Achieving this coupling for solid-state-based spin qubits is a long-standing challenge. Here we theoretically investigate a method for achieving such a coupling, based on superconducting nanostructures designed to channel the magnetic flux created by the qubits. We detail semiclassical analytical calculations and simulations of the magnetic field created by a magnetic dipole, depicting the spin qubit, positioned directly below nanofabricated apertures in a superconducting layer. We show that such structures could channel the magnetic flux, enhancing the dipole-dipole interaction between spin qubits and changing its scaling with distance, thus potentially paving the way for controllably engineering an interacting spin system.

The proposed setup consists of four parts: multiple RFSoC boards, a setup to synchronize every digital to analog converter (DAC) and analog to digital converter (ADC) channel across multiple boards, a low-noise direct current supply for tuning the qubit frequency, and cloud access for remotely performing experiments. We also designed the setup to be free of physical mixers. The RFSoC boards directly generate microwave pulses using sixteen DAC channels up to the third Nyquist zone, which are directly sampled by its eight ADC channels between the fifth and the ninth zones.

TI Quantum state discrimination circuits inspired by Deutschian closed
   timelike curves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is known that a party with access to a Deutschian closed timelike curve (DCTC) can perfectly distinguish multiple nonorthogonal quantum states. In this paper we propose a practical method for discriminating multiple nonorthogonal states, by using a previously known quantum circuit designed to simulate DCTCs. This method relies on multiple copies of an input state, multiple iterations of the circuit, and a fixed set of unitary operations. We first characterize the performance of this circuit and study its asymptotic behavior. We also show how it can be equivalently recast as a local adaptive circuit that may be implemented simply in an experiment. Finally, we prove that our state discrimination strategy achieves the multiple Chernoff bound when discriminating an arbitrary set of pure qubit states.

TI Dirac quantum walk on tetrahedra
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Discrete-time quantum walks (QWs) are transportation models of single quantum particles over a lattice. Their evolution is driven through causal and local unitary operators. QWs are a powerful tool for quantum simulation of fundamental physics, as some of them have a continuum limit converging to well-known physics partial differential equations, such as the Dirac or the Schr & ouml;dinger equation. In this paper, we show how to recover the Dirac equation in (3 + 1) dimensions with a QW evolving in a tetrahedral space. This paves the way to simulate the Dirac equation on a curved space-time. This also suggests an ordered scheme for propagating matter over a spin network, of interest in loop quantum gravity, where matter propagation has remained an open problem.

Additionally, we discuss how the recently developed truncated Wigner approximation for open quantum systems can be applied to the same Hamiltonian. We benchmark the performance of both methods and identify the regimes where each method is best suited. Finally, we discuss strategies to improve each technique.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

AB We investigate signal propagation in a quantum field simulator of the Klein-Gordon model realized by two strongly coupled parallel one-dimensional quasi-condensates. By measuring local phononic fields after a quench, we observe the propagation of correlations along sharp light-cone fronts. If the local atomic density is inhomogeneous, these propagation fronts are curved. For sharp edges, the propagation fronts are reflected at the system's boundaries. By extracting the space-dependent variation of the front velocity from the data, we find agreement with theoretical predictions based on curved geodesics of an inhomogeneous metric. This work extends the range of quantum simulations of nonequilibrium field dynamics in general space-time metrics.

AB Motivated by quantum simulation, we consider lattice Hamiltonians for Yang-Mills gauge theories with finite gauge group, for example a finite subgroup of a compact Lie group. We show that the electric Hamiltonian admits an interpretation as a certain natural, nonunique Laplacian operator on the finite Abelian or non-Abelian group and derive some consequences from this fact. Independent of the chosen Hamiltonian, we provide a full explicit description of the physical, gauge-invariant Hilbert space for pure gauge theories and derive a simple formula to compute its dimension. We illustrate the use of the gauge-invariant basis to diagonalize a dihedral gauge theory on a small periodic lattice.

TI Equivalence between face nonsignaling correlations, full nonlocality,
   all-versus-nothing proofs, and pseudotelepathy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show that a quantum correlation p is in a face of the nonsignaling polytope with no local points if and only if p has nonlocal content 1, if and only if p allows for a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like proof, and if and only if p provides a perfect strategy for a nonlocal game. That is, face nonsignaling (FNS) correlations, full nonlocality (FN), all-versus-nothing (AVN) proofs, and pseudotelepathy (PT) are equivalent. This shows that different resources behind a wide variety of fundamental results are in fact the same resource. We demonstrate that quantum correlations with FNS = FN = AVN = PT do not need to maximally violate a tight Bell inequality. We introduce a method for identifying quantum FNS = FN = AVN = PT correlations and use it to prove quantum mechanics does not allow for FNS = FN = AVN = PT neither in the (3, 3; 3, 2) nor in the (3, 2; 3, 4) Bell scenarios. This solves an open problem that, because of the FNS = FN = AVN = PT equivalence, has implications in several fields.

TI Device-independent witness for the nonobjectivity of quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum Darwinism offers an explanation for the emergence of classical objective features (those we are used to at macroscopic scales) from quantum properties at the microscopic level. The interaction of a quantum system with its surroundings redundantly proliferates information to many parts of the environment, turning it accessible and objective to different observers. However, given that one cannot probe the quantum system directly, only its environment, how to determine whether an unknown quantum property can be deemed objective? Here we propose a probabilistic framework to analyze this question and show that objectivity implies a Bell-like inequality. Among several other results, we show quantum violations of this inequality, a device-independent proof of the nonobjectivity of quantum correlations. We also implement a photonic experiment where the temporal degree of freedom of photons is the quantum system of interest, while their polarization acts as the environment. Employing a fully black-box approach, we achieve the violation of a Bell-like inequality, thus certifying the nonobjectivity of the underlying quantum dynamics in a fully device-independent framework.

TI Fast, high precision dynamics in quantum optimal control theory
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum optimal control theory is becoming increasingly crucial as quantum devices become more precise, but the need to quickly optimize these systems classically remains a significant bottleneck in their operation. Here we present a new theoretical quantum control framework for much faster optimization than the state of the art by replacing standard time propagation with a product of short-time propagators, each calculated using the Magnus expansion. The derived formulas for exact series terms and their gradients, based on earlier approximate integrals in a simulation setting, allow us to subsume the high cost of calculating commutators and integrals as an initial overhead. This provides an order of magnitude speedup for quantum control optimization.

TI Experimental generation of 9.1 dB HG10 mode squeezed light
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The high-order Hermite-Gaussian (HG) mode squeezed light, as one of the important quantum sources, has significant application in quantum precision measurement and quantum imaging. The enhancement of spatial measurement precision largely depends on the squeezing level of high-order HG-mode quantum states. However, the squeezing level of high-order HG modes is primarily limited by the external pump power in the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) cavity. As is well known, the OPO with dual resonance for both squeezed light and pump light can lower external pump power. The generation of HG(10) mode squeezed light differs from that of HG(00) mode squeezed light, with an additional Gouy phase shift introduced between the HG(20 )pump mode and HG(10) down-conversion mode within the OPO cavity. In this work, we conduct theoretical analysis and experimental generation of HG(10) mode squeezed light at lower external pump power by using a doubly-resonant OPO based on a wedged periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal. By precisely controlling both the propagation length of the optical field and temperature in the wedged PPKTP crystal, we simultaneously compensate for the Gouy phase shift between the HG(20 )and HG(10) modes and the astigmatism induced by the frequency-dependent refractive index. This configuration allows for dual resonance of the HG(20) pump mode and the HG10 squeezed mode, while operating under the condition close to optimal phase matching. Increasing the reflectivity of the input coupler of OPO cavity enhances the intra-cavity circulating power of the pump light, thereby reducing the required external pump power. Here, the bow-tie-shaped OPO cavity consists of two plane mirrors and two concave mirrors with a curvature radius of 50 mm. The wedged PPKTP is placed in the smallest beam waist of the cavity. The mode converter is employed to generate high-purity HG(20 ) pump mode with a measured purity of 98.0%. The mode-matching effciency of 93.0% is achieved between the high-purity HG(20 ) pump mode and the OPO cavity. The homodyne visibility of the HG(10)mode is 98.1%. We experimentally demonstrate the generation of 9.10 dB HG(10) mode squeezed light by using a doubly-resonant OPO with only 51 mW of HG(20 ) pump mode, and simultaneously achieve 9.20 dB of squeezing in the HG(00) mode with 27 mW of HG(00) pump mode. The inferred squeezing levels of both HG(10) mode and HG(00) mode squeezed light both reach up to 12.15 dB. The quantum technology has solved the pump power limitations in optical parametric oscillators, generating high-order HG mode states with high squeezing level and providing an effective method for enhancing spatial measurement precision.

AB The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN will involve a significant increase in complexity and sheer size of data with respect to the current LHC experimental complex. Hence, the task of reconstructing the particle trajectories will become more involved due to the number of simultaneous collisions and the resulting increased detector occupancy. Aiming to identify the particle paths, machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks are being explored in the HEP. TrkX project and its successor, the Exa. TrkX project. Both show promising results and reduce the combinatorial nature of the problem. Previous results of our team have demonstrated the successful attempt of applying quantum graph neural networks to reconstruct the particle track based on the hits of the detector. A higher overall accuracy is gained by representing the training data in a meaningful way within an embedded space. That has been included in the Exa. TrkX project by applying a classical MLP. Consequently, pairs of hits belonging to different trajectories are pushed apart while those belonging to the same ones stay close together. We explore the applicability of variational quantum circuits that include a relatively low number of qubits applicable to NISQ devices within the task of embedding and show preliminary results.

TI Complexity measures in QFT and constrained geometric actions
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the conditions under which, given a generic quantum system, complexity metrics provide actual lower bounds to the circuit complexity associated to a set of quantum gates. Inhomogeneous cost functions - many examples of which have been recently proposed in the literature - are ruled out by our analysis. Such measures are shown to be unrelated to circuit complexity in general and to produce severe violations of Lloyd's bound in simple situations. Among the metrics which do provide lower bounds, the idea is to select those which produce the tightest possible ones. This establishes a hierarchy of cost functions and considerably reduces the list of candidate complexity measures. In particular, the criterion suggests a canonical way of dealing with penalties, consisting in assigning infinite costs to directions not belonging to the gate set. We discuss how this can be implemented through the use of Lagrange multipliers. We argue that one of the surviving cost functions defines a particularly canonical notion in the sense that: i) it straightforwardly follows from the standard Hermitian metric in Hilbert space; ii) its associated complexity functional is closely related to Kirillov's coadjoint orbit action, providing an explicit realization of the "complexity equals action" idea; iii) it arises from a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the "quantum action" describing quantum dynamics in the phase space canonically associated to every Hilbert space. Finally, we explain how these structures provide a natural framework for characterizing chaos in classical and quantum systems on an equal footing, find the minimal geodesic connecting two nearby trajectories, and describe how complexity measures are sensitive to Lyapunov exponents.

TI Multiple wavelength frequency stabilization with a single transfer
   cavity for mercury optical lattice clock
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB A simple and robust multiple wavelength frequency stabilization system is demonstrated using a single transfer cavity and a 1062-nm ultra-stable laser for all the lasers used in a mercury optical lattice clock. Offset sideband locking is employed to tune the laser frequency while dichroic mirrors and differentiated modulation frequencies are utilized for the Pound- Drever-Hall locking of four-color lasers. For the most demanding lasers at 1015 nm and 725 nm, the line width of the beat note is reduced to 27 kHz and 17 kHz, respectively. The frequency fluctuation for the transfer-locked 1015-nm laser is less than 10 kHz, which is much better than the lasers locked to an atomic spectrum. Using its high stability of 5 x 10(-12) over 100 s, the transfer-locked 1015-nm laser is employed for low-noise frequency modulated saturated absorption spectroscopy. This approach could also be used in various situations for the research of optical clocks, Rydberg atoms, laser cooling of molecules, and quantum computation with neutral atoms.

TI Tunable even- and odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in
   trilayer graphene
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are exotic quantum many-body phases whose elementary charged excitations are anyons obeying fractional braiding statistics. While most FQH states are believed to have Abelian anyons, the Moore-Read type states with even denominators - appearing at half filling of a Landau level (LL) - are predicted to possess non-Abelian excitations with appealing potential in topological quantum computation. These states, however, depend sensitively on the orbital contents of the single-particle LL wavefunctions and the LL mixing. Here we report magnetotransport measurements on Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene, whose multiband structure facilitates interlaced LL mixing, which can be controlled by external magnetic and displacement fields. We observe robust FQH states including even-denominator ones at filling factors nu = - 9/2, - 3/2, 3/2 and 9/2. In addition, we fine-tune the LL mixing and crossings to drive quantum phase transitions of these half-filling states and neighbouring odd-denominator ones, exhibiting related emerging and waning behaviour.
   The fractional quantum Hall effect offers a potential platform to harness non-Abelian anyons. Here, the authors report fractional quantum Hall states in trilayer graphene and drive quantum phase transitions between neighbouring states.

TI Interaction-induced topological phase transition and Majorana edge
   states in low-dimensional orbital-selective Mott insulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Topological phases of matter are among the most intriguing research directions in Condensed Matter Physics. It is known that superconductivity induced on a topological insulator's surface can lead to exotic Majorana modes, the main ingredient of many proposed quantum computation schemes. In this context, the iron-based high critical temperature superconductors are a promising platform to host such an exotic phenomenon in real condensed-matter compounds. The Coulomb interaction is commonly believed to be vital for the magnetic and superconducting properties of these systems. This work bridges these two perspectives and shows that the Coulomb interaction can also drive a canonical superconductor with orbital degrees of freedom into the topological state. Namely, we show that above a critical value of the Hubbard interaction the system simultaneously develops spiral spin order, a highly unusual triplet amplitude in superconductivity, and, remarkably, Majorana fermions at the edges of the system. Superconductivity induced on a topological insulator's surface may realize Majorana modes. Here, Herbrych et al. predict that a large Coulomb interaction helps develop a spiral spin order, which is a topological state at the edge of a canonical superconductor with orbital degrees of freedom.

TI Second Chern crystals with inherently non-trivial topology
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Chern insulators have been generalized to many classical wave systems and thereby lead to many potential applications such as robust waveguides, quantum computation and high-performance lasers. However, the band structure of a material can be either topologically trivial or non-trivial, depending on how the crystal structure is designed. Here, we propose a second Chern crystal in a four-dimensional parameter space by introducing two extra synthetic translation dimensions. Since the topology of the bulk bands in the synthetic translation space is intrinsically non-trivial, our proposed four-dimensional crystal is guaranteed to be topologically non-trivial regardless of the crystal's detailed configuration. We derive the topologically protected modes on the lower dimensional boundaries of such a crystal via dimension reduction. Remarkably, we observe the one-dimensional gapless dislocation modes and confirm their robustness in experiments. Our findings provide novel perspectives on topologically non-trivial crystals and may inspire designs of classical wave devices.
   Featuring with the gapless dislocation and corner modes, second Chern crystals with inherently nontrivial topology were demonstrated in the four-dimensional space with the introduction of synthetic translation dimension.

TI Topological nonlinear optics with spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein
   condensate in cavity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We investigate topological nonlinear optics with spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate in a cavity. The cavity is driven by a pump laser and a weak probe laser. Both lasers excite Bose-Einstein condensate, in the presence of standard Raman process for spin-orbit coupling, to an intermediate storage level. We theoretically show that the quantum interference at the transitional pathways of dressed atomic states results in different types of optical transparencies, which get completely inverted in atomic damping induced gain regime. The synthetic pseudo-spin states also implant different phases in the probe field forcing modes in probe transparencies to form gapless Dirac cones, which become gapped in presence of Raman detuning. These features get interestingly enhanced in gain regime where the amplified part of probe transparencies appear as gapless topological edge-like states between the probe bulk modes and cause non-trivial phase transition. We illustrate that the nonlinear interactions of the pseudo-spin states also enhance the slow light features in probe transmission. The manipulation of dressed states for topological optical transparencies in our findings could be a crucial step towards topological photonics and their application in quantum computation.

TI Uninformed Bayesian quantum thermometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the Bayesian approach to thermometry with no prior knowledge about the expected temperature scale, through the example of energy measurements on fully or partially thermalized qubit probes. We show that the most common Bayesian estimators, namely the mean and the median, lead to high-temperature divergences when used for uninformed thermometry. To circumvent this and achieve better overall accuracy, we propose two new estimators based on an optimization of relative deviations. Their global temperature-averaged behavior matches a modified van Trees bound, which complements the Cramer-Rao bound for smaller probe numbers and unrestricted temperature ranges. Furthermore, we show that, using partially thermalized probes, one can increase the range of temperatures to which the thermometer is sensitive at the cost of the local accuracy.

TI Hierarchical Self-Assembly and Conformation of Tb Double-Decker
   Molecular Magnets: Experiment and Molecular Dynamics
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Nanostructures, fabricated by locating molecular building blocks in well-defined positions, for example, on a lattice, are ideal platforms for studying atomic-scale quantum effects. In this context, STM data obtained from self-assembled Bis(phthalocyaninato) Terbium (III) (TbPc2) single-molecule magnets on various substrates have raised questions about the conformation of the TbPc2 molecules within the lattice. In order to address this issue, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a 2D assembly of TbPc2 molecules. The calculations are in excellent agreement with the experiment, and thus improve our understanding of the self-assembly process. In particular, the calculated electron density of the molecular assembly compares well with STM contrast of self-assembled TbPc2 on Au(111), simultaneously providing the conformation of the two Pc ligands of the individual double-decker molecule. This approach proves valuable in the identification of the STM contrast of LnPc(2) layers and could be used in similar cases where it is difficult to interpret the STM images of an assembly of molecular complexes.

TI Probing Topological Entanglement on Large Scales
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Topologically ordered quantum matter exhibits intriguing long-range patterns of entanglement, which reveal themselves in subsystem entropies. However, measuring such entropies, which can be used to certify topological order, on large partitions is challenging and becomes practically unfeasible for large systems. We propose a protocol based on local adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian which extracts the universal features of long-range topological entanglement from measurements on small subsystems of finite size, trading an exponential number of measurements against a polynomial-time evolution. Our protocol is general and readily applicable to various quantum simulation architectures. We apply our method to various string-net models representing both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases and illustrate its application to neutral atom tweezer arrays with numerical simulations.

TI Atom-Mediated Deterministic Generation and Stitching of Photonic Graph
   States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Highly entangled multiphoton graph states are a crucial resource in photonic quantum computation and communication. Yet, the lack of photon-photon interactions makes the construction of such graph states especially challenging. Typically, these states are produced through probabilistic single-photon sources and linear-optics entangling operations that require indistinguishable photons. The resulting inefficiency of these methods necessitates a large overhead in the number of sources and operations, creating a major bottleneck in the photonic approach. Here, we show how harnessing single-atom-based photonic operations can enable deterministic generation of photonic graph states, while also lifting the requirement for photon indistinguishability. To this end, we introduce a multigate quantum node comprising a single atom in a W-type level scheme coupled to an optical resonator. This configuration provides a versatile toolbox for generating graph states, allowing the operation of both the controlled-Z and SWAP photon-atom gates, as well as the deterministic generation of single photons. Furthermore, the ability to deterministically entangle photonic qubits enables the expansion of the generated state by stitching together graph states produced by different nodes. We investigate the implementation of this gate-based approach using 87Rb atoms and evaluate its performance through numerical simulations.

TI Exploration of growth conditions of TaAs Weyl semimetal thin film using
   pulsed laser deposition
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB TaAs, the first experimentally discovered Weyl semimetal material, has attracted a lot of attention due to its high carrier mobility, high anisotropy, nonmagnetic properties and strong interaction with light. These make it an ideal candidate for the study of Weyl fermions and applications in quantum computation, thermoelectric devices, and photodetection. For further basic physics studies and potential applications, large-size and high-quality TaAs films are urgently needed. However, it is difficult to grow As-stoichiometry TaAs films due to the volatilization of As during the growth. To solve this problem, we attempted to grow TaAs films on different substrates using targets with different As stoichiometric ratios via pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In this work, we found that partial As ions of the GaAs substrate are likely to diffuse into the TaAs films during growth, which was preliminarily confirmed by structural characterization, surface topography and composition analysis. As a result, the As content in the TaAs film was improved and the TaAs phase was achieved. Our work presents an effective method for the fabrication of TaAs films using PLD, enabling possible use of the Weyl semimetal film for functional devices.

TI Passive verification protocol for thermal graph states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Graph states are entangled resource states for universal measurement-based quantum computation. Although matter qubits such as superconducting circuits and trapped ions are promising candidates to generate graph states, it is technologically hard to entangle a large number of them due to several types of noise. Since they must be sufficiently cooled to maintain their quantum properties, thermal noise is one of the major ones. In this paper, we show that, for any temperature T, the fidelity (G|pT |G) between an ideal graph state |G) at zero temperature and a thermal graph state pT , which is a graph state at temperature T, can be efficiently estimated by using only one measurement setting. A remarkable property of our protocol is that it is passive, while existing protocols are active, namely, they switch between at least two measurement settings. Since thermal noise is equivalent to an independent phase-flip error, our estimation protocol also works for that error. By generalizing our protocol to hypergraph states, we apply our protocol to the quantum-computational-supremacy demonstration with instantaneous quantum polynomial time circuits. Our results should make the characterization of entangled matter qubits extremely feasible under thermal noise.

TI 0D-2D heterostructure for making very large quantum registers using
   'itinerant' Bose-Einstein condensate of excitons
SO MATERIALS TODAY ELECTRONICS
AB Presence of coherent 'resonant' tunneling in quantum dot (zero -dimensional) - quantum well (two-dimensional) heterostructure is necessary to explain the collective oscillations of average electrical polarization of excitonic dipoles over a macroscopically large area. This was measured using photo excited capacitance as a function of applied voltage bias. Resonant tunneling in this heterostructure definitely requires momentum space narrowing of charge carriers inside the quantum well and that of associated indirect excitons, which indicates bias dependent 'itinerant' Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons. Observation of periodic variations in negative quantum capacitance points to in -plane coulomb correlations mediated by long range spatial ordering of indirect, dipolar excitons. Enhanced contrast of quantum interference beats of excitonic polarization waves even under white light and observed Rabi oscillations over a macroscopically large area also support the presence of density driven excitonic condensation having long range order. Periodic presence (absence) of splitting of excitonic peaks in photocapacitance spectra even demonstrate collective coupling (decoupling) between energy levels of the quantum well and quantum dots with applied biases, which can potentially be used for quantum gate operations. All these observations point to experimental control of macroscopically large, quantum state of a two -component Bose-Einstein condensate of excitons in this quantum dot - quantum well heterostructure. Therefore, in principle, millions of two -level excitonic qubits can be intertwined to fabricate large quantum registers using such hybrid heterostructure by controlling the local electric fields and also by varying photoexcitation intensities of overlapping light spots.

TI Almost gauge-invariant states and the ground state of Yang-Mills theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We consider the problem of the explicit description of the gauge-invariant subspace of pure lattice gauge theories in the Hamiltonian formulation, where the gauge group is either a compact Lie group or a finite group. The latter case is particularly interesting for quantum simulation. A basis of states where configurations are grouped according to their holonomies is shown to have several advantages over other descriptions. Using this basis, we compute some properties of interest for some non-Abelian finite groups on small lattices, and in particular we examine the question of whether a certain ansatz introduced long ago is a good approximation for the ground state.

AB Model compression, such as pruning and quantization, has been widely applied to optimize neural networks on resource-limited classical devices. Recently, there are growing interest in variational quantum circuits (VQC), that is, a type of neural network on quantum computers (a.k.a., quantum neural networks). It is well known that the near-term quantum devices have high noise and limited resources (i.e., quantum bits, qubits); yet, how to compress quantum neural networks has not been thoroughly studied. One might think it is straightforward to apply the classical compression techniques to quantum scenarios. However, this paper reveals that there exist differences between the compression of quantum and classical neural networks. Based on our observations, we claim that the compilation/traspilation has to be involved in the compression process. On top of this, we propose the very first systematical framework, namely CompVQC, to compress quantum neural networks (QNNs). In CompVQC, the key component is a novel compression algorithm, which is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of the CompVQC, reducing the circuit depth (almost over 2.5x) with a negligible accuracy drop (<1%), which outperforms other competitors. Another promising truth is our CompVQC can indeed promote the robustness of the QNN on the near-term noisy quantum devices.

AB The Lipkin and Agassi models are simplified nuclear models that provide natural test beds for quantum simulation methods. Prior work has investigated the suitability of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to find the ground state of these models. There is a growing awareness that if VQE is to prove viable, we will need problem inspired ans & auml;tze that take into account the symmetry properties of the problem and use clever initialisation strategies. Here, by focusing on the Lipkin and Agassi models, we investigate how to do this in the context of nuclear physics ground state problems. We further use our observations to discus the potential of new classical, but quantum-inspired, approaches to learning ground states in nuclear problems.

TI Quantum Variational Learning of the Entanglement Hamiltonian
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Learning the structure of the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) is central to characterizing quantum many body states in analog quantum simulation. We describe a protocol where spatial deformations of the many body Hamiltonian, physically realized on the quantum device, serve as an efficient variational ansatz for a local EH. Optimal variational parameters are determined in a feedback loop, involving quench dynamics with the deformed Hamiltonian as a quantum processing step, and classical optimization. We simulate the protocol for the ground state of Fermi-Hubbard models in quasi-1D geometries, finding excellent agreement of the EH with Bisognano-Wichmann predictions. Subsequent on-device spectroscopy enables a direct measurement of the entanglement spectrum, which we illustrate for a Fermi Hubbard model in a topological phase.

TI Semi-quantum mutual identity authentication using single particles
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Identity authentication plays a critical role in safeguarding communication information. In this study, we propose a semi- quantum mutual identity authentication protocol that leverages single particles as resources, significantly reducing quantum resource usage as well as system complexity and operational difficulty. The protocol operates without third- party involvement, simplifying the structure and enabling mutual authentication between quantum and classical participants through straightforward single-qubit measurement and reordering operations. Additionally, if the authentication process fails, the protocol can immediately identify which participant's identity is unauthorized, thereby enhancing security. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can defend against impersonation attacks, intercept-measure-resend attacks, entangle-measure attacks, and Trojan horse attacks. Compared to existing protocols, our protocol offers advantages in practicality.

TI Entropic characterization of stabilizer states and magic states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum states with minimum or maximum uncertainty are of special significance due to their extreme properties. Celebrated examples are coherent states induced from certain Lie groups and intelligent states for various uncertainty relations. In this work, by virtue of the Maassen-Uffink entropic uncertainty relation, we introduce an entropic quantifier of uncertainty and use it to characterize several important families of states in the stabilizer formalism of quantum computation. More specifically, we show that the stabilizer states and T-type magic states stand at the two extremes of the entropic quantifier of uncertainty: The former are precisely the minimum entropic uncertainty states, while the latter are precisely the maximum entropic uncertainty states. Moreover, interpolating between the above two extremes, the H-type magic states are the saddle points of the entropic quantifier of uncertainty. These entropic characterizations reveal some intrinsic features of stabilizer states, H- and T-type magic states, and cast novel light on the resource-theoretic viewpoint of regarding the stabilizer states as free states and the T-type magic states as the most precious source states in the stabilizer quantum theory.

TI Current density of Majorana bound states
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB It is known that a non-local complex fermion can be written in terms of two Majorana fermions. We exploit this fact to explain the system of two Majorana zero modes bound to a vortex and an antivortex, on the surface of a topological insulator in contact with an s-wave superconductor, as a nonlocal complex fermion. Although the current density of a single zero mode vanishes, by starting with a wave packet consisted of the positive and negative energy complex fermions, we specify that a timedependent oscillatory motion emerges in the system. We also show that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations depend on the relative distance of those two zero modes. Therefore, the observation of this oscillatory motion can be considered as a signature of the Majorana zero modes. Also, as the frequency of such an oscillatory motion depends on the distance between the two zero modes, it can be adjusted to bring this frequency within the resolution of observations. Furthermore, we indicate that the predicted oscillatory current is the reminiscent of the zitterbewegung effect.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Long-distance strong coupling of magnon and photon: Effect of multi-mode
   waveguide
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB Coupled mode theory predicts that the long-distance coupling between two distant harmonic oscillators is in the weak coupling regime. However, a recent experimental measurement observed strong coupling of magnon and critically-driven photon with a distance of over two meters. To explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment, we study long-distance coupling of magnon and photon mediated by a multi-mode waveguide. Our results show that strong coupling is achieved only when both critical coupling and multi-mode waveguide are involved. The former reduces the damping while the latter enhances the coupling strength by increasing the pathways of coupling magnon and photon. Our theory and results pave the way for understanding the long-distance coherence and designing the magnon-based distributed quantum networks.

TI Hole spin qubits in unstrained Germanium layers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Strained germanium heterostructures are one of the most promising material for hole spin qubits but suffer from the strong anisotropy of the gyromagnetic factors that hinders the optimization of the magnetic field orientation. The figures of merit (Rabi frequencies, lifetimes & mldr;) can indeed vary by an order of magnitude within a few degrees around the heterostructure plane. We propose to address this issue by confining the holes at the interface of an unstrained, bulk Ge substrate or thick buffer. We model such structures and show that the gyromagnetic anisotropy is indeed considerably reduced. In addition, the Rabi frequencies and quality factors can be significantly improved with respect to strained heterostructures. This extends the operational range of the qubits and shall ease the scale-up to many-qubit systems.

SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Shadow evaporation is commonly used to micro-fabricate the key element of superconducting qubits-the Josephson junction. However, in conventional two-angle deposition circuit topology, unwanted stray Josephson junctions are created which contribute to dielectric loss. So far, this could be avoided by shorting the stray junctions with a so-called bandage layer deposited in an additional lithography step, which may further contaminate the chip surface. Here, we present an improved shadow evaporation technique allowing one to fabricate sub-micrometer-sized Josephson junctions together with bandage layers in a single lithography step. We also show that junction aging is significantly reduced when junction electrodes are passivated in an oxygen atmosphere directly after deposition.

Compared with previous protocols, our method saves the rearrangement time by sorting row-by-row and is also universal to arbitrary periodic patterns with no need to change the hardware. We present the generation of a defect-free square and other periodic geometries and demonstrate the potential to scale up a defect-free array to 2500 atoms with only about 180 steps of rearrangement.

TI Systematic nonuniform field effects in miniature atomic co-magnetometers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Wafer-fabricated vapor cells are essential components in the development of scalable, field-deployable atomic sensing systems, including atomic spin gyroscopes (ASGs). This paper presents a systematic study of magnetic resonance spectra obtained in a two-chamber, millimeter-sized, wafer-fabricated cell containing Cs, 129Xe, 131Xe, and N2 buffer gas. For a range of vapor temperatures and pump powers, we identify characteristic structural and dynamical effects, including electric quadrupole splitting of the 131Xe frequency and spectral branching of the 129Xe frequency and linewidth as the signature of a parity-time symmetry-broken phase. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a primary class of systematic nonuniform field effects can be reduced to a simple one-dimensional linear gradient. We leverage these effects to offer regimes of optimized and robust sensor operation, setting a benchmark for the performance of wafer-fabricated vapor cells in both ASGs and more broad quantum technologies.

TI CdTe0.25Se0.75 Quantum Dots Showed Efficient
   Room-Temperature Single Photon Emission
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Room-temperature single photon sources (SPS) are crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies. Quantum dots (QDs) have recently been reported as promising materials for SPS at room temperature. Our study highlights a new mechanism to enhance single photon emission through trap state-assisted enhancement in single photon emission purity by optimizing the single particle optical properties of a series of water-soluble CdTe x Se1-x QDs. We achieved an efficient SPS in CdTe0.25Se0.75 QDs with a second-order photon correlation value (g2(0)) as low as 0.02. They also exhibited deterministic emissions, with some QDs exhibiting ON time exceeding 95% of the total time. This was accompanied by an increased photon count rate, substantially reduced blinking events, and extended single particle ON-time. The increased single photon emission with enhanced ON time is attributed to simultaneous electron and hole trapping to dense trap states, which encourages the single photon emission for a long time.

TI Planar Hall supercurrent and 5¢-shift in the topological
   Josephson junction
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB We theoretically investigate Josephson junctions comprising superconductors and ferromagnets on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators. We use Bogoliubov-deGennes formalism and show the in-plane magnetization creates a difference between the upward and downward population of Andreev modes and produces a planar Hall supercurrent. Due to the strong spin-orbit interaction of Dirac fermions, bending on the supercurrent imposes a spin transfer torque on the junction. We develop a theory and demonstrate the relation between planar Hall supercurrent and spin transfer torque. The parallel component of in-plane magnetization creates an anomalous supercurrent that can flow even in zero superconducting phase difference and make 5 cent-junction. We show in some range, 2r/2d <= mY <= 2r/d, there is a 2r shift in the Josephson supercurrent. This research advances our understanding of quantum transport in 3DTIs and highlights their potential in emerging quantum technologies.

TI Hot electron driven structural expansion and magnetic collapse in
   bilayer FeSe
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum phenomena emerging from the interaction of light and matter in low-dimensional systems hold great potential for future quantum technologies. Here using finite-temperature density functional calculations incorporating nonlocal van der Waals interactions and Hubbard corrections, we report simultaneous structural expansion and magnetic collapse in bilayer FeSe induced by photoexcited hot electrons. Our calculations reveal that, while bulk FeSe is nonmagnetic, as observed experimentally, double-layer FeSe exhibits robust staggered antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures with a net site magnetization of similar to 2.75 mu B/Fe. Increasing the density of photoexcited electrons systematically enhances the internal electronic entropy, leading to a complete collapse of the antiferromagnetic order accompanied by an abrupt expansion of the interlayer separation. Our findings suggest the structural and magnetic properties of FeSe thin films can be finely tuned via ultrafast laser excitation, offering a pathway to control quantum phases in iron-based compounds through electronic temperature.

TI Fourier transform noise spectroscopy
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spectral characterization of noise environments that lead to the decoherence of qubits is critical to developing robust quantum technologies. While dynamical decoupling offers one of the most successful approaches to characterize noise spectra, it necessitates applying large sequences of pi pulses that increase the complexity and cost of the method. Here, we introduce a noise spectroscopy method that utilizes only the Fourier transform of free induction decay or spin echo measurements, thus removing the need for the application many pi pulses. We show that our method faithfully recovers the correct noise spectra for a variety of different environments (including 1/f-type noise) and outperforms previous dynamical decoupling schemes while significantly reducing their experimental overhead. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of our proposal and demonstrate its robustness in the presence of statistical measurement error. Our method is applicable to a wide range of quantum platforms and provides a simpler path toward a more accurate spectral characterization of quantum devices, thus offering possibilities for tailored decoherence mitigation.

TI Generation of entangled waveguided photon pairs by free electrons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Entangled photons are a key resource in quantum technologies. While intense laser light propagating in nonlinear crystals is conventionally used to generate entangled photons, such schemes have low efficiency due to the weak nonlinear response of known materials and losses associated with in/out photon coupling. Here, we show how to generate entangled polariton pairs directly within optical waveguides using free electrons. The measured energy loss of undeflected electrons heralds the production of counter-propagating polariton pairs entangled in energy and emission direction. For illustration, we study the excitation of plasmon polaritons in metal strip waveguides that strongly enhance light-matter interactions, rendering two-plasmon generation dominant over single-plasmon excitation. We demonstrate that electron energy losses detected within optimal frequency ranges can reliably signal the generation of plasmon pairs entangled in energy and momentum. Our proposed scheme is directly applicable to other types of optical waveguides for in situ generation of entangled photon pairs.

TI Next-Generation Smart Grid Cybersecurity: A Systematic Review of OT
   Cyber Threats, AI-Driven Defense, Cyber Deception Techniques, and
   Emerging Security Strategies
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The swift modernization of conventional power grids into smart grids has substantially increased their attack surface, making them vulnerable to advanced cyber threats. These cyberattacks can jeopardize the seamless operation of a smart grid, leading to significant economic losses and potential malicious control. Securing these infrastructures is now of paramount importance to ensure their resilience and optimal performance. Existing studies often tackle security issues separately without considering the complexity of Operational Technology systems, requiring advanced strategies for threat detection and mitigation. To bridge this gap, this study aims to systematically review recent research in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to examine the role of Artificial Intelligence, Edge Computing, Digital Twin technology, 5G/6G, Software-Defined Networking, Cyber Deception, and Blockchain in enhancing smart grid cybersecurity. This study demonstrates that Artificial Intelligence improves anomaly detection, while Edge Computing reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and accelerates threat mitigation. Furthermore, Digital Twin technology enables continuous simulations of real-world attacks and defense scenarios. The convergence of 5G/6G and Software-Defined Networking enhances network flexibility and scalability, while Zero Trust and Blockchain provide secure, decentralized frameworks and enhance data integrity. Meanwhile, Cyber Deception strengthens defenses by misleading attackers. This research sheds light on key opportunities for future studies, focusing on the development of AI-driven testbeds, Digital Twin simulations, and the integration of Quantum Machine Learning for sophisticated threat analysis. Additionally, the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence can foster trust in automated decisions. Tackling these challenges is essential for strengthening the resilience of smart grids against evolving cyber threats.

TI Bright multiplexed source of indistinguishable single photons with
   tunable GHz-bandwidth at room temperature
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Narrowband single photons that couple well to atomic ensembles could prove essential for future quantum networks, but the efficient generation of such photons remains an outstanding challenge. We realize a spatially-multiplexed heralded source of single photons that are inherently compatible with the commonly employed D2 line of rubidium. Our source is based on four-wave mixing in hot rubidium vapor, requiring no laser cooling or optical cavities, and generates single photons with high rate and low noise. We use Hong-Ou-Mandel interference to verify the indistinguishability of the photons generated in two different (multiplexed) channels. We further demonstrate a five-fold tunability of the photons' temporal width. The experimental results are well reproduced by a theoretical model.

TI Nonreciprocal Dissipation Engineering via Strong Coupling with a
   Continuum of Modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Optical nonreciprocity plays a key role in almost every optical system, directing light flow and protecting optical components from backscattered light. Controllable forms of on-chip nonreciprocity are needed for the robust operation of increasingly sophisticated photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the context of classical and quantum computation, networking, communications, and sensing. However, it has been challenging to achieve wideband, low-loss optical nonreciprocity on-chip. In this paper, we demonstrate strong coupling and Rabi-like energy exchange between photonic bands, possessing a continuum of modes, to unlock nonreciprocity and frequency translation over wide optical bandwidths in silicon. Using a traveling-wave phonon field to drive indirect interband photonic transitions, we demonstrate band hybridization that enables an intriguing form of nonreciprocal dissipation engineering. Using the converted mode to create a nonreciprocal dissipation channel, we demonstrate a frequency-neutral, low-loss (less than 1 dB) isolator with high nonreciprocal contrast (more than 14 dB) and broad operating bandwidth (more than 59 GHz). Additionally, through the implementation of complete interband conversion, we demonstrate a high extinction (more than 55 dB) optical frequency translation operation with near-unity efficiency.

TI Insights into the Stability and Surface Termination of Topological
   Semimetal NbAs2
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB NbAs2, a topological semimetal, has stirred considerable interest for its potential usage in magnetic and fault-tolerant quantum computation superconductor devices, owing to its superconductivity, enormous magnetoresistance, and anisotropic magneto-transport attributes. Yet, its environmental stability, a crucial factor for practical applications, remains largely unexplored. Herein, a comprehensive examination of the stability and electronic properties of the (001) surface of NbAs2 utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and surface science experiments is conducted. The theoretical deductions reveal that As atoms, organized in a buckled honeycomb configuration, terminate the bare (001) surface, akin to the tensile blue arsenene monolayer along the armchair direction. This study further demonstrates that the oxidation barrier is particularly low (only 0.2 eV), highlighting that the (001) surface is highly prone to oxidation under standard conditions, forming a As2O5+Nb2O5/NbAs2 heterostructure. Additionally, it observes that oxidation adversely affects the electronic characteristics of the topological semimetal NbAs2. The conclusions underscore the need for NbAs2 to be managed under high vacuum conditions or to be encapsulated for any usage in the ambient atmosphere in order to retain its electronic properties for practical purposes.

TI Fractional magnetoresistance oscillations in spin-triplet
   superconducting rings
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Despite many candidates for spin-triplet superconductivity so far, no definitive evidence has been produced. This study proposes a signature, related to the flux quantisation, that could be used to identify spin-triplet superconductors in mesoscopic rings via the magnetoresistance oscillations.
   Half-quantum vortices in spin-triplet superconductors are predicted to host Majorana zero modes and may provide a viable platform for topological quantum computation. Recent works also suggested that, in thin mesoscopic rings, the superconducting pairing symmetry can be probed via Little-Parks-like magnetoresistance oscillations of periodicity phi(0) = h/2e that persist below the critical temperature. Here we use the London limit of Ginzburg-Landau theory to study these magnetoresistance oscillations resulting from thermal vortex tunneling in spin-triplet superconducting rings. For a range of temperatures in the presence of disorder, we find magnetoresistance oscillations with an emergent fractional periodicity phi(0)/n, where the integer n >= 3 is entirely determined by the ratio of the spin and charge superfluid densities. These fractional oscillations can unambiguously confirm the spin-triplet nature of superconductivity and directly reveal the tunneling of half-quantum vortices in real-world candidate materials.

TI Transport measurement of fractional charges in topological models
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB The static topological fractional charge (TFC) in condensed matter systems is related to the band topology and thus has potential applications in topological quantum computation. However, the experimental measurement of these TFCs in electronic systems is quite challenging. We propose an electronic transport measurement scheme in which both the charge amount and the spatial distribution of the TFC can be extracted from the differential conductance through a quantum dot coupled to the topological system being measured. For one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, both the e/2 charge of the TFC and its distribution can be verified. As for the disorder effect, it is shown that the Anderson disorder, which breaks certain symmetry related to the TFC, is significant in higher-dimensional systems while having little effect on the one-dimensional SSH chain. Nonetheless, our measurement scheme can still work well for specific higher-order topological insulator materials, for instance, the 2e/3 TFC in the breathing kagome model could be confirmed even in the presence of disorder effect. These conclusions about spatial dimension and disorder effect are quite universal, which also applies to other topological systems such as topological classic wave system.

TI Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state in bilayer graphene
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB At a half-filled Landau level, composite fermions with chiral p-wave pairing will form a Moore-Read state which hosts charge-e/4 fractional excitation. This excitation supports non-Abelian statistics and has potential to enable topological quantum computation. Owing to the SU(4) symmetry of electron and electric-field tunability, the bilayer graphene becomes an ideal platform for exploring physics of multi-component quantum Hall state and is candidate for realizing non-Abelian statistics. In this work, high-quality bilayer graphene/hBN heterostructure is fabricated by using dry-transfer technique, and electric transport measurement is performed to study quantum Hall state behavior in bilayer graphene under electric field and magnetic field. Under strong magnetic field, the sequences of incompressible state with quantized Hall conductivity are revealed at -5/2, -1/2, 3/2 filling of Landau level. The feature of even-denominator quantum Hall state is more visible then weaker with increasing magnetic field, and this corresponds to the polarization of Landau level wave function. The experimental results indicate that the observed even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state belongs to the topological phase described by Pfaffian wavefunction.

TI Emergent Ergodicity at the Transition between Many-Body Localized Phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Strongly disordered systems in the many-body localized (MBL) phase can exhibit ground state order in highly excited eigenstates. The interplay between localization, symmetry, and topology has led to the characterization of a broad landscape of MBL phases ranging from spin glasses and time crystals to symmetry protected topological phases. Understanding the nature of phase transitions between these different forms of eigenstate order remains an essential open question. Here, we conjecture that no direct transition between distinct MBL orders can occur in one dimension; rather, an ergodic phase always intervenes. Motivated by recent advances in Rydberg-atom-based quantum simulation, we propose an experimental protocol where the intervening ergodic phase can be diagnosed via the dynamics of local observables.

TI Nonconventional thermal states of interacting bosonic oligomers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB There has recently been a growing effort to understand the physics and intricate dynamics of many-body and many-state (multimode) interacting bosonic systems in a comprehensive manner. For instance, in photonics, nonlinear multimode fibers are being intensely investigated nowadays due to their promise for ultrahigh-bandwidth and high-power capabilities. Similar prospects are being pursued in connection with magnon Bose-Einstein (BE) condensates, and ultracold atoms in periodic lattices for room-temperature quantum devices and quantum computation, respectively. While it is practically impossible to monitor the phase space of such complex systems (classically or quantum mechanically), thermodynamics has succeeded in predicting their thermal state: the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) distribution for classical fields and the BE distribution for quantum systems. These distributions are monotonic and promote either the ground state or the most excited mode. Here, we demonstrate the possibility to advance the participation of other modes in the thermal state of bosonic oligomers. The resulting nonmonotonic modal occupancies are described by a microcanonical treatment, while they deviate drastically from the RJ/BE predictions of canonical and grand-canonical ensembles. Our results provide a paradigm of ensemble equivalence violation and can be used for designing the shape of thermal states.

TI Quantum-spin-Hall phases and 2D topological insulating states in
   atomically thin layers
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The quantum-spin-Hall (QSH) phase and its helical edge spins of two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators (TIs) are attracting increasing attention. The helical edge spin currents are a favorite to applications in dissipationless spintronic devices with low error rates because the spin currents existing along sample 1D edges are topologically protected in time-reversal symmetry and are easily controlled by external bias voltages. Moreover, combining the 1D edge spin currents with ferromagnetic or superconductor electrodes yields various exciting phenomena and those applications to innovative quantum devices. Nevertheless, reports of 2D TIs and QSH phases (particularly at high temperatures) have been rare and mainly in semiconductor 2D quantum wells. Here, I introduce and discuss how 2D TI states and QSH phases can be created and applied to innovative quantum (spintronic) devices, particularly in atomically thin layers (such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide family, which is energetically studied and have demonstrated large topological bulk gaps recently). Research of 2D TIs on atom-thin (or few) layers and those application must open a door to next-generation quantum architectures (such as topological quantum computation utilizing the Majorana fermion).

TI Engineering Chiral Light-Matter Interactions in a Waveguide-Coupled
   Nanocavity
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Spin-dependent, directional light-matter interactions form the basis of chiral quantum networks. In the solid state, quantum emitters commonly possess circularly polarized optical transitions with spin-dependent handedness. We demonstrate numerically that spin-dependent chiral coupling can be realized by embedding such an emitter in a waveguide-coupled nanocavity, which supports two near-degenerate, orthogonally polarized cavity modes. The chiral behavior arises due to direction-dependent interference between the cavity modes upon coupling to two single-mode output waveguides. Notably, an experimentally realistic cavity design simultaneously supports near-unity chiral contrast, efficient (>95%) cavity-waveguide coupling and enhanced lightmatter interaction strength (Purcell factor F-P > 70). In combination, these parameters enable the development of highly coherent spin-photon interfaces ready for integration into nanophotonic circuits.

TI Charging power and stability of always-on transitionless driven quantum
   batteries
SO EPL
AB The storage and transfer of energy through quantum batteries are key elements in quantum networks. Here, we propose a charger design based on transitionless quantum driving (TQD), which allows for inherent control over the battery charging time, with the speed of charging coming at the cost of the internal energy available to implement the dynamics. Moreover, the TQD-based charger is also shown to be locally stable, which means that the charger can be disconnected from the quantum battery (QB) at any time after the energy transfer to the QB, with no full energy backflow to the charger. This provides a highly charged QB in an always-on asymptotic regime. We illustrate the robustness of the QB charge against time fluctuations and the full control over the evolution time for a feasible TQD-based charger. Copyright (C) 2022 EPLA

TI Generating Many Majorana Corner Modes and Multiple Phase Transitions in
   Floquet Second-Order Topological Superconductors
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A d-dimensional, nth-order topological insulator or superconductor has localized eigenmodes at its (d-n)-dimensional boundaries (n & LE;d). In this work, we apply periodic driving fields to two-dimensional superconductors, and obtain a wide variety of Floquet second-order topological superconducting (SOTSC) phases with many Majorana corner modes at both zero and pi quasienergies. Two distinct Floquet SOTSC phases are found to be separated by three possible kinds of transformations, i.e., a topological phase transition due to the closing/reopening of a bulk spectral gap, a topological phase transition due to the closing/reopening of an edge spectral gap, or an entirely different phase in which the bulk spectrum is gapless. Thanks to the strong interplay between driving and intrinsic energy scales of the system, all the found phases and transitions are highly controllable via tuning a single hopping parameter of the system. Our discovery not only enriches the possible forms of Floquet SOTSC phases, but also offers an efficient scheme to generate many coexisting Majorana zero and pi corner modes, which may find applications in Floquet quantum computation.

TI Homology-changing percolation transitions on finite graphs
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We consider homological edge percolation on a sequence (G(t))(t) of finite graphs covered by an infinite (quasi)transitive graph H & nbsp;and weakly convergent to H. In particular, we use the covering maps to classify 1-cycles on graphs G(t) as homologically trivial or non-trivial and define several thresholds associated with the rank of thus defined first homology group on the open subgraphs generated by the Bernoulli (edge) percolation process. We identify the growth of the homological distance d(t), the smallest size of a non-trivial cycle on G(t), as the main factor determining the location of homology-changing thresholds. In particular, we show that the giant cycle erasure threshold p(E)(0) (related to the conventional erasure threshold for the corresponding sequence of generalized toric codes) coincides with the edge percolation threshold p(c)(H) if the ratio d(t)/ln n(t) diverges, where n(t) is the number of edges of G(t), and we give evidence that p(E)(0) < p(c)(H) in several cases where this ratio remains bounded, which is necessarily the case if H & nbsp;is non-amenable.

TI Spin-texture topology in curved circuits driven by spin-orbit
   interactions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Interferometry is a powerful technique used to extract valuable information about the wave function of a system. In this work, we study the response of spin carriers to the effective field textures developed in curved one-dimensional interferometric circuits subject to the joint action of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. By using a quantum network technique, we establish that the interplay between these two non-Abelian fields and the circuit's geometry modify the geometrical characteristics of the spinors, particularly on square circuits, leading to the localisation of the electronic wave function and the suppression of the quantum conductance. We propose a topological interpretation by classifying the corresponding spin textures in terms of winding numbers.

TI Converting single photons from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot into the

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Wavelength conversion at the single-photon level is required to forge a quantum network from distinct quantum devices. Such devices include solid-state emitters of single or entangled photons, as well as network nodes based on atoms or ions. Here we demonstrate the conversion of single photons emitted from a III-V semiconductor quantum dot at 853nm via sum frequency conversion to the wavelength of the strong transition of Yb+ ions at 370 nm. We measure the secondorder correlation function of both the unconverted and the converted photon and show that the single-photon character of the quantum dot emission is preserved during the conversion process.

TI Deriving the Landauer Principle From the Quantum Shannon Entropy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We derive an expression to determine the equilibrium probability distribution of a quantum state in contact with a noisy thermal environment that formally separates contributions from quantum and classical forms of probabilistic uncertainty. A statistical mechanical interpretation of this probability distribution enables us to derive an expression for the minimum free energy costs for arbitrary (reversible or irreversible) quantum state changes. Based on this derivation, we demonstrate that-in contrast to classical systems-the free energy required to erase or reset a qubit depends sensitively on both the fidelity of the target state and on the physical properties of the environment, such as the number of quantum bath states, due primarily to the entropic effects of system-bath entanglement.

TI Josephson junction infrared single-photon detector
SO SCIENCE
AB Josephson junctions are superconducting devices used as high-sensitivity magnetometers and voltage amplifiers as well as the basis of high-performance cryogenic computers and superconducting quantum computers. Although device performance can be degraded by the generation of quasiparticles formed from broken Cooper pairs, this phenomenon also opens opportunities to sensitively detect electromagnetic radiation. We demonstrate single near-infrared photon detection by coupling photons to the localized surface plasmons of a graphene-based Josephson junction. Using the photon-induced switching statistics of the current-biased device, we reveal the critical role of quasiparticles generated by the absorbed photon in the detection mechanism. The photon sensitivity will enable a high-speed, low-power optical interconnect for future superconducting computing architectures.

TI Impossibility of achieving Landauer's bound for almost every quantum
   state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The thermodynamic cost of resetting an arbitrary initial state to a particular desired state is lower bounded by Landauer's bound. However, here we demonstrate that this lower bound is necessarily unachievable for every initial state (except possibly the single minimally dissipative input) for any reliable reset mechanism. Since local heating threatens rapid decoherence, this issue is of substantial importance beyond mere energy efficiency. For the case of qubit reset, we find the minimally dissipative state analytically for any reliable reset protocol, in terms of the entropy-flow vector introduced here. This allows us to verify a recent theorem about initial-state dependence of entropy production for any finite-time transformation, as it pertains to quantum state preparation.

TI Nonlinear extension of the quantum dynamical semigroup
SO QUANTUM
AB In this paper we consider deterministic nonlinear time evolutions satisfying so called convex quasi-linearity condition. Such evolutions preserve the equivalence of ensembles and therefore are free from problems with signaling. We show that if family of linear non-trace-preserving maps satisfies the semigroup property then the generated family of convex quasilinear operations also possesses the semigroup property. Next we generalize the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad type equation for the considered evolution. As examples we discuss the general qubit evolution in our model as well as an extension of the Jaynes-Cummings model. We apply our formalism to spin density matrix of a charged particle moving in the electromagnetic field as well as to flavor evolution of solar neutrinos.

TI Quantum image encryption based on Baker map and DNA circular shift
   operation
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum computation can improve the efficiency of image processing by utilizing parallelism and superposition characteristics. In this paper, a quantum cryptosystem based on Baker map and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) circular shift operation is designed. Firstly, the digital image to be encrypted is firstly represented with a novel enhanced quantum representation model. Then quantum Baker map is used to permutate the position information of the prepared quantum image. Next, the designed DNA circular shift operation is performed to preliminarily change the color information of the scrambled image. Finally, the ciphertext image is obtained by implementing the exclusive OR (XOR) operation between the pseudo-random sequence generated by a four-dimensional (4D) hyper-chaotic system and the DNA shift operated image. Numerical experimental results and security analysis verify that the proposed scheme has good performance at securing information storage and transmission as the histograms of ciphertexts are uniform, the correlation coefficient values of three directions are very close to 0, the average information entropy is 7.9972, the key space is more than 1015x4 to resist brute-force attack. Furthermore, it has lower computational complexity compared with classical algorithms.

TI Vortex detection from quantum data
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data-states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose an algorithm for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection, where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data, and it points to the need for developing appropriate models for quantum data analysis that can be trained on them.

TI TQCPat: Tree Quantum Circuit Pattern-based Feature Engineering Model for
   Automated Arrhythmia Detection using PPG Signals
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Background and PurposeArrhythmia, which presents with irregular and/or fast/slow heartbeats, is associated with morbidity and mortality risks. Photoplethysmography (PPG) provides information on volume changes of blood flow and can be used to diagnose arrhythmia. In this work, we have proposed a novel, accurate, self-organized feature engineering model for arrhythmia detection using simple, cost-effective PPG signals.MethodWe have drawn inspiration from quantum circuits and employed a quantum-inspired feature extraction function /named the Tree Quantum Circuit Pattern (TQCPat). The proposed system consists of four main stages: (i) multilevel feature extraction using discrete wavelet transform (MDWT) and TQCPat, (ii) feature selection using Chi-squared (Chi2) and neighborhood component analysis (NCA), (iii) classification using k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) and (iv) information fusion.ResultsOur proposed TQCPat-based feature engineering model has yielded a classification accuracy of 91.30% using 46,827 PPG signals in classifying six classes with ten-fold cross-validation.ConclusionOur results show that the proposed TQCPat-based model is accurate for arrhythmia classification using PPG signals and can be tested with a large database and more arrhythmia classes.

TI Towards compact phase-matched and waveguided nonlinear optics in
   atomically layered semiconductors
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Nonlinear frequency conversion provides essential tools for generating new colors and quantum states of light. Transition metal dichalcogenides possess huge nonlinear susceptibilities; further, 3R-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide crystals possess aligned layers with broken inversion symmetry, representing ideal candidates to boost the nonlinear optical gain with minimal footprint. Here we report the second-order nonlinear processes of 3R-MoS2 along the ordinary and extraordinary directions. Along the ordinary axis, by measuring the thickness-dependent second-harmonic generation, we present the first measurement of the second-harmonic-generation coherence length of 3R-MoS2 and achieve record nonlinear optical enhancement from a van der Waals material, >10(4) stronger than a monolayer. It is found that 3R-MoS2 slabs exhibit similar conversion efficiencies of lithium niobate, but within 100-fold shorter propagation lengths. Furthermore, along the extraordinary axis, we achieve broadly tunable second-harmonic generation from 3R-MoS2 in a waveguide geometry, revealing the coherence length in such a structure. We characterize the full refractive-index spectrum and quantify its birefringence with near-field nanoimaging. Our results highlight the potential of 3R-stacked transition metal dichalcogenides for integrated photonics, providing critical parameters for designing highly efficient on-chip nonlinear optical devices including periodically poled structures, optical parametric oscillators and amplifiers, and quantum circuits.

TI An Electron Waveguide Model for FDSOI Transistors
SO SOLIDS
AB We extend our previous semi-empirical model for quantum transport in a conventional nano-MOSFET to FDSOI transistors. In ultra-thin-body and -BOX (UTBB) FDSOI transistors, the electron channel can be treated as an electron waveguide. In the abrupt transition approximation, it is possible to derive an analytical approximation for the potential seen by the charge carriers. With these approximations we calculate the threshold voltage and the transfer characteristics, finding remarkably good agreement with experiments in the OFF-state given the relative simplicity of our model. In the ON-state, our theory fails because Coulomb interaction between the free charge carriers and the device heating is neglected in our approach.

TI Light-Matter Interactions in Synthetic Magnetic Fields: Landau-Photon
   Polaritons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study light-matter interactions in two-dimensional photonic systems in the presence of a spatially homogeneous synthetic magnetic field for light. Specifically, we consider one or more two-level emitters located in the bulk region of the lattice, where for increasing magnetic field the photonic modes change from extended plane waves to circulating Landau levels. This change has a drastic effect on the resulting emitter-field dynamics, which becomes intrinsically non-Markovian and chiral, leading to the formation of strongly coupled Landau-photon polaritons. The peculiar dynamical and spectral properties of these quasiparticles can be probed with state-of-the-art photonic lattices in the optical and the microwave domain and may find various applications for the quantum simulation of strongly interacting topological models.

TI On-chip nonvolatile and erasable silicon waveguide filter based on a
   low-loss phase-change material
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Silicon waveguide filters are considered an indispensable component for on-chip optical signal processing, spectrum analysis, and neural networks, where its filtering function is determined after fabrication. Electro-optical tuning or thermo-optical tuning can only slightly change the filter spectrum. We propose a nonvolatile and erasable silicon waveguide filter based on the low-loss phase change material Sb2Se3. By depositing Sb2Se3 layer on both sides of the silicon waveguide and using the laser irradiation-induced phase transition technique, we can write and erase arbitrary grating structures in real time within the erasable Sb2Se3 region (length: 36 mu m) to change the optical transmission in the silicon waveguide. Three working states were found in such a filter: the low-loss transmission state, the Bragg reflection state, and the cycle, number, and phase shift can be modified online through laser irradiation with low cost, low power consumption and erasable use, which cannot be achieved using current lithography and etching methods. Finally, we set up the phase change laser processing platform and demonstrated the proposed erasable filter. We believe the proposed silicon waveguide filter and its erasable processing method are promising for programmable photonic circuits and quantum circuits.

TI Performance comparison of the quantum and classical deep Q-learning
   approaches in dynamic environments control
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB There is a lack of adequate studies on dynamic environments control for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) algorithms, representing a significant gap in this field. This study contributes to bridging this gap by demonstrating the potential of quantum RL algorithms to effectively handle dynamic environments. In this research, the performance and robustness of Quantum Deep Q-learning Networks (DQN) were examined in two dynamic environments, Cart Pole and Lunar Lander, by using three distinct quantum Ansatz layers: RealAmplitudes, EfficientSU2, and TwoLocal. The quantum DQNs were compared with classical DQN algorithms in terms of convergence speed, loss minimization, and Q-value behavior. It was observed that the RealAmplitudes Ansatz outperformed the other quantum circuits, demonstrating faster convergence and superior performance in minimizing the loss function. To assess robustness, the pole length was increased in the Cart Pole environment, and a wind function was added to the Lunar Lander environment after the 50th episode. All three quantum Ansatz layers were found to maintain robust performance under disturbed conditions, with consistent reward values, loss minimization, and stable Q-value distributions. Although the proposed QRL demonstrates competitive results overall, classical RL can surpass them in convergence speed under specific conditions.

TI q-Analogues of Lyapunov-type inequalities involving Riemann-Liouville
   fractional derivatives
SO BULLETIN OF THE KARAGANDA UNIVERSITY-MATHEMATICS SERIES
AB In this article, new q-analogues of Lyapunov-type inequalities are presented for two-point fractional boundary value problems involving the Riemann-Liouville fractional q-derivative with well-posed q-boundary conditions. The study relies on the properties of the q-Green's function, which is constructed to solve such problems and allows for the analytical derivation of the inequalities. These inequalities find application in two directions: establishing precise lower bounds for the eigenvalues of corresponding q-fractional spectral problems and formulating criteria for the absence of real zeros in q-analogues of Mittag-Leffler functions. The obtained results generalize classical and fractional Lyapunov inequalities, offering new perspectives for the analysis of stability and spectral properties of q-fractional differential systems. The relevance of the work is driven by the growing interest in q-calculus in discrete models, such as visco elastic systems or quantum circuits, where discrete dynamics play a key role. The convenience of closed-form analytical expressions makes the results practically applicable. The research lays the foundation for further generalizations, including Caputo derivatives or multidimensional q-systems, which may stimulate new discoveries in discrete fractional analysis.

TI Manipulating single-photon transport in a waveguide-QED structure
   containing two giant atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate coherent single-photon transport in a waveguide-QED structure containing two giant atoms. The unified analytical expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes applicable for different topological configurations are derived. The spectroscopic characteristics in different parameter regimes, especially the asymmetric Fano line shapes and the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-like spectra, are analyzed in detail. Specifically, we find that the appearance of Fano line shapes is influenced by not only the phase delays between coupling points but also the topologies of system. We also summarize the general conditions for appearance of EIT-like spectra by analyzing the master equation and verify these conditions by checking the corresponding analytical expressions of the scattering spectra. These phenomena may provide powerful tools for controlling and manipulating photon transport in future quantum networks.

TI Estimating Nonstabilizerness Dynamics Without Simulating It
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce the iterative Clifford circuit renormalization (ICCR), a novel technique designed to handle the dynamics of nonstabilizerness (also known as quantum magic) in generic quantum circuits composed of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, as well as measurements, extending beyond the reach of pre-existing methods. ICCR iteratively adjusts the starting circuit, transforming it into a Clifford circuit where all elements that can alter the nonstabilizerness, such as measurements or T gates, have been removed. In the process the initial state is renormalized in such a way that the new circuit outputs the same final state as the original one. This approach embeds the complex dynamics of nonstabilizerness in the flow of an effective initial state, enabling the efficient evaluation of stabilizer Renyi entropies and magic nullity while avoiding the need for direct and computationally expensive simulation of the original circuit. The initial state renormalization can be computed explicitly using a matrix-product state approximation that can be systematically improved. We implement the ICCR algorithm to evaluate the nonstabilizerness dynamics for systems of size up to N = 1000, in one and more dimensions. We validate our method by comparing it to tensor-network simulations. Finally, we employ the ICCR technique to study measurement-induced magic transitions in monitored circuits without and with T gates.

TI HQ-DCGAN: Hybrid quantum deep convolutional generative adversarial
   network approach for ECG generation
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB The class imbalance of electrocardiogram (ECG) data is a serious impediment to the development of diagnostic systems for heart disease. To address this issue, this paper proposes HQ-DCGAN, a hybrid quantum deep convolutional generative adversarial network, specifically designed for the generation of ECGs. The proposed algorithm employs different quantum convolutional layers for the generator and discriminator as feature extractors and utilizes parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) to enhance computational capabilities, along with the model-feature mapping process. Moreover, this algorithm preserves the nonlinearity and scalability inherent to classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), thereby optimizing the utilization of quantum resources, and ensuring compatibility with contemporary quantum devices. In addition, this paper proposes a novel evaluation metric, 1D Fr & eacute;chet Inception Distance (1DFID), to assess the quality of the generated ECG signals. Simulation experiments show that HQ-DCGAN exhibits strong performance in ECG signal generation. Furthermore, the generated signals achieve an average classification accuracy of 82.2%, outperforming the baseline algorithms. It has been experimentally proven that HQ-DCGAN is friendly to currently noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, in terms of both number of qubits and circuit depths, while improving the stability.

TI Ultra-compact, broadband adiabatic passage optical couplers in thin-film
   lithium niobate on insulator waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report the first demonstration of broadband adiabatic directional couplers in thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) waveguides. A three LN-waveguide configuration with each waveguide having a ridge cross section of less than 1 square micron, built atop a layer of SiO2 based on a 500-mu m-thick Si substrate, has been designed and constructed to optically emulate a three-state stimulated Raman adiabatic passage system, with which a unique counterintuitive adiabatic light transfer phenomenon in a high coupling efficiency of >97% (corresponding to a >15 dB splitting ratio) spanning telecom S, C, and L bands for both TE and TM polarization modes has been observed for a 2-mm long coupler length. An even broader operating bandwidth of >800 nm of the device can be found from the simulation fitting of the experimental data. The footprint of the realized LNOI adiabatic coupler has been reduced by >99% compared to its bulk counterparts. Such an ultra-compact, broadband LNOI adiabatic coupler can be further used to implement or integrate with various photonic elements, a potential building block for realizing large-scale integrated photonic (quantum) circuits in LN.

TI Diversity and multiplexing in quantum MIMO channels
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Characterization and exploitation of multiple channels between the transmitter and the receiver in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications brought a paradigm shift in classical communication systems. The techniques developed around MIMO communication systems not only brought unprecedented advancements in communication rates but also substantially improved the reliability of communication, measured by low error rates. We develop a framework for MIMO quantum communications with discrete-variable quantum systems. We propose a general model of MIMO quantum channels incorporating noise, losses, and crosstalk among multiple channels. We leverage the approximate quantum cloning to transmit imperfect clones of the input state over this channel setup. We demonstrate that transmitting multiple imperfect clones achieves better communication fidelity as compared to transmitting a single perfect copy of the state due to the diversity of the MIMO setup. We also demonstrate a practical tradeoff between fidelity and rate of communication and call it quantum diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) due to its similarity with the well-known DMT in classical MIMO setups.

TI Two-Dimensional XY Ferromagnet Induced by Long-Range Interaction
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The crossover between short-range and long-range (LR) universal behaviors remains a central theme in the physics of LR interacting systems. The competition between LR coupling and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism makes the problem more subtle and less understood in the two-dimensional (2D) XY model, a cornerstone for investigating low-dimensional phenomena and their implications in quantum computation. We study the 2D XY model with algebraically decaying interaction similar to 1/r(2+sigma). Utilizing an advanced update strategy, we conduct LR Monte Carlo simulations of the model up to a linear size of L = 8192. Our results demonstrate continuous phase transitions into a ferromagnetic phase for sigma < 2, which exhibit the simultaneous emergence of a long-ranged order and a power-law decaying correlation function due to the Goldstone mode. Furthermore, we find logarithmic scaling behaviors in the low-temperature phase at sigma = 2. The observed scaling behaviors in the low-temperature phase for sigma <= 2 agree with our theoretical analysis. Our findings request further theoretical understanding and can be of practical application in cutting-edge experiments like Rydberg atom arrays.

TI High-fidelity parametric beamsplitting with a parity-protected converter
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Fast, high-fidelity operations between microwave resonators are an important tool for bosonic quantum computation and simulation with superconducting circuits. An attractive approach for implementing these operations is to couple these resonators via a nonlinear converter and actuate parametric processes with RF drives. It can be challenging to make these processes simultaneously fast and high fidelity, since this requires introducing strong drives without activating parasitic processes or introducing additional decoherence channels. We show that in addition to a careful management of drive frequencies and the spectrum of environmental noise, leveraging the inbuilt symmetries of the converter Hamiltonian can suppress unwanted nonlinear interactions, preventing converter-induced decoherence. We demonstrate these principles using a differentially-driven DC-SQUID as our converter, coupled to two high-Q microwave cavities. Using this architecture, we engineer a highly-coherent beamsplitter and fast (similar to 100 ns) swaps between the cavities, limited primarily by their intrinsic single-photon loss. We characterize this beamsplitter in the cavities' joint single-photon subspace, and show that we can detect and post-select photon loss events to achieve a beamsplitter gate fidelity exceeding 99.98%, which to our knowledge far surpasses the current state of the art.

TI Efficient discrimination between real and complex quantum theories
SO QUANTUM
AB We improve the test to show the impossibility of a quantum theory based on real numbers by a larger ratio of complex-toreal bound on a Bell-type parameter. In contrast to previous theoretical and experimental proposals the test requires three settings for the parties A and C, but also six settings for the middle party B, assuming separability of the sources. The bound we found for this symmetric configuration imposed on a real theory is 14.69 while the complex maximum is 18. This large theoretical difference enables us to demonstrate the concomitant experimenvia a designed quantum network, without resorting to error mitigation, obtaining as a result 15.44 at more than 100 standard deviations above the found real bound.

TI Cavity-driven Rabi oscillations between Rydberg states of atoms trapped
   on a superconducting atom chip
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid quantum systems involving cold atoms and microwave resonators can enable cavity-mediated infinite-range interactions between atomic spin systems and realize atomic quantum memories and transducers for microwave-to-optical conversion. To achieve strong coupling of atoms to on-chip microwave resonators, it was suggested to use atomic Rydberg states with strong electric-dipole transitions. Here we report on the experimental realization of coherent coupling of a Rydberg transition of ultracold atoms, trapped on an integrated superconducting atom chip, to the microwave field of an on-chip coplanar waveguide resonator. Close to the chip surface, stray electric fields lead to inhomogeneous Rydberg level shifts, which would hinder coherent interactions of atoms in a cloud with the Rydberg excitation lasers and the microwave cavity field. We, however, use optical excitation of a Rydberg state of atoms in a narrow layer with nearly constant electric field, which allows for resonant coupling of the atoms to the cavity microwave field on an appropriate Rydberg transition. We also achieve state-selective detection of the energetically close Rydberg states. We then observe and characterize cavity-driven Rabi oscillations between a pair of atomic Rydberg states. The residual damping of the oscillations is dominated by the spread of Rabi frequencies of atoms in different positions of the resonant cavity mode, as revealed by our model. Despite the technical challenges, our studies demonstrate the feasibility of coherent-state manipulation of Rydberg atoms interacting with superconducting circuits, paving the way for realization of capable hybrid quantum systems.

TI Topological band inversion and chiral Majorana mode in hcp thallium
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The chiral Majorana fermion is an exotic particle that is its own antiparticle. It can arise in a one-dimensional edge of topological materials, and especially that in a topological superconductor can be exploited in non-Abelian quantum computation. While the chiral Majorana mode (CMM) remains elusive, a promising situation is realized when superconductivity coexists with a topologically non-trivial surface state. Here, we perform fully non-empirical calculation for the CMM considering superconductivity and surface relaxation, and show that hexagonal close-packed thallium (Tl) has an ideal electronic state that harbors the CMM. The k z = 0 plane of Tl is a mirror plane, realizing a full-gap band inversion corresponding to a topological crystalline insulating phase. Its surface and hinge are stable and easy to make various structures. Another notable feature is that the surface Dirac point is very close to the Fermi level, so that a small Zeeman field can induce a topological transition. Our calculation indicates that Tl will provide a new platform of the Majorana fermion.

In the present review, the topological insulators (2D, 3D, and hydride) were discussed including the conducting edge of 2D topological insulators (TIs). Preparation methods of TIs along with fundamental properties, such as low power dissipation and spin polarized electrons, have been explored. Magnetic TIs have been extensively discussed and explained. Weyl phases, topological superconductors, and TIs are covered in this review. We have focused on creating novel spintronic gadgets based on TIs which have metallic topological exterior facades that are topologically defended and have an insulating bulk. In this review, topological phases are discussed as a potential candidate for novel quantum phenomena and new technological advances for fault-tolerant quantum computation in spintronics, low-power electronics, and as a host for Majorana fermions are elucidated. Room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions and anti-skyrmions in spintronics for next-generation memory/storage devices have been reported.

TI Evidence of topological boundary modes with topological nodal-point
   superconductivity
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Scanning tunnelling microscopy provides evidence for topological superconductivity in a naturally occurring transition metal dichalcogenide material.
   Topological superconductors are an essential component for topologically protected quantum computation and information processing. Although signatures of topological superconductivity have been reported in heterostructures, material realizations of intrinsic topological superconductors are rather rare. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to study the transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2 that interleaves superconducting 1H-TaS2 layers with strongly correlated 1T-TaS2 layers, and find spectroscopic evidence for the existence of topological surface superconductivity. These include edge modes running along the 1H-layer terminations as well as under the 1T-layer terminations, where they separate between superconducting regions of distinct topological nature. We also observe signatures of zero-bias states in vortex cores. All the boundary modes exhibit crystallographic anisotropy, which-together with a finite in-gap density of states throughout the 1H layers-allude to the presence of a topological nodal-point superconducting state. Our theoretical modelling attributes this phenomenology to an inter-orbital pairing channel that necessitates the combination of surface mirror symmetry breaking and strong interactions. It, thus, suggests a topological superconducting state realized in a natural compound.

TI Quantum interference of pulsed time-bin entanglement generated from
   silicon ring resonator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate a pulsed operation of an entangled photon pair source that is based on a silicon ring resonator. Time-bin entangled photon pairs at telecommunication wavelengths are generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing, which is excited by a pulsed pump laser. The entanglement between the generated photon pair is analyzed by using asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometers followed by single-photon detectors, resulting in non-classical interference with a visibility exceeding a classical limit. The reason for the degradation of the interference visibility is discussed using the theoretical model with experimental parameters. Our experimental results show successful pulsed generation of entanglement, which represents an important step towards a synchronized quantum network based on silicon photonics.

TI Stability of thermally bistable states and their switching in
   superconducting weak link
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Superconducting weak link (WL), acting as a Josephson junction (JJ), is one of the widely used elements in superconductor science and quantum circuits. A hysteretic JJ with robust switching between its superconducting and resistive state is an excellent candidate for single-photon detection. However, the ubiquitous fluctuations in the junction strongly influence the stability of the states and, thus, the transition from one to the other. Here, we present an experimental study of switching statistics of critical and retrapping currents of a JJ based on niobium WL in its hysteretic regime. The mean lifetimes of the two metastable states, namely, the zero-voltage superconducting state and finite-voltage resistive state, are estimated from the distributions. Further, close to the hysteresis crossover temperature, observed telegraphic noise in the time domain due to random switching between the states provides their lifetimes directly. We present a thermal model introducing a double-well (bistable) feature with an intriguing quantity with respect to the devices' temperature states. The effects of temperature fluctuations on the stability of the states are shown. We discuss our results toward further improvement of the efficiency of superconducting WL or nanowire single-photon detectors. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Optical multi-trapping by Kinoform m-Bonacci lenses
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical manipulation is interfacing disciplines in the micro and nanoscale, from molecular biology to quantum computation. Versatile solutions for increasingly more sophisticated technological applications require multiple traps with which to maneuver dynamically several particles in three dimensions. The axial direction is usually overlooked due to difficulties in observing particles away from an objective-lens focal plane, a normal element in optical tweezers, and in managing interparticle distances along the trapping beam propagating direction, where strong radiation pressure and shadowing effects compromise the simultaneous and stable confinement of the particles. Here, aperiodic kinoform diffractive lens based on the m-Bonacci sequence are proposed as a newtrapping strategy. This lens provides split first-order diffractive foci whose separation depends on the generalized m-golden ratio. We show the extended manipulation capabilities of a laser tweezers system generated by these lens, in which concomitant trapping of particles in different focal planes takes place. Positioning particles in the axial direction with computer-controlled distances allows dynamic three-dimensional all-optical lattices, useful in a variety of microscale and nanoscale applications.

TI High-accuracy Ising machine using Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators
   with local four-body interactions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A two-dimensional array of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs) with local four-body interactions is a promising candidate for realizing an Ising machine with all-to-all spin couplings, based on adiabatic quantum computation in the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. However, its performance has been evaluated only for a symmetric network of three KPOs, and thus it has been unclear whether such an Ising machine works in general cases with asymmetric networks. By numerically simulating an asymmetric network of more KPOs in the LHZ scheme, we find that the asymmetry in the four-body interactions causes inhomogeneity in photon numbers and hence degrades the performance. We then propose a method for reducing the inhomogeneity, where the discrepancies of the photon numbers are corrected by tuning the detunings of KPOs depending on their positions, without monitoring their states during adiabatic time evolution. Our simulation results show that the performance can be dramatically improved by this method. The proposed method, which is based on the understanding of the asymmetry, is expected to be useful for general networks of KPOs in the LHZ scheme and thus for their large-scale implementation.

TI Synonym-based multi-keyword ranked search with secure k-NN in 6G network
SO IET NETWORKS
AB Sixth Generation (6G) integrates the next generation communication systems such as maritime, terrestrial, and aerial to offer robust network and massive device connectivity with ultra-low latency requirement. The cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum machine learning, and millimetre enable hyper-connectivity to extend the development of mobile communication. The potential technologies utilise different computing infrastructures, on-demand software, platforms, and machine intelligence to access a massive amount of data in real-time. The delivery of real-time data demands third-party remote access to exploit the resources such as network service and storage to meet user requirements. Moreover, certain computing infrastructures such as cloud, edge, and fog recommend privacy protection to guarantee effective data storage and information retrieval by a data centre. As a result, multi-keyword searching over encrypted cloud data is commonly exercised to retrieve the cloud data with service integrity. With the use of mobile cloud computing, the data generating IoT device can easily outsource any kind of complex data management system from the local network system. It may commercialise the system site to achieve better resource-saving. However, data privacy and protection are expected to ensure using encryption techniques before any sensitive data is outsourced via data generating IoT devices. Thus, this paper presents a synonym-based multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data in order to solve privacy-preserving and computation cost. The proposed mechanism constructs an m-Way search tree to allot an index vector for each document which applies a depth-first search to compute top score ranking to realise better search efficiency. The examination results show that the assumed index vectors can be subdivided into the sub-vectors before storing them into the index tree to achieve better security and computation efficiency.

TI Dissipation and irreversibility in computing
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB There has been much discussion for decades over the proper concepts of minimum dissipation per logic gate and what is required for computation, as well as early arguments over logically reversible machines. Here these arguments, and the thermodynamics related to them, are discussed in terms of what is required for a computing machine. This gives a set of requirements for a valid computer that arise already from Turing and a set of limitations on energy dissipation and entropy. Here, the requirements set by Turing on what can and cannot be a computing machine are introduced, and how these limits affect not only the machine, but individual bits and a general need for irreversibility, are discussed. Then, it is shown that there is a minimum dissipation for a bit operation, and this is imposed both by Turing's requirements as well as by noise in the system. Finally, it is shown that information entropy differs from physical entropy and care must be taken in trying to connect the two quantities. How these requirements, and new ones, affect quantum computation is also discussed.

TI Quantum mechanics of bipartite ribbon graphs: Integrality, Lattices and
   Kronecker coefficients
SO ALGEBRAIC COMBINATORICS
AB We define solvable quantum mechanical systems on a Hilbert space spanned by bipartite ribbon graphs with a fixed number of edges. The Hilbert space is also an associative algebra, where the product is derived from permutation group products. The existence and structure of this Hilbert space algebra has a number of consequences. The algebra product, which can be expressed in terms of integer ribbon graph reconnection coefficients, is used to define solvable Hamiltonians with eigenvalues expressed in terms of normalized characters of symmetric group elements and degeneracies given in terms of Kronecker coefficients, which are tensor product multiplicities of symmetric group representations. The square of the Kronecker coefficient for a triple of Young diagrams is shown to be equal to the dimension of a sub-lattice in the lattice of ribbon graphs. This leads to an answer to the long-standing question of a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients. As avenues for future research, we discuss applications of the ribbon graph quantum mechanics in algorithms for quantum computation. We also describe a quantum membrane interpretation of these quantum mechanical systems.

TI Observation of Non-Abelian Thouless Pump
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Thouless pump provides robust ways to realize quantized transport of waves and particles, and it casts the static 2D quantum Hall effect onto ID dynamic systems where one of the momentum dimensions is replaced by the evolution time or path parameter. In the past few decades, various types of Abelian Thouless pump have been achieved theoretically and experimentally. However, the study of non-Abelian Thouless pump is scarce, which tells us that the order of two evolution loops with the same base point cannot be changed, and there has been no experimental observation of non-Abelian Thouless pump. Here we report the observation of a non-Abelian Thouless pump in coupled acoustic waveguide array. The non-Abelian property originates from the noncommutative combination of two different Z(3) pump cycles that traverse across multiple band degeneracies in the parameter space in a three-band system. Moreover, we can pump a specific initial state to any state on any lattice site by applying these two Z(3) pump cycles multiple times in a well-designed sequence. Our study paves the way for exploring and utilizing non-Abelian dynamical effects in classical wave systems and may offer different recipes for quantum walking, quantum optics, and quantum computation.

TI Phase-induced topological superconductivity in a planar heterostructure
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Topological superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional systems is a novel phase of matter with possible implications for quantum computation. Despite years of effort, a definitive signature of this phase in experiments is still debated. A major cause of this ambiguity is the side effects of applying a magnetic field: induced in-gap states, vortices, and alignment issues. Here we propose a planar semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure as a platform for realizing topological superconductivity without applying a magnetic field to the two-dimensional electron gas hosting the topological state. Time-reversal symmetry is broken only by phase biasing the proximitizing superconductors, which can be achieved using extremely small fluxes or bias currents far from the quasi-one-dimensional channel. Our platform is based on interference between this phase biasing and the phase arising from strong spin-orbit coupling in closed electron trajectories. The principle is demonstrated analytically using a simple model, and then shown numerically for realistic devices. We show a robust topological phase diagram, as well as explicit wavefunctions of Majorana zero modes. We discuss experimental issues regarding the practical implementation of our proposal, establishing it as an accessible scheme with contemporary experimental techniques.

TI Two-mode Schrodinger-cat states with nonlinear optomechanics: generation
   and verification of non-Gaussian mechanical entanglement
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Cavity quantum optomechanics has emerged as a new platform for quantum science and technology with applications ranging from quantum-information processing to tests of the foundations of physics. Of crucial importance for optomechanics is the generation and verification of non-Gaussian states of motion and a key outstanding challenge is the observation of a canonical two-mode Schrodinger-cat state in the displacement of two mechanical oscillators. In this work, we introduce a pulsed approach that utilizes the nonlinearity of the radiation-pressure interaction combined with photon-counting measurements to generate this entangled non-Gaussian mechanical state, and, importantly, describe a protocol using subsequent pulsed interactions to verify the non-Gaussian entanglement generated. Our pulsed verification protocol allows quadrature moments of the two mechanical oscillators to be measured up to any finite order providing a toolset for experimental characterisation of bipartite mechanical quantum states and allowing a broad range of inseparability criteria to be evaluated. Key experimental factors, such as optical loss and open-system dynamics, are carefully analyzed and we show that the scheme is feasible with only minor improvements to current experiments that operate outside the resolved-sideband regime. Our scheme provides a new avenue for quantum experiments with entangled mechanical oscillators and offers significant potential for further research and development that utilizes such non-Gaussian states for quantum-information and sensing applications, and for studying the quantum-to-classical transition.

TI Scattershot multiboson correlation sampling with random photonic
   inner-mode multiplexing
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Multiphoton interference is an essential phenomenon at the very heart not only of fundamental quantum optics and applications in quantum information processing and sensing but also of demonstrations of quantum computational supremacy in boson sampling experiments relying only on linear optical interferometers. However, scalable boson sampling experiments with either photon number states or squeezed states are challenged by the need to generate a large number of photons with fixed temporal and frequency spectra from one experimental run to another. Unfortunately, even the well-established standard multiplexing techniques employed to generate photons with fixed spectral properties are affected by the detrimental effects of losses, spectral distorsions and reduction in purity. Here, we employ sampling correlation measurements in the photonic inner modes, time and frequency, at the interferometer input and output to ensure the occurrence of multiphoton interference even with pure states of input photons with random spectral overlap from one sample to another. Indeed, by introducing a random multiplexing technique where photons are generated with random inner-mode parameters, it is possible to substantially enhance the probability to successfully generate samples and overcome the typical drawbacks in standard multiplexing. We also demonstrate the classical hardness of the resulting problem of scattershot multiboson correlation sampling based on this technique. Therefore, these results not only shed new light in the computational complexity of multiboson interference but also allow us to enhance the experimental scalability of boson sampling schemes. Furthermore, this research provides a new exciting route toward future demonstrations of quantum computational supremacy with scalable experimental resources as well as future applications in quantum information processing and sensing beyond boson sampling.

TI Circuit-level protocol and analysis for twist-based lattice surgery
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Lattice surgery is a measurement-based technique for performing fault-tolerant quantum computation in two dimensions. When using the surface code, the most general lattice surgery operations require lattice irregularities called twist defects. However, implementing twist-based lattice surgery may require additional resources, such as extra device connectivity, and could lower the threshold and overall performance for the surface code. Here we provide an explicit twist-based lattice surgery protocol and its requisite connectivity layout. We also provide new stabilizer measurement circuits for measuring twist defects which are compatible with our chosen gate scheduling. We undertake the first circuit-level error correction simulations during twist-based lattice surgery using a biased depolarizing noise model. Our results indicate a slight decrease in the threshold for timelike logical failures compared to lattice surgery protocols with no twist defects in the bulk. However, comfortably below threshold (i.e., with CNOT infidelities below 5 x 10(-3)), the performance degradation is mild and in fact preferable over proposed alternative twist-free schemes. Lastly, we provide an efficient scheme for measuring Y operators along boundaries of surface codes, which bypasses certain steps that were required in previous schemes.

TI Hybridization mechanism of the dual proximity effect in
   superconductor-topological insulator interfaces
SO SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this communication we consider generalities of the proximity effect in a contact between a conventional. s-wave superconductor (S) nano-island and a thin film of a topological insulator (TI). A local hybridization coupling mechanism is considered and a corresponding model is corroborated that captures not only the induced unconventional superconductivity in a TI, but also predicts the spreading of topologically protected surface states into the superconducting over-layer. This dual nature of the proximity effect leads specifically to a modified description of topological superconductivity in these systems. Experimentally accessible signatures of this phenomenon are discussed in the context of scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. For this purpose an effective density of states is computed in both the superconductor and topological insulator. As a guiding example, practical applications are made for Nb islands deposited on a surface of Bi2Se3. The obtained results are general and can be applied beyond the particular material system used. Possible implications of these results to proximity circuits and hybrid hardware devices for quantum computation processing are discussed.

TI Quantum-inspired multi-agent reinforcement learning for
   exploration-exploitation optimization in UAV-assisted 6G network
   deployment
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework for optimizing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), applied to UAV-assisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits (VQCs) as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as a representative VQC-based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments-including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines-demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI-MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods. All implementation code and supplementary materials are publicly available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

TI Fully in situ Nb/InAs-nanowire Josephson junctions by
   selective-area growth and shadow evaporation
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Josephson junctions based on InAs semiconducting nanowires and Nb superconducting electrodes are fabricated in situ by a special shadow evaporation scheme for the superconductor electrode. Compared to other metallic superconductors such as Al, Nb has the advantage of a larger superconducting gap which allows operation at higher temperatures and magnetic fields. Our junctions are fabricated by shadow evaporation of Nb on pairs of InAs nanowires grown selectively on two adjacent tilted Si (111) facets and crossing each other at a small distance. The upper wire relative to the deposition source acts as a shadow mask determining the gap of the superconducting electrodes on the lower nanowire. Electron microscopy measurements show that the fully in situ fabrication method gives a clean InAs/Nb interface. A clear Josephson supercurrent is observed in the current-voltage characteristics, which can be controlled by a bottom gate. The large excess current indicates a high junction transparency. Under microwave radiation, pronounced integer Shapiro steps are observed suggesting a sinusoidal current-phase relation. Owing to the large critical field of Nb, the Josephson supercurrent can be maintained to magnetic fields exceeding 1 T. Our results show that in situ prepared Nb/InAs nanowire contacts are very interesting candidates for superconducting quantum circuits requiring large magnetic fields.

TI Quantum Fokker-Planck Master Equation for Continuous Feedback Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Measurement and feedback control are essential features of quantum science, with applications ranging from quantum technology protocols to information-to-work conversion in quantum thermodynamics. Theoretical descriptions of feedback control are typically given in terms of stochastic equations requiring numerical solutions, or are limited to linear feedback protocols. Here we present a formalism for continuous quantum measurement and feedback, both linear and nonlinear. Our main result is a quantum Fokker-Planck master equation describing the joint dynamics of a quantum system and a detector with finite bandwidth. For fast measurements, we derive a Markovian master equation for the system alone, amenable to analytical treatment. We illustrate our formalism by investigating two basic information engines, one quantum and one classical.

TI Majorana bound states with chiral magnetic textures
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The aim of this Tutorial is to give a pedagogical introduction into realizations of Majorana fermions, usually termed as Majorana bound states (MBSs), in condensed matter systems with magnetic textures. We begin by considering the Kitaev chain model of "spinless" fermions and show how two "half' fermions can appear at chain ends due to interactions. By considering this model and its two-dimensional generalization, we emphasize intricate relation between topological superconductivity and possible realizations of MBS. We further discuss how "spinless" fermions can be realized in more physical systems, e.g., by employing the spin-momentum locking. Next, we demonstrate how magnetic textures can be used to induce synthetic or fictitious spin-orbit interactions, and, thus, stabilize MBS. We describe a general approach that works for arbitrary textures and apply it to skyrmions. We show how MBS can be stabilized by elongated skyrmions, certain higher order skyrmions, and chains of skyrmions. We also discuss how braiding operations can be performed with MBS stabilized on magnetic skyrmions. This Tutorial is aimed at students at the graduate level.

TI A Surrogate Assisted Quantum-Behaved Algorithm for Well Placement
   Optimization
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The oil and gas industry faces difficulties in optimizing well placement problems. These problems are multimodal, non-convex, and discontinuous in nature. Various traditional and non-traditional optimization algorithms have been developed to resolve these difficulties. Nevertheless, these techniques remain trapped in local optima and provide inconsistent performance for different reservoirs. This study thereby presents a Surrogate Assisted Quantum-behaved Algorithm to obtain a better solution for the well placement optimization problem. The proposed approach utilizes different metaheuristic optimization techniques such as the Quantum-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization and the Quantum-behaved Bat Algorithm in different implementation phases. Two complex reservoirs are used to investigate the performance of the proposed approach. A comparative study is carried out to verify the performance of the proposed approach. The result indicates that the proposed approach provides a better net present value for both complex reservoirs. Furthermore, it solves the problem of inconsistency exhibited in other methods for well placement optimization.

AB The quantum Haar random oracle model is an idealized model where every party has access to a single Haar random unitary and its inverse. We construct strong pseudorandom unitaries in the quantum Haar random oracle model. This strictly improves upon prior works who either only prove the existence of pseudorandom unitaries in the inverseless quantum Haar random oracle model [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin, EUROCRYPT 2025] or prove the existence of a weaker notion (implied by strong pseudorandom unitaries) in the quantum Haar random oracle model [Hhan, Yamada, 2024].
   We also provide an alternate method of combining Haar random unitaries from the gluing lemma from [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] that is secure against adversaries with inverse query access to the joined unitary. Taken together, our results have the following implication for the plain model: strong pseudo-random unitaries can generically have their length extended, and can be constructed using only O(n(1/c)) bits of randomness, for any constant c, if strong pseudorandom unitaries exists. Our results also present a viable approach for building quantum pseudorandomness from random quantum circuits and analyzing pseudorandom objects in nature. As part of our analysis, we formalize a "strong path-recording framework", which generalizes the strong path-recording oracle of [Ma, Huang, STOC 2025].

TI Chemical mechanical planarization for Ta-based superconducting quantum
   devices
SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY B
AB We report on the development of a chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process for thick damascene Ta structures with pattern feature sizes down to 100 nm. This CMP process is the core of the fabrication sequence for scalable superconducting integrated circuits at a 300mm wafer scale. This work has established the elements of various CMP-related design rules that can be followed by a designer for the layout of circuits that include Ta-based coplanar waveguide resonators, capacitors, and interconnects for tantalum-based qubits and single flux quantum circuits. The fabrication of these structures utilizes a 193 nm optical lithography along with 300mm process tools for dielectric deposition, reactive ion etch, wet-clean, CMP, and in-line metrology-all tools typical for a 300mm wafer CMOS foundry. The process development was guided by measurements of the physical and electrical characteristics of the planarized structures. Physical characterization such as atomic force microscopy across the 300mm wafer surface showed that local topography was less than 5 nm. Electrical characterization confirmed low leakage at room temperature, and less than 12% within wafer sheet resistance variation for damascene Ta line widths ranging from 100 nm to 3 mu m. Run-to-run reproducibility was also evaluated. Effects of process integration choices including the deposited thickness of Ta are discussed.

TI Variational quantum metrology with the Loschmidt echo
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB By leveraging quantum effects, such as superposition and entanglement, quantum metrology promises higher precision than classical strategies. It is, however, a challenging task to achieve the higher precision on practical systems. This is mainly due to difficulties in engineering nonclassical states and performing nontrivial measurements on the system, especially when the number of particles is large. Here we propose a variational scheme with the Loschmidt echo for quantum metrology. By utilizing hardware-efficient ansatzes in the design of variational quantum circuits, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the probe state can be extracted from the experimentally measured Loschmidt echo in a scalable manner. This QFI is then used to guide the online optimization of the preparation of the probe state. We experimentally implement the scheme on an ensemble of 10-spin quantum processors and achieve a 12.4-dB enhancement of the measurement precision over the uncorrelated states, which is close to the theoretical limit. The scheme can also be employed on various other noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, which provides a promising protocol to demonstrate quantum advantages.
   This study introduces a variational quantum metrology scheme based on Loschmidt echo and experimentally demonstrates its quantum-enhanced characteristic, providing a promising framework for quantum metrology across diverse practical quantum systems.

TI Enhanced quantum transport in chiral quantum walks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum transport across discrete structures is a relevant topic that can be suitably studied in the context of continuous-time quantum walks. The addition of phase degrees of freedom, leading to chiral quantum walks, can also account for directional transport on graphs with loops. We discuss criteria for quantum transport and study the enhancement that can be achieved with chiral quantum walks on chain-like graphs, exploring different topologies for the chain units and optimizing over the phases. We select three candidate structures with optimal performances and we investigate their transport behaviour with Krylov reduction. While one of them can be reduced to a weighted line with minor couplings modulation, the other two are truly chiral quantum walks, with enhanced transport probability over long chain structures.

TI Operational interpretation of the Choi rank through exclusion tasks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Choi state is an indispensable tool in the study and analysis of quantum channels. Considering a channel in terms of its associated Choi state can greatly simplify problems. It also offers an alternative approach to the characterization of a channel, with properties of the Choi state providing novel insight into a channel's behavior. The rank of a Choi state, termed the Choi rank, has proven to be an important characterizing property, and here, its significance is further elucidated through an operational interpretation. The Choi rank is shown to provide a universal bound on how successfully two agents, Alice and Bob, can perform an entanglement-assisted exclusion task. The task can be considered an extension of superdense coding, where Bob can only output information about Alice's encoded bit string with certainty. Conclusive state exclusion, in place of state discrimination, is therefore considered at the culmination of the superdense coding protocol. In order to prove this result, a necessary condition for conclusive k-state exclusion of a set of states is presented in order to achieve this result, and the notions of weak and strong exclusion are introduced.

TI Entanglement generation and stabilization by coherent collisions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.

TI Classically optimized variational quantum eigensolver with applications
   to topological phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is regarded as a promising candidate of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for near-term quantum computers. Meanwhile, VQE is confronted with a challenge that statistical error associated with measurement as well as systematic error could significantly hamper the optimization. To circumvent this issue, we propose the classically optimized VQE (CO-VQE), where the whole process of optimization is efficiently conducted on a classical computer. The efficacy of the method is guaranteed by the observation that quantum circuits with up to logarithmic depth are classically tractable via simulations of local subsystems with up to quasipolynomial cost (polynomial for constant depth). In CO-VQE, we only use quantum computers to measure nonlocal quantities after the parameters are optimized. As a proof of concept, we present numerical experiments on quantum spin models with topological phases. After the optimization, we identify the topological phases by nonlocal order parameters as well as unsupervised machine learning on inner products between quantum states. The proposed method maximizes the advantage of using quantum computers while avoiding strenuous optimization on noisy quantum devices. In addition, our paper indicates that clustering technique combined with the fidelity measured on quantum computers could be useful for phase classification in condensed-matter physics.

TI Multiparticle quantum interference in Bogoliubov bosonic transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore the multiparticle transition probabilities in Gaussian unitaries effected by a two-mode Bogoliubov bosonic transformation on the mode annihilation and creation operators. We show that the transition probabilities can be characterized by remarkably simple, yet unsuspected recurrence equations involving a linear combination of probabilities. The recurrence exhibits an interferometric suppression term-a negative probability-which generalizes the seminal Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to more than two indistinguishable photons impinging on a beam splitter of rational transmittance. Unexpectedly, interferences thus originate in this description from the cancellation of probabilities instead of amplitudes. Our framework, which builds on the generating function of the non-Gaussian matrix elements of Gaussian unitaries in Fock basis, is illustrated here for the most common passive and active linear coupling between two optical modes driven by a beam splitter or a parametric amplifier. Hence, it also allows us to predict unsuspected multiphoton interference effects in an optical amplifier of rational gain. In particular, we confirm the newly found two-photon interferometric suppression effect in an amplifier of gain 2 originating from timelike indistinguishability [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 117, 33107 (2020)]. Overall, going beyond standard two-mode optical components, we expect our method will prove valuable for describing general quantum circuits involving Bogoliubov bosonic transformations.

TI Broadband electro-optic frequency comb with electrical and optical
   dual-resonance enhancement in lithium niobate
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC) has significant applications in fields such as spectroscopy, optical communications, high-precision measurements, and quantum technology, offering a flexible free spectral range (FSR) and stable spectral characteristics. Practical implementation of the EOFC requires high power and flattened comb teeth, which depend highly on optical losses and microwave modulation strength. In this work, we propose the integration of short-circuit electrodes to form a microwave resonant cavity, thereby enhancing the microwave modulation strength. The maximum modulation enhancement factor was measured to be 2.77 at approximately 20 GHz. Furthermore, the spectral bandwidth of the electricalresonator-enhanced electro-optic frequency comb (ERE-EOFC) generator was 71 nm, 1.7 times broader than that of a generator without resonant electrodes.

TI Error Probability Mitigation in Quantum Reading Using Classical Codes
SO ENTROPY
AB A general framework describing the statistical discrimination of an ensemble of quantum channels is given by the name quantum reading. Several tools can be applied in quantum reading to reduce the error probability in distinguishing the ensemble of channels. Classical and quantum codes can be envisioned for this goal. The aim of this paper is to present a simple but fruitful protocol for this task using classical error-correcting codes. Three families of codes are considered: Reed-Solomon codes, BCH codes, and Reed-Muller codes. In conjunction with the use of codes, we also analyze the role of the receiver. In particular, heterodyne and Dolinar receivers are taken into consideration. The encoding and measurement schemes are connected by the probing step. As probes, we consider coherent states. In such a simple manner, interesting results are obtained. As we show, there is a threshold below which using codes surpass optimal and sophisticated schemes for any fixed rate and code. BCH codes in conjunction with Dolinar receiver turn out to be the optimal strategy for error mitigation in quantum reading.

TI Dynamical spatial light modulation in the ultraviolet spectral range
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Spatial light modulators enable arbitrary control of the intensity of optical light fields and facilitate a variety of applications in biology, astronomy, and atomic, molecular, and optical physics. For coherent light fields, holography, implemented through arbitrary phase modulation, represents a highly power-efficient technique to shape the intensity of light patterns. Here, we introduce and benchmark a spatial light modulator based on a piston micromirror array. In particular, we utilize the reflection-based device to demonstrate arbitrary beam shaping in the ultraviolet (UV) regime at a wavelength of 322 nm. We correct aberrations of the reflected wave front and show that the modulator does not add detectable excess phase noise to the reflected light field. We utilize the intrinsically low latency of the architecture to demonstrate fast switching of arbitrary light patterns synchronized with short laser pulses at an update rate of 1 kHz. Finally, we outline how the modulator can act as an important component of a zone-based architecture for a neutral-atom quantum computer or simulator, including UV wavelengths.

TI Computing the Many-Body Green's Function with Adaptive Variational
   Quantum Dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We present a method to compute the many-body real-time Green's function using an adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation approach. The real-time Green's function involves the time evolution of a quantum state with one additional electron with respect to the ground state wave function that is first expressed as a linear-linear combination of state vectors. The real-time evolution and the Green's function are obtained by combining the dynamics of the individual state vectors in a linear combination. The use of the adaptive protocol enables us to generate compact ansatzes on-the-fly while running the simulation. In order to improve the convergence of spectral features, Pade ' approximants are applied to obtain the Fourier transform of the Green's function. We demonstrate the evaluation of the Green's function on an IBM Q quantum computer. As a part of our error mitigation strategy, we develop a resolution-enhancing method that we successfully apply on the noisy data from the real-quantum hardware.

TI Efficient Classical Simulation and Benchmarking of Quantum Processes in
   the Weyl Basis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB One of the crucial steps in building a scalable quantum computer is to identify the noise sources which lead to errors in the process of quantum evolution. Different implementations come with multiple hardware-dependent sources of noise and decoherence making the problem of their detection many foldly more complex. We develop a randomized benchmarking algorithm which uses Weyl unitaries to efficiently identify and learn a mixture of error models which occur during the computation. We provide an efficiently computable estimate of the overhead required to compute expectation values on outputs of the noisy circuit relying only on the locality of the interactions and no further assumptions on the circuit structure. The overhead decreases with the noise rate and this enables us to compute analytic noise bounds that imply efficient classical simulability. We apply our methods to ansatz circuits that appear in the variational quantum eigensolver and establish an upper bound on classical simulation complexity as a function of noise, identifying regimes when they become classically efficiently simulatable.

TI Reducing training data needs with minimal multilevel machine learning
   (M3L)
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB For many machine learning applications in science, data acquisition, not training, is the bottleneck even when avoiding experiments and relying on computation and simulation. Correspondingly, and in order to reduce cost and carbon footprint, training data efficiency is key. We introduce minimal multilevel machine learning (M3L) which optimizes training data set sizes using a loss function at multiple levels of reference data in order to minimize a combination of prediction error with overall training data acquisition costs (as measured by computational wall-times). Numerical evidence has been obtained for calculated atomization energies and electron affinities of thousands of organic molecules at various levels of theory including HF, MP2, DLPNO-CCSD(T), DFHFCABS, PNOMP2F12, and PNOCCSD(T)F12, and treating them with basis sets TZ, cc-pVTZ, and AVTZ-F12. Our M3L benchmarks for reaching chemical accuracy in distinct chemical compound sub-spaces indicate substantial computational cost reductions by factors of similar to 1.01, 1.1, 3.8, 13.8, and 25.8 when compared to heuristic sub-optimal multilevel machine learning (M2L) for the data sets QM7b, QM9 LCCSD ( T ) , Electrolyte Genome Project, QM9 AE CCSD ( T ) , and QM9 EA CCSD ( T ) , respectively. Furthermore, we use M2L to investigate the performance for 76 density functionals when used within multilevel learning and building on the following levels drawn from the hierarchy of Jacobs Ladder: LDA, GGA, mGGA, and hybrid functionals. Within M2L and the molecules considered, mGGAs do not provide any noticeable advantage over GGAs. Among the functionals considered and in combination with LDA, the three on average top performing GGA and Hybrid levels for atomization energies on QM9 using M3L correspond respectively to PW91, KT2, B97D, and tau-HCTH, B3LYP & lowast; (VWN5), and TPSSH.

TI Monolithically integrated femtosecond optical parametric oscillators
SO OPTICA
AB Synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are highly efficient sources of long-wavelength pulses and nonclassical light, making them invaluable for applications in spectroscopy, metrology, multi-photon microscopy, and quantum computation. Typical systems based on free-space cavities either operate non-degenerately, which limits their efficiency, or use active feedback control to achieve degenerate operation, which limits these systems to dedicated low-noise environments. In this work, we demonstrate a femtosecond monolithically integrated OPO. In contrast with bulk OPOs, our monolithic 10 GHz cavity, based on reverse-proton-exchanged lithium niobate, operates stably without active locking. By detuning the repetition rate of the free-running pump laser from the cavity free spectral range, we control the intracavity pulse dynamics and observe many of the operating regimes previously encountered in free-space degenerate OPOs, such as box-pulsing and quadratic bright-dark solitons (simultons), in addition to non-degenerate operation. When operated in the simulton regime and pumped with 125 fs pulses at 1 mu m, this monolithic OPO chip outputs broadband sech2 pulses (63 nm, 3 dB) with tens of milliwatts of average power.

TI Identification of a Kitaev quantum spin liquid by magnetic field angle
   dependence
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum spin liquids realize massive entanglement and fractional quasiparticles from localized spins, proposed as an avenue for quantum science and technology. In particular, topological quantum computations are suggested in the non-abelian phase of Kitaev quantum spin liquid with Majorana fermions, and detection of Majorana fermions is one of the most outstanding problems in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we propose a concrete way to identify the non-abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid by magnetic field angle dependence. Topologically protected critical lines exist on a plane of magnetic field angles, and their shapes are determined by microscopic spin interactions. A chirality operator plays a key role in demonstrating microscopic dependences of the critical lines. We also show that the chirality operator can be used to evaluate topological properties of the non-abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid without relying on Majorana fermion descriptions. Experimental criteria for the non-abelian spin liquid state are provided for future experiments.

TI Controllable nonreciprocal single-photon frequency converter via a
   four-level system
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We propose an efficient, nonreciprocal single-photon device that achieves single-photon routing and frequency conversion through chiral coupling of two one-dimensional waveguides with a four-level atom. Photons incoming from one port can be definitely directed to another port. However, the photon frequency conversion has been achieved only when the single photons are transferred from one waveguide to the other, and its probability can reach unity. Applied the on-demand classical field to drive an atom, the transmission quantum tunneling path can be turned off and on by exploiting the Autler-Townes splitting mechanism. Our results illustrate the potential of our device for applications in a quantum network.

TI Widely flexible and finely adjustable nonlocal dispersion cancellation
   with wavelength tuning
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In fiber-based quantum information processing with energy-time entangled photon pairs, optimized dispersion compensation is vital to preserve the strong temporal correlation of the photon pairs. We propose and experimentally verify that, by simply tuning the wavelength of the entangled photon pairs, nonlocal dispersion cancellation (NDC) can provide a widely flexible and finely adjustable solution for optimizing the dispersion compensation, which cannot be reached with the traditional local dispersion cancellation (LDC) instead. By way of example, when a 50 km-long single-mode fiber (SMF) is dispersion compensated by a 6.2-km-long commercial dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) based on the LDC configuration, it will lead to an almost invariant over-compensation in the wavelength range of 1500-1600 nm which restricts the observed temporal coincidence width of the self-developed energy-time entangled photon-pairs source to a minimum of similar to 110 ps. While in the NDC configuration, the dispersion compensation can be readily optimized by tuning the signal wavelength to 1565.7 nm and a minimum coincidence width of 86.1 +/- 0.7 ps is observed, which is mainly limited by the jitter of the single-photon detection system. Furthermore, such optimized dispersion compensation can also be achieved as the fiber length varies from 48 km to 60 km demonstrating the wide flexibility of NDC. Thanks to these capabilities, elaborate dispersion compensation modules are no longer required, which makes NDC a more versatile tool in fiber-based quantum information and metrology applications.

TI Classical and quantum evolution in a simple coherent neutrino problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The extraordinary neutrino flux produced in extreme astrophysical environments like the early Universe, core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers may produce coherent quantum neutrino oscillations on macroscopic length scales. The Hamiltonian describing this evolution can be mapped into quantum spin models with all-to-all couplings arising from neutrino-neutrino forward scattering. To date many studies of these oscillations have been performed in a mean-field limit where the neutrinos time evolve in a product state. In this paper we examine a simple two-beam model evolving from an initial product state and compare the mean-field and many-body evolution. The symmetries in this model allow us to solve the realtime evolution for the quantum many-body system for hundreds or thousands of spins, far beyond what would be possible in a more general case with an exponential number (2N) of quantum states. We compare mean-field and many-body solutions for different initial product states and ratios of one- and two-body couplings, and find that in all cases in the limit of infinite spins the mean-field (product state) and manybody solutions coincide for simple observables. This agreement can be understood as a consequence of the fact that the typical initial condition represents a very local but dense distribution about a mean energy in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. We explore quantum information measures like entanglement entropy and purity of the many-body solutions, finding intriguing relationships between the quantum information measures and the dynamical behavior of simple physical observables.

TI Bayesian inference of general noise-model parameters from the syndrome
   statistics of surface codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The performance of error correction in the surface code can be enhanced by leveraging the knowledge of the noise model for physical qubits. To provide accurate noise information to the decoder in parallel with quantum computation, an adaptive estimation of the noise model based on syndrome measurement statistics is an effective approach. While noise-model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well established for Pauli noise, it remains unexplored for more complex and realistic scenarios such as amplitude damping, which cannot be represented as a Pauli channel. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference methods for general noise models, integrating a tensor network simulator of surface code, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic scenario, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present numerical results of applying our proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and nonuniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.

TI Ferroelectric topological superconductor: α-In 2 Se
   3
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A two-dimensional topological superconductor (TSC) represents an exotic quantum material with quasiparticle excitation manifesting in dispersive Majorana modes (DMMs) at the boundaries. A domain -wall DMM can arise at the boundary between two TSC domains with opposite Chern numbers or with a n - -phase shift in their pairing gap, which can only be tuned by a magnetic field. Here we propose the concept of a ferroelectric (FE) TSC, which not only enriches the domain -wall DMMs but also significantly makes them electrically tunable. The n - -phase shift of the pairing gap is shown to be attained between two TSC domains of opposite FE polarization, and switchable by reversing FE polarizations. In combination with ferromagnetic (FM) polarization, the domain wall can host helical, doubled chiral, and fused DMMs, which can be transferred into each other by changing the direction of the electrical and/or magnetic field. Furthermore, based on first -principles calculations, we demonstrate alpha -In 2 Se 3 to be a promising FE TSC candidate in proximity with a FM layer and a superconductor substrate. We envision that a FE TSC will significantly ease the manipulation of a DMM by electrical field to realize fault -tolerant quantum computation.

TI Anisotropic multiband superconductivity in 2M-WS2 probed by controlled
   disorder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The intrinsically superconducting Dirac semimetal 2M-WS2 is a promising candidate for realizing proximityinduced topological superconductivity in its protected surface states. A precise characterization of the bulk superconducting state is essential to understand the nature of surface superconductivity in the system. Here, we report a detailed experimental study of the temperature -dependent London penetration depth, lambda(T ), the upper critical field, Hc2(T ), and the effects of nonmagnetic disorder on these quantities, as well as on the superconducting transition temperature Tc in single crystals of 2M-WS2. We observe a power -law variation of lambda(T) proportional to T3 at temperatures below 0.35Tc. Nonmagnetic pointlike disorder induced by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation at various doses results in a significant suppression of Tc. These observations are markedly different from expectations for a fully gapped isotropic s -wave superconductor. Together with the substantial increase of slope, dHc2/dT |T =Tc, with increasing disorder, our results suggest a strongly anisotropic s++ multiband superconducting state. These results have direct consequences for the expected proximity -induced superconductivity of the topological surface states.

TI Quantum state over time is unique
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The conventional framework of quantum theory treats space and time in vastly different ways by representing temporal correlations via quantum channels and spatial correlations via multipartite quantum states-an imbalance absent in classical probability theory. Since Leifer and Spekkens [Phys. Rev. A 88, 052130 (2013)] called for a causally neutral formulation of quantum theory in their seminal work, numerous attempts have been made to rectify this asymmetry by proposing a dynamical description of a quantum system encapsulated by a static quantum state over time, without a definite consensus on which one is most appropriate. In this paper, we propose sets of operationally motivated axioms for quantum states over time alternative to the ones proposed by Fullwood and Parzygnat [Proc. R. Soc. A 478, 20220104 (2022)], which we show is unable to induce a unique quantum state over time. Our proposed axioms are better suited to describe quantum states over any spacetime regions beyond two points. Through this reformulation, we prove that the Fullwood-Parzygnat state over time uniquely satisfies all these operational axioms, unifying the bipartite spacetime correlations of quantum systems.

TI Low-energy in-gap states of vortices in superconductor-semiconductor
   heterostructures
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The recent interest in the low-energy states in vortices of semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures are mainly fuelled by the prospects of using Majorana zero modes for quantum computation. The knowledge of low-lying states in the vortex core is essential as they pose a limitation on the topological computation with these states. Recently, the low-energy spectra of clean heterostructures, for superconducting-pairing profiles that vary slowly on the scale of the Fermi wavelength of the semiconductor, have been analytically calculated. In this work, we formulate an alternative method based on perturbation theory to obtain concise analytical formulas to predict the low-energy states including explicit magnetic-field and gap profiles. We provide results for both a topological insulator (with a linear spectrum) as well as for a conventional electron gas (with a quadratic spectrum). We discuss the spectra for a wide range of parameters, including both the size of the vortex and the chemical potential of the semiconductor, and thereby provide a tool to guide future experimental efforts. We compare these findings to numerical results.

TI Nano-assembled open quantum dot nanotube devices
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB A pristine suspended carbon nanotube is a near ideal environment to host long-lived quantum states. For this reason, they have been used as the core element of qubits and to explore numerous condensed matter physics phenomena. One of the most advanced technique to realize complex carbon nanotube based quantum circuits relies on a mechanical integration of the nanotube into the circuit. Despite the high-quality and complexity of the fabricated circuits, the range of possible experiments was limited to the closed quantum dot regime. Here, by engineering a transparent metal-nanotube interface, we developed a technique that overcomes this limitation. We reliably reach the open quantum dot regime as demonstrated by measurements of Fabry-Perot interferences and Kondo physics in multiple devices. A circuit-nanotube alignment precision of +/- 200 nm is demonstrated. Our technique allows to envision experiments requiring the combination of complex circuits and strongly coupled carbon nanotubes such as the realization of carbon nanotube superconducting qubits or flux-mediated optomechanics experiments.
   Suspended carbon nanotubes are ideal for hosting long-lived quantum states but mechanically integrating nanotubes into circuits is challenging. Here, by engineering a transparent metal-nanotube interface, the authors can reach the open quantum dot regime and integrate the nanotube within the circuit with a 200 nm precision.

AB An indistinguishability obfuscator is a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm that takes a circuit as input and outputs a new circuit that has the same functionality as the input circuit, such that for any two circuits of the same size that compute the same function, the outputs of the indistinguishability obfuscator are indistinguishable. Here, we study schemes for indistinguishability obfuscation for quantum circuits. We present two definitions for indistinguishability obfuscation: in our first definition (qiO) the outputs of the obfuscator are required to be indistinguishable if the input circuits are perfectly equivalent, while in our second definition (qiO(D)), the outputs are required to be indistinguishable as long as the input circuits are approximately equivalent with respect to a pseudo-distance D. Our main results provide (1) a computationally-secure scheme for qiO where the size of the output of the obfuscator is exponential in the number of non-Clifford (T gates), which means that the construction is efficient as long as the number of T gates is logarithmic in the circuit size and (2) a statistically-secure qiO(D), for circuits that are close to the kth level of the Gottesman-Chuang hierarchy (with respect to D); this construction is efficient as long as k is small and fixed.

TI Photon-Number-Resolving Single-Photon Detector with a System Detection
   Efficiency of 98% and Photon-Number Resolution of 32
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Efficiently distinguishing photon numbers is a crucial yet challenging technology for various quantum information and quantum metrology applications. While superconducting transition edge sensors offer good photon-number-resolving (PNR) capabilities, they are hampered by low detection speed, timing jitter, and complex cooling and readout requirements. In this work, we present a significant advancement toward achieving high-fidelity PNR single-photon detectors by combing high efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detector and spatial multiplexing technology. The unique twin-layer configuration of superconducting nanowire atop a dielectric mirror ensures the near-unity detection efficiency. The segmented design, where each section is shunted by a resistor, enables spatial multiplexing, establishing a mapping relationship between pulse amplitude and registered photons. The fabricated detector exhibits impressive performance metrics, including a single-photon system detection efficiency (SDE) of similar to 98% at a dark count rate of 20 cps and photon-number resolution capability up to 32. Further characterization through detector tomography reveals high fidelities for two-, three-, and four-photon events, approximately 87%, 73%, and 40% respectively. Moreover, the detector operates at a high count rate of 41 MHz at 3 dB-SDE, with a low timing jitter of as low as 40 ps. With its near-unity efficiency, high photon-number resolution, low dark count rate, fast detection speed, and superior timing resolution, we expect significant interest in these detectors, promising substantial benefits for weak light detection and optical quantum information applications.

TI Generation of spectrally uncorrelated biphotons via fiber nonlinear
   quantum interference
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Spectrally uncorrelated biphotons are the essential resources for achieving various quantum information processing protocols. We theoretically investigate the generation of spectrally uncorrelated biphotons emitted by spontaneous four-wave mixing from a fiber nonlinear interferometer which consists of an N-stage nonlinear gain fiber and an (N-1)-stage dispersion modulation fiber. The output biphoton states of nonlinear interference are the coherent superposition of various biphoton states born in each nonlinear fiber, and thus the interference fringe will reshape the biphoton joint spectra. As a result, resorting to Taylor expansion to first order for phase mismatching, we theoretically verify that the orientation of phase matching contours will rotate in a specific way with only varying the length of dispersion modulation fiber. The rotation in orientation of phase matching contours may result in spectrally uncorrelated biphotons and even arbitrary correlation biphotons. Further, we choose micro/nanofiber as the nonlinear gain fiber and single-mode communication fiber as dispersion modulation fiber to numerically simulate the generation of spectrally uncorrelated biphotons from spontaneous fourwave mixing. Here, due to significant frequency detuning (hundreds of THz), Raman background noise can be considerably suppressed, even at room temperature, and photons with largely tunable wavelengths can be achieved, indicating a practicability in many quantum fields. A photon mode purity of 97.2% will be theoretically attained without weakening the heralding nature of biphoton sources. We think that this fiber nonlinear interference with the flexibly engineered quantum state can be an excellent practical source for quantum information processing.

TI Diagonal unitary and orthogonal symmetries in quantum theory
SO QUANTUM
AB We analyze bipartite matrices and linear maps between matrix algebras, which are respectively, invariant and covariant, under the diagonal unitary and orthogonal groups' actions. By presenting an expansive list of examples from the literature, which includes notable entries like the Diagonal Symmetric states and the Choi-type maps, we show that this class of matrices (and maps) encompasses a wide variety of scenarios, thereby unifying their study. We examine their linear algebraic structure and investigate different notions of positivity through their convex conic manifestations. In particular, we generalize the well-known cone of completely positive matrices to that of triplewise completely positive matrices and connect it to the separability of the relevant invariant states (or the entanglement breaking property of the corresponding quantum channels). For linear maps, we provide explicit characterizations of the stated covariance in terms of their Kraus, Stinespring, and Choi representations, and systematically analyze the usual properties of positivity, decomposability, complete positivity, and the like. We also describe the invariant subspaces of these maps and use their structure to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of the associated invariant states.

TI Digital toolbox for vector field characterization
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Vectorial structured light fields have displayed properties advantageous in many disciplines ranging from communications, microscopy and metrology to laser cutting and characterizing quantum channels. The generation of these fields has been made convenient through the implementation of nanophotonic metasurfaces amongst other static and digital techniques. Consequently, the detection and characterisation of these fields is of equal importance. Most existing techniques involve using separate polarization optics and correlation filters to perform the projective measurements - or are only able to perform such measurements on a subset of possible vector states. We present a compact, fully automated measurement technique based on a digital micro-mirror device (DMD), which facilitates the complete, local and global, characterisation of the spatial mode and polarization degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) for arbitrary vectorial fields. We demonstrate our approach through the identification of relevant hybrid-order Poincare spheres, the reconstruction of state vectors on these spheres, as well as the recovery of the non-separability and states-of-polarization for a variety of vector beams.

TI Quantumbit Cosmology Explains Effects of Rotation Curves of Galaxies
SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB Some terms identify enigmata of today's cosmology: "Inflation" is expected to explain the homogeneity and isotropy of the cosmic background. The repulsive force of a "dark energy" shall prevent a re-collapse of the cosmos. The additional gravitational effect of a "dark matter" was originally supposed to explain the deviations of the rotation curves of the galaxies from Kepler's laws. Adopting a theory founded on the core notion of absolute quantum information-Protyposis-being a cosmological concept from the outset, the observed phenomena can be explained without postulating further unknown specific "particles" or "fields". Moreover, this theory allows for a rationalization of the fact that huge black holes with their enormous jet structures, acting as "seeds" of the galaxies, are detected ever closer to the big bang. The problem of the rotation curves in the galaxies can be addressed outside of General Relativity within a Newtonian approximation: by an attenuation of the gravitational acceleration as in the modified Newtonian dynamics, or by the effect of additional invisible "particles of dark matter", yet unknown and not yet established in natural sciences. Within the Protyposis theory, these problems are solved without having to invent a lot of parameters. The cosmology of the Protyposis causes the change of the gravitational acceleration in the vicinity of large (black hole) masses and, at the same time, avoids a recollapse of the cosmos for which a cosmological constant or "dark energy" was invented.

However, resolving charges at the lattice scale in a time-resolved manner has not been achieved so far. Here, we present the development of an electrometer with 60 ns acquisition steps, leveraging on the spectroscopy of an optically-active spin defect embedded in a solid-state material with a non-linear Stark response. By applying our approach to diamond, a widely used platform for quantum technology applications, we can distinguish the distinct charge traps at the lattice scale, quantify their impact on transport dynamics and noise generation, analyze relevant material properties, and develop strategies for material optimization.

SO COMPUTER SCIENCE JOURNAL OF MOLDOVA
AB A new form of the hidden discrete logarithm problem, called split logarithm problem, is introduced as primitive of practical post-quantum digital signature schemes, which is characterized in using two non-permutable elements A and B of a finite non-commutative associative algebra, which are used to compute generators Q = AB and G = BQ of two finite cyclic groups of prime order q. The public key is calculated as a triple of vectors (Y, Z, T): Y = Q(x), Z = G(w), and T = Q(a) B(-1)G(b), where x, w, a, and b are random integers. Security of the signature scheme is defined by the computational difficulty of finding the pair of integers (x, w), although, using a quantum computer, one can easily find the ratio x/w mod q.

TI Intelligent Structure Searching and Designs for Nanoclusters: Effective
   Units in Atomic Manufacturing
SO ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Clusters, an aggregation of several to thousands of atoms, molecules, or ions, are the building blocks of novel functional materials by atomic manufacturing and exhibit excellent applications in catalysis, quantum information, and nanomedicine. The evolution of cluster structures has been studied for many years. Many effective structural search methods, such as genetic algorithm, basin-hopping, and so on, have been developed. However, the efficient execution of these methods relies on precise energy calculators, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Up to now, limited by computational methods and capabilities, the researches mainly focus on free-standing clusters, which are different from clusters in practical applications. Recently, the rapid development of big data-driven machine learning is expected to replace DFT for high-precision large-scale computing. In this review, the present cluster search methods and challenges currently faced have been summarized. It is proposed that the development of artificial intelligence has the potential to solve some practical problems including the structural and properties evolution of clusters in complex environment, causing revolutionary developments in the fields of catalysis, quantum information, and nanomedicine based on clusters.

TI High-quality factor Ta2O5-on-insulator resonators with ultimate thermal

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Experiments in photonics, laser optics, and quantum technology require low-loss, thermal, and mechanical stability. While photonic integrated circuits on monolithic chips achieve interferometric stability, important nanophotonic material systems suffer from propagation loss, thermal drift, and noise that prevent, for example, precise frequency stabilization of resonators. Here we show that tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) on insulator micro-ring resonators combine quality factors beyond 1.8 Mio with vanishing temperaturedependent wavelength shift in a relevant 70 K to 90 K temperature range. Our Ta2O5-on-SiO2 devices will thus enable athermal operation at liquid nitrogen temperatures, paving the way for ultra-stable low-cost resonators, as desired for wavelength division multiplexing, on chip frequency stabilization and low-noise optical frequency comb generation.

TI Controlled Remote Implementation of Operations via Graph States

AB Protocols are proposed for controlled remote implementation of operations here.

The control power analysis shows that without the controller's permission, eight specified operations can be implemented with the success rate of 50%, other operations can be realized with the success rate of 25%, and thus the control power is reliable. All the implementation requirements of this protocol can be satisfied by means of local operations and classical communications, and the experimental feasibility is presented according to current techniques. The entanglement requirement of this protocol is characterized in terms of geometric measure of entanglement. It turns out to be economic to realize the control function from the perspective of entanglement cost.

TI Multi-state quantum simulations via model-space quantum imaginary time
   evolution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We introduce the framework of model space into quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) to enable stable estimation of ground and excited states using a quantum computer. Model-space QITE (MSQITE) propagates a model space to the exact one by retaining its orthogonality, and hence is able to describe multiple states simultaneously. The quantum Lanczos (QLanczos) algorithm is extended to MSQITE to accelerate the convergence. The present scheme is found to outperform both the standard QLanczos and the recently proposed folded-spectrum QITE in simulating excited states. Moreover, we demonstrate that spin contamination can be effectively removed by shifting the imaginary time propagator, and thus excited states with a particular spin quantum number are efficiently captured without falling into the different spin states that have lower energies. We also investigate how different levels of the unitary approximation employed in MSQITE can affect the results. The effectiveness of the algorithm over QITE is demonstrated by noise simulations for the H4 model system.

TI Entanglement transitions from restricted Boltzmann machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The search for novel entangled phases of matter has lead to the recent discovery of a new class of "entanglement transitions," exemplified by random tensor networks and monitored quantum circuits. Most known examples can be understood as some classical ordering transitions in an underlying statistical mechanics model, where entanglement maps onto the free-energy cost of inserting a domain wall. In this paper we study the possibility of entanglement transitions driven by physics beyond such statistical mechanics mappings. Motivated by recent applications of neural-network-inspired variational Ansatze, we investigate under what conditions on the variational parameters these Ansatze can capture an entanglement transition. We study the entanglement scaling of short-range restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) quantum states with random phases. For uncorrelated random phases, we analytically demonstrate the absence of an entanglement transition and reveal subtle finite-size effects in finite-size numerical simulations. Introducing phases with correlations decaying as 1 /r(alpha) in real space, we observe three regions with a different scaling of entanglement entropy depending on the exponent alpha. We study the nature of the transition between these regions, finding numerical evidence for critical behavior. Our work establishes the presence of long-range correlated phases in RBM-based wave functions as a required ingredient for entanglement transitions.

TI Infinite dimensionality of the post-processing order of measurements on
   a general state space
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB For a partially ordered set (S, ?), the order (monotone) dimension is the minimum cardinality of total orders (respectively, real-valued order monotone functions) on S that characterize the order ?. In this paper we consider an arbitrary generalized probabilistic theory and the set of finite-outcome measurements on it, which can be described by effect-valued measures, equipped with the classical post-processing orders. We prove that the order and order monotone dimensions of the post-processing order are (countably) infinite if the state space is not a singleton (and is separable in the norm topology). This result gives a negative answer to the open question for quantum measurements posed in (Guff et al 2021 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 225301). We also consider the quantum post-processing relation of channels with a fixed input quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space H and show that the order (monotone) dimension is countably infinite when dim H (sic)2.

TI Linear growth of circuit complexity from Brownian dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB How rapidly can a many-body quantum system generate randomness? Using path integral methods, we demonstrate that Brownian quantum systems have circuit complexity that grows linearly with time. In particular, we study Brownian clusters of N spins or fermions with time-dependent all-to-all interactions, and calculate the Frame Potential to characterize complexity growth in these models. In both cases the problem can be mapped to an effective statistical mechanics problem which we study using path integral methods. Within this framework it is straightforward to show that the kth Frame Potential comes within e of the Haar value after a time of order t similar to kN + k log k + log epsilon(-1). Using a bound on the diamond norm, this implies that such circuits are capable of coming very close to a unitary k-design after a time of order t similar to kN. We also consider the same question for systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and argue that a small amount of time-dependent randomness is sufficient to generate a k-design in linear time provided the underlying Hamiltonian is quantum chaotic. These models provide explicit examples of linear complexity growth that are analytically tractable and are directly applicable to practical applications calling for unitary k-designs.

TI Quantum sampling algorithms, phase transitions, and computational
   complexity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Drawing independent samples from a probability distribution is an important computational problem with applications in Monte Carlo algorithms, machine learning, and statistical physics. The problem can be solved in principle on a quantum computer by preparing a quantum state that encodes the entire probability distribution followed by a projective measurement. We investigate the complexity of adiabatically preparing such quantum states for the Gibbs distributions of various classical models including the Ising chain, hard-sphere models on different graphs, and a model encoding the unstructured search problem. By constructing a parent Hamiltonian, whose ground state is the desired quantum state, we relate the asymptotic scaling of the state preparation time to the nature of transitions between distinct quantum phases. These insights enable us to identify adiabatic paths that achieve a quantum speedup over classical Markov chain algorithms. In addition, we show that parent Hamiltonians for the problem of sampling from independent sets on certain graphs can be naturally realized with neutral atoms interacting via highly excited Rydberg states.

TI Triplet-pair spin signatures from macroscopically aligned heteroacenes
   in an oriented single crystal
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The photo-driven process of singlet fission generates coupled triplet pairs (TT) with fundamentally intriguing and potentially useful properties. The quintet (TT0)-T-5 sublevel is particularly interesting for quantum information because it is highly entangled, is addressable with microwave pulses, and could be detected using optical techniques. Previous theoretical work on a model Hamiltonian and nonadiabatic transition theory, called the JDE model, has determined that this sublevel can be selectively populated if certain conditions are met. Among the most challenging, the molecules within the dimer undergoing singlet fission must have their principal magnetic axes parallel to one another and to an applied Zeeman field. Here, we present time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TR-EPR) spectroscopy of a single crystal sample of a tetracenethiophene compound featuring arrays of dimers aligned in this manner, which were mounted so that the orientation of the field relative to the molecular axes could be controlled. The observed spin sublevel populations in the paired TT and unpaired (T+T) triplets are consistent with predictions from the JDE model, including preferential (TT0)-T-5 formation at z parallel to B-0, with one caveat-two (TT)-T-5 spin sublevels have little to no population. This may be due to crossings between the (TT)-T-5 and (TT)-T-3 manifolds in the field range investigated by TR-EPR, consistent with the intertriplet exchange energy determined by monitoring photoluminescence at varying magnetic fields.

TI Exact solution of the topological symplectic Kondo problem
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB The Kondo effect is an archetypical phenomenon in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems. Recent attention has focused on the application of Kondo physics to quantum information science by exploiting overscreened Kondo impurities with residual anyon-like impurity entropy. While this physics was proposed in the fine-tuned multi-channel Kondo setup or in the Majorana-based topological Kondo effect, we here study the Kondo effect with symplectic symmetry Sp(2k) and present details about the implementation which importantly only involves conventional s-wave superconductivity coupled to an array of resonant levels and neither requires perfect channel symmetry nor Majorana fermions. We carefully discuss the role of perturbations and show that a global Zeeman drives the system to a 2-channel SU(k) fixed point. Exact results for the residual entropy, specific heat and magnetization are derived using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for Sp(2k). This solution not only proves the existence of a quantum critical ground state with anyon-like Hilbert space dimension, but also a particularly weak non-Fermi liquid behavior at criticality. We interpret the weakness of non-analyticities as a manifestation of suppressed density of states at the impurity causing only a very weak connection of putative anyons and conduction electrons. Given this weak connection, the simplicity of the design and the stability of the effect, we conjecture that the symplectic Kondo effect may be particularly suitable for quantum information applications.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI A genetic algorithm to generate maximally orthogonal frames in complex
   space
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A frame is a generalization of a basis of a vector space to a redundant overspanning set whose vectors are linearly dependent. Frames find applications in signal processing and quantum information theory. We present a genetic algorithm that can generate maximally orthogonal frames (MOFs) of arbitrary size n in d-dimensional complex space. First, we formalize the concept of MOF and demonstrate that it depends on the choice of an energy function to weigh the different pairwise overlaps between vectors. Then, we discuss the relation between different energy functions and well-known frame varieties such as tight and Grassmannian frames and complex projective p-designs. Obtaining MOFs poses a global non-convex minimization problem. We discuss the relation with established numerical problems such as the Thomson problem and the problem of finding optimal packings in complex projective space. To tackle the minimization, we design a hybrid genetic algorithm that features local optimization of the parents. To assess the performance of the algorithm, we propose two visualization techniques that allow us to analyze the coherence and uniformity of high-dimensional frames. The genetic algorithm is able to produce highly-symmetric universal frames, such as equiangular tight frames, symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measurements and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for configurations of up to d = 6 and n = 36, with runtimes of the order of several minutes on a regular desktop computer for the largest configurations.

TI Controllability of the periodic quantum Ising spin chain and the Onsager
   algebra
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The Ising spin model is a fundamental theoretical model in statistical physics which has received large attention in the context of quantum phase transitions (Sachdev S 2011 Quantum Phase Transitions (Cambridge University) Press) and, more recently, in quantum information (King et al 2022 Nat. Phys. 18 1324-8). In this paper, we present a controllability analysis of the quantum Ising periodic chain (1-dimensional) of n spin 12 particles (Pfeuty 1970 Ann. Phys 57 79-90) where the interpolating parameter between the two Hamiltonians plays the role of the control. The controllability is characterized by the dynamical Lie algebra generated by the two Hamiltonians (D'Alessandro 2021 Introduction to Quantum Control and Dynamics (CRC Press Taylor and Francis)). It is known (see, e.g. (Minami 2021 Nucl. Phys. B 973 115599; Roan 1991 Max-Plank-. Math.; Von Gehlen and Rittenberg 1985 Nucl. Phys. B 257 351-70) that such a Lie algebra is an Onsager algebra. We present an alternative derivation of this result which is based on the algebra of Pauli matrices and Pauli strings. This derivation displays the explicit basis of the Lie algebra and of its simple ideals and center in the relevant representation of the space of n qubits (C2)circle times n. We discuss how these results match the ones of the seminal paper by Onsager (Onsager 1944 Phys. Rev. 65 3-4) which were obtained in the context of classical statistical mechanics. Applications to quantum information and control are also discussed.

AB Re-synthesis techniques are utilized to optimize the quantum circuit. To enable scalable re-synthesis a divide-and-conquer approach is adopted that partitions the circuit into smaller blocks, which are optimized independently. Several algorithms have been proposed to minimize the block number while maximizing the gate count of each block. However, they vary in their performance and may not yield the highest output fidelity. We propose a reinforcement learning-based quantum circuit partitioning framework that incorporates the physical properties of the quantum hardware to maximize the output fidelity post-quantum circuit optimization. To accelerate the training, we also propose a noise injection method that enables on-the-fly optimization in the reinforcement learning environment, independent of the adopted optimization/re-synthesis method at the block level. We evaluate our approach compared to different partitioning techniques using various quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Q Hanoi quantum computer.

TI Recovery of the secret on Binary Ring-LWE problem using random known

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS

Some of these systems are based on the Binary Ring-LWE problem which is presumed to be difficult to solve even on a quantum computer. This problem is considered secure for IoT (Internet of Things) devices with limited resources. In Binary Ring-LWE, a polynomial a is selected randomly and a polynomial b is calculated as b = a.s + e where the secret s and the noise e are polynomials with binary coefficients. The polynomials b and a are public and the secret s is hard to find. However, there are Side Channel Attacks that can be applied to retrieve some coefficients (random known bits) of s and e. In this work, we analyze that the secret s can be retrieved successfully having at least 50% of random known bits of s and e.

TI Measurement of work and heat in the classical and quantum regimes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Despite the increasing interest, the research field which studies the concepts of work and heat at the quantum level has suffered from two main drawbacks: first, the difficulty to properly define and measure the work, heat, and internal energy variation in a quantum system and, second, the lack of experiments. Here, we report a full characterization of the dissipated heat, work, and internal energy variation in a two-level quantum system interacting with an engineered environment. We use the IBMQ quantum computer to implement the driven system's dynamics in a dissipative environment. The experimental data allow us to construct quasiprobability distribution functions from which we recover the correct averages of work, heat, and internal energy variation in the dissipative processes. Interestingly, by increasing the environment coupling strength, we observe a reduction of the pure quantum features of the energy exchange processes that we interpret as the emergence of the classical limit. This makes the present approach a privileged tool to study, understand, and exploit quantum effects in energy exchanges.

TI Dynamical transition in controllable quantum neural networks with large
   depth
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Understanding the training dynamics of quantum neural networks is a fundamental task in quantum information science with wide impact in physics, chemistry and machine learning. In this work, we show that the late-time training dynamics of quantum neural networks with a quadratic loss function can be described by the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, leading to a transcritical bifurcation transition in the dynamics. When the targeted value of loss function crosses the minimum achievable value from above to below, the dynamics evolve from a frozen-kernel dynamics to a frozen-error dynamics, showing a duality between the quantum neural tangent kernel and the total error. In both regions, the convergence towards the fixed point is exponential, while at the critical point becomes polynomial. We provide a non-perturbative analytical theory to explain the transition via a restricted Haar ensemble at late time, when the output state approaches the steady state. Via mapping the Hessian to an effective Hamiltonian, we also identify a linearly vanishing gap at the transition point. Compared with the linear loss function, we show that a quadratic loss function within the frozen-error dynamics enables a speedup in the training convergence. The theory findings are verified experimentally on IBM quantum devices.
   Understanding the training dynamics of quantum neural networks is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Here, the authors show how these follow generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, revealing a transition between frozen-kernel, critical point and frozen-error dynamics. Theoretical findings, validated on IBM devices, provide insight to cost function design.

TI Superimposed Bragg gratings and entangled biphoton dispersion management
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Quantum optical integrated circuits have heralded a paradigm shift in the realm of quantum information processing. Integrated photonics technology now empowers the creation of intricate optical circuits on single chips. While optical integrated circuits used to pose formidable challenges for numerous quantum applications, they have, in recent times, evolved to satisfy stringent requirements across a spectrum of research and industrial domains. Today, it is imperative to delve into research aimed at both crafting and preserving quantum properties within photonic substrates. Superimposed Bragg grating structures have emerged as valuable components within optical applications, poised to play pivotal roles in the development of integrated circuits. Nevertheless, these structures exhibit an inherent drawback in the form of dispersion, which can potentially compromise the preservation of quantum states. In this study, we meticulously scrutinize the physical attributes of these structures to elucidate the factors contributing to undesirable dispersion effects. We also investigate the correlation between two photons at the termination point of the structure. The superimposed Bragg grating structure under scrutiny boasts periods of both 1 and 3 micrometers, an overall length of 100 micrometers, and radiates at a wavelength of 1.55 micrometers. By subjecting photons to this medium individually or in tandem and analyzing their correlation function, we aim to pinpoint elements that effectively safeguard the quantum properties inherent in the system. This research endeavor is poised to yield valuable insights that will substantially influence the design of quantum integrated circuits, enhancing their efficacy in computational tasks and quantum information processing.

Here, we used a single-electron pump (SEP) for loading single electrons into a QD array as a preparatory step to use electrons as spin qubits. We used parallel gates in the QD array as a SEP and demonstrated 100 MHz operation with an accuracy of 99% at 4 K. By controlling the timing of a subsequent gate synchronously as a shutter, we found that the jitter representing electron transfer was less than 10 ns, which would be acceptable for a typical operating speed of around 1 MHz for silicon qubits.

TI Single-Mode Magnon-Polariton Lasing and Amplification Controlled by
   Dissipative Coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate single-mode lasing of magnon polaritons in a cavity magnonic system enabled by dissipative coupling between two passive modes, microwave cavity mode and magnon mode in a ferrimagnetic spin ensemble. The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon-polariton amplification arises between two real-frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions. Dissipative coupling offers an alternative paradigm for tailoring light-matter interactions, paving the way for advances in both information processing and quantum technologies.

TI Quantum coherence and distinguishability as complementary resources: A
   resource-theoretic perspective from wave-particle duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Wave-particle duality, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, encapsulates the complementary relationship between the wave and particle behaviors of quantum systems. In this paper, we treat quantum coherence and classical distinguishability as complementary resources and uncover a novel duality relation, which is explored through quantum state discrimination under incoherent operations, extending beyond typical interference scenarios. We prove that in an ensemble of mutually orthogonal pure states, the sum of "co-bits," quantifying the coherence preserved under incoherent free operations, and classical bits, representing the distinguishability extracted via quantum state discrimination, is bounded. This coherence-distinguishability duality relation exposes an inherent tradeoff between the simultaneous preservation of a system's quantum coherence (wavelike property) and the extraction of its classical distinguishability (particlelike property). Our findings provide a fresh perspective on wave-particle duality through quantum resource theories, offering complementary insights into manipulating quantum and classical resources, with implications for quantum foundations and quantum technologies.

TI Mixing thermal coherent states for precision and range enhancement in
   quantum thermometry
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The unavoidable interaction between thermal environments and quantum systems typically leads to the degradation of quantum coherence, which can be fought against by reservoir engineering. We propose the realization of a special mixture of thermal coherent states by coupling a thermal bath with a two-level system (TLS) that is longitudinally coupled to a resonator. We find that the state of the resonator is a special mixture of two oppositely displaced thermal coherent states, whereas the TLS remains thermal. This observation is verified by evaluating the second-order correlation coefficient for the resonator state. Moreover, we reveal the potential benefits of employing the mixture of thermal coherent states of the resonator in quantum thermometry. In this context, the resonator functions as a probe to measure the unknown temperature of a bath mediated by a TLS, strategically bridging the connection between the two. Our results show that the use of an ancillary-assisted probe may enhance the precision and broaden the applicable temperature range.

TI In situ photoemission spectroscopies to reveal surface transfer doping
   on hydrogenated milled nanodiamonds
SO CARBON
AB Nanodiamonds (ND) exhibit exceptional chemical, electronic, thermal, and optical properties, making them valuable for applications in nanomedicine, energy, quantum technologies, advanced lubricants, and polymer composites. Surface analysis techniques such as X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS) are critical for understanding the surface properties of nanomaterials, including nanodiamonds. This study investigates hydrogenated milled nanodiamonds (H-MND) by integrating UPS and XPS measurements with REELS. Through in situ annealing within an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber, we examine the impact of surface termination on surface conductivity, focusing on the role of adsorbates. Our findings reveal that a surface transfer doping mechanism, akin to that observed in bulk diamond, governs a pseudo p-type conductivity in H-MND. The conductivity dependence on ambient exposure, water, and subsequent annealing demonstrates its reversibility. The study also discusses the nature of electron acceptors and the influence of ND facets on conductivity.

TI Causes and Consequences of Ordering and Dynamic Phases of Confined
   Vortex Rows in Superconducting Nanostripes
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Understanding the behaviour of vortices under nanoscale confinement in superconducting circuits is important for the development of superconducting electronics and quantum technologies. Using numerical simulations based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory for non-homogeneous superconductivity in the presence of magnetic fields, we detail how lateral confinement organises vortices in a long superconducting nanostripe, presenting a phase diagram of vortex configurations as a function of the stripe width and magnetic field. We discuss why the average vortex density is reduced and reveal that confinement influences vortex dynamics in the dissipative regime under sourced electrical current, mapping out transitions between asynchronous and synchronous vortex rows crossing the nanostripe as the current is varied. Synchronous crossings are of particular interest, since they cause single-mode modulations in the voltage drop along the stripe in a high (typically GHz to THz) frequency range.

TI Large-scale stochastic simulation of open quantum systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Understanding interactions between quantum systems and their environments is crucial for developing stable quantum technologies and accurate physical models. Yet, simulating open quantum systems with non-unitary dynamics remains computationally demanding. We introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable and embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. The TJM extends the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) approach to matrix product states, employs a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to minimize evolution errors, and introduces a sampling MPS to reduce timestep dependence. This method scales efficiently, ensuring convergence to Lindbladian dynamics independent of system size, as demonstrated both rigorously and numerically. We showcase its utility by simulating XXX Heisenberg models with up to a thousand spins on a consumer-grade CPU. The TJM represents a significant advance in open quantum system simulation, enabling exploration of dissipative many-body dynamics and the design of more stable quantum hardware.

TI Crystal engineering of rare earth heteroleptic complexes: phosphine
   oxide ligand control, POM-directed assembly, and performance metrics
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB This study explores crystal engineering strategies for rare earth heteroleptic complexes, focusing on ligand design, supramolecular control, and functional performance. Phosphine oxide ligands (TPPO) synergize steric/electronic effects to stabilize coordination geometries, while mixed-ligand systems (e.g., TPPO/phen) enhance Eu3+ luminescence (26.88% quantum yield). Polyoxometalates (POMs) template 3D architectures via hydrogen/charge interactions, enabling >95% photocatalytic dye degradation and >200 degrees C thermal stability. Rare earth-transition metal systems integrate 2D/3D topologies and multifunctionality (luminescence, gas adsorption) through electronic coupling. Additionally, carbon-based oxygen ligand systems (e.g., beta-diketonates) demonstrate the applicability of these core strategies-leveraging synergistic N-donor coordination and supramolecular interactions to achieve advanced functionalities like temperature-responsive luminescence. Future work will prioritize flexible ligand engineering and stimuli-responsive designs for applications in clean energy and quantum technologies, establishing a roadmap for advanced rare earth materials.

TI Spectral features of Pb-related color centers in diamond - a systematic
   photoluminescence characterization
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report on the systematic characterization of the optical properties of diamond color centers based on Pb impurities. An ensemble photoluminescence analysis of their spectral emission was performed at different excitation wavelengths in the 405-520 nm range and at different temperatures in the 4-300 K range. The series of observed spectral features consist of different emission lines associated with Pb-related defects. Finally, a room-temperature investigation of single-photon emitters under 490.5 nm laser excitation is reported, revealing different spectral signatures with respect to those already reported under 514 nm excitation. This work represents a substantial progress with respect to previous studies on Pb-related color centers, both in the attribution of an articulated series of spectral features and in the understanding of the formation process of this type of defect, thus clarifying the potential of this system for high-impact applications in quantum technologies.

TI Finding Solutions to the Integer Case Constraint Satisfiability Problem
   Using Grover's Algorithm
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Constraint satisfiability problems, crucial to several applications, are solved on a quantum computer using Grover's search algorithm, leading to a quadratic improvement over the classical case. The solutions are obtained with high probability for several cases and are illustrated for the cases involving two variables for both 3- and 4-bit numbers. Methods are defined for inequality comparisons, and these are combined according to the form of the satisfiability formula, to form the oracle for the algorithm. The circuit is constructed using IBMQ is kit and is verified on an IBM simulator. It is further executed on one of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors from IBM on the cloud. Noise levels in the processor at present are found to be too high for successful execution. Running the algorithm on the simulator with a custom noise model lets us identify the noise threshold for successful execution.

TI Research Progress of Actinide Single Molecule Magnets
SO ACTA CHIMICA SINICA
AB Single molecule magnets is a kind of magnetic materials composed of a single molecule. Its magnetism stems from the magnetic moment of a single molecule. It is expected to be applied in ultra-high density storage, quantum computer, spintronics and other fields. Actinide single molecule magnets have attracted more and more attention due to the great spin-orbit coupling effect of actinides and large radial extension of 5f electrons, and demonstrate promise for exceeding the magnetism performance of transition metal and lanthanide complexes. However, the relaxation mechanism of actinide single molecule magnets and the factors of slow magnetic behavior remain unclear. In this review, the reported actinide single molecule magnets in the last ten years are summarized. It is found that the experimental values of blocking barrier are absolutely inconsistent with the theoretical values, which limited the development of actinide single molecule magnets to some extent. Finally, the future research directions of actinide single molecule magnets are prospected.

TI Cyclic superconducting refrigerators using guided fluxon propagation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose cyclic refrigeration in solid state, employing a gas of magnetic field vortices in a type-II superconductor-also known as fluxons-as the cooling agent. Refrigeration cycles are realized by envisioning a racetrack geometry consisting of both adiabatic and isothermal arms, etched into a type-II superconductor. The guided propagation of fluxons in the racetrack is achieved by applying an external electrical current, in a Corbino geometry, through the sample. A gradient of magnetic field is set across the racetrack allowing one to adiabatically cool down and heat up the fluxons, which subsequently exchange heat with the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively. We characterize the steady state of refrigeration cycles thermodynamically for both s-wave and d-wave pairing symmetries, and present their figures of merit such as the cooling power delivered, and the coefficient of performance. Our cooling principle can offer significant cooling for on-chip microrefrigeration purposes, by locally cooling below the base temperatures achievable in a conventional dilution refrigerator. We estimate nW/mm2 of cooling power per unit area assuming a tunnel coupling with similar to MO mu m2 specific resistance. Integrating the fluxon fridge to quantum circuits can enhance their coherence time by locally suppressing thermal fluctuations, and improve the efficiency of single photon detectors and charge sensors.

TI Timing the escape of a photoexcited electron from a molecular cage
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Charge transfer is fundamentally dependent on the overlap of the orbitals comprising the transport pathway. This has key implications for molecular, nanoscale, and quantum technologies, for which delocalization (and decoherence) rates are essential figures of merit. Here, we apply the core hole clock technique-an energy-domain variant of ultrafast spectroscopy-to probe the delocalization of a photoexcited electron inside a closed molecular cage, namely the Ar 2p54s1 state of Ar@C60. Despite marginal frontier orbital mixing in the ground configuration, almost 80% of the excited state density is found outside the buckyball due to the formation of a markedly diffuse hybrid orbital. Far from isolating the intracage excitation, the surrounding fullerene is instead a remarkably efficient conduit for electron transfer: we measure characteristic delocalization times of 6.6 +/- 0.3 fs and less than or similar to 500 attoseconds, respectively, for a 3D Ar@C60 film and a 2D monolayer on Ag(111).

TI Low-temperature quantum metrology enhanced by strong coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Equilibrium probes have been widely used in various noisy quantum metrology schemes. However, such an equilibrium-probe-based metrology scenario severely suffers from the low-temperature-error-divergence problem in the weak-coupling regime. To circumvent this limit, we propose a strategy to eliminate the errordivergence problem by utilizing the strong-coupling effects, which can be captured by the reaction-coordinate mapping. The strong couplings induce a noncanonical equilibrium state which greatly enhances the metrology performance. It is found that our metrology precision behaves as a polynomial-type scaling relation, which suggests the reduction of temperature can be used as a resource to improve the metrology performance. Our result is sharply contrary to that of the weak-coupling case, in which the metrology precision exponentially decays as the temperature decreases. Paving a way to realize a high-precision noisy quantum metrology at low temperatures, our result reveals the importance of the non-Markovianity in quantum technologies.

It is demonstrated that both the modulation frequency and amplitude are crucial for optimizing the charging process and the ergotropy of the quantum battery. Specifically, high-amplitude, low-frequency modulation significantly enhances charging performance and work extraction in the strong coupling regime. As an intriguing result, it is deduced that modulation at very low frequencies leads to the emergence of energy storage and work extraction in the weak coupling regime. Such a result can never be achieved without modulation in the weak coupling regime. These results highlight the importance of adjusting modulation parameters to optimize the performance of quantum batteries for real-world applications in quantum technologies.

TI Proximity effect of emergent field from spin ice in an oxide
   heterostructure
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Geometrical frustration endows magnets with degenerate ground states, resulting in exotic spin structures and quantum phenomena. Such magnets, called quantum magnets, can display non-coplanar spin textures and be a viable platform for the topological Hall effect driven by "emergent field." However, most quantum magnets are insulators, making it challenging to electrically detect associated fluctuations and excitations. Here, we probe magnetic transitions in the spin ice insulator Dy2Ti2O7, a prototypical quantum magnet, as emergent magnetotransport phenomena at the heterointerface with the nonmagnetic metal Bi2Rh2O7. Angle-dependent longitudinal resistivity exhibits peaks at the magnetic phase boundaries of spin ice due to domain boundary scattering. In addition, the anomalous Hall resistivity undergoes a sign change with the magnetic transition in Dy2Ti2O7, reflecting the inversion of the emergent field. These findings, on the basis of epitaxial techniques, connect the fundamental research on insulating quantum magnets to their potential electronic applications, possibly leading to transformative innovations in quantum technologies.

TI Electrolyte gated graphene terahertz amplitude modulators
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Active manipulation of the amplitude of terahertz (THz) frequency waves, through electrical tuning, is key for next-generation THz imaging and essential for unlocking strategic applications, from wireless communication to quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate high-performance THz amplitude modulators based on an electrolyte-gated single-layer graphene. Broadband modulation in the 1.5-6 THz range is achieved by optimizing the electric field coupling by carefully controlling the spacer thickness in a quarter-wavelength cavity structure, with a maximum modulation depth of 40% at around 2 THz. Raman characterization confirms a Fermi-level tuning of 0.39 eV via electrolyte gating of graphene. A test 2 x 2 modulator array with independent control of sub-millimeter regions is then developed and tested, with no crosstalk between pixels. The reported results highlight the potential of electrolyte-gated graphene for efficient THz modulation. The single-chip design offers compactness and ease of integration with other electronic components, making it a promising platform for THz spatial light modulators and adaptive optical components.

TI Plasmonic-Enhanced Bright Single Spin Defects in Silicon Carbide
   Membranes
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Optically addressable spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have emerged as attractable platforms for various quantum technologies. However, the low photon count rate significantly limits their applications. We strongly enhanced the brightness by 7 times and spin-control strength by 14 times of single divacancy defects in 4H-SiC membranes using a surface plasmon generated by gold film coplanar waveguides. The mechanism of the plasmonic-enhanced effect is further studied by tuning the distance between single defects and the surface of the gold film. A three-energy-level model is used to determine the corresponding transition rates consistent with the enhanced brightness of single defects. Lifetime measurements also verified the coupling between defects and surface plasmons. Our scheme is low-cost, without complicated microfabrication and delicate structures, which is applicable for other spin defects in different materials. This work would promote developing spin-defect-based quantum applications in mature SiC materials.

TI Phosphorus-lithium double-helix nanoribbons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Phosphorus nanoribbons combine the tunable bandgap and high mobility with the inherent anisotropy of one-dimensional systems, offering promise for functional electronics, but their intrinsic low stability hinders practical applications. Here, we report phosphorus-lithium double-helix nanoribbons with a well-ordered helical architecture and high structural stability under harsh conditions such as in air up to 225 degrees C, water, and even acidic solutions. Comprehensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses show that the stability arises from a synergistic combination of Zintl phase formation between phosphorus and lithium atoms, noncovalent interhelical interactions, and geometric protection offered by the distinctive helical architecture. The nanoribbons show tunable optical properties dependent on temperature, thickness, and polarization state. It is demonstrated that these properties enabled nanoribbon-based hydrogels with self-healability and highly efficient photothermal conversion, showing a general approach for stabilizing active low-dimensional materials and paving the way for applying phosphorus-based nanostructures in biomedical engineering and quantum technologies.

TI Vortex solitons in Rydberg atoms system with twisted PT-symmetric
   photonic lattices
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB This study presents a theoretical model for generating vortex solitons (VSs) in a Rydberg atomic system with twisted PT-symmetric photonic lattices. Numerical simulations are conducted via the modified square operator and split-step Fourier methods. A diverse family of VSs, including ring-, four-core rhombus-, eight-core, four-core square-, and multi-core ring-shaped structures, are obtained by tuning system parameters, such as spatial lattice constant and radial index of input beam. Ring-and rhombus-shaped VSs exhibit universal existence and robust stability against perturbations. Linear spectral analysis uncovers a PT-symmetric to PT-broken phase transition in rhombus-shaped VSs, accompanied by eigenvalue degeneracy lifting under rotation. The stability of VSs is confirmed by propagation evolution. Additionally, the interplay of PT-symmetric gain-loss profiles and VS rotation induces power current exchange, generating secondary solitons. These insights advance the understanding of VS dynamics and offer potential for soliton-based photonic and quantum technologies.

TI Ultrafast space-time optical merons in momentum-energy space
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Skyrmions, topologically non-trivial localized spin structures, are fertile ground for exploring emergent phenomena in condensed matter physics and next-generation magnetic-memory technologies. Although magnetics and optics readily lend themselves to two-dimensional realizations of spin texture, only recently have breakthroughs brought forth three-dimensional (3D) magnetic skyrmions, whereas their optical counterparts have eluded observation to date because their realization requires precise control over the spatiotemporal spectrum. Here, we demonstrate freely propagating 3D-localized optical skyrmionic structures with a non-trivial topological profile by imprinting meron polarization texture on open and closed spectral surfaces in the momentum-energy space of an ultrafast optical wave packet. Precise control over the spatiotemporal polarization texture of light - a key requisite for synthesizing 3D optical merons - is the product of synergy between novel methodologies in the modulation of light jointly in space and time, digital holography, and large-area birefringent metasurfaces. Our work advances the fields of polarization optics and topological photonics and may inspire new developments in imaging, metrology, optical communications, and quantum technologies.

TI Aspects of cavity engineering in THz quantum cascade laser frequency
   combs
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Terahertz quantum cascade laser (QCL) frequency combs are a disruptive technology for spectroscopy, imaging, and quantum technologies in this spectral range. For advanced development and tailoring of frequency comb properties, detailed modeling of the QCL device is necessary. Recent achievements in the field of THz QCLs have unveiled that custom modifications of the laser cavity by dispersion engineering or tapered waveguide sections significantly influence the laser's behavior. In this article, we present a numerical model based on the Maxwell-density matrix formalism that captures such cavity effects in detail, yielding a better understanding of the QCL dynamics and opening the possibility of designing cavities for custom laser applications. We show that waveguide engineering in terms of dispersion compensation and field enhancement can stabilize an unlocked multimode state into frequency comb operation and even shape its properties, such as the bandwidth or the mode spacing of harmonic frequency combs.

TI Quantum Optics Parity Effect on Generalized NOON States and Its
   Implications for Quantum Metrology
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB NOON states are entangled states of great interest in the development of quantum technologies, because they enable high-precision phase measurements in interferometric schemes relevant to quantum metrology and sensing. This study shows that two degenerate modes of a cavity field coupled to an atom or molecule that can be modeled as a two-level system through two-photon interactions, initially prepared in a (generalized) NOON state, experience a dynamical evolution that distinctly depends on the parity of the photon number. When the total photon number is even, the system dynamics is characterized by a time range in which the state of the system evolves near maximally entangled states that may be fed to an optical interferometer to make phase measurements essentially at the Heisenberg limit. Such entangled states cannot be achieved for odd photon numbers instead. The parity effect thus emerges as a potential control factor in quantum metrology, sensing, and lithography.

TI Bottom-Up Synthesis of Single Crystal Diamond Pyramids Containing
   Germanium Vacancy Centers
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Diamond resonators containing color-centers are highly sought after for application in quantum technologies. Bottom-up approaches are promising for the generation of single-crystal diamond structures with purposely introduced color centers. Here the possibility of using a polycrystalline diamond to grow single-crystal diamond structures by employing a pattern growth method is demonstrated. For, the possible mechanism of growing a single-crystal structure with predefined shape and size from a polycrystalline substrate by controlling the growth condition is clarified. Then, by introducing germanium impurities during the growth, localized and enhanced emission from fabricated pyramid shaped single-crystal diamonds containing germanium vacancy (GeV) color centers is demonstrated. Finally, linewidth of similar to 500 MHz at 4 K from a single GeV center in the pyramid shaped diamonds is measured. The method is an important step toward fabrication of 3D structures for integrated diamond photonics.

TI Quantum enhanced solution method for platform clustering grouping based
   on quantum K-means
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The paper proposes a quantum enhanced solution method based on quantum K-means for platform clustering and grouping in joint operations campaigns. The method first calculates the number of categories for platform clustering based on the determined number of task clusters, and sets the number of clustering categories in the classical K-means algorithm. By using the location information of the tasks, the clustering center points are calculated and derived. Secondly, the Euclidean distance is used as an indicator to measure the distance between the platform data and each cluster center point. The platform data are quantized and transformed into their corresponding quantum state representations. According to theoretical derivation, the Euclidean distance solution is transformed into the quantum state inner product solution. By designing and constructing a universal quantum state inner product solution quantum circuit, the Euclidean distance solution is completed. Then, based on the sum of squared errors of the clustering dataset, the corresponding quantum circuits are constructed through calculation and deduction. The experimental results show that compared with the classical K-means algorithm, the proposed method not only effectively solves the platform clustering and grouping problem on such action scales, but also significantly reduces the time and space complexity of the algorithm.

TI An integrated photonic engine for programmable atomic control
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Solutions for scalable, high-performance optical control are important for the development of scaled atom-based quantum technologies. Modulation of many individual optical beams is central to applying arbitrary gate and control sequences on arrays of atoms or atom-like systems. At telecom wavelengths, miniaturization of optical components via photonic integration has pushed the scale and performance of classical and quantum optics far beyond the limitations of bulk devices. However, material platforms for high-speed telecom integrated photonics lack transparency at the short wavelengths required by leading atomic systems. Here, we propose and implement a scalable and reconfigurable photonic control architecture using integrated, visible-light modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate. We combine this system with techniques in free-space optics and holography to demonstrate multi-channel, gigahertz-rate visible beamshaping. When applied to silicon-vacancy artificial atoms, our system enables the spatial and spectral addressing of a dynamically-selectable set of these stochastically-positioned point emitters.

TI Perspective on room-temperature solid-state masers

AB The first solid-state masers to operate at room-temperature and ambient air-pressure were recently demonstrated using optically pumped spin-triplet states as the gain medium. In this Perspective, we briefly review the previous state-of-the-art in cryogenic solid-state masers and then discuss the development of the room-temperature solid-state maser: from the organic pentacene pulsed maser to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy continuous-wave maser. We characterize the operation of these masers as coherent microwave sources and ultra-low noise amplifiers before outlining how they can be adapted to act as model systems in which to explore room-temperature cavity quantum electrodynamics. After discussing challenges facing current embodiments of the room-temperature solid-state maser, we explore how they might be addressed or by-passed altogether through the development of alternative materials and masing mechanisms. Finally, we speculate on how the advent of masers that can operate in ambient conditions might lead to novel applications in metrology and quantum technologies.

AB The transport of neutral atoms in Rydberg quantum computers is a crucial step for the initial arrangement of the grid as well as the dynamic connectivity, recently successfully demonstrated. We study the application of optimal control and the quantum speed limit for the transport of neutral atoms in optical tweezers at finite temperatures and analyze how laser noise affects transport fidelity. Open-loop optimal control significantly enhances transport fidelity, achieving an improvement up to 89% for the lowest analyzed temperature of 1 mu K for a distance of 3 mu m. Furthermore, we simulate how the transport fidelity behaves in release-and-capture measurements, which are realizable in the experiment to estimate transport efficiency and implement closed-loop optimal control.

TI A model of randomly-coupled Pauli spins
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We construct a model of Pauli spin operators with all-to-all 4-local interactions by replacing Majorana fermions in the SYK model with spin operators. Equivalently, we replace fermions with hard-core bosons. We study this model numerically and compare the properties with those of the SYK model. We observe a striking quantitative coincidence between the spin model and the SYK model, which suggests that this spin model is strongly chaotic and, perhaps, can play some role in holography. We also discuss the path-integral approach with multi-local fields and the possibility of quantum simulations. This model may be an interesting target for quantum simulations because Pauli spins are easier to implement than fermions on qubit-based quantum devices.

TI Quantum-aided secure deep neural network inference on real quantum
   computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) are phenomenally successful machine learning methods broadly applied to many different disciplines. However, as complex two-party computations, DNN inference using classical cryptographic methods cannot achieve unconditional security, raising concern on security risks of DNNs' application to sensitive data in many domains. We overcome such a weakness by introducing a quantum-aided security approach. We build a quantum scheme for unconditionally secure DNN inference based on quantum oblivious transfer with an untrusted third party. Leveraging DNN's noise tolerance, our approach enables complex DNN inference on comparatively low-fidelity quantum systems with limited quantum capacity. We validated our method using various applications with a five-bit real quantum computer and a quantum simulator. Both theoretical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that our approach manages to operate on existing quantum computers and achieve unconditional security with a negligible accuracy loss. This may open up new possibilities of quantum security methods for deep learning.

TI Algebraic aspects of boundaries in the Kitaev quantum double model
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We provide a systematic treatment of boundaries based on subgroups K subset of G for the Kitaev quantum double D(G) model in the bulk. The boundary sites are representations of a *-subalgebra Xi subset of D(G) and we explicate its structure as a quasi-Hopf *-algebra dependent on a choice of transversal R. We provide decomposition formulae for irreducible representations of D(G) pulled back to Xi. As an application of our treatment, we study patches with boundaries based on K = G horizontally and K = {e} vertically and show how these could be used in a quantum computer using the technique of lattice surgery. More abstractly, we also provide explicitly the monoidal equivalence of the category of Xi-modules and the category of G-graded K-bimodules and use this to prove that different choices of R are related by Drinfeld cochain twists. Examples include Sn-1 subset of S-n and an example related to the octonions where Xi is also a Hopf quasigroup.

TI Well-conditioned multi-product formulas for hardware- friendly
   Hamiltonian simulation
SO QUANTUM
AB Simulating the time-evolution of a Hamiltonian is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. suited to replace standard product formulas since they scale better with respect to time and approximation errors. Hamiltonian simulation with MPFs was first proposed in a fully quantum setting using a linear combination of unitaries. Here, we analyze and demonstrate a hybrid quantum-classical approach to MPFs that classically combines expectation values evaluated with a quantum computer. This has the same approximation bounds as the fully quantum MPFs, but, in contrast, requires no additional qubits, no controlled operations, and is not probabilistic. We show how to design MPFs that do not amplify the hardware and sampling errors, and demonstrate their performance. In particular, we illustrate the potential of our work by theoretically analyzing the benefits when applied to a classically intractable spin-boson model, and by computing the dynamics of the transverse field Ising model using a classical simulator as well as quantum hardware. lation on noisy hardware.

TI Pathways in neutrino physics via quantum-encoded data analysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the quest to unveil the laws of nature, particle detectors produce an ever-increasing amount of data. Large data rates require the use of specialized triggers that promptly reduce the data rate to a manageable level; however, in doing so, unexpected phenomena may escape detection. In this work, we present a methodology based on recent quantum compression techniques that can store exponentially more information than classically available methods. We encode the full neutrino telescope event information using parity observables in an IBM quantum processor using eight qubits to demonstrate this. Then, we show that we can recover the information stored on the quantum computer with a fidelity of 84%. Finally, we illustrate the use of our protocol by performing a classification task that separates electron-neutrino events from muon-neutrino events in a neutrino telescope. We find that this classification method is limited by our ability to find adequately faithful representations of the classical data within the quantum systems, necessitating further investigations into finding these representations.

TI Elimination of substrate-induced ferromagnetic resonance linewidth
   broadening in the epitaxial system YIG-GGG by microstructuring
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Modern quantum technologies and hybrid quantum systems offer the opportunity to utilize magnons on the level of single excitations. Long lifetimes, low decoherence rates, and a strong coupling rate to other subsystems propose the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG), grown on a gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate, as a suitable platform to host magnonic quantum states. However, the magnetic damping at cryogenic temperatures significantly increases due to the paramagnetic character and the highly inhomogeneous stray field of GGG, as recent experiments and simulations pointed out. Here, we report on temperature dependent ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies in YIG-GGG thin films with different sample geometries. We experimentally demonstrate how to eliminate the asymmetric stray field-induced linewidth broadening via microstructuring of the YIG film. Additionally, our experiments reveal evidence of a non-Gilbert-like behavior of the linewidth at cryogenic temperatures, independent of the inhomogeneous GGG stray field.

TI Robust consistent single quantum dot strong coupling in plasmonic
   nanocavities
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Strong coupling between a single quantum emitter and an optical cavity (at rate Omega) accesses fundamental quantum optics and provides an essential building block for photonic quantum technologies. However, the minimum mode volume of conventional dielectric cavities restricts their operation to cryogenic temperature for strong coupling. Here we harness surface self-assembly to make deterministic strong coupling at room temperature using CdSe/CdS quantum dots (QDs) in nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) plasmonic nanocavities. We achieve a fabrication yield of similar to 70% for single QD strong coupling by optimizing their size and nano-assembly. A clear and reliable Rabi splitting is observed both in the scattering of each nanocavity and their photoluminescence, which are however not equal. Integrating these quantum elements with electrical pumping allows demonstration of strong coupling in their electroluminescence. This advance provides a straightforward way to achieve practical quantum devices at room temperature, and opens up exploration of their nonlinear, electrical, and quantum correlation properties.

TI Effect of the nanopillar diameter on diamond silicon vacancy center spin
   lifetime
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Color centers in diamond micro and nano-structures play an important role in a wide range of quantum technologies. However, obtaining high-quality color centers in small structures is challenging, as properties such as spin population lifetimes can be affected by the transition from a bulk to nanostructured crystal host. In this manuscript, we measure how population lifetimes of silicon vacancy center orbital states change when they are created in nanopillars whose diameters vary from 1 mu m to 120 nm. We also discuss the influence of annealing methods on the silicon vacancy inhomogeneous linewidth. After selecting a sample with low inhomogeneous broadening and patterning it with nanopillars, we expected that restricted vibrational modes in the smallest structures could extend spin population lifetimes. However, we found that this effect was masked by other effects that reduced population lifetimes, suggesting that imperfections in the crystal lattice or surface damage caused by etching can influence SiV spins.

TI Squeezing by critical speeding up: Applications in quantum metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present an alternative protocol allowing for the preparation of critical states that instead of suffering from the critical slowing down benefits from the critical speeding up. Paradoxically, we prepare these states by going away from the critical point which allows for the speed-up. We apply the protocol to the paradigmatic quantum Rabi model and its classical oscillator limit as well as the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Subsequently, we discuss the application of the adiabatic speed-up protocol in quantum metrology and compare its performance with critical quantum metrology. We show that critical quantum metrology with the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model cannot even overcome the standard quantum limit, and we argue that, even though critical metrology protocols can overcome it in some cases, critical metrology is a suboptimal metrological strategy. Finally, we conclude that systems exhibiting a phase transition are indeed interesting from the viewpoint of quantum technologies; however, it may not be the critical point that should attract the most attention.

TI Mitigation of Structural Defects during the Growth of 2D van der Waals
   Chalcogenides by Molecular Beam Epitaxy
SO SMALL METHODS
AB The growth of wafer-scale van der Waals (vdW) thin films and heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is important for future applications in quantum technologies, next-generation optoelectronic devices, and fundamental physics investigations. When grown using co-deposition methods that are typically used for compound semiconductor MBE, vdW materials typically show a high density of structural defects, including twin or antiphase domains, spiral growth, and pyramidal growth. These defects are caused by the relatively weak film/substrate interaction and/or the poor wettability of typical substrates by many vdW materials. These difficulties can be mitigated using a multi-step growth procedure in which growth stages, including nucleation and coalescence, can be rigorously controlled, resulting in high-quality deposition of vdW thin films. This article will describe a general recipe for the growth of highly-crystalline wafer-scale vdW thin films by MBE.

TI Spin-Polarizing Electron Beam Splitter from Crossed Graphene Nanoribbons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Junctions composed of two crossed graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have been theoretically proposed as electron beam splitters where incoming electron waves in one GNR can be split coherently into propagating waves in two outgoing terminals with nearly equal amplitude and zero back-scattering. Here we scrutinize this effect for devices composed of narrow zigzag GNRs taking explicitly into account the role of Coulomb repulsion that leads to spin-polarized edge states within mean-field theory. We show that the beam-splitting effect survives the opening of the well-known correlation gap and, more strikingly, that a spin-dependent scattering potential emerges which spin polarizes the transmitted electrons in the two outputs. By studying different ribbons and intersection angles we provide evidence that this is a general feature with edgepolarized nanoribbons. A near-perfect polarization can be achieved by joining several junctions in series. Our findings suggest that GNRs are interesting building blocks in spintronics and quantum technologies with applications for interferometry and entanglement.

TI Ternary metal oxide substrates for superconducting circuits
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Substrate material imperfections and surface losses are one of the major factors limiting superconducting quantum circuitry from reaching the scale and complexity required to build a practical quantum computer. One potential path towards higher coherence of superconducting quantum devices is to explore new substrate materials with a reduced density of imperfections due to inherently different surface chemistries. Here, we examine two ternary metal oxide materials, spinel (MgAl2O4) and lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3), with a focus on surface and interface characterization and preparation. Devices fabricated on LaAlO3 have quality factors three times higher than those of earlier devices, which we attribute to a reduction in the interfacial disorder. MgAl2O4 is a new material in superconducting quantum devices, and even in the presence of significant surface disorder, it consistently outperforms LaAlO3. Our results highlight the importance of materials exploration, substrate preparation, and characterization for identifying materials suitable for high-performance superconducting quantum circuitry.

TI BINARY OPTIMAL CONTROL OF SINGLE-FLUX-QUANTUM PULSE SEQUENCES
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION
AB We introduce a binary, relaxed gradient, trust-region method for optimizing pulse sequences for single flux quanta control of a quantum computer. The pulse sequences are optimized with the goal of realizing unitary gate transformations. Each pulse has a fixed amplitude and duration. We model this process as a binary optimal control problem, constrained by Schrodinger's equation, where the binary variables indicate whether each pulse is on or off. We introduce a first-order trust-region method, which takes advantage of a relaxed gradient to determine an optimal pulse sequence that minimizes the gate infidelity, while also suppressing leakage to higher energy levels. The proposed algorithm has a computational complexity of O (p log(p)), where p is the number of pulses in the sequence. We present numerical results for the H and X gates, where the optimized pulse sequences give gate fidelities better than 99:9%, in approximate to 25 trust-region iterations.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Boson Sampling Algorithm for Molecular
   Vibrationally Resolved Electronic Spectroscopy with Duschinsky Rotation
   and Anharmonicity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Using a photonic quantum computer for boson sampling has demonstrated a tremendous advantage over classical supercomputers. It is highly desirable to develop boson sampling algorithms for realistic scientific problems. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical sampling (HQCS) algorithm to calculate the optical spectrum for complex molecules considering Duschinsky rotation effects and anharmonicity. The classical sum-over-states method for this problem has a computational complexity that exponentially increases with system size. The HQCS algorithm creates an intermediate harmonic potential energy surface (PES) to bridge the initial and final PESs. The magnitude and sign of the overlap between the initial and the intermediate state are estimated by boson sampling and classical algorithms, respectively. The overlap between the intermediate and the final state is efficiently evaluated by classical algorithms. The feasibility of HQCS is demonstrated in calculations of the emission spectrum of a Morse model as well as the pyridine molecule.

TI Applications of Gaussian Boson Sampling to Solve Some Chemistry Problems
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum computers, due to their superposition and entanglement properties, provide significant advantages in solving certain problems compared with classical computers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify issues that can be efficiently solved by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. Xanadu has introduced the X8 quantum chip, based on integrated photonic technology, along with important photonic platforms such as Strawberry Fields and Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), to solve specific computational problems. In this review article, after reviewing Boson Sampling (BS) and Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), we discuss the relationship between GBS and graph theory, including how graphs can be encoded in GBS. Some applications of GBS, particularly molecular docking and molecular vibrations, are also considered. The future goal of this study is to identify problems that can be represented as small graphs and solved using GBS with a limited number of optical modes.

TI The Use of The High-Performance Computing in The Learning Process
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB The need for specialists with high-performance computing skills is growing day by day. This is due to the fact that the high-performance process of processing big data is one of the most pressing problems today. This is especially important in science, economics, physical modeling, medicine, bioinformatics, weather forecasting, etc. This article analyzes the conditions for teaching high-performance computing, the experience of leading universities in the world, and it is established that teaching high-performance computing requires study. High performance computing training was carried out on 3 different hardware equipment (a personal computer, a supercomputer "Param-Bilim" India Kazakhstan Centre of Excellence in ICT [IKCOEICT] at L.N. Gumilyov Eurasian National University and a quantum computer in the cloud IBM Quantum Experience) using different algorithms in the C ++ and Phyton programming languages. The effectiveness of the calculation results in the educational process was determined as a result of the completed questionnaire.

TI Classical Non-Markovian Noise in Symmetry-Preserving Quantum Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In quantum dynamics, symmetries are vital for identifying and assessing conserved quantities that govern the evolution of a quantum system. When promoted to the open quantum system setting, dynamical symmetries can be negatively altered by system-environment interactions, thus, complicating their analysis. Previous work on noisy symmetric quantum dynamics has focused on the Markovian setting, despite the ubiquity of non-Markovian noise in a number of widely used quantum technologies. In this Letter, we develop a framework for quantifying the impact of non-Markovian noise on symmetric quantum evolution via root space decompositions and the filter function formalism. We demonstrate analytically that symmetry-preserving noise maintains the symmetric subspace, while nonsymmetric noise leads to highly specific leakage errors that are block diagonal in the symmetry representation. We support our findings with numerical studies of a transverse-field Ising model and a quantum error detecting code subject to spatiotemporally correlated multiaxis noise. Our results are broadly applicable, providing new analytic insights into the control and characterization of open quantum system dynamics.

TI Few-fermion resonant tunneling and underbarrier trapping in asymmetric
   potentials
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Understanding quantum tunneling in many-body systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and nanoscale device design. Despite extensive studies of quantum tunneling, the role of interactions in determining directional transport through asymmetric barriers in discrete quantum systems remains unclear. Here we show that noninteracting fermions exhibit symmetric tunneling probabilities regardless of barrier orientation, while inter-particle interactions break this symmetry and create pronounced asymmetric tunneling behavior. We explore the dependence of tunneling behavior on the initial spin configurations of two spin-1/2 fermions: spin-triplet states preserve tunneling symmetry, while spin-singlet states show strong asymmetry. We identify regimes where interactions mediate tunneling through under-barrier resonant trapping and enhance tunneling via many-body resonant tunneling - a phenomenon arising solely from inter-particle interactions and being fundamentally different from traditional single-particle resonant tunneling. Our results may be applied to the design of nanoscale devices with tailored transport properties, such as diodes and memristors.

TI Symmetry-mediated quantum coherence of W5+ spins in an
   oxygen-deficient double perovskite
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Elucidating the factors limiting quantum coherence in real materials is essential to the development of quantum technologies. Here we report a strategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin coherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host materials. In addition to obtaining millisecond T1 spin-lattice lifetimes at T similar to 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room temperature. We determine that T-2 enhancement in Sr2CaWO6-delta over previously studied Ba2CaWO6-delta is caused by a dynamically-driven increase in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site, assigned as W5+ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, a combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled quantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon mode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry on the spin lifetimes of W5+ paramagnetic defects, an important step in the process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.

TI Observation of the magnonic Dicke superradiant phase transition
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Two-level atoms ultrastrongly coupled with single-mode cavity photons are predicted to exhibit a quantum phase transition, entering a phase in which both the atomic polarization and the photonic field are finite even without external driving. However, this phenomenon, the superradiant phase transition (SRPT), is forbidden by a no-go theorem due to the existence of the diamagnetic term. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence for a magnonic SRPT in ErFeO3, where the role of the photonic mode (two-level atoms) in the photonic SRPT is played by an Fe3+ magnon mode (Er3+ spins). The absence of the diamagnetic term in the Fe3+-Er3+ exchange coupling ensures that the no-go theorem does not apply. Ultrabroadband terahertz and gigahertz magnetospectroscopy experiments revealed the signatures of the SRPT in thermal equilibrium, a kink and a softening, respectively, of two spin-magnon hybridized modes at the critical point. Systems near this phase are expected to harbor large-scale squeezing, which will potentially provide a route to next-generation quantum technologies.

TI Radiation-Induced Paramagnetic Centers in Meso- and Macroporous
   Synthetic Opals from EPR and ENDOR Data
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB The paramagnetic defects and radiation-induced paramagnetic centers (PCs) in silica opals can play a crucial role in determining the magnetic and electronic behavior of materials and serve as local probes of their electronic structure. Systematic investigations of paramagnetic defects are essential for advancing both theoretical and practical aspects of material science. A series of silica opal samples with different geometrical parameters were synthesized and radiation-induced PCs were investigated by means of the conventional and pulsed X- and W-band electron paramagnetic resonance, and 1H/2H Mims electron-nuclear double resonance. Two groups of PCs were distinguished based on their spectroscopic parameters, electron relaxation characteristics, temperature and time stability, localization relative to the surface of silica spheres, and their origin. The obtained data demonstrate that stable radiation-induced E' PCs can be used as sensitive probes for the hydrogen-containing fillers of the opal pores, for the development of compact radiation monitoring equipment, and for quantum technologies.

TI Hybrid fiber-solid-state laser with 3D-printed intracavity lenses
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Microscale 3D-printing has revolutionized micro-optical applications ranging from endoscopy, imaging, to quantum technologies. In all these applications, miniaturization is key, and in combination with the nearly unlimited design space, it is opening novel, to the best of our knowledge, avenues. Here, we push the limits of miniaturization and durability by realizing the first fiber laser system with intra-cavity on-fiber 3D-printed optics. We demonstrate stable laser operation at over 20 mW output power at 1063.4 nm with a full width half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 0.11 nm and a maximum output power of 37 mW. Furthermore, we investigate the power stability and degradation of 3D-printed optics at Watt power levels. The intriguing possibilities afforded by free-form microscale 3D-printed optics allow us to combine the gain in a solid-state crystal with fiber guidance in a hybrid laser concept. Therefore, our novel ansatz enables the compact integration of a bulk active media in fiber platforms at substantial power levels.

TI Engineering analog quantum chemistry Hamiltonians using cold atoms in
   optical lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Using quantum systems to efficiently solve quantum chemistry problems is one of the long-sought applications of near-future quantum technologies. In a recent work [J. Arguello-Luengo et al., Nature (London) 574, 215 (2019)], ultracold fermionic atoms have been proposed for this purpose by showing us how to simulate in an analog way the quantum chemistry Hamiltonian projected in a lattice basis set. Here, we continue exploring this path and go beyond these results in several ways. First, we numerically benchmark the working conditions of the analog simulator and find less demanding experimental setups where chemistry-like behavior in three dimensions can still be observed. We also provide a deeper understanding of the errors of the simulation appearing due to discretization and finite-size effects and provide a way to mitigate them. Finally, we benchmark the simulator characterizing the behavior of two-electron atoms (He) and molecules (HeH+) beyond the example considered in the original work.

TI Photonic-Cavity-Enhanced Laser Writing of Color Centers in Diamond
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Color centers in diamond have widespread utility in quantum technologies, but their creation process remains stochastic in nature. Deterministic creation of color centers in device-ready diamond platforms can improve the yield, scalability, and integration. Recent work using pulsed laser excitation has shown impressive progress in deterministically creating defects in bulk diamond. Here, we extend this laser-writing process into nanophotonic devices etched into diamond membranes, including nanopillars and photonic resonators with writing and subsequent readout occurring in situ at cryogenic temperatures. We demonstrate the optically driven creation of carbon vacancy (GR1) and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond nanopillars and observe enhanced photoluminescence collection from them. We also fabricate bullseye resonators and leverage their cavity modes to locally amplify the laser-writing field, yielding defect creation with picojoule write-pulse energies 100 times lower than those typically used in bulk diamond demonstrations.

Harnessing and exploring their interactions with two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) systems opens new frontiers in materials science and engineering. As part of a special issue on these guided elastic waves for hybrid nano- and quantum technologies, our review highlights work focusing on acoustically-induced transport phenomena at low temperatures that arise from the interaction between the surface acoustic waves in a piezoelectric substrate and a vdW material on its surface. A main focus is on technological methods to control the carrier concentration in transport and strain-related effects that can act on the carrier motion as an effective magnetic field.

TI Perovskite quantum dots: What's next?
SO NEXT ENERGY
AB Zero-dimensional metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) display distinct chemical, physical, electrical, and optical properties compared to their bulk counterparts. These unique characteristics make PQDs highly promising materials for a broad range of applications spanning solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), to lasers and quantum technologies. Despite the recent advances, the translations of PQDs into commercially viable materials are hindered by several drawbacks; for example, an unclear understanding of their formation mechanism(s), the complex chemistry and dynamic instabilities at the PQDs surface, and the inefficient or unbalanced charge transportation in PQDs-based devices. In this review, we present an in-depth analysis of the current progress and challenges in the field of PQDs and their applications. Additionally, we offer insights into potential future research directions in this exciting area of study.

TI One-dimensional optomagnonic microcavities for selective excitation of
   perpendicular standing spin waves
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB Here we propose a method of the excitation of perpendicular standing spin waves (PSSWs) of different orders in an optomagnonic microcavity by ultrashort laser pulses. The microcavity is formed by a magnetic dielectric film surrounded by dielectric non-magnetic Bragg mirrors. Optical cavity modes in the magnetic layer provide concentration and strongly non-uniform distribution of the optical power over the layer thickness and therefore induce the effective field of the inverse Faraday effect also spatially non-uniform. It results in excitation of PSSWs. PSSWs whose wavevector is closest to the wavevector characterizing distribution of the inverse Faraday effect field are excited most efficiently. Consequently, a key advantage of this approach is a selectivity of the PSSW excitation which allows to launch PSSWs of required orders only. All-optical operation of the optomagnonic cavities opens new possibilities for their applications for quantum technologies.

TI Long-range transport of 2D excitons with acoustic waves
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Excitons in 2D semiconductors suffer from a weak response to in-plane electric fields, inhibiting their transport beyond the diffusion length. Here, the authors demonstrate the directional, long-range transport of interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe2 driven by the propagating potential traps induced by surface acoustic waves.
   Excitons are elementary optical excitation in semiconductors. The ability to manipulate and transport these quasiparticles would enable excitonic circuits and devices for quantum photonic technologies. Recently, interlayer excitons in 2D semiconductors have emerged as a promising candidate for engineering excitonic devices due to their long lifetime, large exciton binding energy, and gate tunability. However, the charge-neutral nature of the excitons leads to weak response to the in-plane electric field and thus inhibits transport beyond the diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate the directional transport of interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe2 driven by the propagating potential traps induced by surface acoustic waves (SAW). We show that at 100 K, the SAW-driven excitonic transport is activated above a threshold acoustic power and reaches 20 mu m, a distance at least ten times longer than the diffusion length and only limited by the device size. Temperature-dependent measurement reveals the transition from the diffusion-limited regime at low temperature to the acoustic field-driven regime at elevated temperature. Our work shows that acoustic waves are an effective, contact-free means to control exciton dynamics and transport, promising for realizing 2D materials-based excitonic devices such as exciton transistors, switches, and transducers up to room temperature.

TI Boosting quantum yields in two-dimensional semiconductors via proximal
   metal plates
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The short exciton lifetime and strong exciton-exciton interaction in transition metal dichalcogenides limit the efficiency of exciton emission. Here, the authors show that exciton-exciton interaction in monolayer WS2 can be screened using proximal metal plates, leading to an improved quantum yield.
   Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMDs) have tremendous potential as atomically thin, direct bandgap semiconductors that can be used as convenient building blocks for quantum photonic devices. However, the short exciton lifetime due to the defect traps and the strong exciton-exciton interaction in TMDs has significantly limited the efficiency of exciton emission from this class of materials. Here, we show that exciton-exciton interaction in 1L-WS2 can be effectively screened using an ultra-flat Au film substrate separated by multilayers of hexagonal boron nitride. Under this geometry, induced dipolar exciton-exciton interaction becomes quadrupole-quadrupole interaction because of effective image dipoles formed within the metal. The suppressed exciton-exciton interaction leads to a significantly improved quantum yield by an order of magnitude, which is also accompanied by a reduction in the exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) rate, as confirmed by time-resolved optical measurements. A theoretical model accounting for the screening of the dipole-dipole interaction is in a good agreement with the dependence of EEA on exciton densities. Our results suggest that fundamental EEA processes in the TMD can be engineered through proximal metallic screening, which represents a practical approach towards high-efficiency 2D light emitters.

TI Multimode phonon-polaritons in lead-halide perovskites in the
   ultrastrong coupling regime
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Phonons play a central role in fundamental solid-state phenomena, including superconductivity, Raman scattering, and symmetry-breaking phases. Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light-matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimodal Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.

TI High-Performance Spin Field-Effect Transistors with Multicycle Spin
   Precession in BLG/WSe2/hBN Heterostructures
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Spintronics seeks to enhance information processing by harnessing the spin of electrons, offering solutions to the limitations of conventional electronics. A key device in spintronics research is the spin-injected field-effect transistor (spin FET), which incorporates a lateral semiconducting channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This study presents a high-mobility BLG/WSe2/hBN spin FET capable of operating from cryogenic to room temperature, demonstrating efficient spin injection, detection, and precession. We investigate spin transport across different transport regimes, revealing coherent spin precession in the ballistic regime and a transition to reduced coherence in the semiballistic and diffusive regimes. By modulating the gate voltage, we achieve precise control over Rashba spin-orbit coupling, which enables tunable spin dynamics in the device. These findings advance the understanding of spin transport in 2D heterostructures and pave the way for developing electrically controlled spintronic devices for future applications in logic, memory, and quantum technologies.

TI Fluorescence Enhancement of Single V2 Centers in a 4H-SiC Cavity Antenna
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Solid state quantum emitters are a prime candidate in distributed quantum technologies since they inherently provide a spin-photon interface. An ongoing challenge in the field, however, is the low photon extraction due to the high refractive index of typical host materials. This challenge can be overcome using photonic structures. Here, we report the integration of V2 centers in a cavity-based optical antenna. The structure consists of a silver-coated, 135 nm-thin 4H-SiC membrane functioning as a planar cavity with a broadband resonance yielding a theoretical photon collection enhancement factor of similar to 34. The planar geometry allows us to identify over 20 single V2 centers at room temperature with a mean (maximum) count rate enhancement factor of 9 (15). Moreover, we observe 10 V2 centers with a mean absorption line width below 80 MHz at cryogenic temperatures. These results demonstrate a photon collection enhancement that is robust to the lateral emitter position.

TI Indistinguishability of Remote Quantum-Dot-Cavity Single-Photon Sources
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Generating identical photons from remote emitter-based bright single-photon sources is an important step for scaling up optical quantum technologies. Here, we study the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of photons emitted from remote sources based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). We make use of a deterministic fabrication technique to position the QDs in a spectrally resonant micropillar cavity and fine-tune their operation wavelength electrically. In doing so, we can match four pairs of sources between five distinct sources, study them under various excitation schemes, and measure their degree of indistinguishability. We demonstrate remote indistinguishabiltity between 44 +/- 1% and 69 +/- 1% depending on the pair of sources and excitation conditions, record values for QDs in cavities. The relative contribution of pure dephasing and spectral diffusion is then analyzed, revealing that the remaining distinguishability is mostly due to low-frequency noise.

TI Time Crystals from Single-Molecule Magnet Arrays
SO ACS NANO
AB Time crystals, a unique nonequilibrium quantum phenomenon with promising applications in current quantum technologies, mark a significant advance in quantum mechanics. Although traditionally studied in atom-cavity and optical lattice systems, pursuing alternative nanoscale platforms for time crystals is crucial. Here we theoretically predict discrete time crystals in a periodically driven molecular magnet array, modeled by a spin-S Heisenberg Hamiltonian with significant quadratic anisotropy, taken with realistic and experimentally relevant physical parameters. Surprisingly, we find that the time crystal response frequency correlates with the energy levels of the individual magnets and is essentially independent of the exchange coupling. The latter is unexpectedly manifested through a pulse-like oscillation in the magnetization envelope, signaling a many-body response. These results show that molecular magnets can be a rich platform for studying time-crystalline behavior and possibly other out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.

TI Genuine and faux single G centers in carbon-implanted silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Among the wide variety of single fluorescent defects investigated in silicon, numerous studies have focused on color centers with a zero-phonon line around 1.28 mu m and identified to a common carbon complex in silicon, namely the G center. However, inconsistent estimates regarding their quantum efficiency cast doubt on the correct identification of these individual emitters. Through a comparative analysis of their single-photon emission properties, we demonstrate that these single color centers are split in two distinct families of point defects. A first family consists of the genuine single G centers with a well-identified microscopic structure and whose photoluminescence has been investigated on ensemble measurements since the 1960s. The remaining defects belong to another color center, which we will refer to as the G* center, whose atomic configuration has yet to be determined. These results provide a safeguard against future defect misidentifications, which is crucial for further development of quantum technologies relying on G or G* center quantum properties.

TI Synthesis of an aqueous, air-stable, superconducting 1T?-WS2 monolayer
   ink
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Liquid-phase chemical exfoliation can achieve industry-scale production of two-dimensional (2D) materials for a wide range of applications. However, many 2D materials with potential applications in quantum technologies often fail to leave the laboratory setting because of their air sensitivity and depreciation of physical performance after chemical processing. We report a simple chemical exfoliation method to create a stable, aqueous, surfac-tant-free, superconducting ink containing phase-pure 1T '-WS2 monolayers that are isostructural to the air -sen-sitive topological insulator 1T '-WTe2. The printed film is metallic at room temperature and superconducting below 7.3 kelvin, shows strong anisotropic unconventional superconducting behavior with an in-plane and out-of-plane upper critical magnetic field of 30.1 and 5.3 tesla, and is stable at ambient conditions for at least 30 days. Our results show that chemical processing can make nontrivial 2D materials that were formerly only studied in laboratories commercially accessible.

TI From Non-Hermitian Linear Response to Dynamical Correlations and
   Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Quantum Many-Body Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum many-body systems are characterized by their correlations. While equal-time correlators and unequal-time commutators between operators are standard observables, the direct access to unequal-time anticommutators poses a formidable experimental challenge. Here, we propose a general technique for measuring unequal-time anticommutators using the linear response of a system to a non-Hermitian perturbation. We illustrate the protocol at the example of a Bose-Hubbard model, where the approach to thermal equilibrium in a closed quantum system can be tracked by measuring both sides of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. We relate the scheme to the quantum Zeno effect and weak measurements, and illustrate possible implementations at the example of a cold-atom system. Our proposal provides a way of characterizing dynamical correlations in quantum many-body systems with potential applications in understanding strongly correlated matter as well as for novel quantum technologies.

TI Double-Pulse Generation of Indistinguishable Single Photons with
   Optically Controlled Polarization
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Single-photon sources play a key role in photonic quantum technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots can emit indistinguishable single photons under resonant excitation. However, the resonance fluorescence technique typically requires cross-polarization filtering, which causes a loss of the unpolarized quantum dot emission by 50%. To solve this problem, we demonstrate a method for generating indistinguishable single photons with optically controlled polarization by two laser pulses off-resonant with neutral exciton states. This scheme is realized by exciting the quantum dot to the biexciton state and subsequently driving the quantum dot to an exciton eigenstate. By combining with a magnetic field, we demonstrated the generation of photons with optically controlled polarization (the degree of polarization is 101(2)%), laser-neutral exciton detuning up to 0.81 meV, high single-photon purity (99.6(1)%), and indistinguishability (85(4)%). Laser pulses can be blocked using polarization and spectral filtering. Our work makes an important step toward indistinguishable single-photon sources with near-unity collection efficiency.

TI Photonic Spin Lattices: Symmetry Constraints for Skyrmion and Meron
   Topologies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Symmetry and topology govern many electronic, magnetic, and photonic phenomena in condensed matter physics and optics, resulting in counterintuitive skyrmion, meron, and other phenomena important for modern technologies. Here we demonstrate photonic spin lattices as a new topological construct governed by the spin-orbit coupling in an optical field. The symmetry of the electromagnetic field in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction may result in only two types of photonic spin lattices: either hexagonal spin-skyrmion or square spin-meron lattices. We show that these spin structures correspond to the lowest energy of the electromagnetic field configuration, therefore, energetically stable. We further show that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling these spin topologies are degenerated in dynamic field skyrmions, unifying the description of electromagnetic field topologies. The results provide a new understanding of electromagnetic field topology and its transformations as well as new opportunities for applications in quantum technologies, spin optics, and topological photonics.

TI Resonance-fluorescence spectral dynamics of an acoustically modulated
   quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum technologies that rely on photonic qubits require a precise controllability of their properties. For this purpose hybrid approaches are particularly attractive because they offer a large flexibility to address different aspects of the photonic degrees of freedom. When combining photonics with other quantum platforms like phonons, quantum transducers have to be realized that convert between the mechanical and optical domain. Here, we realize this interface between phonons in the form of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and single photons, mediated by a single semiconductor quantum dot exciton. In this combined theoretical and experimental study, we show that the different sidebands exhibit characteristic blinking dynamics that can be controlled by detuning the laser from the exciton transition. By developing analytical approximations we gain a better understanding of the involved internal dynamics. Our specific SAW approach allows us to reach the ideal frequency range of around 1 GHz that enables simultaneous temporal and spectral phonon sideband resolution close to the combined fundamental time-bandwidth limit.

TI Low-temperature heat transport under phonon confinement in
   nanostructures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Heat transport in bulk materials is well described using the Debye theory of three-dimensional vibrational modes (phonons) and the acoustic match model. However, in cryogenic nanodevices, phonon wavelengths exceed device dimensions, leading to confinement effects that standard models fail to address. With the growing application of low-temperature devices in communication, sensing, and quantum technologies, there is an urgent need for models that accurately describe heat transport under confinement. We introduce a computational approach to obtain phonon heat capacity and heat transport rates between solids in various confined geometries that can be easily integrated into, e.g., the standard two-temperature model. Confinement significantly reduces heat capacity and may slow down heat transport. We validate our model with experiments on strongly disordered NbTiN superconducting nanostructure, widely used in highly efficient single-photon detectors, and we argue that confinement is due to their polycrystalline granular structure. These findings point to potential advances in cryogenic device performance through tailored material and microstructure engineering.

TI Ultrastrong photon-to-magnon coupling in multilayered heterostructures
   involving superconducting coherence via ferromagnetic layers
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The critical step for future quantum industry demands realization of efficient information exchange between different-platform hybrid systems that can harvest advantages of distinct platforms. The major restraining factor for the progress in certain hybrids is weak coupling strength between the elemental particles. In particular, this restriction impedes a promising field of hybrid magnonics. In this work, we propose an approach for realization of on-chip hybrid magnonic systems with unprecedentedly strong coupling parameters. The approach is based on multilayered microstructures containing superconducting, insulating, and ferromagnetic layers with modified photon phase velocities and magnon eigenfrequencies. The enhanced coupling strength is provided by the radically reduced photon mode volume. Study of the microscopic mechanism of the photon-to-magnon coupling evidences formation of the long-range superconducting coherence via thick strong ferromagnetic layers in superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor trilayer in the presence of magnetization precession. This discovery offers new opportunities in microwave superconducting spintronics for quantum technologies.

TI High-impedance granular-aluminum ring resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting inductors with impedance surpassing the resistance quantum, i.e., superinductors, are important for quantum technologies because they enable the development of protected qubits, enhance coupling to systems with small electric dipole moments, and facilitate the study of phase-slip physics. We demonstrate superinductors with densely packed meandered traces of granular aluminum (grAl) with inductances up to 4 mu H, achieving impedances exceeding 100 kQ in the 4-8 GHz range. Ring resonators made with grAl meandered superinductors exhibit quality factors on the order of 105 in the single-photon regime, and low nonlinearity on the order of tens of hertz. Depending on the grAl resistivity, at 10 Hz, we measure frequency-noise spectral densities in the range of 102-103 Hz/root Hz. In some devices, in the single-photon regime, we observe a positive Kerr coefficient of unknown origin. Using more complex fabrication, the devices could be released from the substrate, either freestanding or suspended on a membrane, thereby further improving their impedance by a factor of 3.

TI Time-space-encoded readout for noise suppression and scalable scanning
   in optically active solid-state spin systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optically active solid-state spin systems have been extensively studied in quantum technologies. We introduce a new readout scheme, termed "time-to-space" (T2S) encoding, which decouples spin manipulation from optical readout both temporally and spatially. This is achieved by simultaneously controlling the spin state within a region of interest, followed by rapid scanning of the optical readout position using an acousto-optic modulator. Time tracking allows the optical readout position to be encoded as a function of time. Using nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles in diamond, we demonstrate that the T2S scheme enables correlated experiments for efficient common-mode noise cancellation in various nano- and microscale sensing scenarios. Additionally, we show scalable multipixel imaging that does not require a camera and has the potential to accelerate data acquisition by several hundred times compared to conventional scanning methods. We anticipate widespread adoption of this technique, as it requires no additional components beyond those commonly used in experiments with optically adressable spin systems.

TI Anomalous supercurrent and diode effect in locally perturbed topological
   Josephson junctions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry can lead to peculiar effects in Josephson junctions, such as the anomalous Josephson effect or supercurrent rectification, which is a dissipationless analog of the diode effect. Due to their impact in new quantum technologies, it is important to find robust platforms and external means to manipulate the above-mentioned effects in a controlled way. Here, we theoretically consider a Josephson junction based on a quantum spin Hall system as the normal channel, subjected to a magnetic field in the direction defined by spin-momentum locking, and in the presence of a local tip in close proximity to one of the metallic edges in the normal region. We consider different local perturbations, model normal and magnetic tips, and study how they affect the Josephson response of the device. In particular, we argue that magnetic tips are a useful tool that allows for tunability of both phi(0) response and supercurrent rectification.

TI High-resolution ptychographic imaging at a seeded free-electron laser
   source using OAM beams
SO OPTICA
AB Electromagnetic waves possessing orbital angular momentum (OAM) are powerful tools for applications in optical communications, quantum technologies, and optical tweezers. Recently, they have attracted growing interest since they can be harnessed to detect peculiar helical dichroic effects in chiral molecular media and in magnetic nanostructures. In this work, we perform single-shot per position ptychography on a nanostructured object at a seeded free-electron laser, using extreme ultraviolet OAM beams of different topological charge orders 2 generated with spiral zone plates. By controlling 2 , we demonstrate how the structural features of OAM beam profiles determine an improvement of about 30% in image resolution with respect to conventional Gaussian beam illumination. This result extends the capabilities of coherent diffraction imaging techniques, and paves the way for achieving time-resolved high -resolution (below 100 nm) microscopy on large area samples.

TI Metasurface reflector enables room-temperature circularly polarized
   emission from VCSEL
SO OPTICA
AB While most lasers are linearly polarized, circularly polarized laser sources are crucial components for many optical applications such as biosensing, quantum technologies, and AR/VR. However, conventional methods for generating chiral light have limitations in device miniaturization. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), with their small footprint and surface emission feature, can be integrated with ultrathin metasurfaces for light manipulation, offering an opportunity to realize ultracompact chiral lasers. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of chiral lasing from electrically pumped VCSELs at room temperature, without spin injection. This is enabled by incorporating a high-contrast chiral metasurface reflector as the VCSEL top mirror, favoring one specific circular polarization for lasing. Our demonstrated 940 nm VCSELs show stable single-mode chiral lasing and achieve a circular-polarization degree of up to 59%. This study provides a scalable approach for circular-polarization control of VCSELs and holds great promise for applications that desire ultracompact chiral emitters.

TI A way forward for fundamental physics in space
SO NPJ MICROGRAVITY
AB Space-based research can provide a major leap forward in the study of key open questions in the fundamental physics domain. They include the validity of Einstein's Equivalence principle, the origin and the nature of dark matter and dark energy, decoherence and collapse models in quantum mechanics, and the physics of quantum many-body systems. Cold-atom sensors and quantum technologies have drastically changed the approach to precision measurements. Atomic docks and atom interferometers as well as classical and quantum links can be used to measure tiny variations of the space-time metric, elusive accelerations, and faint forces to test our knowledge of the physical laws ruling the Universe. In space, such instruments can benefit from unique conditions that allow improving both their precision and the signal to be measured. In this paper, we discuss the scientific priorities of a space-based research program in fundamental physics.

TI Light propagation and magnon-photon coupling in optically dispersive
   magnetic media
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Achieving strong coupling between light and matter excitations in hybrid systems is a benchmark for the implementation of quantum technologies. We recently proposed (Bittencourt, Liberal, and Viola-Kusminskiy, arXiv:2110.02984) that strong single-particle coupling between magnons and light can be realized in a magnetized epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) medium, in which magneto-optical effects are enhanced. Here we present a detailed derivation of the magnon-photon coupling Hamiltonian in dispersive media both for degenerate and nondegenerate optical modes, and show the enhancement of the coupling near the ENZ frequency. Moreover, we show that the coupling of magnons to plane-wave nondegenerate Voigt modes vanishes at specific frequencies due to polarization selection rules tuned by dispersion. Finally, we present specific results using a Lorentz dispersion model. Our results pave the way for the design of dispersive optomagnonic systems, providing a general theoretical framework for describing and engineering ENZ-based optomagnonic systems.

TI An Atomic Receiver for AM and FM Radio Communication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
AB Radio reception relies on antennas for the collection of electromagnetic fields carrying information, and receiver elements for demodulation and retrieval of the transmitted information. Here, we demonstrate an atom-based receiver for AM and FM microwave communication with a 3 dB bandwidth in the baseband of similar to 100 kHz that provides optical circuit-free field pickup, multiband carrier capability, and inherently high field sensitivity. The atom-based receiver exploits field-sensitive cesium Rydberg vapors in a centimeter-sized glass cell, and electromagnetically induced transparency, a quantum-optical effect, as a readout of baseband signals modulated onto carriers with frequencies ranging over four octaves, from C-band to Q-band. Receiver bandwidth, dynamic range and sideband suppression are characterized, and acquisition of audio waveforms of human vocals demonstrated. The atomic receiver is a valuable receiver technology because it does not require antenna structures and is resilient against electromagnetic interference, while affording multiband operation in a single compact receiving element.

TI Liouvillian skin effect in quantum neural networks
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB In the field of dissipative systems, the non-Hermitian skin effect has generated significant interest due to its unexpected implications. A system is said to exhibit a skin effect if its properties are largely affected by the boundary conditions. Despite the burgeoning interest, the potential impact of this phenomenon on emerging quantum technologies remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by demonstrating that quantum neural networks can exhibit this behavior and that skin effects, beyond their fundamental interest, can also be exploited in computational tasks. Specifically, we show that the performance of a given complex network used as a quantum reservoir computer is dictated solely by the boundary conditions of a dissipative line within its architecture. The closure of one (edge) link is found to drastically change the performance in time-series processing, proving the possibility of exploiting skin effects for machine learning.

TI Bipolar thermoelectric Josephson engine
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Thermoelectric effects in metals are typically small due to the nearly perfect particle-hole symmetry around their Fermi surface. Furthermore, thermo-phase effects and linear thermoelectricity in superconducting systems have been identified only when particle-hole symmetry is explicitly broken, since thermoelectric effects were considered impossible in pristine superconductors. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that superconducting tunnel junctions develop a very large bipolar thermoelectricity in the presence of a sizable thermal gradient thanks to spontaneous particle-hole symmetry breaking. Our junctions show Seebeck coefficients of up to +/- 300 mu V K-1, which is comparable with quantum dots and roughly 10(5) times larger than the value expected for normal metals at subkelvin temperatures. Moreover, by integrating our junctions into a Josephson interferometer, we realize a bipolar thermoelectric Josephson engine generating phase-tunable electric powers of up to similar to 140 nW mm(-2). Notably, our device implements also the prototype for a persistent thermoelectric memory cell, written or erased by current injection. We expect that our findings will lead to applications in superconducting quantum technologies.

TI Cavity optomechanics with a laser-engineered optical trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Laser-engineered exciton-polariton networks could lead to dynamically configurable integrated optical circuitry and quantum devices. Combining cavity optomechanics with electrodynamics in laser-configurable hybrid designs constitutes a platform for the vibrational control, conversion, and transport of signals. With this aim we investigate three-dimensional optical traps laser induced in quantum well embedded semiconductor planar microcavities. We show that the laser-generated and -controlled discrete states of the traps dramatically modify the interaction between photons and phonons confined in the resonators, accessing through coupling of photoelastic origin (g(0)/2 pi similar to 1.8 MHz) an optomechanical cooperativity C > 1 for milliwatt excitation. The quenching of Stokes processes and double-resonant enhancement of anti-Stokes ones involving pairs of discrete optical states in the sideband-resolved regime allow the optomechanical cooling of 180-GHz bulk acoustic waves, starting from room temperature down to similar to 130 K. These results pave the way for dynamical tailoring of optomechanical actuation in the extremely high frequency range (30-300 GHz) for future network and quantum technologies.

TI Systematic modulation of charge and spin in graphene nanoribbons on MgO
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In order to take full advantage of graphene nanostructures in quantum technologies, their charge and spin state must be precisely controlled. Graphene quantum dots require external gating potentials to tune their ground state. Here, we show systematic manipulation of the electron occupation in graphene nanoribbons lying on MgO layers grown on Ag(001). Owing to the efficient electronic decoupling character of MgO, and the electropositive nature of the substrate, the ribbons host an integer number of electrons that depend on their length and shape. This results in the alternation between a non-magnetic closed-shell state and an open-shell paramagnetic system for even and odd electron occupations respectively. For the odd case, we find a narrow Coulomb correlation gap, which is the smoking gun of its spin-1/2 state. Comparisons of scanning tunnelling microscopy data with mean-field Hubbard simulations confirm the discretization of the ribbons' electronic states and charge excess of up to 19 electrons per ribbon.

TI Strong intrinsic room-temperature ferromagnetism in freestanding non-van
   der Waals ultrathin 2D crystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Control of ferromagnetism is of critical importance for a variety of proposed spintronic and topological quantum technologies. Inducing long-range ferromagnetic order in ultrathin 2D crystals will provide more functional possibility to combine their unique electronic, optical and mechanical properties to develop new multifunctional coupled applications. Recently discovered intrinsic 2D ferromagnetic crystals such as Cr2Ge2Te6, CrI3 and Fe3GeTe2 are intrinsically ferromagnetic only below room temperature, mostly far below room temperature (Curie temperature, similar to 20-207 K). Here we develop a scalable method to prepare freestanding non-van der Waals ultrathin 2D crystals down to mono- and few unit cells (UC) and report unexpected strong, intrinsic, ambient-air-robust, room-temperature ferromagnetism with T-C up to similar to 367 K in freestanding non-van der Waals 2D CrTe crystals. Freestanding 2D CrTe crystals show comparable or better ferromagnetic properties to widely-used Fe, Co, Ni and BaFe12O19, promising as new platforms for room-temperature intrinsically-ferromagnetic 2D crystals and integrated 2D devices.

TI Optimization of heterogeneously integrated InP-Si on-chip photonic
   components
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate comprehensive numerical studies on a hybrid III-V/Si-based waveguide system, serving as a platform for efficient light coupling between an integrated III-V quantum dot emitter to an on-chip quantum photonic integrated circuit defined on a silicon substrate. We propose a platform consisting of a hybrid InP/Si waveguide and an InP-embedded InAs quantum dot, emitting at the telecom C-band near 1550 nm. The platform can be fabricated using existing semiconductor processing technologies. Our numerical studies reveal nearly 87% of the optical field transfer efficiency between geometrically-optimized InP/Si and Si waveguides, considering propagating field along a tapered geometry. The coupling efficiency of a directional dipole emission to the hybrid InP/Si waveguide is evaluated to similar to 38%, which results in more than 33% of the total on-chip optical field transfer efficiency from the dipole to the Si waveguide. We also consider the off-chip outcoupling efficiency of the propagating photon field along the Si waveguide by examining the normal to the chip plane and in-plane outcoupling configurations. In the former case, the outcoupling amounts to similar to 26% when using the circular Bragg grating outcoupler design. In the latter case, the efficiency reaches up to 8%. Finally, we conclude that the conceptual device's performance is weakly susceptible to the transferred photon wavelength, offering a broadband operation within the 1.5-1.6 mu m spectral range.

TI Integrate and scale: a source of spectrally separable photon pairs
SO OPTICA
AB Integrated photonics is a powerful contender in the race for a fault-tolerant quantum computer, claiming to be a platform capable of scaling to the necessary number of qubits. This necessitates the use of high-quality quantum states, which we create here using an all-around high-performing photon source on an integrated photonics platform. We use a photonic molecule architecture and broadband directional couplers to protect against fabrication tolerances and ensure reliable operation. As a result, we simultaneously measure a spectral purity of 99.1 +/- 0.1%, a pair generation rate of 4.4 +/- 0.1 MHz mW(-2), and an intrinsic source heralding efficiency of 94.0 +/- 2.9%. We also see a maximum coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 1644 +/- 263. We claim over an order of magnitude improvement in the trivariate trade-off among source heralding efficiency, purity, and brightness. Future implementations of the source could achieve in excess of 99% purity and heralding efficiency using the lowest reported propagation losses.

TI Hot-Injection-Free Silicon Nanocrystals Realize Record-Breaking
   Sustainable QD LEDs
SO CHEMICAL RECORD
AB Silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) are an emerging class of high-performing, sustainable, environmentally safe luminescent nanomaterial. They offer opportunities for next-generation displays, solid-state lighting, medical applications, and quantum technologies. Here, we highlight recent breakthroughs in colloidal SiQD synthesis and photophysics, comparing eight synthetic strategies. Among these, we focus on the hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) polymer route, a simple and cost-effective hot-injection-free method that yields highly crystalline, ultrabright, and stable SiQDs with photoluminescence quantum yields approaching 80%. We also describe how solvent engineering realizes SiQD light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with record external quantum efficiencies (EQEs, >16%), >700-fold-increased lifetimes, and far-red emissions to rival state-of-the-art perovskite QD LEDs. Moreover, rice husk-derived SiQD LEDs illustrate the potential for low-waste circular material cycles. Thus, SiQDs are a sustainable platform for plant growth technologies, photodynamic therapy, and beyond.

TI Fast recovery of niobium-based superconducting resonators after laser
   illumination
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Interfacing superconducting microwave resonators with optical systems enables sensitive photon detectors, quantum transducers, and related quantum technologies. Achieving high optical pulse repetition is crucial for maximizing the device throughput. However, light-induced deterioration, such as quasiparticle poisoning, pair-breaking-phonon generation, and elevated temperature, hinders the rapid recovery of superconducting circuits, limiting their ability to sustain high optical pulse repetition rates. Understanding these loss mechanisms and enabling fast circuit recovery are therefore critical. In this work, we investigate the impact of optical illumination on niobium nitride and niobium microwave resonators by immersing them in superfluid helium-4 and demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude faster resonance recovery compared to vacuum. By analyzing transient resonance responses, we provide insights into light-induced dynamics in these superconductors, highlighting the advantages of niobium-based superconductors and superfluid helium for rapid circuit recovery in superconducting quantum systems integrated with optical fields.

TI Optimization of experimental quantum randomness expansion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum technologies provide many applications for information processing tasks that are impossible to realize within classical physics. These capabilities include such fundamental resources as generating secure, i.e., private and unpredictable random values. Yet, the problem of quantifying the amount of generated randomness is still not fully solved. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the design and performance optimization of a quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on Bell inequality violations. We investigate key protocol parameters, including the smoothing parameter (Es), test round probability (gamma ), and switching delays, and their effects on the generation rate and quality of randomness. We identify optimal ranges for gamma and p (the protocol's nonaborting probability) to balance the tradeoff between randomness consumption and net randomness generation. We investigate the impact of the laser power on the overall generation rate. We explore the impact of switching delays on the system's performance, providing strategies to mitigate these effects. The work provides practical guidelines for the efficient and secure design of QRNG systems and other cryptographic protocols.

TI Periodic Phase Slips and Frequency Comb Generation at Tunable Microwave
   Frequencies in Superconducting Diabolo Structures
SO ACS NANOSCIENCE AU
AB Superconductors are characterized by macroscopic phase coherence and have enabled cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies. Recent advances in 3D nanofabrication now offer possibilities for tuning functional properties relevant for on-chip 3D integration of superconductors. However, nonequilibrium phenomena in 3D nanostructures exposed to transport currents remain largeley unexplored. Here, we employ numerical simulations to investigate phase slips-discrete 2 pi jumps in the phase of the superconducting order parameter-in a tubular Nb superconductor with a central constriction, which is subjected to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transport currents. We find that under DC drive, the system stabilizes periodic phase slips, resulting in GHz voltage oscillations. Introducing an additional AC frequency modulation generates microwave frequency combs which depend characteristically on the interaction between moving vortices and phase slips. Our findings open avenues for developing on-chip frequency comb generators in 3D cryoelectronics.

TI Postulating the Unicity of the Macroscopic Physical World
SO ENTROPY
AB We argue that a clear view of quantum mechanics is obtained by considering that the unicity of the macroscopic world is a fundamental postulate of physics, rather than an issue that must be mathematically justified or demonstrated. This postulate allows for a framework in which quantum mechanics can be constructed in a complete mathematically consistent way. This is made possible by using general operator algebras to extend the mathematical description of the physical world toward macroscopic systems. Such an approach goes beyond the usual type-I operator algebras used in standard textbook quantum mechanics. This avoids a major pitfall, which is the temptation to make the usual type-I formalism 'universal'. This may also provide a meta-framework for both classical and quantum physics, shedding new light on ancient conceptual antagonisms and clarifying the status of quantum objects. Beyond exploring remote corners of quantum physics, we expect these ideas to be helpful to better understand and develop quantum technologies.

SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Low-dimensional microwave interconnects have important applications for nanoscale electronics, from complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) to silicon quantum technologies. Graphene is naturally nanoscale and has already demonstrated attractive electronic properties, however its application to electronics is limited by available fabrication techniques and CMOS incompatibility. Here, the characteristics of transmission lines made from silicon doped with phosphorus are investigated using phosphine monolayer doping. S-parameter measurements are performed between 4-26 GHz from room temperature down to 4.5 K. At 20 GHz, the measured monolayer transmission line characteristics consist of an attenuation constant of 40 dB mm(-1) and a characteristic impedance of 600 omega. The results indicate that Si:P monolayers are a viable candidate for microwave transmission and that they have a.c. properties similar to graphene, with the additional benefit of extremely precise, reliable, stable, and inherently CMOS compatible fabrication.

TI Long-distance device-independent conference key agreement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables two remote parties to share an information-theoretically secure key without any assumptions on the inner workings of the devices used. Device-independent conference key agreement (DI-CKA) is multipartite DI-QKD in which more than two parties share a common secure key. The performance of DI-CKA, however, is strictly limited because of its susceptibility to losses due to, e.g., imperfect detection efficiency and channel transmission. Here, we propose a DI-CKA protocol which reduces this limitation by using a heralding scheme to distribute multipartite entanglement. We analyze key rates of our protocol for two different measurement scenarios, and we show that our protocol outperforms a previous DI-CKA protocol even with an experimentally feasible measurement.

Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C-N bonds. Bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open-shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the pi orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low-energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low-dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.

TI Programmable integrated photonics for topological Hamiltonians
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A variety of topological Hamiltonians have been demonstrated in photonic platforms, leading to fundamental discoveries and enhanced robustness in applications such as lasing, sensing, and quantum technologies. To date, each topological photonic platform implements a specific type of Hamiltonian with inexistent or limited reconfigurability. Here, we propose and demonstrate different topological models by using the same reprogrammable integrated photonics platform, consisting of a hexagonal mesh of silicon Mach-Zehnder interferometers with phase shifters. We specifically demonstrate a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian supporting a localized topological edge mode and a higher-order topological insulator based on a two-dimensional breathing Kagome Hamiltonian with three corner states. These results highlight a nearly universal platform for topological models that may fast-track research progress toward applications of topological photonics and other coupled systems.
   Topological photonics could impact the scalability of integrated photonics, but it has shown limited reconfigurability to date. Here, the authors demonstrate reprogrammable integrated photonics as a nearly universal platform for topological models.

TI Dopant-assisted stabilization of negatively charged single
   nitrogen-vacancy centers in phosphorus-doped diamond at low temperatures
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Charge state instabilities have been a bottleneck for the implementation of solid-state spin systems and pose a major challenge to the development of spin-based quantum technologies. Here we investigate the stabilization of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in phosphorus-doped diamond at liquid helium temperatures. Photoionization of phosphorous donors in conjunction with charge diffusion at the nanoscale enhances NV0 to NV- conversion and stabilizes the NV- charge state without the need for an additional repump laser. The phosphorus-assisted stabilization is explored and confirmed both with experiments and our theoretical model. Stable photoluminescence-excitation spectra are obtained for NV- centers created during the growth. The fluorescence is continuously recorded under resonant excitation to real-time monitor the charge state and the ionization and recombination rates are extracted from time traces. We find a linear laser power dependence of the recombination rate as opposed to the conventional quadratic dependence, which is attributed to the photo-ionization of phosphorus atoms.

TI Dawn of nitride ferroelectric semiconductors: from materials to devices
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB III-nitride semiconductors are promising optoelectronic and electronic materials and have been extensively investigated in the past decades. New functionalities, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, and superconductivity, have been implanted into III-nitrides to expand their capability in next-generation semiconductor and quantum technologies. The recent experimental demonstration of ferroelectricity in nitride materials, including ScAl(Ga)N, boron-substituted AlN, and hexagonal BN, has inspired tremendous research interest. Due to the large remnant polarization, high breakdown field, high Curie temperature, and significantly enhanced piezoelectric, linear and nonlinear optical properties, nitride ferroelectric semiconductors have enabled a wealth of applications in electronic, ferroelectronic, acoustoelectronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices and systems. In this review, the development of nitride ferroelectric semiconductors from materials to devices is discussed. While expounding on the unique advantages and outstanding achievements of nitride ferroelectrics, the existing challenges and promising prospects have been also discussed.

TI Semi-Device-Independent Heterodyne-Based Quantum Random-Number Generator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Randomness is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, which is an invaluable resource for both classical and quantum technologies. Practical quantum random-number generators (QRNGs) usually need to trust their devices, but their security can be jeopardized in the case of imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work, we present a robust implementation of a semi-device-independent QRNG that guarantees both security and fast generation rates. The system works in a prepare-and-measure scenario, where measurement and source are uncharacterized, but a bound on the energy of the prepared states is assumed. Our implementation exploits heterodyne detection, which offers increased generation rate and improved long-term stability compared to alternative measurement strategies. In particular, due to the tomographic properties of heterodyne measurement, we can compensate for fast phase fluctuations via postprocessing, avoiding complex active phase-stabilization systems. As a result, our scheme combines high security and speed with a simple setup featuring only commercial-off-the-shelf components, making it an attractive solution in many practical scenarios.

TI A holistic view of the dynamics of long-lived valley polarized dark
   excitonic states in monolayer WS2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB With their long lifetime and protection against decoherence, dark excitons in monolayer semiconductors offer a promising route for quantum technologies. Optical techniques have previously observed dark excitons with a long-lived valley polarization. However, several aspects remain unknown, such as the populations and time evolution of the different valley-polarized dark excitons and the role of excitation conditions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we obtain a holistic view of the dynamics after valley-selective photoexcitation. By varying experimental conditions, we reconcile between the rapid valley depolarization previously reported in TR-ARPES, and the observation of long-lived valley polarized dark excitons in optical studies. For the latter, we find that momentum-dark excitons largely dominate at early times sustaining a 40% degree of valley polarization, while valley-polarized spin-dark states dominate at longer times. Our measurements provide the timescales and how the different dark excitons contribute to the previously observed long-lived valley polarization in optics.

TI Indium tin oxide combined with anti-reflective coatings with high
   transmittance for wavelengths <400 nm
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB The transparent and conductive properties of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films make them an attractive coating for optically integrated ion traps. However, the relatively low transmittance for wavelengths <400 nm, high scattering, and high production temperature limit the usability in trapped-ion-based quantum technologies. Here we present ITO coatings and a combined ITO + anti-reflective (AR) coating system optimized for an ion trap applied using ion beam sputtering (IBS). The coatings feature a high transmittance for wavelengths <400 nm and additional wavelengths up to 1000 nm, low scattering, and low production temperature <150 degrees C. The transmission, reflection, and absorption spectra are simulated and the resistance, transmittance, and scattering at 370 nm are measured for different ITO coating thicknesses and the ITO + AR coating system. For the ITO + AR coating system a resistance of 115 +/- 552 Omega/square, transmittance of 80%, and scattering of 0.012 +/- 0.002% at 370 nm are achieved.

TI Nonlinear nanoresonators for Bell state generation
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Entangled photon states are a fundamental resource for optical quantum technologies and investigating the fundamental predictions of quantum mechanics. Up to now such states are mainly generated in macroscopic nonlinear optical systems with elaborately tailored optical properties. In this theoretical work, we extend the understanding on the generation of entangled photonic states toward the nanoscale regime by investigating the fundamental properties of photon-pair generation in sub-wavelength nonlinear nanoresonators. Taking materials with Zinc-Blende structure as an example, we reveal that such systems can naturally generate various polarization-entangled Bell states over a very broad range of wavelengths and emission directions, with little to no engineering needed. Interestingly, we uncover different regimes of operation, where polarization-entangled photons can be generated with dependence on or complete independence from the pumping wavelength and polarization, and the modal content of the nanoresonator. Our work also shows the potential of nonlinear nanoresonators as miniaturized sources of biphoton states with highly complex and tunable properties.

TI Multi-Watt cavity for 266 nm light in vacuum
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Intense coherent ultraviolet radiation is gaining increasing importance in advanced quantum technologies-from optical clocks and quantum computers to matter-wave interferometry-as well as in photochemistry, life sciences, semiconductor industry, and space applications. Since the preparation of multi-Watt light sources is still an open challenge for many ultraviolet wavelengths, resonant enhancement in a cavity is an attractive alternative. However, many experiments with atoms, molecules or nanoparticles require isolation in high vacuum where UV optics often show fast degradation. Here, we present stable performance of a cavity for 266 nm light with several Watt of intra-cavity power in high vacuum despite the presence of hydrocarbons. Comparing two sets of cavity mirrors indicates that this feat is connected to the micro-chemical environment at the topmost coating layer. Our study emphasizes the need for further developments in this direction to facilitate robust, compact, and high-performing devices employing UV radiation.

TI Rare-earth metal catalysts for high-pressure synthesis of rare diamonds
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The combination of the unique properties of diamond and the prospects for its high-technology applications urges the search for new solvents-catalysts for the synthesis of diamonds with rare and unusual properties. Here we report the synthesis of diamond from melts of 15 rare-earth metals (REM) at 7.8 GPa and 1800-2100 degrees C. The boundary conditions for diamond crystallization and the optimal parameters for single crystal diamond synthesis are determined. Depending on the REM catalyst, diamond crystallizes in the form of cube-octahedrons, octahedrons and specific crystals bound by tetragon-trioctahedron and trigon-trioctahedron faces. The synthesized diamonds are nitrogen-free and belong to the rare type II, indicating that the rare-earth metals act as both solvent-catalysts and nitrogen getters. It is found that the REM catalysts enable synthesis of diamond doped with group IV elements with formation of impurity-vacancy color centers, promising for the emerging quantum technologies. Our study demonstrates a new field of application of rare-earth metals.

TI Integration of Er3+ Emitters in Silicon-on-Insulator Nanodisk
   Metasurface
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Erbium (Er3+) emitters are relevant for optical applications due to their narrow emission line directly in the telecom C-band due to the 4I13/2 -> 4I15/2 transition at 1.54 mu m. Additionally, they are promising candidates for future quantum technologies when embedded in thin film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) to achieve fabrication scalability and CMOS compatibility. In this paper we integrate Er3+ emitters in SOI metasurfaces made of closely spaced arrays of nanodisks, to study their spontaneous emission via room and cryogenic temperature confocal microscopy, off-resonance and in-resonance photoluminescence excitation at room temperature and time-resolved spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the possibility to adopt CMOS-compatible and fabrication-scalable metasurfaces for controlling and improving the collection efficiency of the spontaneous emission from the Er3+ transition in SOI and that they could be adopted in similar technologically advanced materials.

TI Pauli spin blockade at room temperature in double-quantum-dot tunneling
   through individual deep dopants in silicon
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.

TI Jaynes-Cummings interaction between low-energy free electrons and cavity
   photons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is at the core of cavity quantum electrodynamics; however, it relies on bound-electron emitters fundamentally limited by the binding Coulomb potential. In this work, we propose theoretically a new approach to realizing the Jaynes-Cummings model using low-energy free electrons coupled to dielectric microcavities and exemplify several quantum technologies made possible by this ap-proach. Using quantum recoil, a large detuning inhibits the emission of multiple consecutive photons, effective-ly transforming the free electron into a few-level system coupled to the cavity mode. We show that this approach can be used for generation of single photons, photon pairs, and even a quantum SWAP gate between a photon and a free electron, with unity efficiency and high fidelity. Tunable by their kinetic energy, quantum free elec-trons are inherently versatile emitters with an engineerable emission wavelength. Hence, they pave the way toward new possibilities for quantum interconnects between photonic platforms at disparate spectral regimes.

TI Tuning and Enhancing Quantum Coherence Time Scales in Molecules via
   Light-Matter Hybridization
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Protecting quantum coherences in matter from the detrimental effects introduced by its environment is essential to employ molecules and materials in quantum technologies and develop enhanced spectroscopies. Here, we show how dressing molecular chromophores with quantum light in the context of optical cavities can be used to generate quantum superposition states with tunable coherence time scales that are longer than those of the bare molecule, even at room temperature and for molecules immersed in solvent. For this, we develop a theory of decoherence rates for molecular polaritonic states and demonstrate that quantum superpositions that involve such hybrid light-matter states can survive for times that are orders of magnitude longer than those of the bare molecule while remaining optically controllable. Further, by studying these tunable coherence enhancements in the presence of lossy cavities, we demonstrate that they can be enacted using present-day optical cavities. The analysis offers a viable strategy to engineer and increase quantum coherence lifetimes in molecules.

TI Nonlinear Coupling of Phononic Resonators Induced by Surface Acoustic
   Waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The rising need for hybrid physical platforms has triggered a renewed interest in the development of agile radio-frequency phononic circuits with complex functionalities. The combination of traveling waves with resonant mechanical elements appears as an appealing means of harnessing elastic vibration. In this work, we demonstrate that this combination can be further enriched by the occurrence of traveling surface acoustic waves (SAWs), induced by elastic nonlinearities, interacting with a pair of otherwise linear micron-scale mechanical resonators. Reduction of the resonator-gap distance and an increase in the SAW amplitude results in a frequency softening of the resonator-pair response that lies outside the usual picture of geometrical Duffing nonlinearities. The dynamics of the SAW excitation scheme allows further control of the resonator motion, notably leading to circular-polarization states. These results may pave the way toward versatile high-frequency phononic microelectromechanical-systems-nanoelectromechanicalsystems circuits fitting both classical and quantum technologies.

TI Comparison of Gaussian and vortex beams in free-space QKD with phase
   encoding in turbulent atmosphere
SO NANOSYSTEMS-PHYSICS CHEMISTRY MATHEMATICS
AB At present, free-space QKD systems are being actively researched and developed. The main limitation of these systems remains the strong influence of atmospheric turbulence and weather conditions on the propagating Gaussian beam. In turn, a number of works have shown that vortex beams are more stable in a turbulent atmosphere. Thus, in this work, the use of vortex beams in the free-space QKD system with phase encoding under the condition of a turbulent atmosphere and their comparison with Gaussian beams are studied. The possibility of phase modulation preservation with additional modulation and demodulation of the vortex beam is also investigated.

TI Hybrid magnon-photon system for sensing weak phase
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB It belongs to a hot topic to sense or detect the weak and even ultra-weak physical quantities by utilizing quantum platforms and methods. We here propose a hybrid magnon-photon system of the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnon mode coupled to a microwave cavity, which also includes another degree of freedom with respect to the thermal vibration of this YIG microsphere. In this quasi-tripartite coupling system, we generalize the condition for satisfying energy degeneracy and anti-crossing behaviors. Especially around the zero-energy area, we can get the joint quantum effects of anti-crossing behavior and degeneracy of systemic energy, and then reach a significantly enhanced sensitivity to this phase disturbance. Therefore our proposal can characterize this weak vibration through a phase disturbance and indicate a group of clearly resolvable output spectra. This investigation may be considered as an encouraging attempt on sensing weak quantity by engineering the systemic energy into the critical area for further enlarging its sensitivity to the weak disturbance.

TI Diamond-Based Nanoscale Quantum Relaxometry for Sensing Free Radical
   Production in Cells
SO SMALL
AB Diamond magnetometry makes use of fluorescent defects in diamonds to convert magnetic resonance signals into fluorescence. Because optical photons can be detected much more sensitively, this technique currently holds several sensitivity world records for room temperature magnetic measurements. It is orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting magnetic resonances. Here, the use of diamond magnetometry to detect free radical production in single living cells with nanometer resolution is experimentally demonstrated. This measuring system is first optimized and calibrated with chemicals at known concentrations. These measurements serve as benchmarks for future experiments. While conventional MRI typically has millimeter resolution, measurements are performed on individual cells to detect nitric oxide signaling at the nanoscale, within 10-20 nm from the internalized particles localized with a diffraction limited optical resolution. This level of detail is inaccessible to the state-of-the-art techniques. Nitric oxide is detected and the dynamics of its production and inhibition in the intra- and extracellular environment are followed.

TI Continuous real-time sensing with a nitrogen-vacancy center via coherent
   population trapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose and theoretically analyze the use of coherent population trapping of a single diamond nitrogenvacancy (NV) center for continuous real-time sensing. The formation of the dark state in coherent population trapping prevents optical emissions from the NV center. Fluctuating magnetic fields, however, can kick the NV center out of the dark state, leading to a sequence of single-photon emissions. A time series of the photon counts detected can be used for magnetic field estimations, even when the average photon count per update time interval is much smaller than 1. For a theoretical demonstration, the nuclear spin bath in a diamond lattice is used as a model fluctuating magnetic environment. For fluctuations with known statistical properties, such as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Bayesian inference-based estimators can lead to an estimation variance that approaches the classical Cramer-Rao lower bound and can update dynamical information in real time with the detection of just a single photon. Real-time sensing using coherent population trapping adds a powerful tool to the emerging technology of quantum sensing.

TI Moving Abrikosov vortex lattices generate sub-40-nm magnons
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Magnons, the quasi-particles of spin waves, are promising candidates for developing wave-based computing and hybrid quantum technologies. However, generating short-wavelength magnons through microwave excitation becomes increasingly challenging because the excitation efficiency decreases as the antenna size shrinks. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach and generate magnons in a Co-Fe strip using magnetic flux quanta, that is, Abrikosov vortices, moving in an adjacent Nb-C superconductor at velocities exceeding 1 km s-1. The moving vortex lattice acts on the magnetic layer via both static and dynamic stray fields. Our experiments showcase the unidirectional excitation of sub-40-nm wavelength magnons and their coherent interaction with the moving vortices. In turn, the Nb-C sustains its low-resistive state because the magnon creation removes energy from the superconductor. This discovery enables high-speed on-chip electrically driven magnon generation and validates an alternative means of magnon excitation. Our approach could be adapted to other wave excitations, such as surface acoustic waves, for integration into advanced electronic and hybrid quantum systems.

TI Programmable phonon-assisted resonant energy transfer between moiré
   cells in charge-tunable MoSe2-WS2 heterobilayers
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Moir & eacute; superlattices in van-der-Waals heterostructures offer a versatile platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena. In type-I MoSe2-WS2 moir & eacute; superlattices, the large lattice mismatch ensures robustness of the moir & eacute; period against twist-angle disorder. The excitonic ground state is formed by moir & eacute;-trapped MoSe2 intralayer excitons. However, a key challenge is the controlled transfer of excitonic energy across moir & eacute; sites. This work investigates gate-controlled phonon-assisted resonant energy transfer (RET) as a means to transfer excitonic energy between moir & eacute; cells. By harnessing the interplay between resonantly excited moir & eacute; excitonic complexes and single or few phonons, energy transfer pathways can be modulated via the charging state of moir & eacute; cells. We discuss two potential RET mechanisms: phonon-assisted resonant tunneling and F & ouml;rster-like dipole-dipole transfer. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach for excitonic circuits and nanoscale energy transport, paving the way for future applications in quantum technologies.

TI Random alloy AlInAsSb single photon avalanche diodes with high breakdown
   probability
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Emerging quantum technologies depend on developing near-infrared single-photon counting detectors with high detection efficiencies (PDEs) and low dark count rates (DCRs). Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) operating in Geiger-mode are an attractive option for moderate cryogenic operating temperatures. InGaAs/InP SPADs exhibit excellent DCRs, but relatively low PDEs, primarily due to the low avalanche triggering probability (Pav ) of InP. Recent simulations have shown that sufficiently thick multipliers made from AlAsSb can readily exhibit much larger Pav values at low over-biases due to their comparatively stronger asymmetry between electron and hole ionization coefficients. AlxIn1-xAsySb1-y is a related antimonide material with a similarly strong ionization coefficient. In this work, the avalanche triggering probability of similar to 1 mu m thick Al0.79InAsSb multiplier grown on InP is measured. Pav values as large as 85% were attained at room temperature for an over-bias of 8%, confirming the capacity of antimonide-based multipliers to achieve high photon detection efficiencies.

TI Exploring Quantum Emission in Bilayer WSe2: Strain Effects
   from Nanopillars
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB 2D semiconductors subject to localized strain represent an emerging, scalable platform for the generation of bright single-photon emitters. In this study, the observation of quantum emission from bilayer (BL) WSe2 under varying 3D strain induced by dielectric nanopillars is reported. Spectrally narrow and bright photoluminescence along with antibunched photon statistics is observed, comparable to those of monolayer WSe2, consistent with strain-mediated quantum emission via defect states. The results indicate that the brightest emitters are created with pillar diameters ranging from 175 to 195 nm. A robust second-order correlation function of g(2)(0) = 0.139 confirms strong antibunching, indicative of high-quality single-photon emission. These findings highlight the potential of using nanopillar arrays to manipulate the electronic states and quantum emission in transition metal dichalcogenide BLs, paving the way for future applications in quantum technologies.

TI FACILITATING GRADUATE STUDENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP: BARRIERS AND PROPOSED
   SOLUTIONS
SO TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
AB University research, often funded by the federal government, is a linchpin of national innovation. This academic research drives advances in fundamental science, technology with long development horizons, and public priorities such as artificial intelligence, climate technologies, and quantum technologies. Universities produce not only the ideas but also the people driving scientific and technological innovation. Despite being key enablers of high-impact research, graduate students seldom transform their discoveries into commercial ventures. This disconnect represents missed technology transfer opportunities: the next Google, VMWare, Genentech, or Moderna that was not built. In this perspective, we attempt to answer the question "Why aren't more PhDs commercializing their research?" It is a product of 35 interviews with ecosystem participants, including startup founders, university technology licensing office administrators, entrepreneurship program leaders, and investors. We identify systemic barriers hindering graduate student entrepreneurship and propose targeted solutions to increase research commercialization. We aim to illuminate pathways for graduate students, alongside other stakeholders, to convert academic breakthroughs into market-ready technologies.

TI Spin-to-Charge Conversion with Electrode Confinement in Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center in diamond has a wide range of potential applications in quantum metrology, communications, and computation. The key to its use lies in how large the optical spin contrast is and the associated fidelity of the spin-state readout. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for improving contrast with a spin-to-charge protocol that relies on the use of an external electrode and cryogenic temperatures to discretize the diamond conduction band for spin-selective resonant photoionization. We use effective-mass theory to calculate the discrete eigenenergies in this system and use them to formulate a spin-to-charge protocol that involves resonant photoionization out of the N-V ground state into the diamond conduction band. The major sources of broadening, which guide the design of the experiment, are also addressed. With this mechanism, we calculate an optical spin contrast that and an associated spinreadout fidelity of 85%. This significant improvement can be applied to a number of cryogenic quantum technologies.

TI Triggered emission of indistinguishable photons from an organic dye

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Single molecules in solid state matrices have been proposed as sources of single photon Fock states back 20 years ago. Their success in quantum optics and in many other research fields stems from the simple recipes used in the preparation of samples, with hundreds of nominally identical and isolated molecules. Main challenges as of today for their application in photonic quantum technologies are the optimization of light extraction and the on-demand emission of indistinguishable photons. We here present Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiments with photons emitted by a single molecule of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene nanocrystal at 3 K, under continuous wave and also pulsed excitation. A detailed theoretical model is applied, which relies on independent measurements for most experimental parameters, hence allowing for an analysis of the different contributions to the two-photon interference visibility, from residual dephasing to spectral filtering. A HOM interference visibility of more than 75% is reported, which, according to the model, is limited by the residual dephasing present at the operating temperature.

TI Valley splitting and anomalous valley Hall effect in
   MoTe2/CrSCl heterostructure
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Two-dimensional valleytronics offers a promising platform for novel information processing and quantum technologies by harnessing the valley degree of freedom. A key challenge lies in lifting valley degeneracy, for which magnetic proximity effects provide a promising route. Here, we demonstrate substantial valley splitting in a MoTe2/CrSCl heterostructure via first-principles calculations. We show that interlayer charge transfer and interfacial orbital hybridization critically govern the valley physics at the interface. Under a moderate in-plane tensile strain (3%) and an applied out-of-plane electric field (0.2 V & Aring;-1), a sizable valley splitting of 63 meV emerges at the valence band maximum. These conditions induce hole doping and a pronounced Berry curvature of -23 & Aring;2 at the K valley, realizing an electrically tunable anomalous valley Hall effect. Our findings establish the MoTe2/CrSCl interface as a versatile platform for valley-selective charge transport, opening pathways for valleytronic device applications.

TI Stacking-Dependent Interlayer Excitons in BP/CrSe2 van der
   Waals Heterostructure
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The emergence of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has revolutionized exciton-based research due to their tunable electronic and optical properties. Here, we present a systematic many-body study of a BP/CrSe2 vdW heterostructure composed of experimentally realized boron phosphide (BP) and chromium diselenide (CrSe2) monolayers. We find a robust type-II band alignment across all stacking configurations; however, interlayer excitons emerge selectively depending on the stacking order. The vdW heterostructure exhibits strong exciton binding energy (0.34-0.44 eV, depending on stacking) and nanosecond-scale room-temperature radiative lifetimes, indicating long-lived excitonic states. Additionally, its optical absorption extends from the visible to the near-infrared regime, underscoring its potential for optoelectronic and excitonic applications. Our findings highlight the critical role of stacking-dependent interlayer coupling in controlling the excitonic properties of vdW heterostructures, paving the way for tailored design strategies in next-generation light-harvesting and quantum technologies.

TI Monolithic 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators with intrinsic factors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present an extensive study of 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators electrochemically etched out of a monocrystalline wafer. Combining piezo-driven interferometric determination of the mechanical spectra with scanning laser Doppler vibrometry, an unambiguous assignment of resonance peaks to flexural and torsional modes is achieved. The investigation of multiple harmonic eigenmodes of singly and doubly clamped resonators with varying geometry allows for a comprehensive characterization. Excellent intrinsic mechanical quality factors up to 2 x 105 are found at room temperature, approaching the thermoelastic limit at eigenfrequencies exceeding 10 MHz. Mechanical stress is essentially absent. Young's modulus is in agreement with the literature. These findings are robust under postprocessing treatments, in particular atomic layer etching and high-temperature thermal annealing. The resulting on-chip high-quality mechanical resonators represent a valuable technological element for a broad range of applications. In particular, the monolithic architecture meets the requirements of spin-based photonic quantum technologies on the upcoming SiC platform.

TI Quantum terminology in pseudoscience: exploration of pre-service physics
   teachers' reasonings
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The growing public fascination with quantum technologies has inadvertently fueled the rise of pseudoscientific claims, particularly the misuse of quantum terminology in fields such as alternative medicine. This phenomenon poses a challenge for physics education, where the distinction between legitimate science and pseudoscience is essential. This paper examines how pre-service physics teachers (N = 28) respond to pseudoscientific uses of quantum terminology, particularly in the context of quantum healing. Therefore, the participants were asked to evaluate a pseudoscientific text about quantum healing in a classroom-like vignette, responding as if they were addressing a student. Their responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis to categorize the types of reasoning used. Most participants were successful in identifying scientific inaccuracies and misuse of technical terms, although only a proportion applied broader Nature of Science (NOS)-related critiques. The findings suggest that although pre-service teachers are adept at identifying pseudoscientific claims, more emphasis on the principles of NOS could improve their ability to make comprehensive judgements.

TI Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging
   electronic and quantum device applications
SO FRONTIERS IN ELECTRONICS
AB The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion and storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.

TI Charge transport in n-type As- and Sb-hyperdoped Ge
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB This paper presents a systematic study of the charge transport behavior of heavily doped n-type Ge layers with As and Sb. A nonequilibrium method ion implantation followed by milliseconds flash lamp annealing is applied to synthesize the n(++) Ge layers (Ge:As and Ge:Sb). The resulting materials contain free electrons with a density above 3 x 10(19) cm(-3) and mobility more than 220 cm(2)/(V s). Quantum corrections to the conductance in a magnetic field are observed at low temperatures. Weak localization persists up to 30 K in Ge:Sb, while only up to 10 K in Ge:As. Using the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model to fit the magnetoconductance data, we obtain the phase coherence length l(phi) of the hyperdoped Ge samples in the range of 70-163 nm. This study may pave a way to explore possible applications for quantum technologies utilizing As- and Sb-hyperdoped Ge.

TI Ultrafast measurement of a single-photon wave packet using an optical
   Kerr gate
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Ultrafast quantum optics with time-frequency entangled photons is at the forefront of progress towards future quantum technologies. However, to unravel the time domain structure of entangled photons and exploit fully their rich dimensionality, a single-photon detector with sub-picosecond temporal resolution is required. Here, we present ultrafast single-photon detection using an optical Kerr gate composed of a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) placed inside a Sagnac interferometer. A near-rectangle temporal waveform of a heralded single-photon generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion is measured with temporal resolution as high as 224 +/- 9 fs. The large nonlinearity and long effective interaction length of the PCF enables maximum detection efficiency to be achieved with only 30.5 mW gating pulse average power, demonstrating an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to optical gating with sum-frequency generation. Also, we discuss the trade-off relationship between detection efficiency and temporal resolution. Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

TI Impact of Incorporation Kinetics on Device Fabrication with Atomic
   Precision
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Scanning tunneling microscope lithography can be used to create nanoelectronic devices in which dopant atoms are precisely positioned in a Si lattice within approximately 1 nm of a target position. This exquisite precision is promising for realizing various quantum technologies. However, a potentially impactful form of disorder is due to incorporation kinetics, in which the number of P atoms that incorporate into a single lithographic window is manifestly uncertain. We present experimental results indicating that the likelihood of incorporating into an ideally written three-dimer single-donor window is 63 +/- 10% for room-temperature dosing, and corroborate these results with a model for the incorporation kinetics. Nevertheless, further analysis of this model suggests conditions that might raise the incorporation rate to near-deterministic levels. We simulate bias spectroscopy on a chain of comparable dimensions to the array in our yield study, indicating that such an experiment may help confirm the inferred incorporation rate.

TI The Noncollinear Path to Two-Dimensional Topological Superconductivity
SO ACS NANO
AB Two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrids (2D-MSH) are promising candidates to realize devices for topology-based quantum technologies and superconducting spintronics. So far, studies have focused on 2D-MSH systems with collinear ferro- or antiferromagnetic layers. Here, we present the discovery of topological superconductivity in a noncollinear MSH system where a magnetic spiral is realized in an Fe monolayer proximity coupled to a superconducting Ta(110) substrate. By combining low-temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy with an in-depth theoretical study, we can conclude that the system is in a topological nodal-point superconducting phase with low-energy edge modes. Furthermore, we reveal that for this noncollinear spin texture, these edge modes exhibit a magnetization direction-dependent dispersion. This means that a spatial shift of the magnetic spiral could be used to reverse the chirality of an edge mode in future MSH-based devices.

TI Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasiconserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed one-dimensional quantum transverse-field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse-field Ising model and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.

TI Quantum Coherence Control at Temperatures up to 1400 K
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Coherent quantum control at high temperatures is important for expanding the quantum world and is useful for applying quantum technologies to realistic environments. Quantum control of spins in diamond has been demonstrated near 1000 K, with the spins polarized and read out at room temperature and controlled at elevated temperatures by rapid heating and cooling. Further increase of the working temperature is challenging due to fast spin relaxation in comparison with the heating and cooling rates. Here we significantly improve the heating and cooling rates by using reduced graphene oxide as the laser absorber and heat drain and hence realize coherent quantum operation at up to 1400 K, which is higher than the Curie temperatures of all known materials. This work facilitates the use of diamond sensors to study a wide range of magnetic effects in the high-temperature regime, such as thermoremanent magnetism and magnetic shape memory effects.

TI Fast optoelectronic charge state conversion of silicon vacancies in
   diamond
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Group IV vacancy color centers in diamond are promising spin-photon interfaces with strong potential for applications in photonic quantum technologies. Reliable methods for controlling and stabilizing their charge state are urgently needed for scaling to multiqubit devices. Here, we manipulate the charge state of silicon vacancy (SiV) ensembles by combining luminescence and photocurrent spectroscopy. We controllably convert the charge state between the optically active SiV- and dark SiV2- with megahertz rates and >90% contrast by judiciously choosing the local potential applied to in-plane surface electrodes and the laser excitation wavelength. We observe intense SiV- photoluminescence under hole capture, measure the intrinsic conversion time from the dark SiV2- to the bright SiV- to be 36.4(67) ms, and demonstrate how it can be enhanced by a factor of 105 via optical pumping. Moreover, we obtain previously unknown information on the defects that contribute to photoconductivity, indicating the presence of substitutional nitrogen and divacancies.

TI Mechanical dissipation by substrate-mode coupling in SiN resonators
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB State-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators are heralded as a central component for next-generation clocks, filters, resonant sensors, and quantum technologies. To practically build these technologies will require monolithic integration of microchips, resonators, and readout systems. While it is widely seen that mounting microchip substrates into a system can greatly impact the performance of high-Q resonators, a systematic study has remained elusive, owing to the variety of physical processes and factors that influence the dissipation. Here, we analytically analyze a mechanism by which substrates couple to resonators manufactured on them and experimentally demonstrate that this coupling can increase the mechanical dissipation of nanomechanical resonators when resonance frequencies of resonator and substrate coincide. More generally, we then show that a similar coupling mechanism can exist between two adjacent resonators. Since the substrate-mode coupling mechanism strongly depends on both the resonator position on the substrate and the mounting of the substrate, this work provides key design guidelines for high-precision nanomechanical technologies.

TI Single Photon Emitters Coupled to Plasmonic Waveguides: A Review
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB During the last two decades, many research groups have demonstrated coupling of single photon emitters to plasmonic waveguides, promising very high emission enhancements, for applications in quantum technologies. In this review, recent developments within this important research topic are discussed. Different plasmonic waveguide-quantum emitter configurations are compared from the application viewpoint by utilizing a figure-of-merit (FOM) reflecting the emission enhancement, coupling efficiency, and radiation loss. The experimental methods applied to obtain the coupled systems with high FOMs are described. Configurations that are exploited for reinforcing the coupling efficiency, i.e., the efficiency of funneling the emitted radiation into a plasmonic waveguide, are also considered as well as the scalability potential of various waveguide platforms. A recent experiment, in which enhanced light-matter interaction in a plasmonic waveguide is taken advantage of, resulting in the demonstration of non-linearity at the single emitter level, is discussed.

TI Enhancing the performance of mode-pairingquantum key distribution by

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) holds great promise for the practi-cal implementation of QKD in the near future. It combines the security advantages of measurementdevice independence while still being capable of breaking the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bound without the need for highly demanding phase-locking and phase-tracking tech-nologies for deployment. In this work, we explore optimization strategies for MP-QKD in awavelength-division multiplexing scenario. The simulation results reveal that incorporation ofmultiple wavelengths not only leads to a direct increase in key rate but also enhances the pairingefficiency by employing our novel pairing strategies among different wavelengths. As a result,our work provides a new avenue for the future application and development of MP-QKD.

TI Efficient fibre-pigtailed source of indistinguishable single photons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots in microcavities are an excellent platform for the efficient generation of indistinguishable single photons. However, their use in a wide range of quantum technologies requires their controlled fabrication and integration in compact closed-cycle cryocoolers, with a key challenge being the efficient and stable extraction of the single photons into a single-mode fibre. Here we report on a method for the fibre-pigtailing of deterministically fabricated single-photon sources. Our technique allows for nanometre-scale alignment accuracy between the source and a fibre, alignment that persists all the way from room temperature to 2.4 K. We demonstrate high performance of the device under near-resonant optical excitation with a photon indistinguishability of 97.5 % and a brightness at the output fibre of the system of 20.8 %. We show that the indistinguishability and single-photon rate are stable for over ten hours of continuous operation in a single cooldown. We further confirm that the device performance is not degraded by nine successive cooldown-warmup cycles.

Recent advances in experimental techniques for controlling and preparing these systems have increased interest in this area, as they have the potential to drive the development of quantum technologies. In this study, we present a density-functional-theory approach to extract detailed information about the statistics of work and the irreversible entropy associated with quantum quenches at finite temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate that these quantities can be expressed as functionals of thermal and out-of-equilibrium densities, which may serve as fundamental variables for understanding finite-temperature many-body processes. We, then, apply our method to the case of the inhomogeneous Hubbard model, showing that our density-functional-theorybased approach can be usefully employed to unveil the distinctive roles of interaction and external potential on the thermodynamic properties of such a system.

TI Matrix Encoding Method in Variational Quantum Singular Value
   Decomposition
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We propose the variational quantum singular value decomposition based on encoding the elements of the considered N x N matrix into the state of a quantum system of appropriate dimension. This method doesn't use the expansion of this matrix in terms of the unitary matrices. Controlled measurement is involved to avoid small success probability in ancilla measurement. The objective function for maximization algorithm can be obtained probabilistically via measurement of the states of two one-qubit subsystems. The circuit requires O(log N) qubits for realization of this algorithm whose depths is proportional to log N/epsilon, where epsilon is the precision required for calculation of singular values.

TI Tunable capacitor for superconducting qubits using an InAs/InGaAs
   heterostructure
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Adoption of fast, parametric coupling elements has improved the performance of superconducting qubits, enabling recent demonstrations of quantum advantage in randomized sampling problems. The development of low loss, high contrast couplers is critical for scaling up these systems. We present a blueprint for a gate-tunable coupler realized with a two-dimensional electron gas in an InAs/InGaAs heterostructure. Rigorous numerical simulations of the semiconductor and high frequency electromagnetic behavior of the coupler and microwave circuitry yield an on/off ratio of more than one order of magnitude. We give an estimate of the dielectric-limited loss from the inclusion of the coupler in a two qubit system, with coupler coherences ranging from a few to tens of microseconds.

TI Nonlinear coherent heat machines
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB We propose heat machines that are nonlinear, coherent, and closed systems composed of few field (oscillator) modes. Their thermal-state input is transformed by nonlinear Kerr interactions into nonthermal (non-Gaussian) output with controlled quantum fluctuations and the capacity to deliver work in a chosen mode. These ma-chines can provide an output with strongly reduced phase and amplitude uncertainty that may be useful for sensing or communications in the quantum domain. They are experimentally realizable in optomechanical cav-ities where photonic and phononic modes are coupled by a Josephson qubit or in cold gases where interactions between photons are transformed into dipole-dipole interacting Rydberg atom polaritons. This proposed ap-proach is a step toward the bridging of quantum and classical coherent and thermodynamic descriptions.

TI Entanglement cost of discriminating noisy Bell states by local
   operations and classical communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entangled states can help in quantum-state discrimination by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). For example, a Bell state is necessary (and sufficient) to perfectly discriminate a set of either three or four Bell states by LOCC. In this paper, we consider the task of LOCC discrimination of the states of noisy Bell ensembles, where a given ensemble consists of the states obtained by mixing the Bell states with an arbitrary two-qubit state with nonzero probabilities. It is proved that a Bell state is required for optimal discrimination by LOCC, even though the ensembles do not contain, in general, any maximally entangled state and, in specific instances, any entangled state.

TI Phase-controlled improvement of photon lifetime in coupled
   superconducting cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-quality cavities are crucial for various fundamental physical studies and applications. Here we find that by coupling two cavities directly or via a phase-tunable coupling channel, the photon lifetime of the local field can exceed that of the bare cavities. The cavity photon lifetime is modified by the phases of the initial states and the phase accumulation on the coupling channel, which affect the interference between cavities. In experiments, by coupling superconducting radio-frequency cavities via phase-tunable cables, we realize a factor of 2 improvement in the cavity photon lifetime. The results can bring rich revenue to quantum information science, sensing, and high-energy physics.

TI Single-Atom Trapping in a Metasurface-Lens Optical Tweezer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Optical metasurfaces of subwavelength pillars have provided new capabilities for the versatile definition of the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. In this work, we demonstrate that an efficient dielectric metasurface lens can be used to trap and image single neutral atoms with a long working distance from the lens of 3 mm. We characterize the high-numerical-aperture optical tweezers using the trapped atoms and compare with numerical computations of the metasurface-lens performance. We predict that future metasurfaces for atom trapping will be able to leverage multiple ongoing developments in metasurface design and enable multifunctional control in complex quantum information experiments with neutral-atom arrays.

   Quantum Framework

AB We introduce a novel class of coherent states, termed W alpha,beta,nu-coherent states, constructed using a deformed boson algebra based on the generalised factorial [n]alpha,beta,nu!. This algebra extends conventional factorials, incorporating advanced special functions such as the Mittag-Leffler and Wright functions, enabling the exploration of a broader class of quantum states. The mathematical properties of these states, including their continuity, completeness, and quantum fluctuations, are analysed. A key aspect of this work is the resolution of the Stieltjes moment problem associated with these states, achieved through the inverse Mellin transformation method. The framework provides insights into the interplay between the classical and quantum regimes, with potential applications in quantum optics and fractional quantum mechanics. By extending the theoretical landscape of coherent states, this study opens avenues for further exploration in mathematical physics and quantum technologies.

TI Quantum control of ion-atom collisions beyond the ultracold regime
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Tunable scattering resonances are crucial for controlling atomic and molecular systems. However, their use has so far been limited to ultracold temperatures. These conditions remain hard to achieve for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems-a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here, we measure inelastic collision probabilities for Sr+ + Rb and use them to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. Our theoretical results, compared with experimental observations, confirm that quantum interference effects persist to the multiple-partial-wave regime, leading to the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates. Using our model, we go beyond interference and identify a rich spectrum of Feshbach resonances at moderate magnetic fields with the Rb atom in its lower (f = 1) hyperfine state, which persist at temperatures as high as 1 millikelvin. Future observation of these predicted resonances should allow precise control of the short-range dynamics in Sr+ + Rb collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.

TI Mapping of Vibrational Modes Revealing a Strong and Tunable Coupling in
   Two Juxtaposed 3R-WSe2 Nanodrums
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) material resonators have emerged as promising platforms for advanced nanomechanical applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties, tunability, and nonlinearities. We explored the strong mechanical mode coupling between two adjacent 3R-WSe2 nanodrums at room temperature. Combining a piezoelectric material, as noncentrosymmetric 3R-WSe2, and vibration manipulation is the building block for phononic experiments with 2D materials. By strategically placing gate grids beneath each resonator and mapping the spatial distribution of these modes, we demonstrate the ability to transit between localized modes in individual membranes to delocalized, strongly coupled modes that span the entire suspended region. The coherent coupling is strongly tunable with simple gate voltage, and remarkable resonance splitting was achieved, corresponding to up to 5% of the vibration frequency. These results showcase the potential of 2D material resonators for efficient information exchange, paving the way for novel applications in quantum technologies and nanoscale sensing.

AB To achieve full control over acoustic phonons at ultrahigh frequencies, it is essential to characterize the phonon transport properties. Recent works have shown that surface acoustic waves at gigahertz frequencies can propagate over micrometer distances in different nanostructures such as nanowires, nanogratings, and nanoantennas. Here, we aim at investigating acoustic phonon transport by designing a GaAs/AlAs optophononic waveguide. Along the vertical direction of the waveguide, a Fabry-Perot cavity ensures an efficient confinement of acoustic phonons that has been demonstrated in planar and micropillar structures. In the lateral direction, the interface of air and semiconductor serves as an acoustic mirror to reflect phonons in the waveguide. We perform pump-probe experiments to generate coherent acoustic phonons at one position and detect them remotely on the waveguide. We analyze the signals originated by phonons generated in the pump position reaching the remote probe location, revealing a clear indication of phonon transport at room temperature. Our findings have potential applications in quantum technologies and data processing.

TI Enhancement of Optical Spin-Orbit Coupling in Anisotropic ENZ
   Metamaterials
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Vector vortex beams which possess complex intensity and polarisation patterns, and phase or polarisation singularities are important in a variety of applications ranging from high resolution imaging and data transmission to nonlinear optics and quantum technologies. Here, we theoretically analyse the effect of vector vortex beams propagation through strongly anisotropic metamaterials exhibiting epsilon-near-zero behaviour. The interaction of the metamaterial with longitudinal field of the vector beams results in a strong modification of the polarisation distribution, with the metamaterial acting as an azimuthal polariser. The dependence on the local ellipticity of the field is also investigated revealing conversion of spin angular momentum to orbital angular momentum and polarisation structure vorticity, mediated by the longitudinal field. The results show the promise of an anisotropic metamaterial platform for manipulation of polarisation properties of and spin-orbit coupling in vector vortex beams.

AB Strong coupling has emerged as a central topic in nanophotonics, offering a powerful platform for light-matter interaction studies and advancing quantum technologies. Low-dimensional materials, such as quantum dots (QDs) and two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, possess pronounced excitonic resonances, high stability, and size-dependent tunability, making them ideal candidates for achieving strong coupling with plasmonic structures. In this review, we systematically summarize recent progress in plasmon low-dimensional material strong coupling. We first introduce the fundamental principles and experimental methods of plasmon-exciton strong coupling, then highlight representative studies on plasmon-QDs and plasmon-2D material hybrid systems, and finally discuss recent advances in multimode strong coupling. This review will provide a comprehensive overview and offer valuable guidance for future studies in strong coupling.

TI Dark-state photonic entanglement filters
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Preserving entanglement in the presence of decoherence remains a major challenge for quantum technologies. Recent proposals have employed photonic filters based on anti-parity-time symmetry to recover certain entangled states, but these approaches require intricate, symmetry-constrained waveguide architectures and precise bath engineering. In this work, we show that such strict non-Hermitian symmetry constraints are not necessary for entanglement filtering. Instead, we identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states-arising naturally through destructive interference in simple photonic settings-as the essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond previously studied dimer configurations. We demonstrate this concept using minimal waveguide network designs, offering a broadly accessible route to robust entanglement filtering. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group.

TI Embedding memory-efficient stochastic simulators as quantum trajectories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB By exploiting the complexity intrinsic to quantum dynamics, quantum technologies promise a host of computational advantages. One such advantage lies in the field of stochastic modeling, where it has been shown that quantum stochastic simulators can operate with a lower memory overhead than their best classical counterparts. This advantage is particularly pronounced for continuous -time stochastic processes; however, the corresponding quantum stochastic simulators heretofore prescribed operate only on a quasi -continuous -time basis and suffer an ever-increasing circuit complexity with increasing temporal resolution. Here, by establishing a correspondence with quantum trajectories (a method for modeling open quantum systems), we show how truly continuous -time quantum stochastic simulators can be embedded in such open quantum systems, bridging this gap and obviating previous constraints. We further show how such an embedding can be made for discrete -time stochastic processes, which manifest as jump -only trajectories, and discuss how viewing the correspondence in the reverse direction provides a means of studying structural complexity in quantum systems themselves.

TI Directionality between driven-dissipative resonators
SO EPL
AB The notion of nonreciprocity, in essence when going forwards is different from going backwards, emerges in all branches of physics from cosmology to electromagnetism. Intriguingly, the breakdown of reciprocity is typically associated with extraordinary phenomena, which may be readily capitalized on in the design of (for example) nontrivial electromagnetic devices when Lorentz reciprocity is broken. However, in order to enable the exploitation of nonreciprocal-like effects in the next generation of quantum technologies, basic quantum optical theories are required. Here we present a versatile model describing a pair of driven-dissipative quantum resonators, where the relative phase difference between the coherent and incoherent couplings induces an asymmetry. The interplay between the diverse dissipative landscape -which encompasses both intrinsic losses and dissipative couplings- and the coherent interactions leads to some remarkable consequences including highly directional (or even one-way) energy transport. Our work proffers the tantalizing prospect of observing dissipation-induced quantum directionality in areas like photonics or cavity magnonics (spin waves), which may aid the design of unconventional nanoscopic devices.

TI InGaN-diode-pumped AlGaInP VECSEL with sub-kHz linewidth at 689 nm
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report the design, growth, and characterization of an AlGaInP-based VECSEL, designed to be optically-pumped with an inexpensive high power blue InGaN diode laser, for emission around 689 nm. Up to 140 mW output power is achieved in a circularly-symmetric single transverse (TEM00) and single longitudinal mode, tunable from 683 to 693 nm. With intensity stabilization of the pump diode and frequency-stabilization of the VECSEL resonator to a reference cavity via the Pound-Drever-Hall technique, we measure the power spectral density of the VECSEL frequency noise, reporting sub-kHz linewidth at 689 nm. The VECSEL relative intensity noise (RIN) is <-130 dBc/Hz tbr all frequencies above 100 kHz.

TI NISQ algorithm for the matrix elements of a generic observable
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The calculation of off-diagonal matrix elements has various applications in fields such as nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. In this paper, we present a noisy intermediate scale quantum algorithm for estimating the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of a generic observable in the energy eigenbasis of a given Hamiltonian without explicitly preparing its eigenstates. By means of numerical simulations we show that this approach finds many of the matrix elements for the one and two qubits cases. Specifically, while in the first case, one can initialize the ansatz parameters over a broad interval, in the latter the optimization landscape can significantly slow down the speed of convergence and one should therefore be careful to restrict the initialization to a smaller range of parameters.

TI Near-field imaging of plasmonic nanopatch antennas with integrated
   semiconductor quantum dots
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Plasmonic nanopatch antennas that incorporate dielectric gaps hundreds of picometers to several nanometers thick have drawn increasing attention over the past decade because they confine electromagnetic fields to grossly sub-diffraction-limited volumes. Substantial control over the optical properties of excitons and color centers confined within these plasmonic cavities has already been demonstrated with far-field optical spectroscopies, but near-field optical spectroscopies are essential for an improved understanding of the plasmon-emitter interaction at the nanoscale. Here, we characterize the intensity and phase-resolved plasmonic response of isolated nanopatch antennas by cathodoluminescence microscopy. Furthermore, we explore the distinction between optical and electron beam spectroscopies of coupled plasmon-exciton heterostructures to identify constraints and opportunities for future nanoscale characterization and control of hybrid nanophotonic structures. While we observe substantial Purcell enhancement in time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies, negligible Purcell enhancement is observed in cathodoluminescence spectroscopies of hybrid nanophotonic structures. The substantial differences in measured Purcell enhancement for electron beam and laser excitation can be understood as a result of the different selection rules for these complementary experiments. These results provide a fundamentally new understanding of near-field plasmon-exciton interactions in nanopatch antennas, which is essential for myriad emerging quantum photonic devices. 2021 Author(s).

TI PROCLAMATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
   2025, AN EXAMPLE OF SCIENCE DIPLOMACY
SO FORO INTERNACIONAL
AB On June 7, 2024, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the year 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ2025), as a result of long scientific and diplomatic negotiations that began in October 2021, at the initiative of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. This article gives an account of the origins, preparations and significance of the IYQ2025 declaration and offers a reflection on the diplomatic negotiations undertaken. The celebration of the centenary of the first breakthroughs in modern quantum mechanics provides a valuable opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of quantum science and technology in our lives and its transformative impact on society. Hence the need for each country to develop its own capabilities in this field, both scientific, technological and productive, in order to contribute to scientific progress and, at the same time, to take advantage of its benefits for society and national development.

TI Plug-and-Play Fiber-Coupled Quantum Dot Single-Photon Source via
   Photonic Wire Bonding
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The collection of single-photon emission from a quantum dot (QD) in a Bragg waveguide through a photonic wire bond (PWB) via free-space resonant frequency pumping at 1.6 K is demonstrated. The in-fiber single photons show a small multiphoton contribution, quantified by a low second order photon autocorrelation value of g(corr)((2))(0)=(5.9 +/- 0.8)x10(-3) (background-corrected) or graw((0))((2)) = (9.5 +/- 1.4)x10(-2) (raw data). The decay time of the QD is measured to be tau=440 ps. The PWB obviates the need for in-cryostat alignment of the single-photon source with an optical fiber and thus offers a route to scalable integration of quantum photonic devices in a cryogenic environment. Uniquely, the approach combines the QD-waveguide technique, enabling resonant driving of individual QDs without the need for cross-polarization filtering, and the PWB for deterministic, alignment-free coupling of single-photon sources to optical fibers.
   The combination of a single-photon source in a ridge waveguide with a photonic wire bond (PWB) connected to the end-facet is demonstrated. After cooling the sample to 1.6 K, decay time and second-order autocorrelation under pulsed, resonant optical excitation are analyzed. The findings herein highlight the possibility of using PWBs at low temperatures as an interface for single-photon collection.image

TI Position-controlled quantum emitters with reproducible emission
   wavelength in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Single photon emitters (SPEs) in low-dimensional layered materials have recently gained a large interest owing to the auspicious perspectives of integration and extreme miniaturization offered by this class of materials. However, accurate control of both the spatial location and the emission wavelength of the quantum emitters is essentially lacking to date, thus hindering further technological steps towards scalable quantum photonic devices. Here, we evidence SPEs in high purity synthetic hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that can be activated by an electron beam at chosen locations. SPE ensembles are generated with a spatial accuracy better than the cubed emission wavelength, thus opening the way to integration in optical microstructures. Stable and bright single photon emission is subsequently observed in the visible range up to room temperature upon non-resonant laser excitation. Moreover, the low-temperature emission wavelength is reproducible, with an ensemble distribution of width 3meV, a statistical dispersion that is more than one order of magnitude lower than the narrowest wavelength spreads obtained in epitaxial hBN samples. Our findings constitute an essential step towards the realization of top-down integrated devices based on identical quantum emitters in 2D materials. Accurate control of the spatial location and the emission wavelength of single photon emitters (SPEs) in van der Waals materials is a crucial yet challenging endeavour. Here, the authors use an electron beam to generate SPE ensembles in high purity synthetic hBN with enhanced spatial accuracy and emission reproducibility.

TI Toward exact predictions of spin-phonon relaxation times: An ab initio
   implementation of open quantum systems theory
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Spin-phonon coupling is the main driver of spin relaxation and decoherence in solid-state semiconductors at finite temperature. Controlling this interaction is a central problem for many disciplines, ranging from magnetic resonance to quantum technologies. Spin relaxation theories have been developed for almost a century but often use a phenomenological description of phonons and their coupling to spin, resulting in a nonpredictive tool and hindering our detailed understanding of spin dynamics. Here, we combine time-local master equations up to the fourth order with advanced electronic structure methods and perform predictions of spin-phonon relaxation time for a series of solid-state coordination compounds based on both transition metals and lanthanide Kramers ions. The agreement between experiments and simulations demonstrates that an accurate, universal, and fully ab initio implementation of spin relaxation theory is possible, thus paving the way to a systematic study of spin-phonon relaxation in solid-state materials.

TI Observation of the Influence of Generalized Parity on the Alignment
   Spectra in the Periodically Modulated Warm Atomic Ensemble
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Periodically modulated systems with parity symmetry have been extensively investigated in recent years and exhibited various novel phenomena and potential applications in quantum technologies. In this study, a pump-probe structure is used to observe the influence of generalized parity on the alignment spectra of magnetic resonance in a periodically biharmonic modulated warm atomic cesium ensemble. The alignment spectra are symmetric when the generalized parity of modulated Floquet atomic ensemble is present. The breaking of spectral symmetry is accompanied by the absence of generalized parity. The influence of generalized parity on atomic alignment polarization distribution is analyzed based on the perspective of the angular-momentum probability surface. A necessary and sufficient condition for generalized parity to maintain spectral symmetry is verified experimentally and theoretically, providing a new perspective to investigative complex periodic modulation system. The results are universally applicable to atomic and solid-state systems.

TI Noise-resilient and resource-efficient hybrid algorithm for robust
   quantum gap estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a hybrid quantum algorithm for estimating gaps in many-body energy spectra, supported by an analytic proof of its inherent resilience to state preparation and measurement errors, as well as midcircuit multiqubit depolarizing noise. Our analysis extends to a broader class of Markovian noise, employing error mitigation strategies that optimize the utilization of quantum resources. By integrating trial-state optimization and classical signal processing into the algorithm, we amplify the signal peak corresponding to the exact target gap beyond the error threshold, thereby significantly reducing gap estimate errors. The algorithm's robustness is demonstrated through noisy simulations on the Qiskit Aer simulator and demonstrations on IBM Quantum processors. These results underscore the potential to enable accurate quantum simulations on near-term noisy quantum devices without resource-intensive error correction.

TI Nitrogen-vacancy centre formation via local femto-second laser annealing
   of diamond
SO CARBON
AB Emerging quantum technologies based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond require carefully engineered material with controlled defect density, optimised NV formation processes, and minimal crystal strain. The choice of NV generation technique plays a crucial role in determining the quality and performance of these centres. In this work, we investigate NV centre formation in nitrogen-doped diamond using femtosecond (fs) laser processing. We systematically examine the effect of laser pulse energy on NV production and quality using photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. We also probe the role of pre-existing lattice defects formed by electron irradiation and consider defect evolution over extended dwell times. Finally, we are able to identify a regime where the main action of the fs-laser is to diffuse rather than create vacancies. This local annealing capability expands the toolkit for tailored NV production and presents opportunities for fine tuning defect populations.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report for the first time a high performance, single frequency AlGaInP-based VECSEL (vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser) with emission at 698 nm, targeting the clock transition of neutral strontium atoms. Furthermore, we present comprehensive noise characterization of this class-A semiconductor laser, including the residual fast phase noise in addition to the frequency and relative intensity noise. The low noise VECSEL has output power at around 135 mW with an estimated linewidth of 115 Hz when frequency stabilized via the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique to a high finesse reference cavity, without intermediate stabilization. The phase noise is measured to be below -126 dBc/Hz for frequencies between 10 kHz and 15 MHz with a total integrated phase noise of 3.2 mrad, suitable not only for ultra-cold neutral strontium-based quantum technologies, such as optical clocks, but also with potential for atom-interferometry applications.

TI Swing-Up of Quantum Emitter Population Using Detuned Pulses
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The controlled preparation of the excited state in a quantum emitter is a prerequisite for its usage as a single-photon source-a key building block for quantum technologies. In this paper, we propose a coherent excitation scheme using off-resonant pulses. In the usual Rabi scheme, these pulses would not lead to a significant occupation. This is overcome by using a frequency-modulated pulse to swing up the excited-state population. The same effect can be obtained using two pulses with different strong detunings of the same sign. We theoretically analyze the applicability of the scheme to a semiconductor quantum dot. In this case, the excitation is several millielectronvolts below the band gap, i.e., far away from the detection frequency, allowing for easy spectral filtering, and does not rely on any auxiliary particles such as phonons. Our scheme has the potential to lead to the generation of close-to-ideal photons.

TI Memory compression and thermal efficiency of quantum implementations of
   nondeterministic hidden Markov models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Stochastic modeling is an essential component of the quantitative sciences, with hidden Markov models (HMMs) often playing a central role. Concurrently, the rise of quantum technologies promises a host of advantages in computational problems, typically in terms of the scaling of requisite resources such as time and memory. HMMs are no exception to this, with recent results highlighting quantum implementations of deterministic HMMs exhibiting superior memory and thermal efficiency relative to their classical counterparts. In many contexts, however, nondeterministic HMMs are viable alternatives; compared to them, the advantages of current quantum implementations do not always hold. Here, we provide a systematic prescription for constructing quantum implementations of nondeterministic HMMs that reestablish the quantum advantages against this broader class. Crucially, we show that whenever the classical implementation suffers from thermal dissipation due to its need to process information in a time-local manner, our quantum implementations will both mitigate some of this dissipation and achieve an advantage in memory compression.

TI Thermalization of finite complexity and its application to heat-bath
   algorithmic cooling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a class of thermal operations based on the collision model, where the system sequentially interacts with uncorrelated bath molecules via energy-preserving unitaries. To ensure finite complexity, each molecule is constrained to be no larger than the system. We identify a necessary condition for cooling below the bath temperature via a single collision: The system must initially lack a well-defined effective temperature, even a negative one. By constructing an iterative protocol, we demonstrate that sub-bath cooling is achievable without a machine under these restricted thermal operations. Moreover, introducing a qubit machine further enhances both the cooling limit and energy efficiency. These findings contribute to the broader study of cooling with finite resources.

TI Simultaneous estimation of multiple eigenvalues with short-depth quantum
   circuit on early fault-tolerant quantum computers
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce a multi-modal, multi-level quantum complex exponential least squares (MM-QCELS) method to simultaneously estimate multiple eigenvalues of a quantum Hamiltonian on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm exhibits Heisenberg-limited scaling in terms of circuit depth and total cost. Notably, the proposed quantum circuit utilizes just one ancilla qubit, and with appropriate initial state conditions, it achieves significantly shorter circuit depths compared to circuits based on quantum phase estimation (QPE). Numerical results suggest that compared to QPE, the circuit depth can be reduced by around two orders of magnitude under several settings for estimating ground-state and excited-state energies of certain quantum systems.

TI Conditional Action and Imperfect Erasure of Qubits
SO ENTROPY
AB We consider state changes in quantum theory due to "conditional action" and relate these to the discussion of entropy decrease due to interventions of "intelligent beings" and the principles of Szilard and Landauer/Bennett. The mathematical theory of conditional actions is a special case of the theory of "instruments", which describes changes of state due to general measurements and will therefore be briefly outlined in the present paper. As a detailed example, we consider the imperfect erasure of a qubit that can also be viewed as a conditional action and will be realized by the coupling of a spin to another small spin system in its ground state.

TI Broadband Measurement and Tuning of the Volatile Thermo-Optic Properties
   in Chalcogenide Phase Change Materials
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Chalcogenide phase change materials (PCM's) are shown to exhibit a much-overlooked giant switchable volatile thermo-optic response across the visible/telecommunication bands. The first broadband measurement of this is presented in the alloys: Ge2Sb2Te5, Sb2Te3, Sb2S3, and Sb2Se3, demonstrating that their response can exceed that of many commonly used volatile reconfigurable material platforms. Additionally, it is observed that the thermo-optic response in some PCM alloys can be uniquely switched from positive to negative sign. To engineer this response based on application requirements, phase change metacoatings are introduced, relying on subwavelength interlayer nanostructuring of the PCM layer interleaved with transparent dielectric barriers. It is demonstrated that their thermo-optic properties can be suppressed across broad frequency ranges and tuned by varying the periodicity within the metacoating, without altering the composition or stoichiometry of the PCM layer. This shows that neglecting thermo-optical effects in photonic platforms with PCM inclusions during device design may lead to instabilities and noise due to intrinsic thermo-optic drifts. It also highlights the potential for exploring new PCMs/PCM heterostructures to serve as the sole modulation layer in PIC architectures, meeting both volatile and nonvolatile signal modulation needs, promising significant reductions in device footprints/power consumption in classical and emerging quantum photonic architectures.

SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB An analytical theory to calculate the dissipatively stable concurrence in the system of two coupled superconducting qubits in the strong driving field is developed. The conditions for the entanglement state generation and destruction during the formation of the multiphoton transitions regions due to the interference of Landau-Zener-St & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana are found. Based on the solution of the Floquet-Markov equation, the technique is proposed to adjust the amplitudes of dc-and ac-fields for effective control of the entanglement between qubit states while taking into account the effects of the decoherence.

TI Programmable Quantum Annealers as Noisy Gibbs Samplers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the sampling properties of physical realizations of quantum annealers which are implemented through programmable lattices of superconducting flux qubits. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the data produced by these quantum machines shows that quantum annealers behave as samplers that generate independent configurations from low-temperature noisy Gibbs distributions. We show that the structure of the output distribution probes the intrinsic physical properties of the quantum device such as effective temperature of individual qubits and magnitude of local qubit noise, which result in a nonlinear response function and spurious interactions that are absent in the hardware implementation. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in the characterization of future generations of quantum annealers and other emerging analog computing devices.

TI On the importance of antimony for temporal evolution of emission from
   self-assembled (InGa) (AsSb)/GaAs quantum dots on GaP(001)
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Understanding the carrier dynamics of nanostructures is the key for development and optimization of novel semiconductor nano-devices. Here, we study the optical properties and carrier dynamics of (InGa)(AsSb)/GaAs/GaP quantum dots (QDs) by means of non-resonant energy and time-resolved photoluminescence depending on temperature. Studying this material system is fundamental in view of the ongoing implementation of such QDs for nano memory devices. The structures studied in this work include a single QD layer, QDs overgrown by a GaSb capping layer, and solely a GaAs quantum well, respectively. Theoretical analytical models allow to discern the common spectral features around the emission energy of 1.8 eV related to the GaAs quantum well and the GaP substrate. We observe type-I emission from QDs with recombination times between 2 ns and 10 ns, increasing towards lower energies. Moreover, based on the considerable tunability of the QDs depending on Sb incorporation, we suggest their utilization as quantum photonic sources embedded in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor platforms, due to the feasibility of a nearly defect-free growth of GaP on Si. Finally, our analysis confirms the nature of the pumping power blue-shift of emission originating from the charged-background induced changes of the wavefunction spatial distribution.

TI Ultimate precision limit of noise sensing and dark matter search
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The nature of dark matter is unknown and calls for a systematical search. For axion dark matter, such a search relies on finding feeble random noise arising from the weak coupling between dark matter and microwave haloscopes. We model such process as a quantum channel and derive the fundamental precision limit of noise sensing. An entanglement-assisted strategy based on two-mode squeezed vacuum is thereby demonstrated optimal, while the optimality of a single-mode squeezed vacuum is found limited to the lossless case. We propose a "nulling" measurement (squeezing and photon counting) to achieve the optimal performances. In terms of the scan rate, even with 20-decibel of strength, single-mode squeezing still underperforms the vacuum limit which is achieved by photon counting on vacuum input; while the two-mode squeezed vacuum provides large and close-to-optimum advantage over the vacuum limit, thus more exotic quantum resources are no longer required. Our results highlight the necessity of entanglement assistance and microwave photon counting in dark matter search.

TI Lower bound of of formation based on correlation matrix
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The entanglement of formation (EOF), which quantifies the required minimally physical resources to prepare a quantum state, plays important roles in many quantum information processes. Due to the convex-roof definition, it is hard to find the explicit analytic formulae of EOF, except for some special quantum systems. The correlation matrix of a quantum state is closely related to entanglement property. In this paper, we use the Lagrange-multiplier approach to obtain an analytic lower bound of EOF for arbitrary dimensional bipartite states, which improves the previous conclusions. Numerical example shows that the bound is also valid for some PPT entangled states.

Using our classical-quantum universal superposition code, we establish the capacity region of a classical-quantum compound broadcast channel with degraded message sets. Our universal classical-quantum multiple access channel codes have two types of codes. One is a code with joint decoding and the other is a code with separate decoding. It is not so easy to construct a former code that universally achieves general points of the capacity region beyond corner points. First, we construct the latter code that universally achieves general points of the capacity region. Then, converting the latter code to the former coder, we construct the above desired code with the former type.

TI Postquantum common-cause channels: the resource theory of local
   operations and shared entanglement
SO QUANTUM
AB We define the type-independent resource theory of local operations and shared entanglement (LOSE). This allows us to formally quantify postquantumness in common-cause scenarios such as the Bell scenario. Any nonsignaling bipartite quantum channel which cannot be generated by LOSE operations requires a postquantum common cause to generate, and constitutes a valuable resource. Our framework allows LOSE operations that arbitrarily transform between different types of resources, which in turn allows us to undertake a systematic study of the different manifestations of postquantum common causes. Only three of these have been previously recognized, namely postquantum correlations, postquantum steering, and 'non-localizable' channels, all of which are subsumed as special cases of resources in our framework. Finally, we prove several fundamental results regarding how the type of a resource determines what conversions into other resources are possible, and also places constraints on the resource's ability to provide an advantage in distributed tasks such as nonlocal games, semiquantum games, steering games, etc.

TI Confidence polytopes for quantum process tomography
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In the present work, we propose a generalization of the confidence polytopes approach for quantum state tomography (QST) to the case of quantum process tomography (QPT). Our approach allows obtaining a confidence region in the polytope form for a Choi matrix of an unknown quantum channel based on the measurement results of the corresponding QPT experiment. The method uses the improved version of the expression for confidence levels for the case of several positive operator-valued measures. We then demonstrate how confidence polytopes can be employed for calculating confidence intervals for affine functions of quantum states (Choi matrices), such as fidelities and observables mean values, which are used both in QST and QPT settings. As we propose, this problem can be efficiently solved using linear programming tools. We also study the performance and scalability of the developed approach on the basis of simulation and experimental data collected using IBM cloud quantum processor.

These features make WGMRs an efficient platform for quantum information processing. Here, we experimentally show that it is possible to generate polarization entanglement from WGMRs by using an interferometric scheme. Our scheme gives us the flexibility to control the phase of the generated entangled state by changing the relative phase of the interferometer. The S value of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt's inequality in the system is 2.45 +/- 0.07, which violates the inequality by more than six standard deviations.

AB Although heralding signals in quantum optics experiments are typically based on the detection of exactly one photon, it has recently been theoretically shown that heralding based on the detection of zero photons can be useful in a number of quantum information applications. Here we experimentally investigate a technique for "heralding on zero photons" using conventional single-photon detectors. We illustrate how detector efficiency and dark count rates play a counterintuitive role in the ability to accurately detect zero photons, and we use a variant of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer to study the deleterious effects of limited detector efficiency when heralding on zero.

TI Lieb-Robinson Light Cone for Power-Law Interactions

AB The Lieb-Robinson theorem states that information propagates with a finite velocity in quantum systems on a lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions. What are the speed limits on information propagation in quantum systems with power-law interactions, which decay as 1/r(a) at distance r? Here, we present a definitive answer to this question for all exponents a > 2d and all spatial dimensions d. Schematically, information takes time at least r(min{1,a-2d}) to propagate a distance r. As recent state transfer protocols saturate this bound, our work closes a decades-long hunt for optimal Lieb-Robinson bounds on quantum information dynamics with power-law interactions.

TI Non-Abelian statistics with mixed-boundary punctures on the toric code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The toric code is a simple and exactly solvable example of topological order realizing Abelian anyons. However, it was shown to support nonlocal lattice defects, namely twists, which exhibit non-Abelian anyonic behavior [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 030403 (2010)]. Motivated by this result, we investigated the potential of having non-Abelian statistics from puncture defects on the toric code. We demonstrate that an encoding with mixed-boundary punctures reproduces Ising fusion, and a logical Pauli-X upon their braiding. Our construction paves the way for local lattice defects to exhibit non-Abelian properties that can be employed for quantum information tasks.

By manipulating the spin -orbit coupling and polarization states, one can control the density, phase, and polarization distributions of exciton-polaritons.

TI Investigation of spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride generated via
   ion implantation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Spin-active defects in layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals have attracted increased attention in quantum sensing. Notably, the recently discovered negatively charged boron vacancy (V-B) center stands out due to its optical addressability and coherent controllability. Among the various methods reported for generating such defects, ion implantation is notable as a readily accessible technique. In this paper, the properties of V-B defects in hBN generated via ion implantation are extensively studied. We achieve a ubiquitous distribution of highly stable defects across the crystal sample, and find that the ion beam current density, rather than fluence, plays a critical role in determining the uniformity and density of defects. The generated defects display bright and stable photoluminescence, and we explicitly investigate the dependence of spin properties on factors such as laser, microwave power, and duration. An intriguing phenomenon is observed wherein the peak contrast exceeds 20% without any enhancing techniques in the optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum for some special defects. Our results provide valuable insights and suggestions for the controlled generation of V-B defects in hBN through ion implantation.

TI Magnetoelectric microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems
   for the IoT
SO NATURE REVIEWS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB The internet of things (IoT) has revolutionized society by creating a network of interconnected devices with sensors, processing ability and software for data exchange. However, the expansion of IoT places undue strain on energy resources. Thus, the development of low-power components is critical. Moreover, the demand for IoT has opened new markets for wearable technologies, necessitating innovations towards miniaturization. This rapid growth introduces further challenges in communication and environmental adaptability. Magnetoelectric (ME) microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems (M/NEMS) introduce unparalleled properties to reshape the IoT landscape. ME M/NEMS enable a 100,000x reduction in wavelength, resulting in reduced size and weight, and provide multifunctionality, such as simultaneous sensing, data transmission and wireless power transfer. With renewed interest in ME M/NEMS platforms, several disruptive technologies have emerged ranging from ultra-compact radiofrequency front-ends to quantum sensing, computing and communication networks. This Review delves into ME materials, ME composites and ME M/NEMS for IoT functions, including logic memory; magnetic sensing; wireless power transfer; ultra-compact antennas; power, radiofrequency and microwave electronics; and communication systems.

TI Room Temperature Relaxometry of Single Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in
   Proximity to α-RuCl3 Nanoflakes
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) center-based magnetometry has been proven to be a versatile sensor for various classes of magnetic materials in broad temperature and frequency ranges. Here, we use the longitudinal relaxation time T-1 of single NV centers to investigate the spin dynamics of nanometer-thin flakes of alpha-RuCl3 at room temperature. We observe a significant reduction in the T-1 in the presence of alpha-RuCl3 in the proximity of NVs, which we attribute to paramagnetic spin noise confined in the 2D hexagonal planes. Furthermore, the T-1 time exhibits a monotonic increase with an applied magnetic field. We associate this trend with the alteration of the spin and charge noise in alpha-RuCl3 under an external magnetic field. These findings suggest that the influence of the spin dynamics of alpha-RuCl3 on the T-1 of the NV center can be used to gain information about the material itself and the technique to be used on other 2D materials.

TI Observing Floquet topological order by symmetry resolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Symmetry-protected topological order in one dimension leads to protected degeneracies between symmetry blocks of the reduced density matrix. In the presence of periodic driving, topological Floquet phases can be identified in terms of a cycling of these symmetry blocks between different charge quantum numbers. We discuss an example of this phenomenon with an Ising Z2 symmetry, using both analytic methods and real quantum computers. By adiabatically moving along the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the cycling periodicity is broken in Floquet topological phase transitions. An equivalent signature of the topological Floquet phase is identified as a computational power allowing for the teleportation of quantum information.

AB Conditional distributions, as defined by the Markov category framework, are studied in the setting of matrix algebras (quantum systems). Their construction as linear unital maps are obtained via a categorical Bayesian inversion procedure. Simple criteria establishing when such linear maps are positive are obtained. Several examples are provided, including the standard EPR scenario, where the EPR correlations are reproduced in a purely compositional (categorical) manner. A comparison between the Bayes map, the Petz recovery map, and the Leifer-Spekkens acausal belief propagation is provided, illustrating some similarities and key differences.

TI Experimental evidence of Förster energy transfer enhancement in the near
   field through engineered metamaterial surface waves
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Plasmonics has been demonstrated to provide fine tuning of the emission properties of single quantum sources (brightness, polarization, directivity, spectrum, lifetime horizontal ellipsis ). However, significantly less is known about the role of surface plasmons in mediating subwavelength Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) when a second emitter is introduced. Here, we report microwave experiments showing that excitation of surface waves on a dedicated metasurface can strongly mediate FRET in the near-field regime. This work paves the way for metasurfaces engineered to control dipole-dipole energy transfer with applications in lighting sources, photovoltaics, quantum information processing and biophysics.

TI Photon-emitter dressed states in a closed waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study a system made up of one or two two-level quantum emitters, coupled to a single transverse mode of a closed waveguide, in which photon wavenumbers and frequencies are discretized, and characterize the states in which one excitation is steadily shared between the field and the emitters. We unearth finite-size effects in the field-emitter interactions and identify a family of dressed bound states that represent the forerunners of bound states in the continuum in the limit of an infinite waveguide. We finally consider the potential interest of such states for applications in the field of quantum information.

TI Choice of mutually unbiased bases and outcome labeling affecting
   measurement outcome secrecy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a crucial ingredient for many protocols in quantum information processing. Measurements performed in these bases are unbiased to the maximally possible extent, which is used to prove the randomness or secrecy of measurement results. In this work we show that certain properties of sets of MUBs crucially depend on their specific choice, including, somewhat surprisingly, measurement outcome labeling. If measurements are chosen in a coherent way, the secrecy of the result can be completely lost for specific sets of MUB measurements but partially retained for others. This could potentially impact a broad spectrum of applications where MUBs are utilized.

SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A
AB We evaluate the material characteristics of superconducting platinum silicide (PtSi) thin films as candidate materials for superconducting quantum information devices compatible with silicon technology. These films were synthesized using magnetron sputtering under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, followed by rapid thermal annealing. Polycrystalline PtSi films synthesized by this method have the favorable properties of superconducting critical temperature of 0.95 K and relatively long zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 76 nm. We further studied coplanar microbridge devices fabricated by electron beam lithography and chlorine-free reactive ion etching, finding that the temperature-dependent critical current density follows the Ginzburg Landau depairing mechanism.

This method is based on a general mathematical object which we call a flow. As an application of our method, we derive bulk invariants for Floquet systems without symmetry, as well as for systems with U(1) symmetry. We also derive new formulations of previously known singleparticle and many-body invariants. For bosonic systems without symmetry, our invariant gives a bulk counterpart of the rational-valued Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index p/q quantifying transport of quantum information along the edge.

AB We study experimentally and theoretically the in-plane magnetic field dependence of the coupling between dots forming a vertically stacked double dot molecule. The InAsP molecule is grown epitaxially in an InP nanowire and interrogated optically at millikelvin temperatures. The strength of interdot tunneling, leading to the formation of the bonding-antibonding pair of molecular orbitals, is investigated by adjusting the sample geometry. For specific geometries, we show that the interdot coupling can be controlled in-situ using a magnetic field-mediated redistribution of interdot coupling strengths. This is an important milestone in the development of qubits required in future quantum information technologies.

TI Grand unification of all discrete Wigner functions on d x d phase space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Wigner functions help visualize quantum states and dynamics while supporting quantitative analysis in quantum information. In the discrete setting, many inequivalent constructions coexist for each Hilbert-space dimension. This fragmentation obscures which features are fundamental and which are artifacts of representation. We introduce a stencil-based framework that exhausts all possible d x d discrete Wigner functions for a single d-dimensional quantum system (including a novel one for even d), subsuming known forms. We also give explicit invertible linear maps between definitions within the same d, enabling direct comparison of operational properties and exposing representation dependence.

TI Self-Similar Phase Diagram of the Fibonacci-Driven Quantum Ising Model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study a stroboscopic quantum Ising model with Fibonacci dynamics. We use its boundary spin correlation functions in long but finite chains to identify regions in the phase diagram which exhibit Majorana zero modes (MZM) as well as Majorana golden-ratio modes (MGM). We find that these regions evolve in a self-similar manner with increasing simulation time and identify the self-similarity transform which governs this evolution of the phase diagram. Integrability-breaking perturbations lead to a temporal decay of the boundary spin correlations, ultimately limiting the self-similarity of the phase diagram. Our predictions are testable with current quantum information processors.

We show that, up to small-probability tails, the supports of quantum states evolving under such dynamics propagate with finite speed in any finite-energy subspace. More precisely, we prove that if the initial quantum state is localized in space, then any finite-energy part of the solution of the von Neumann-Lindblad equation is approximately localized inside an energy-dependent light cone. We also obtain an explicit upper bound for the slope of this light cone.

   disorder
SO CHAOS
AB The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) serves as a powerful tool for investigating quantum information spreading and chaos in complex systems. We present a method employing non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory and coherent potential approximation combined with diagrammatic perturbation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour to calculate the OTOC for correlated fermionic systems subjected to both random disorder and electron interaction. Our key finding is that random disorder enhances the OTOC decay in the Hubbard model for the metallic phase in the weakly interacting limit. However, the current limitation of our perturbative solver restricts the applicability to weak interaction regimes.

TI Bayesian evaluation of multi-grade damage efficiency of ammunition using
   multi-stage binomial distribution
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS
AB In modern information warfare, the assessment of ammunition lethality has evolved from singledimensional evaluations of hit accuracy to multidimensional, multiphase analyses of damage effectiveness. However, exorbitant-tech munition testing is hindered by exorbitant costs, limited sample sizes, and significant uncertainty, rendering traditional binomial or multinomial probability models inadequate. These conventional models either oversimplify damage states (compromising accuracy) or introduce prohibitive computational complexity (impeding practical application). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Bayesian multi-stage binomial modeling approach for multi-level damage assessment under small-sample conditions. The multinomial representation of discrete damage categories is decomposed into a series of conditional binomial distributions aligned with progressive thresholds ("mild or above","moderate or above", "severe or above", and "complete destruction"), thereby enables low-dimensional modeling without sacrificing damage granularity, significantly enhancing computational tractability. To construct robust prior distributions, physical simulation results and expert domain knowledge are fused using Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. The reliability of this fused information is further validated via a consistency test that integrates the Riemannian manifold of Fisher information and quantum entanglement entropy-mitigating subjectivity biases inherent in expert judgments Leveraging conjugate prior properties and Gibbs sampling within the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, the posterior distribution of each damage level is obtained with exorbitant precision despite limited data availability. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior convergence stability, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency over conventional binomial and multinomial approaches, provides a more comprehensive and precise tool for evaluating ammunition damage effectiveness, with direct implications for operational decision-making in information warfare.

TI Characterizing Gaussian quantum processes with Gaussian resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Characterizing quantum processes is indispensable for the implementation of any task in quantum information processing. In this paper, we develop an efficient method to fully characterize arbitrary Gaussian processes in continuous-variable quantum systems. This is done by directly obtaining all elements of the symplectic matrix that describes the process. Only Gaussian resources such as coherent probes and quadrature measurements are needed for this task. The method is efficient, involving only O(N2) steps to characterize an N-mode system. Further, the method is resilient to uniform loss. We simulate this procedure using the Python package Strawberry Fields. We observe that heterodyne measurements outperform homodyne measurements for reconstructing Gaussian processes.

AB Recent measurements of the properties of the top quark at the CERN Large Hadron Collider are discussed. The results were measured for single and top quark pair production in their final states, including jets with either one or two leptons or only in hadronic final states. Top quark properties include angular correlations, top quark spin correlations, mass, and width. When looking towards the future, top quark properties open new and even interdisciplinary avenues for probing quantum information science.

We then usethe Jordan product naturally available in this context in order to define a Riemannianmetric tensor on parametric models satsfying suitable regularity conditions. This Rie-mannian metric tensor reduces to the Fisher-Rao metric tensor, or to the Fubini-Studymetric tensor, or to the Bures-Helstrom metric tensor when suitable choices for theW-algebra and the models are made.

AB Quantum Gaussian states play a fundamental role in quantum communications and in quantum information. This paper deals with the implementation of multimode, and particularly of two-mode Gaussian unitaries and Gaussian states with primitive components (phase shifters, single-mode real squeezers, displacements, and beam splitters). The architecture thus obtained allows one to obtain an insight into the physical meaning of each variable involved. Moreover, following the implementation architecture, it is possible to formulate an easy algebra (radical free) for the main operations and transformations of Gaussian states.

TI Asymmetry-induced nonclassical correlation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In quantum resource theory (QRT), asymmetry recognized as a valid resource for the advantage of various quantum information processing. In this paper, we establish resource theory of asymmetry using quantum Fisher information (QFI). By defining the average Fisher information as a measure of asymmetry, it is shown that the discrepancy of bipartite global and local asymmetries naturally induces the nonclassical correlation between the subsystems. This measure satisfies all the necessary axioms of a faithful measure of bipartite quantum correlation. As an illustration, we have studied the proposed measure for an arbitrary pure state, a class of separable states and Bell diagonal state.

We present an efficient way of tomographic witnessing for both theoretical and experimental detection of coherence. We prove that a coherence witness is optimal if and only if all of its diagonal elements are zero. Naturally, we obtain a bona fide homographic measure of coherence given by the sum of the absolute values of the real and the imaginary parts of the non-diagonal entries of a density matrix, together with its interesting relations with other coherence measures like l(1) norm coherence and robust of coherence.

TI Generation of two mode mechanical squeezing induced by nondegenerate
   parametric amplification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Squeezing light in an optomechanical system involves reducing quantum noise in one of the light's quadratures through the interaction between optical and mechanical modes. However, achieving successful implementation requires careful control of experimental parameters, which can be challenging. Here, we investigate a two-mode squeezed light transfer from optical to mechanical modes induced by a non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The optomechanical system is driven by frequencies nearly resonant with the anti-stokes fields that can realize cooling mechanical oscillators and quantum state transfer within a resolved sideband (good cavity) limit. Our results show that when a non-degenerate OPA is placed inside the optical cavity, the degree of squeezing in both optical and mechanical modes is significantly enhanced. This leads to the two-mode squeezed light being transferred into two-mode mechanical squeezing in the presence of the non-degenerate OPA under weak optomechanical coupling strength. Interestingly, we found that with negligible thermal bath noise, the two-mode squeezed light completely transferred to yield 50% mirror-mirror squeezing. In contrast, at higher thermal noise, the transfer of squeezed light is weak, causing the system to lose its quantum properties and behave more classically. Furthermore, we have shown that the degree of squeezing in the weak coupling regime drastically decreases with increasing mechanical dissipation rates. We believe that our scheme can achieve strong mechanical squeezing in hybrid optomechanical systems and facilitate homodyne detection to measure the quadratures of the squeezed light.

TI Coherent Population Trapping Combined with Cycling Transitions for
   Quantum Dot Hole Spins Using Triplet Trion States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Optical spin rotations and cycling transitions for measurement are normally incompatible in quantum dots, presenting a fundamental problem for quantum information applications. Here we show that for a hole spin this problem can be addressed using a trion with one hole in an excited orbital, where strong spin-orbit interaction tilts the spin. Then, a particular trion triplet forms a double Lambda system, even in a Faraday magnetic field, which we use to demonstrate fast hole spin initialization and coherent population trapping. The lowest trion transitions still strongly preserve spin, thus combining fast optical spin control with cycling transitions for spin readout.

TI Enhanced magneto-optical sensitivity in CsPbBr3 perovskites via Cr3+ions
   doping
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The magneto-optical effect provides a means of optical manipulation for materials and plays a significant role in optical signal modulation. However, the regulation of magnetooptical anisotropy remains challenging. This study reports the impact of Cr3+ doping on the optical anisotropy of CsPbBr3 perovskite under a magnetic field. Experimental observations revealed that Cr3+ doping successfully induced dual emission peaks corresponding to the antiferromagnetic polaron (AMP) and the exciton magnetic polaron (EMP), resulting in a blue shift in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. Polarization-resolved PL measurements demonstrated that Cr3+ doping significantly enhanced the magnetic field sensitivity of CsPbBr3. The optical anisotropy progressively transitioned towards isotropy with increasing magnetic field strength, with the AMP exhibiting stronger magnetic field sensitivity than the EMP. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Cr3+ doping substantially modified the electronic band structure of the material. These findings provide a viable strategy for tuning the magneto-optical anisotropy of lead halide perovskites, demonstrating significant potential in applications such as magneto-optical modulators and quantum sensing devices.

TI Detection of magnetic field polarity with magnetic field modulation ODMR
   on NV- centers in diamond
SO APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY
AB Diamond with negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) colour centers is a promising material system for quantum sensing applications and in particular for magnetometry. The sensing protocol leverages on optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique which provides high sensitivity to magnetic field magnitude and orientation from the analysis of the resonance frequencies. Direct detection of the magnetic field polarity would be appealing for the study of physical phenomena and applications where real-time detection of static and dynamic stray field from samples is required. Unfortunately, ODMR resonance lines are inherently insensitive to the magnetic field polarity. Here, an effect has been observed where the ODMR spectra recorded for an ensemble of NV- centers by demodulating a small magnetic field (Bmod-ODMR) directly correlates the symmetry of the firstderivative spectral lines to the magnetic field polarity. A model is introduced to explain the mechanism underlying for Bmod-ODMR along with a proof-of-concept for real-time detection of magnetic field switching.

TI Experimental evidence for spin-triplet states in Titanium implanted AlN
   film: An electron spin resonance study
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Spin carrying defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising candidates for the development of quan-tum information and quantum sensing technology. Here we report experimental evidence for the formation of paramagnetic defects in AlN films, subjected to high-energy hydrogen and titanium ion implantation. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy show that ion species and implantation process could alter the amount of local strain in AlN films. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals resonance peaks with g-value higher than the one of a free electron (2.0023) for both H-implanted and Ti-implanted AlN films. The origin of these peaks is identified and attributed to different types of point defects. For the Ti-implanted film, in addition to the central peak, a half-field resonance peak has been detected and assigned to spin-triplet (S=1). These results provide new insight into the electronic spin state of point defects in AlN, which opens up interesting perspectives for applications to quantum devices.

TI Quantum-enhanced distributed phase sensing with a truncated SU(1,1)
   interferometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In recent years, distributed quantum sensing has gained interest for a range of applications requiring networks of sensors, from global-scale clock synchronization to high energy physics. In particular, a network of entangled sensors can improve not only the sensitivity beyond the shot noise limit, but also enable a Heisenberg scaling with the number of sensors. Here, using bright entangled twin beams, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the detection of a linear combination of two distributed phases beyond the shot noise limit with a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer. Specifically, we show a quantum noise reduction of 1.7 +/- 0.3 dB below what is possible with the corresponding classical configuration. Additionally, we theoretically extend the use of a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer to a multi-phase-distributed sensing scheme that leverages entanglement as a resource to achieve a quantum improvement in the scaling with the number of sensors in the network. Our results pave the way for developing quantum-enhanced sensor networks that can achieve an entanglement-enhanced sensitivity.

TI Experimental metrology beyond the standard quantum limit for a wide
   resources range
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Adopting quantum resources for parameter estimation discloses the possibility to realize quantum sensors operating at a sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. Such an approach promises to reach the fundamental Heisenberg scaling as a function of the employed resources N in the estimation process. Although previous experiments demonstrated precision scaling approaching Heisenberg-limited performances, reaching such a regime for a wide range of N remains hard to accomplish. Here, we show a method that suitably allocates the available resources permitting them to reach the same power law of Heisenberg scaling without any prior information on the parameter. We demonstrate experimentally such an advantage in measuring a rotation angle. We quantitatively verify sub-standard quantum limit performances for a considerable range of N (O(30,000)) by using single-photon states with high-order orbital angular momentum, achieving an error reduction, in terms of the obtained variance, >10 dB below the standard quantum limit. Such results can be applied to different scenarios, opening the way to the optimization of resources in quantum sensing.

TI Single-Nitrogen-Vacancy NMR of Amine-Functionalized Diamond Surfaces
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging with shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offers an exciting route toward sensitive and localized chemical characterization at the nanoscale. Remarkable progress has been made to combat the degradation in coherence time and stability suffered by near-surface NV centers using suitable chemical surface termination. However, approaches that also enable robust control over adsorbed molecule density, orientation, and binding configuration are needed. We demonstrate a diamond surface preparation for mixed nitrogen-and oxygen-termination that simultaneously improves NV center coherence times for < 10 nm-deep emitters and enables direct and recyclable chemical functionalization via amine-reactive cross-linking. Using this approach, we probe single NV centers embedded in nanopillar waveguides to perform F-19 NMR sensing of covalently bound fluorinated molecules with detection on the order of 100 molecules. This work signifies an important step toward nuclear spin localization and structure interrogation at the single-molecule level.

TI Self-mixing interferometry and near-field nanoscopy in quantum cascade
   random lasers at terahertz frequencies
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB We demonstrate that electrically pumped random laser resonators, operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies, and comprising a quantum cascade laser heterostructure, can operate as sensitive photodetectors through the self-mixing effect. We devise two-dimensional cavities exploiting a disordered arrangement of surface holes that simultaneously provide optical feedback and allow light out-coupling. By reflecting the emitted light back onto the surface with random holes pattern, and by varying the external cavity length, we capture the temporal dependence of the laser voltage, collecting a rich sequence of interference fringes that follow the bias-dependent spectral emission of the laser structure. This provides a visible signature of the random laser sensitivity to the self-mixing effect, under different feedback regimes. The latter effect is then exploited, in the near-field, to demonstrate detectorless scattering near-field optical microscopy with nanoscale (120 nm) spatial resolution. The achieved results open up possibilities of detectorless speckle-free nano-imaging and quantum sensing applications across the farinfrared.

TI Group sparse matrix optimization for efficient quantum state
   transformation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Finding ways to transform a quantum state to another is fundamental to quantum information processing. In this paper, we apply the sparse matrix approach to the quantum state transformation problem. In particular, we present an approach for searching for unitary matrices for quantum state transformation by directly optimizing the objective problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Moreover, we consider the use of group sparsity as an alternative sparsity choice in quantum state transformation problems. Our approach incorporates sparsity constraints into quantum state transformation by formulating it as a nonconvex problem. It establishes a useful framework for efficiently handling complex quantum systems and achieving precise state transformations.

TI On-chip light trapping in bilayer moire photonic crystal slabs
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The optical response of bilayer moire photonic structures can be precisely controlled by varying the lattice geometry. Bilayer moire photonic crystal slabs exhibit flat bands in the optical band structure, where the optical modes have zero group velocity. They also give rise to momentum-independent light-trapping of Bloch waves in both transverse and vertical directions, leading to high quality-factors ( Q = 10 (9)) and small mode volumes ( V = 0.12 lambda (2)). The large Q and small V lead to a large Purcell enhancement ( F (P) = 1035), providing opportunities for low-threshold lasing, enhancement of optical nonlinearities, and quantum information processing.

TI Quantum coherence measure based on affinity
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Quantification of quantum coherence is a fundamental and key issue in the field of resource theory and quantum information processing. Exploiting an affinity-based metric, in this article, we define a faithful measure of quantum coherence. It is shown that the affinity-based coherence is bounded by that based on fidelity and trace distance. The measure of quantumness in terms of the difference between bipartite coherence and corresponding product state coherence is also identified. Finally, we interpret the operational meaning of the affinity-based coherence as a lower bound of interferometric power of the quantum state. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Four-wave mixing in all degrees of freedom
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A Wigner functional approach is used to derive an evolution equation for a photonic state propagating through a Kerr medium. The resulting evolution equation incorporates all the spatiotemporal degrees of freedom together with the photon-number degrees of freedom and thus allows thorough analyses of the effects of experimental parameters in physical quantum information systems. We then use the evolution equation to consider four-wave mixing as a spontaneous process and finally we impose some approximations to obtain an expression for the optical field due to self-phase modulation.

TI Singularities from Entropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Assuming the Bousso bound, we prove a singularity theorem: if the light rays entering a hyperentropic region contract, then at least one light ray must be incomplete. ???Hyperentropic??? means that the entropy of the region exceeds the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of its spatial boundary. Our theorem provides a direct link between singularities and quantum information. The hyperentropic condition replaces the non compactness assumption in Penrose???s theorem, so our theorem is applicable even in a closed universe. In an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, for example, a big bang singularity can be diagnosed from the presence of dilute radiation at arbitrarily late times. In asymptotically flat space, Penrose???s theorem can be recovered by adding soft radiation.

We study the monodromy of such defect and learn how a global O(N)-symmetry is broken. By applying the equation of motion to the bulk-defect operator-product expansion we are able to extract the anomalous dimension of defect-local fields.All of the results in this paper was first presented in my thesis [1], and they generalize previous results on an O(N)-flavoured monodromy twist defect.

TI Physical-layer machine learning with multimode interferometric photon
   counting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Learning about the physical world relies on sensing and postprocessing. When the signals are weak, multidimensional, and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for the integration of quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. Examples of such a learning scenario include the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radio-frequency photonic sensing, and microwave cavity weak-signal sensing. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis and cross-correlation analysis, even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance performance, we also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and antisqueezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.

TI Strict Area Law Entanglement versus Chirality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through nonzero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this Letter, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. We also show that the finite dimensional local Hilbert space condition can be relaxed to the condition that the state has finite local entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.

TI Scattering solution of an interacting Hamiltonian for the electronic
   control of molecular spin qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically study how a scattered electron can entangle molecular spin qubits (MSQs). This requires solving the inelastic transport of a single electron through a scattering region described by a tight-binding interacting Hamiltonian. We accomplish this using a Green's-function solution. We can model realistic physical implementations of MSQs by parametrizing the tight-binding Hamiltonian with first-principles descriptions of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions. We find that, for two-MSQ systems with inversion symmetry, projective measurement of the spin degree of freedom of the scattered electron offers probabilistic control of the degree of entanglement between the MSQs.

Moreover, we show that each coherent state can be detected by one of the coherence witnesses in a finite set. The corresponding finite set of coherence witnesses is presented explicitly, which detects all the coherent states.

Dissolved and solid complexes were studied under a confocal microscope set-up with fluorescence detection. The observed electronic coherence on a few hundred femtoseconds time scale is modulated by additional coherent wave packet dynamics, which we attribute mainly to be vibrational in nature. In future, the complexes may serve as prototypes for possible applications in quantum information technology.

An explicit characteristic function for interactive string field theory will be built using this string field theoretical Ramsey scheme. The average of the difference between the initial and final values of any operator described in string field theory will be obtained using this characteristic function. We will use the quantum information theoretical technique based on quantum Fisher information to extract information about such string field theoretical processes.

The process is applied to distinct fields produced by a spatial light modulator, decomposing the generated paraxial field onto a basis of modes defined by the resonant optical cavity. We also present a proposal for the realization of a mode sorter based on a sequence of these cavities, without the need for optical isolation. We discuss its possible applications in sensitive measurements and distribution of information in optical systems. The high purity of the process should enable its use at the level of quantum information sharing.

TI Spin squeezing of macroscopic nuclear spin ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Spin squeezing has been explored in atomic systems as a tool for quantum sensing, improving experimental sensitivity beyond the spin standard quantum limit for certain measurements. To optimize absolute metrological sensitivity, it is beneficial to consider macroscopic spin ensembles, such as nuclear spins in solids and liquids. Coupling a macroscopic spin ensemble to a parametrically-modulated resonant circuit can create collective spin squeezing by generating spin correlations mediated by the circuit. We analyze the squeezing dynamics in the presence of decoherence and finite spin polarization, showing that achieving 7 dB spin squeezing is feasible in several nuclear spin systems. The metrological benefit of squeezing a macroscopic spin ensemble lies in the suppression of technical noise sources in the spin detection system relative to the spin projection noise. This expands the experimental sensitivity bandwidth when searching for signals of unknown frequency and can improve the resonant signal-to-noise ratio. Squeezing macroscopic spin ensembles may prove to be a useful technique for fundamental physics experiments aimed at detecting spin interactions with oscillating background fields, such as ultralight dark matter.

TI Enhanced magnetization by defect-assisted exciton recombination in
   atomically thin CrCl3
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Two-dimensional semiconductors present unique opportunities to intertwine optical and magnetic functionalities and to tune these performances through defects and dopants. Here, we integrate exciton pumping into a quantum sensing protocol on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to image the optically induced transient stray fields in few-layer, antiferromagnetic CrCl3. We discover that exciton recombination enhances the inplane magnetization of the CrCl3 layers, with a predominant effect in the surface monolayers. Concomitantly, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that nonradiative exciton recombination intensifies in atomically thin CrCl3 with tightly localized, nearly dipole-forbidden excitons and amplified surface-to-volume ratio. Supported by experiments under controlled surface exposure and density functional theory calculations, we interpret the magnetically enhanced state to result from a defect-assisted Auger recombination that optically activates electron transfer between water vapor related surface impurities and the spin-polarized conduction band. Our work validates defect engineering as a route to enhance intrinsic magnetism in single magnetic layers and opens an experimental platform for studying optically induced, transient magnetism in condensed matter systems.

AB Nanoscale confinement of liquids can result in enhanced viscosity, local fluidic order, or collective motion. Studying these effects, however, is notoriously difficult, mainly due to the lack of experimental methods with the required sensitivity and spatial or time resolution. Here we leverage shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the dynamics of room-temperature water molecules entrapped within similar to 5 nm-tall channels formed between the diamond crystal and a suspended hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake. NV-enabled nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of confined water protons reveal a much reduced H2O self-diffusivity, orders of magnitude lower than that in bulk water. We posit the slow dynamics stem from the accumulation of photogenerated carriers at the interface and trapped fluid, a notion we support with the help of molecular dynamics modeling. Our results expose the importance of space charge fields in theories describing interfacial water and lay out a route for investigating other fluids under confinement.

TI Towards high-sensitivity magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   diamond using the singlet infrared absorption
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center in diamond is widely used for quantum sensing due to the sensitivity of the spin triplet in the electronic ground state to external perturbations such as strain and electromagnetic fields, which makes it an excellent probe for changes in these perturbations. The spin state can be measured through optically detected magnetic resonance, which is most commonly achieved by detecting the photoluminescence after exciting the spin-triplet transition. Recently, methods have been proposed and demonstrated that use the absorption of the infrared singlet transition at 1042 nm instead. These methods, however, require cryogenic temperatures or external cavities to enhance the absorption signal. Here, we report on our efforts to optimize the magnetometer sensitivity at room temperature and without cavities. We reach a sensitivity of 18 pT/i/Hz, surpassing previously reported values, and a calculated shot-noise limit of 5 pT/i/Hz . We also report on a defect that is native to diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition and thus absent in high-pressure high-temperature diamond, the excitation of which impacts the measured singlet absorption signal.

TI Edge-Machine-Learning-Assisted Robust Magnetometer Based on Randomly
   Oriented NV-Ensembles in Diamond
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum magnetometry based on optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen vacancy centers in nano- or micro-diamonds is a promising technology for precise magnetic-field sensors. Here, we propose a new, low-cost and stand-alone sensor setup that employs machine learning on an embedded device, so-called edge machine learning. We train an artificial neural network with data acquired from a continuous-wave ODMR setup and subsequently use this pre-trained network on the sensor device to deduce the magnitude of the magnetic field from recorded ODMR spectra. In our proposed sensor setup, a low-cost and low-power ESP32 microcontroller development board is employed to control data recording and perform inference of the network. In a proof-of-concept study, we show that the setup is capable of measuring magnetic fields with high precision and has the potential to enable robust and accessible sensor applications with a wide measuring range.

TI Pyramidal Hyperbolic Metasurfaces Enhance Spontaneous Emission of
   Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Nanodiamond
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond hold great promise for creating superior biological labels and quantum sensing methods. Yet, inefficient photon generation and extraction from excited NV centers restrict the achievable sensitivity and temporal resolution. Herein, an entirely complementary route featuring pyramidal hyperbolic metasurface is reported to modify the spontaneous emission of NV centers. Fabricated using nanosphere lithography, the metasurface consists of alternatively stacked silica-silver thin films configured in a pyramidal fashion, and supports both spectrally broadband Purcell enhancement and spatially extended intense local fields owing to the hyperbolic dispersion and plasmonic coupling. The enhanced photophysical properties are manifested as a simultaneous amplification to the spontaneous decay rate and emission intensity of NV centers. It is envisioned that the reported pyramidal metasurface can serve as a versatile platform for creating chip-based ultrafast single-photon sources and spin-enhanced quantum biosensing strategies, as well as aid in further fundamental understanding of photoexcited species in condensed phases.

TI Quantum Squeezing and Sensing with Pseudo-Anti-Parity-Time Symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The emergence of parity-time (PT) symmetry has greatly enriched our study of symmetry-enabled non-Hermitian physics, but the realization of quantum PT symmetry faces an intrinsic issue of unavoidable symmetry-breaking Langevin noises. Here we construct a quantum pseudo-anti-PT (pseudo-APT) symmetry in a two-mode bosonic system without involving Langevin noises. We show that the spontaneous pseudo-APT symmetry breaking leads to an exceptional point, across which there is a transition between different types of quantum squeezing dynamics; i.e., the squeezing factor increases exponentially (oscillates periodically) with time in the pseudo-APT-symmetric (broken) region. Such dramatic changes of squeezing factors and quantum dynamics near the exceptional point are utilized for ultraprecision quantum sensing. These exotic quantum phenomena and sensing applications can be experimentally observed in two physical systems: spontaneous wave mixing nonlinear optics and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Our Letter offers a physical platform for investigating exciting APT symmetry physics in the quantum realm, paving the way for exploring fundamental quantum non-Hermitian effects and their quantum technological applications.

TI Convolutional neural networks for mode on-demand high finesse optical
   resonator design
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate the use of machine learning through convolutional neural networks to solve inverse design problems of optical resonator engineering. The neural network finds a harmonic modulation of a spherical mirror to generate a resonator mode with a given target topology ("mode on-demand"). The procedure allows us to optimize the shape of mirrors to achieve a significantly enhanced coupling strength and cooperativity between a resonator photon and a quantum emitter located at the center of the resonator. In a second example, a double-peak mode is designed which would enhance the interaction between two quantum emitters, e.g., for quantum information processing.

TI Quantifying dynamical coherence with coherence measures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum coherence, like entanglement, is a fundamental resource in quantum information. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in formulating resource theory of coherence from a broader perspective. The notions of block-coherence and POVM-based coherence have been established. Certain challenges, however, remain to be addressed. It is difficult to define incoherent operations directly, without requiring incoherent states, which proves a major obstacle in establishing the resource theory of dynamical coherence. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by introducing an alternate definition of incoherent operations induced via coherence measures and quantify dynamical coherence based on this definition. Finally, we apply our proposed definition to quantify POVM-based dynamical coherence.

TI Strong broadband intensity noise squeezing from infrared to terahertz
   frequencies in lasers with nonlinear dissipation
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The generation and application of squeezed light have long been central goals of quantum optics. Intensity noise squeezing of bright (coherent) states ("bright squeezing"), in contrast to squeezed vacuum, is relatively underdeveloped. The current state of the art has generally been restricted to narrow operating wavelength ranges and does not natively support strong intracavity and broadband output squeezing. Here, we show how lasers with sharp intensity-dependent dissipation can support strong intensity noise squeezing from infrared (IR) to terahertz (THz) wavelengths, the latter of which has eluded quantum light generation. Our protocol realizes strongly ( > 10 ${ >} 10$ dB) intensity noise-squeezed intracavity quantum states as well as output squeezing surpassing gigahertz bandwidths. Furthermore, we show how the same systems also support self-pulsing and bistability, enabling control of light in both the mean field and noise domains. Our protocol could enable advances in low-noise communication, cavity QED, and quantum sensing across the electromagnetic spectrum.

TI Quantifying the creation of negatively charged boron vacancies in He-ion
   irradiated hexagonal boron nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies (V-B) is still an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically create optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying densities. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of V-B defects created by the ion irradiation. We find a lower bound for the fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the creation efficiency of V-B , which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.

TI On the creation of near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centre ensembles by
   implantation of type Ib diamond
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Dense, near-surface (within similar to 10 nm) ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are moving into prominence as the workhorse of many envisaged applications, from the imaging of fast fluctuating magnetic signals to enacting nuclear hyperpolarisation. Unlike their bulk counterparts, near surface ensembles suffer from charge stability issues and reduced formation efficiency due to proximity to the diamond surface. Here we examine the prospects for creating such ensembles by implanting nitrogen-rich type Ib diamond, aiming to exploit the high bulk nitrogen density to combat surface induced band bending. This approach has previously been successful at creating deeper ensembles, however we find that in the near-surface regime there are fewer benefits over nitrogen implantation into pure diamond substrates. Our results suggest that control over diamond surface termination during annealing is key to successfully creating high-yield near-surface NV ensembles generally and implantation into type Ib diamond may be worth revisiting once that has been accomplished.

TI Collective oscillations of Bose-Einstein condensates in a synthetic
   magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the collective oscillations of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of position-dependent detuning. Specifically, we explore the quadrupole modes of the system using both numerical and analytical approaches based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and hydrodynamic theory. Due to spin-orbit coupling and the synthetic magnetic field, the xy scissors mode couples with a superposition of the three diagonal quadrupole modes (x2, y2, and z2), resulting in the characteristic beating effect. The remaining two scissors modes, xz and yz, are coupled, giving rise to a Lissajous-like pattern that is highly sensitive to the excitation method and orientation of the synthetic magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that anisotropic interactions as well as the direction of the synthetic magnetic field, can significantly influence the oscillation amplitude and frequency of the quadrupole modes. These findings highlight the potential of Bose-Einstein condensates under synthetic magnetic fields for quantum sensing applications, such as magnetic field gradient measurements, and provide a promising foundation for future experimental research and technological development.

TI Electric field sensitivity of molecular color centers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Molecular color centers with S=1 ground states are promising candidates for quantum sensing of electric fields. These molecules have an electronic structure similar to solid state color centers, but they allow for processing modalities that permit direct interfacing with an analyte. Currently, it is unknown how sensitive these molecules are to electric fields and what molecular properties affect their sensitivity. We perform density functional theory calculations to understand the impact of electric fields on the electronic structure of five nominally tetrahedral molecular color centers exhibiting variable transition metal chemistry and ligand densities. We then extract the Stark parameters from each of these molecules and compare them to molecular properties such as the dipole moment and inner shell stiffness and find that the dipole moment of the molecule largely governs sensitivity. We predict that polar heteroleptic molecules may have electric field sensitivities comparable to solid state color centers such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. (c) 2024 Author(s).

The chip aims at easing the assembly together with Silicon Photonics substrates and chips, for a broad spectrum of quantum applications. The chip provides not only 32 independent pulse outputs for multi-channel single-photon counting, but it features other two operation modalities. For single-photon applications, the chip provides the single-hit digital address of the channel detecting the photon among the 32 ones. For multi-photon applications, the chip provides an event-driven pulse every time more than n photons (n selectable between 2 and 4) concurrently trigger different channels. Each detection channel consists of 4 independent SPADs with different diameter (5 mu m, 10 mu m, 20 mu m, and 50 mu m), to easily match the waveguides and collection efficiency.

TI Ultra-sensitive hybrid diamond nanothermometer
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising quantum sensors because of their long spin coherence time under ambient conditions. However, their spin resonances are relatively insensitive to non-magnetic parameters such as temperature. A magnetic-nanoparticle-nanodiamond hybrid thermometer, where the temperature change is converted to the magnetic field variation near the Curie temperature, were demonstrated to have enhanced temperature sensitivity (11 mK Hz(-1/2)) (Wang N, Liu G-Q and LeongW-H et al. Phys Rev X 2018; 8: 011042), but the sensitivity was limited by the large spectral broadening of ensemble spins in nanodiamonds. To overcome this limitation, here we show an improved design of a hybrid nanothermometer using a single NV center in a diamond nanopillar coupled with a single magnetic nanoparticle of copper-nickel alloy, and demonstrate a temperature sensitivity of 76 mu K Hz(-1/2). This hybrid design enables detection of 2 mK temperature changes with temporal resolution of 5 ms. The ultra-sensitive nanothermometer offers a new tool to investigate thermal processes in nanoscale systems.

TI Filtering and Imaging of Frequency-Degenerate Spin Waves Using
   Nanopositioning of a Single-Spin Sensor
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry is a new technique for imaging spin waves in magnetic materials. It detects spin waves by their microwave magnetic stray fields, which decay evanescently on the scale of the spin-wavelength. Here, we use nanoscale control of a single-NV sensor as a wavelength filter to characterize frequency-degenerate spin waves excited by a microstrip in a thin-film magnetic insulator. With the NV probe in contact with the magnet, we observe an incoherent mixture of thermal and microwave-driven spin waves. By retracting the tip, we progressively suppress the small-wavelength modes until a single coherent mode emerges from the mixture. In-contact scans at low drive power surprisingly show occupation of the entire isofrequency contour of the two-dimensional spin-wave dispersion despite our one-dimensional microstrip geometry. Our distance-tunable filter sheds light on the spin-wave band occupation under microwave excitation and opens opportunities for imaging magnon condensates and other coherent spin-wave modes.

TI Second-Harmonic Generation in Bulk Diamond Based on Inversion Symmetry
   Breaking by Color Centers
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Breaking inversion symmetry in solids plays a central role in nonlinear optics because it can change material properties, such as producing even-order nonlinear optical (NLO) effects. Although a centrosymmetric diamond has been developed as a photonic platform, including waveguides and light sources, the NLO effects in bulk diamonds are limited to the third-order. Thus, exploiting more powerful second-order NLO effects, such as second harmonic generation (SHG), are still challenging. Here we explore symmetry-breaking-induced second-order NLO effects in bulk diamonds using the color center, nitrogen-vacancy center. Exciting with ultrashort laser pulses, SHG and third-harmonic generation (THG) are simultaneously observed at the same time, exhibiting characteristic intensity patterns, depending on both the excitation fluence and the angle of light polarization. We uncovered that SHG serves as the source for THG by the cascading process. Our findings will offer NLO effect-based quantum sensing by diamond color centers, such as imaging of the electromagnetic field by electro-optic effects on the nanofemto scale.

TI Generating Stable Spin Squeezing by Squeezed-Reservoir Engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB As a genuine many-body entanglement, spin squeezing (SS) can be used to realize the highly precise measurement beyond the limit constrained by classical physics. Its generation has attracted much attention recently. It was reported that N two-level systems (TLSs) located near a one-dimensional waveguide can generate SS by using the mediation effect of the waveguide. However, a coherent driving on each TLS is used to stabilize the SS, which raises a high requirement for experiments. We here propose a scheme to generate stable SS resorting to neither the spin-spin coupling nor the coherent driving on the TLSs. Incorporating the mediation role of the common waveguide and the technique of squeezed-reservoir engineering, our scheme exhibits the advantages over previous ones in the scaling relation of the SS parameter with the number of the TLSs. The long-range correlation feature of the generated SS along the waveguide in our scheme may endow it with certain superiority in quantum sensing, e.g., improving the sensing efficiency of spatially unidentified weak magnetic fields.

TI Molecular spin sensor for in-situ monitoring of crystallization behavior
   and phase transition in aromatic materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-active materials with sensitive electron spin centers have drawn significant attention in quantum sensing due to their unique quantum characteristics. Herein, we report a molecular spin sensor based on metallofullerene Y2@C79N for in-situ monitoring of crystallization behavior and phase transitions in aromatic materials with high precision. Temperature-dependent spin resonance signals of Y2@C79N dissolved in aromatic materials are analyzed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Two functional aromatic materials, 1-chloronaphthalene and a liquid crystal material of 5CB, are selected based on their significant crystallization-related technological applications. For Y2@C79N in 1-chloronaphthalene, a distinct EPR signal transition attributed to the crystallization of 1-chloronaphthalene. For Y2@C79N in 5CB, three EPR signal transitions correspond to the phase transitions of crystalline 5CB. Theoretical calculations reveal that the sensing mechanism originates from crystallization-induced alignment of fullerene molecular orientation. This work establishes metallofullerene-based spin probes as a powerful analytical tool for detecting the crystallization processes in materials.

TI Characterization of a Continuous Beam Cold Atom Ramsey Interferometer
SO ATOMS
AB The use of atom interferometers in inertial systems holds the promise of improvement of several orders of magnitude in sensitivity over sensors using current technology such as micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) devices or ring laser gyroscopes (RLGs). This paper describes the construction and characterization of an atomic interferometry system for eventual use in a dual-atom-beam accelerometer/gyroscope sensor. In contrast with current state-of-the-art atomic sensors which use pulsed cold atom sources and pulsed laser beams, the investigated apparatus relies purely on continuous atomic and laser beams. These differences can result in a sensor with reduced complexity, a smaller physical footprint, and reduced power consumption. However, these differences also introduce challenges resulting from laser and atomic beam divergences and from velocity averaging due to both longitudinal and transverse velocity spreads. In this work, we characterize our rubidium-based atom beam system and show that Ramsey-style interference can still be observed. The implications for future research are also outlined and discussed.

TI Single-domain Bose condensate magnetometer achieves energy resolution
   per bandwidth below h
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We present a magnetic sensor with energy resolution per bandwidth E-R < h. We show how a Rb-87 single-domain spinor BoseEinstein condensate, detected by nondestructive Faraday rotation probing, achieves single-shot low-frequency magnetic sensitivity of 72(8) fT measuring a volume V = 1,091(30) mu m(3) for 3.5 s, and thus, E-R = 0.075(16) h. We measure experimentally the condensate volume, spin coherence time, and readout noise and use phase space methods, backed by three-dimensional mean-field simulations, to compute the spin noise. Contributions to the spin noise include one-body and three-body losses and shearing of the projection noise distribution, due to competition of ferromagnetic contact interactions and quadratic Zeeman shifts. Nonetheless, the fully coherent nature of the single-domain, ultracold twobody interactions allows the system to escape the coherence vs. density trade-off that imposes an energy resolution limit on traditional spin precession sensors. We predict that other Bose-condensed alkalis, especially the antiferromagnetic Na-23, can further improve the energy resolution of this method.

TI Sensing Electric Currents in an a-IGZO TFT-Based Circuit Using a Quantum
   Diamond Microscope
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES
AB The Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) is an emerging magnetic imaging tool enabling noninvasive characterization of electronic circuits through spatially mapping current densities. In this work, wafer-level current sensing is demonstrated for a current mirror circuit composed of 16 amorphous- indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). a-IGZO TFTs are promising for flexible electronics due to their high performance. Using QDM, 2D magnetic field images produced by DC currents were obtained, from which accurate current density maps are extracted. Notably, QDM measurements agree well with conventional electrical probe station measurements, and enable current sensing in internal circuit paths inaccessible via conventional electrical probing techniques. The results highlight QDM's capability as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the characterization of emerging semiconductor technologies, especially oxide-based TFTs. This approach provides essential insights to fabrication engineers, with potential to improve yield and reliability in flexible electronics manufacturing.

TI A coherence-protection scheme for quantum sensors based on ultra-shallow
   single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High spatial resolution quantum sensing of near-surface nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has enabled detection of magnetic, electrical, and thermal signals at the nanoscale. At depths of just a few nanometers, NV centers serve as localized quantum probes for external spins or low-dimensional materials, but their proximity to the surface also enhances decoherence caused by fluctuating nuclear spins. While advances in surface engineering have stabilized the charge state of NV centers at depths of tens of nanometers, achieving both ultra-shallow implantation (0.5-2 nm) and long-term spin coherence remains a central challenge. In this work, we show using first-principles modeling that, by exploiting the interaction of surface-induced strain and weak dc magnetic fields, the spin coherence times of 1-nm-deep NV centers can be greatly improved near the spin-phonon-confined regime at room temperature in C-12-rich diamonds. We also demonstrate that this protocol benefits similar to 10-nm-deep NV centers in natural diamond, enabling vector magnetometry at the nanoscale.

TI Enhanced Quantum Magnetometry with a Femtosecond Laser-Written
   Integrated Photonic Diamond Chip
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Ensemble negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are promising quantum sensors. To optimize their sensitivity, it is crucial to increase the number of spins sampled and maximize their coupling to the detection system without degrading their spin properties. In this paper, we demonstrate enhanced quantum magnetometry via a buried laser-written waveguide in diamond with 4.5 ppm nitrogen-vacancy centers. The waveguide-coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit spin coherence properties comparable to those of nitrogen-vacancy centers in pristine diamond. Waveguide-enhanced magnetic field sensing is demonstrated in a fiber-coupled integrated photonic chip, where probing an increased volume of high-density spins results in 63 pT<middle dot>Hz-1/2 of DC magnetic field sensitivity and 20 pT<middle dot>Hz-1/2 of AC magnetic field sensitivity. This on-chip sensor realizes at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the conventional confocal detection setup, paving the way for high-sensitivity quantum magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles.

TI First-Principles Investigation of Near-Surface Divacancies in Silicon

SO NANO LETTERS
AB The realization of quantum sensors using spin defects in semiconductors requires a thorough understanding of the physical properties of the defects in the proximity of surfaces. We report a study of the divacancy (VSiVC) in 3C-SiC, a promising material for quantum applications, as a function of surface reconstruction and termination with -H, -OH, -F and oxygen groups. We show that a VSiVC close to hydrogen-terminated (2 x 1) surfaces is a robust spin-defect with a triplet ground state and no surface states in the band gap and with small variations of many of its physical properties relative to the bulk, including the zero-phonon line and zero-field splitting. However, the Debye-Waller factor decreases in the vicinity of the surface and our calculations indicate it may be improved by strain-engineering. Overall our results show that the VSiVC close to SiC surfaces is a promising spin defect for quantum applications, similar to its bulk counterpart.

TI Room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance of triplet
   excitons in a pentacene-doped picene single crystal
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The inclusion of functional molecules as substitutional dopants in single crystals of organic hosts with complementary optical properties provides a versatile strategy to tune optical and magnetic properties in view of their applications in opto-electronics and spintronics. Here, by combining electron spin resonance and optical spectroscopy, isolated triplet exciton states with distinct emission and absorptive resonance modes from two magnetically inequivalent sites of pentacene within the picene crystal are detected at room temperature. This is possible due to the incorporation of a low-doping, 1% mol/mol of pentacene into the monoclinic polymorph of picene high-quality single crystals. In addition, delayed fluorescence-optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) studies demonstrate efficient spin-dependent optical activities that are tuned by crystallographically oriented magnetic fields. These properties are particularly appealing for the exploitation of pentacene in room-temperature spin-driven opto-electronics, quantum sensing and in microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (MASER).

TI Entanglement-Assisted Joint Monostatic-Bistatic Radars
SO ENTROPY
AB With the help of entanglement, we can build quantum sensors with sensitivity better than that of classical sensors. In this paper we propose an entanglement assisted (EA) joint monostatic-bistatic quantum radar scheme, which significantly outperforms corresponding conventional radars. The proposed joint monostatic-bistatic quantum radar is composed of two radars, one having both wideband entangled source and EA detector, and the second one with only an EA detector. The optical phase conjugation (OPC) is applied on the transmitter side, while classical coherent detection schemes are applied in both receivers. The joint monostatic-bistatic integrated EA transmitter is proposed suitable for implementation in LiNbO3 technology. The detection probability of the proposed EA joint target detection scheme outperforms significantly corresponding classical, coherent states-based quantum detection, and EA monostatic detection schemes. The proposed EA joint target detection scheme is evaluated by modelling the direct radar return and forward scattering channels as both lossy and noisy Bosonic channels, and assuming that the distribution of entanglement over idler channels is not perfect.

TI Principles of tractor atom interferometry
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present principles and possible design concepts for a tractor atom interferometer (TAI) based on three-dimensional confinement and transport of ultracold atoms. The confinement reduces device size and wave-packet dispersion, enables arbitrary holding times, and facilitates control to create complex trajectories that allow for optimization to enable fast splitting and recombination, to suppress detrimental nonadiabatic excitation, and to cancel unwanted sensitivity. Thus, the design allows for further advancement of compact, high-sensitivity, quantum sensing technology. In particular, we focus on the implementation of quantum-enhanced accelerometers and gyroscopes. We discuss TAT protocols for both spin-dependent and scalar trapping potentials. Using optimal control theory, we demonstrate the splitting of the wave function on a time scale two orders of magnitude shorter than a previous proposal using adiabatic dynamics, thus maximizing the time spent at full separation, where the interferometric phase is accumulated. The performance estimates for TAI give a promising perspective for atom-interferometry-based sensing, significantly exceeding the sensitivities of current state-of-the-art devices.

TI Continuous recoil-driven lasing and cavity frequency pinning with
   laser-cooled atoms
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Laser-cooled gases of atoms interacting with the field of an optical cavity are a versatile tool for quantum sensing and the simulation of quantum systems. These systems can exhibit phenomena such as self-organization phase transitions, lasing mechanisms, squeezed states and protection of quantum coherence. However, investigations of these phenomena typically occur in a discontinuous manner due to the need to reload atomic ensembles. Here we demonstrate hours-long continuous lasing from laser-cooled 88Sr atoms loaded into a ring cavity. The required inversion to produce lasing arises from inversion in the atomic-momentum degrees of freedom, which is linked to the self-organization phase transitions and collective atomic recoil lasing observed previously only in a cyclic fashion. We find that over a broad parameter range, the sensitivity of the lasing frequency to changes in cavity frequency is significantly reduced due to an atomic loss mechanism, suggesting a potential approach for mitigating low-frequency cavity noise.

TI Realization of nonreciprocal photon statistics by manipulating the
   quantum nonlinearity of cold atoms in an asymmetric cavity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In a strongly coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, the second- order correlation function g ( 2 ) ( r ) of the transmitted probe light from the cavity is determined by the nonlinearity of the atom in the cavity. Therefore, the system provides a platform for controlling the photon statistics by manipulating nonlinearity. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal quantum statistics in a cavity QED system with several atoms strongly coupled to an asymmetric optical cavity, which is composed of two mirrors with different transmittivities. When the direction of the probe light is reversed, the intracavity light field alternates to a different level. Distinct photon statistics are then observed due to the quantum nonlinearity associated with strongly coupled atoms. Sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics for forward light and a Poissonian distribution for backward light are then realized. Our work provides an effective approach for realizing nonreciprocal quantum devices, which have potential applications in the unidirectional generation of nonclassical light fields and quantum sensing.

TI Bright triplet and bright charge-separated singlet excitons in organic
   diradicals enable optical read-out and writing of spin states
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Optical control of electron spin states is important for quantum sensing and computing applications, as developed with the diamond nitrogen vacancy centre. This requires electronic excitations, excitons, with net spin. Here we report a molecular diradical where two trityl radical groups are coupled via a meta-linked fluorene bridge. The singlet exciton is at lower energy than the triplet because electron transfer from one of the radical non-bonding orbitals to the other is spin allowed, set by the charging energy for the double occupancy of the non-bonding level, the Hubbard U. Both excitons give efficient photoluminescence at 640 and 700 nm with near unity efficiency. The ground state exchange energy is low, 60 mu eV, allowing control of ground state spin populations. We demonstrate spin-selective intersystem crossing and show coherent microwave control. We report up to 8% photoluminescence contrast at microwave resonance. This tuning of the singlet Mott-Hubbard exciton against the 'bandgap' exciton provides a new design platform for spin-optical materials.

TI Low-Temperature Contacts and the Coulomb Blockade Effect in Layered
   Nanoribbons with In-Plane Anisotropy
SO ACS NANO
AB One-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons (NRs) constitute rapidly advancing nanotechnology with significant potential for emerging applications such as quantum sensing and metrology. TiS3 nanoribbons exhibit strong in-plane crystal anisotropy, enabling robust 1D confinement and resilience to edge disorder. Nevertheless, charge transport in 1D TiS3 remains relatively unexplored, particularly at low temperatures, where high contact resistance impacts device performance and fundamentally limits its applications. Here, we engineer electrical contacts between a bulk metal and a 1D NR and explore the low-temperature characteristics of the 1D field-effect devices. We report ohmic contacts for 1D TiS3 with temperature-independent contact resistances as low as 2.7 +/- 0.3 k Omega<middle dot>mu m, enabling the study of charge transport at low temperatures (down to 35 mK) and clear observation of the Coulomb blockade effect. We demonstrate single-electron transport in 1D TiS3 and perform excited state spectroscopy and magnetospectroscopy, extracting an out-of-plane electron g-factor, g = 1.8 +/- 0.3.

TI Dynamics for High-Sensitivity Detection of Free Radicals in Primary
   Bronchial Epithelial Cells upon Stimulation with Cigarette Smoke Extract
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death worldwide, is caused by chronic exposure to toxic particles and gases, such as cigarette smoke. Free radicals, which are produced during a stress response to toxic particles, play a crucial role in disease progression. Measuring these radicals is difficult since the complex mixture of chemicals within cigarette smoke interferes with radical detection. We used a new quantum sensing technique called relaxometry to measure free radicals with nanoscale resolution on cells from COPD patients and healthy controls exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or control medium. Epithelial cells from COPD patients display a higher free radical load than those from healthy donors and are more vulnerable to CSE. We show that epithelial cells of COPD patients are more susceptible to the damaging effects of cigarette smoke, leading to increased release of free radicals.

TI Excitons at the interface of 2D TMDs and molecular semiconductors
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) of vertically stacked two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals have been used to elicit intriguing phenomena stemming from strong electronic correlations, magnetic textures, and interlayer excitons spawned at the heterointerface. However, vdWHs comprised of heterointerfaces between these 2D atomic crystal lattices and molecular assemblies are emerging as equally intriguing platforms supporting properties to be harnessed for photovoltaic energy conversion, photodetection, spin-selective charge injection, and quantum emission. In this perspective, we summarize recent research examining exciton dynamics in heterostructures between semiconducting 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and molecular organic semiconductors. We discuss methods for assembly of these heterostructures, the nature of interlayer or charge-transfer excitons at transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD)-molecule interfaces, explicit exciton transfer between organics and TMDs, and other interfacial phenomena driven by the merger of these two material classes. We also suggest key new research directions extending the remit of these 2D atomic-molecular lattice heterointerfaces into the domains of condensed matter physics, quantum sensing, and energy conversion.

TI Optomechanical crystal with bound states in the continuum
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Chipscale micro- and nano-optomechanical systems, hinging on the intangible radiation-pressure force, have shown their unique strength in sensing, signal transduction, and exploration of quantum physics with mechanical resonators. Optomechanical crystals, as one of the leading device platforms, enable simultaneous molding of the band structure of optical photons and microwave phonons with strong optomechanical coupling. Here, we demonstrate a new breed of optomechanical crystals in two-dimensional slab-on-substrate structures empowered by mechanical bound states in the continuum (BICs) at 8 GHz. We show symmetry-induced BIC emergence with optomechanical couplings up to g/2 pi approximate to 2.5 MHz per unit cell, on par with low-dimensional optomechanical crystals. Our work paves the way towards exploration of photon-phonon interaction beyond suspended microcavities, which might lead to new applications of optomechanics from phonon sensing to quantum transduction.
   Unsuspended optomechanical systems might enable unique applications for quantum sensing and transduction. Here, the authors demonstrate a two-dimensional slab-on-substrate optomechanical crystal empowered by mechanical bound states in the continuum.

TI Mode Optimization and Polarization Control in VCSELs with Sub-Wavelength
   Gratings
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB We have demonstrated the integration of sub-wavelength gratings (SWG) into a 795 nm vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) with inverse surface relief to achieve coordinated control of the mode and polarization. At a grating period of around 0.5 mu m and an etching depth range of 60 nm to 100 nm, the reflectivity was higher than 91%. A high reflectivity difference was introduced between different modes, effectively suppressing high-order modes with a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 38 dB. The SWG exhibited different refractive indices for the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) components, increasing anisotropy and thus enhancing the orthogonal polarization suppression ratio (OPSR) to 26.7 dB. The predesign and relaxed fabrication tolerances of grating parameters may facilitate the mass production of high-performance VCSELs for applications in quantum sensing systems.

TI Enhanced magnetization by defect-assisted exciton recombination in
   atomically thin CrCl3
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Two-dimensional semiconductors present unique opportunities to intertwine optical and magnetic functionalities and to tune these performances through defects and dopants. Here, we integrate exciton pumping into a quantum sensing protocol on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to image the optically induced transient stray fields in few-layer, antiferromagnetic CrCl3. We discover that exciton recombination enhances the inplane magnetization of the CrCl3 layers, with a predominant effect in the surface monolayers. Concomitantly, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that nonradiative exciton recombination intensifies in atomically thin CrCl3 with tightly localized, nearly dipole-forbidden excitons and amplified surface-to-volume ratio. Supported by experiments under controlled surface exposure and density functional theory calculations, we interpret the magnetically enhanced state to result from a defect-assisted Auger recombination that optically activates electron transfer between water vapor related surface impurities and the spin-polarized conduction band. Our work validates defect engineering as a route to enhance intrinsic magnetism in single magnetic layers and opens an experimental platform for studying optically induced, transient magnetism in condensed matter systems.

TI Laser threshold magnetometry using green-light absorption by diamond
   nitrogen vacancies in an external cavity laser
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have attracted considerable recent interest for use in quantum sensing, promising increased sensitivity for applications ranging from geophysics to biomedicine. Conventional sensing schemes involve monitoring the change in red fluorescence from the NV center under green laser and microwave illumination. Due to the strong fluorescence background from emission in the NV triplet state and low relative contrast of any change in output, sensitivity is severely restricted by a high optical shot noise level. Here, we propose a means to avoid this issue, by using the change in green pump absorption through the diamond as part of a semiconductor external cavity laser run close to the lasing threshold. We show that theoretical sensitivity to the magnetic field on the pT/root Hz level is possible using a diamond with an optimal density of NV centers. We discuss the physical requirements and limitations of the method, particularly the role of amplified spontaneous emission near threshold and explore realistic implementations using current technology.

TI High-voltage current sensing with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy color center in diamond exhibits several remarkable properties, which make it widely used in magnetic field sensing. In particular, the magnetic field measurements can be traced back to frequency, which makes diamond sensors promising for high-precision current measurement. Here, we develop a quantum current transformer (QCT) with four fiberized diamond sensors uniformly toroidally distributed in a magnetic shielding loop. We proposed fluorescence signal treatments of frequency-doubled conversion and weighted averaging under a zero bias magnetic field, which can reconstruct the 50 Hz alternating-current waveform. A maximum accuracy of 0.05% for AC amplitude measurements is achieved over a highly linear range of 0-1000 A. In addition, tracing two resonance frequencies simultaneously enabled the suppression of temperature drift in the current measurement. Finally, we apply this QCT to current monitoring in a 110 kV substation, verifying its practicality in the power supply network. Such a QCT can provide a robust and scalable platform for current quantum sensing technologies for high-voltage power transmission while reducing the complexity of operation and maintenance.

TI Gradiometer Using Separated Diamond Quantum Magnetometers
SO SENSORS
AB The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamonds is known as the spin defect and using its electron spin, magnetometry can be realized even at room temperature with extremely high sensitivity as well as a high dynamic range. However, a magnetically shielded enclosure is usually required to sense weak magnetic fields because environmental magnetic field noises can disturb high sensitivity measurements. Here, we fabricated a gradiometer with variable sensor length that works at room temperature using a pair of diamond samples containing negatively charged NV centers. Each diamond is attached to an optical fiber to enable free sensor placement. Without any magnetically shielding, our gradiometer realizes a magnetic noise spectrum comparable to that of a three-layer magnetically shielded enclosure, reducing the noises at the low-frequency range below 1 Hz as well as at the frequency of 50 Hz (power line frequency) and its harmonics. These results indicate the potential of highly sensitive magnetic sensing by the gradiometer using the NV center for applications in noisy environments such as outdoor and in vehicles.

TI Recent Advances in the Synthesis, Optical Properties, and Applications
   of Fluorescent Silicon Carbide Quantum Dots
SO SMALL SCIENCE
AB Earth-abundant, fluorescent silicon carbide (SiC) quantum dots (QDs) have recently attracted remarkable attention on account of their long-term chemical and optical stability and impressive biocompatibility. However, there has been a long-standing debate among researchers concerning whether radiative recombination in SiC QDs is governed by quantum confinement effects or by surface-related states. Herein, the underlying mechanism responsible for the photoluminescence observed in SiC QDs is elucidated. Significant progress made through the development of advanced strategies for synthesizing ultrasmall SiC QDs and modifying their surfaces with functional groups, conjugated molecules, and protective shells is discussed. Subsequently, the potential for engineered SiC QDs to be applied to a range of sectors, including energy (photocatalytic-based CO2 reduction systems), electronics/optoelectronics (electroluminescent white light-emitting diodes, nonlinear optics, and quantum sensing), and biomedicine (cell imaging and biosensors), is reviewed. Finally, this review is summarized with some forward-looking challenges and prospects.

TI Low-noise quantum frequency conversion with cavity enhancement of the
   converted mode
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum frequency conversion (QFC), which converts the frequencies of photons while preserving the quantum state, is an essential technology for realizing the quantum internet and quantum interconnect. In the QFC from the visible to the telecom wavelengths around 1.5 mu m, it is widely known that noise photons produced by the strong pump light used for the process contaminate the frequency-converted photon. It degrades the quality of the quantum property of the output photon. Conventional experiments have employed external narrowband frequency filters to eliminate the noise photons. In this study, we present a compact QFC device integrating the cavity structure only for the converted mode. While the cavity structure enhances both the desired efficiency and the noise photon generation, we show that the cavity-enhanced QFC followed by a relatively wide bandpass filter achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparable to conventional systems using external narrowband filters. We experimentally demonstrate the cavity-enhanced QFC for a single photon, converting it from 780 nm to 1540 nm, and successfully observe the non-classical photon statistics after conversion.

TI Optical and spin properties of nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond
   formed along high-energy heavy ion tracks
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Exposure of matter to high-energy heavy ions induces defects along the ion trajectories through electronic and nuclear energy loss processes. Defects, including color centers, can recombine or form along latent damage tracks in semiconductors. Latent tracks in diamond were only recently observed. Here we report on color center formation in nitrogen-doped diamond along the latent tracks of 1 GeV gold and uranium ions. We optically observe direct formation of single vacancy related color centers (GR1-centers) along the tracks. Mobile vacancies can form NV-centers with native nitrogen atoms during thermal annealing. Molecular dynamics simulations show that isolated vacancies and vacancy clusters form through electronic stopping processes along ion trajectories. Moreover, by using 1 GeV Au ions with a dilute fluence, we create individually isolated quasi-1D chains of NV-centers, which appear as isolated bright luminescence strings and present competitive electron spin properties compared to a background of NV-centers. Such spin textures can be building blocks for applications in quantum sensing and computing.

TI Multicritical dissipative phase transitions in the anisotropic open
   quantum Rabi model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the nonequilibrium steady state of the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model, which exhibits first-order and second-order dissipative phase transitions upon varying the degree of anisotropy between the coupling strengths of rotating and counter-rotating terms. Using both semiclassical and quantum approaches, we find a rich phase diagram resulting from the interplay between the anisotropy and the dissipation. First, there exists a bistable phase where both the normal and superradiant phases are stable. Second, there are multicritical points where the phase boundaries for the first- and second-order phase transitions meet. We show that a new set of critical exponents governs the scaling of the multicritical points. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of observing the multicritical transitions and bistability using a pair of trapped ions where the anisotropy can be tuned by controlling the intensity of the Raman transitions. Our study enlarges the scope of critical phenomena that may occur in finite-component quantum systems, which could be useful for applications in critical quantum sensing.

TI Quantum dynamics in Krylov space: Methods and applications
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide an efficient description of quantum evolution and quantum chaos, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.

TI Optimize the event selection strategy to study the anomalous quartic
   gauge couplings at muon colliders using the support vector machine and
   quantum support vector machine
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The search of the new physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model is one of the most important topics in current high energy physics. With the increasing luminosities at the colliders, the search for NP signals requires the analysis of more and more data, and the efficiency in data processing becomes particularly important. As a machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM) is expected to to be useful in the search of NP. Meanwhile, the quantum computing has the potential to offer huge advantages when dealing with large amounts of data, which suggests that quantum SVM (QSVM) is a potential tool in future phenomenological studies of the NP. How to use SVM and QSVM to optimize event selection strategies to search for NP signals are studied in this paper. Taking the tri-photon process at a muon collider as an example, it can be shown that the event selection strategies optimized by the SVM and QSVM are effective in the search of the dimension-8 operators contributing to the anomalous quartic gauge couplings.

AB When implementing and adopting new technologies, knowing the level of organizational readiness is crucial. By assessing the readiness levels, organizations can focus on areas with low readiness levels and prepare for the change processes. Due to the increasing vulnerabilities presented by the advancement of quantum computing technology, today's widely used cryptographic algorithms and encryption methods need to be modified with quantum-safe (QS) ones. However, organizations currently lack tools to understand the complexity of implementing and adopting QS technology, and there is no readiness assessment model available in the context of QS transition. By including different dimensions that organizations should consider when implementing and adopting QS technology, we develop an organizational readiness assessment model for QS transition. The dimensions used in the model include collaboration, governance, policy & regulation, awareness, QS solution standards, hybrid QS solutions, cryptographic agility strategies and knowledge on QS transition. While the organizational readiness assessment model with different dimensions shows the complexity involved in implementing and adopting QS technology, it acts as a guidance tool for organizations to navigate and prepare for uncertainties surrounding QS transition.

TI Extended π-conjugation: a key to magnetic anisotropy preservation in
   highly reactive porphyrins
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB In this study, the magnetic anisotropy of metal complexes is explored for its crucial role in the development of molecular materials for cutting-edge applications in spintronics, memory storage, and quantum computing. The challenge of achieving maximum magnetic anisotropy for paramagnetic single nickel ion sites is addressed and realized through an on-surface thermally induced planarization reaction in tetraphenylporphyrin, which maintains the nickel species in a square planar coordination environment. At the same time, the effective ligand field reduction due to the increased pi-conjugation results in a lower reactivity of the molecular species. The results herein reported showcase the synergy between magnetic anisotropy and chemical robustness in single-site magnetic materials, thus opening exciting prospects for the development of stable uniaxial anisotropy in these materials. Such a finding represents a relevant advance in the field and validates a protocol for exploring magnetic anisotropy in metal complexes.
   The findings herein reported highlight the role played by planarization in quenching the reactivity and preserving the magnetic anisotropy. The effect is associated with the weakening of the ligand field, which accompanies the pi-conjugation increase.

TI Computational Study of Photosynthetic Pigments: Toward Synthetic
   Photosynthesis Engineering
SO INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Chlorophyll is a widely known photosynthetic pigment in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, along with bacteriochlorophyll in some photosynthetic bacteria. The pigments consist of tetrapyrrole structures that carry a single magnesium atom at the center. They play important parts in the light-harvesting process in photosynthesis. This study aimed to characterize and compare the electronic profiles of chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll pigments by using in silico computational approaches, such as density functional theory (DFT), electronic transfer property analysis, and protein-pigment interaction studies via molecular docking. The results showed that chlorophylls a, b, and c have the highest energy gaps at the ground state DFT. For bacteriochlorophylls, bacteriochlorophylls g and b have the highest energy gaps. The time-dependent DFT and the follow-up calculations, including extinction coefficient, tunneling rate, and coherence time, indicated bacteriochlorophyll g as a highly promising and efficient pigment. Additionally, chlorophyll c and bacteriochlorophylls c and d showed the strongest binding affinities with the chlorophyll-binding protein of plant photosystem II. This study provides a comprehensive and replicable computational pipeline for pigment profiling, advancing future synthetic photosynthesis designs through combined quantum and synthetic biology insights.

TI Molecular formations and spectra due to electron correlations in
   three-electron hybrid double-well qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We show that systematic full configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations enable prediction of the energy spectra and the intrinsic spatial and spin structures of the many-body wave functions as a function of the detuning parameter for the case of three-electron hybrid qubits based on GaAs asymmetric double quantum dots. Specifically, in comparison with the case of weak interactions and treating the entire three-electron double-dot hybrid qubit as an integral unit, it is shown that the predicted spectroscopic patterns, originating from strong electron correlations, manifest the formation of Wigner molecules (WMs). Signatures of WM formation include: (1) a strong suppression of the energy gaps relative to the noninteracting-electron modeling, and (2) the appearance of a pair of avoided crossings arising between states associated with two-electron occupancies in the left and right wells. The Wigner molecule is a physical entity associated with electron localization within each well, and it cannot be captured by the previously employed independent-particle or two-site-Hubbard theoretical modeling of the hybrid qubits. The emergence of strong WMs is investigated in depth through the concerted use of FCI-adapted diagnostic tools like charge and spin densities, as well as conditional probability distributions. Furthermore, the energy spectrum as a function of the strength of the Coulomb repulsion (at constant detuning) is calculated in order to complement the thorough analysis of the factors contributing to WM emergence. We report remarkable agreement with recent experimental measurements. The present FCI methodology for multiwell quantum dots can be straightforwardly extended to treat valleytronic two-band Si/SiGe hybrid qubits, where the central role of the WMs was confirmed recently. Such valleytronic FCI could be also adapted and employed in simulations of Si-based two-qubit logical gates made of two interacting double-quantum-dot hybrid qubits confining a total of N <= 6 electrons.

TI Electron-mediated entanglement of two distant macroscopic ferromagnets
   within a nonequilibrium spintronic device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Using the nascent concept of quantum spin -transfer torque [A. Zholud et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 257201 (2017); M. D. Petrovic ' et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 021062 (2021)], we demonstrate that a current pulse can be harnessed to entangle quantum localized spins of two spatially separated ferromagnets (FMs) which are initially unentangled. The envisaged setup is composed of a spin-polarizer (FMp) and a spin -analyzer (FMa) FM layers separated by a normal metal (NM) spacer. The injection of a current pulse into the device leads to a time -dependent superposition of many -body states characterized by a high degree of entanglement between the spin degrees of freedom of the two distant FM layers. The nonequilibrium dynamics are due to the transfer of spin angular momentum from itinerant electrons to the localized spins via a quantum spin -torque mechanism that remains active even for collinear but antiparallel arrangements of the FMp and FMa magnetizations (a situation in which the conventional spin torque is absent). We quantify the mixed -state entanglement generated between the FM layers by tracking the time evolution of the full density matrix and analyzing the build-up of the mutual logarithmic negativity over time. The effect of decoherence and dissipation in the FM layers due to coupling to bosonic baths at finite temperature, the use of multielectron current pulses, and the dependence on the number of spins are also considered in an effort to ascertain the robustness of our predictions under realistic conditions. Finally, we propose a "current-pump-x-ray-probe" scheme, utilizing ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy, that can witness nonequilibrium and transient entanglement of the FM layers by extracting its time -dependent quantum Fisher information.

TI Nonequilibrium Full Counting Statistics and Symmetry-Resolved
   Entanglement from Space-Time Duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Owing to its probabilistic nature, a measurement process in quantum mechanics produces a distribution of possible outcomes. This distribution-or its Fourier transform known as full counting statistics (FCS)- contains much more information than say the mean value of the measured observable, and accessing it is sometimes the only way to obtain relevant information about the system. In fact, the FCS is the limit of an even more general family of observables-the charged moments-that characterize how quantum entanglement is split in different symmetry sectors in the presence of a global symmetry. Here we consider the evolution of the FCS and of the charged moments of a U(1) charge truncated to a finite region after a global quantum quench. For large scales these quantities take a simple large-deviation form, showing two different regimes as functions of time: while for times much larger than the size of the region they approach a stationary value set by the local equilibrium state, for times shorter than region size they show a nontrivial dependence on time. We show that, whenever the initial state is also U(1) symmetric, the leading order in time of FCS and charged moments in the out-of-equilibrium regime can be determined by means of a space-time duality. Namely, it coincides with the stationary value in the system where the roles of time and space are exchanged. We use this observation to find some general properties of FCS and charged moments out of equilibrium, and to derive an exact expression for these quantities in interacting integrable models. We test this expression against exact results in the Rule 54 quantum cellular automaton and exact numerics in the XXZ spin-1=2 chain.

TI Identity-Based Unidirectional Collusion-Resistant Proxy Re-Encryption
   from U-LWE
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Identity-based proxy re-encryption (IB-PRE) converts the ciphertext encrypted under the delegator's identity to the one encrypted under the delegatee's identity through a semitrusted proxy without leaking delegator's private key and the underlying plaintext. At present, the security of most IB-PRE schemes relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm solution or large integer decomposition and cannot resist attacks of the quantum algorithms. The majority of the IB-PRE schemes over lattice are secure only in the random oracle model. Aiming at such problems, the paper constructs a secure IB-PRE scheme over lattice in the standard model. In the scheme, the underlying encryption scheme proposed by Gentry et al. in EUROCRYPT 2010 is adopted to reduce the storage space of ciphertext. The proposed scheme is unidirectional collusion-resistant multihop and anonymous, and it is semantically secure against selective identity and chosen plaintext attack based on Decisional Learning With Errors with uniformly distributed errors (D-U-LWE) hard problem in the standard model.

SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Quantum metrology, such as quantum phase estimation, can surpass classical sensing limits, reaching the Heisenberg-scaling precision. So far, this kind of metrology has been thought to be only implementable with the quantum systems, which, however, are fragile to environmental noise and hardly contribute to the practical detections. Herein, it is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the parameter encoded by the optical phase can also be estimated at the Heisenberg scaling in classical optics. Inspired by the quantum-entanglement-enhanced sensing scheme, the estimation is performed by using classically correlated beams as probes, and obtaining the probes readout after their interaction with the target system. Because the correlated beams considered are spatially separable, a distributed phase estimation scheme is given, which can sense the linear combinations of the phase shifts induced by distinct systems. The results of our experiments show an error reduction up to 3.89 dB below the classical limit when the correlated beam number for probing is 6, approaching the Heisenberg limit. Compared with quantum strategies, the proposal shows a better robustness against the environmental disturbance and keeps their performances even when the correlated beam number is relatively large. Hence, it indicates promising practical applications in the future.
   Herein, it is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally for the first time that the parameter encoded by the optical phase can also be estimated at the Heisenberg scaling in classical optics. Compared with quantum-enhanced measurement, this classical scheme shows robustness to ambient noise. This work indicates promising practical applications in the future.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI QuanBioTrust: a quantum-enhanced bio-inspired trust framework for
   next-generation WBANs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) face critical challenges in achieving energy efficiency, security, and real-time reliability for continuous biomedical monitoring, as conventional protocols are hindered by energy constraints, vulnerability to cyberattacks, and high latency. To address these limitations, this paper proposes QuanBioTrust, a novel, integrated framework that fuses quantum-enhanced optimization, bio-inspired intelligence, and a dynamic zero-trust security model to create a scalable, secure, and self-sustaining WBAN architecture. QuanBioTrust leverages Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) with quantum entanglement to optimize cluster head (CH) selection by concurrently evaluating residual energy, sink proximity, trust score, and bio-energy harvesting potential (20-50 mu W), reducing computational complexity to similar to 500 operations per round, a 28-45% improvement over HCEL (similar to 700 ops) and EGWO (similar to 1000 ops). Inspired by natural systems, the framework employs flocking algorithms for mobility-adaptive clustering, firefly synchronization for efficient multi-hop fractal routing (3-5 paths), and slime mold-inspired data fusion to achieve 50-70% compression of ECG packets (200-bit -> 80-bit), drastically reducing transmission energy. The framework maintains a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 97% under normal conditions (90% under attack) and an end-to-end latency of 48 ms (185 ms under attack), well below the 250 ms threshold for real-time monitoring, outperforming EAFST (1000/1200 ms) and rivaling EDC-ER (50/180 ms). This quantum-biological fusion establishes a new paradigm for next-generation WBANs, offering a robust, energy-efficient, and resilient solution for secure, long-term, real-time healthcare monitoring.

TI Bayesian evaluation of multi-grade damage efficiency of ammunition using
   multi-stage binomial distribution
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS
AB In modern information warfare, the assessment of ammunition lethality has evolved from singledimensional evaluations of hit accuracy to multidimensional, multiphase analyses of damage effectiveness. However, exorbitant-tech munition testing is hindered by exorbitant costs, limited sample sizes, and significant uncertainty, rendering traditional binomial or multinomial probability models inadequate. These conventional models either oversimplify damage states (compromising accuracy) or introduce prohibitive computational complexity (impeding practical application). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Bayesian multi-stage binomial modeling approach for multi-level damage assessment under small-sample conditions. The multinomial representation of discrete damage categories is decomposed into a series of conditional binomial distributions aligned with progressive thresholds ("mild or above","moderate or above", "severe or above", and "complete destruction"), thereby enables low-dimensional modeling without sacrificing damage granularity, significantly enhancing computational tractability. To construct robust prior distributions, physical simulation results and expert domain knowledge are fused using Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. The reliability of this fused information is further validated via a consistency test that integrates the Riemannian manifold of Fisher information and quantum entanglement entropy-mitigating subjectivity biases inherent in expert judgments Leveraging conjugate prior properties and Gibbs sampling within the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, the posterior distribution of each damage level is obtained with exorbitant precision despite limited data availability. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior convergence stability, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency over conventional binomial and multinomial approaches, provides a more comprehensive and precise tool for evaluating ammunition damage effectiveness, with direct implications for operational decision-making in information warfare.

TI Photon counting of extreme ultraviolet high harmonics using a
   superconducting nanowire single-photon detector
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB Laser-driven light sources in the extreme ultraviolet range (EUV) enable nanoscopic imaging with unique label-free elemental contrast. However, to fully exploit the unique properties of these new sources, novel detection schemes need to be developed. Here, we show in a proof-of-concept experiment that superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) can be utilized to enable photon counting of a laser-driven EUV source based on high harmonic generation (HHG). These detectors are dark-count free and accommodate very high count rates-a perfect match for high repetition rate HHG sources. In addition to the advantages of SNSPDs for classical imaging applications with laser-driven EUV sources, the ability to count single photons paves the way for very promising applications in quantum optics and quantum imaging with high energetic radiation like, e.g., quantum ghost imaging with nanoscale resolution.

TI CDMRNet: multimodal meta-adaptive reasoning network with dynamic causal
   modeling and co-evolution of quantum states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Cross-modal reasoning tasks face persistent challenges such as cross-modal inference of causal dependencies with coarse-grained, weak resistance to noise, and weak interaction of spatial-temporal features. To address these issues, the article proposes a dynamic causal-aware collaborative quantum state evolution multimodal reasoning architecture, Causal-aware Dynamic Multimodal Reasoning Network (CDMRNet). The innovation of the model is reflected in the design of the following three-stage progressive linkage architecture of dynamic causal discovery-quantum state fusion-meta-adaptive reasoning: (1) causal discovery module based on differentiable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is used to dynamically identify causal structures between modes, thus solving the problem of coarse dependency granularity; (2) fusion modules inspired by quantum entanglement utilize controlled phase gates to enhance semantic coherence between modalities in Hilbert space, leading to enhanced environmental robustness; (3) meta-adaptive inference mechanism achieves zero-sample adaptation and enhances multi-scale memory to improve the spatio-temporal feature interaction accuracy of the model. To evaluate its performance, the study conducts extensive experiments across three datasets: Visual Genome, MIMIC-CXR, and nuScenes. CDMRNet achieves 89.7% accuracy on Visual Genome, improves F1 score to 84.1%, and shows 3.9% performance drop only under modal absence, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of each module, particularly the quantum state fusion which contributes to a QED score of 73.0%, evidencing effective cross-modal entanglement. These results validate that CDMRNet not only strengthens causal reasoning, but also improves robustness and generalization in quantum-inspired multimodal systems.

TI Entanglement between microwave fields and squeezing of the optical
   output field in an opto-magnomechanical ring cavity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a scheme to generate entanglement between microwave fields and achieve strong squeezing of the optical output field in an opto-magnomechanical ring cavity. The system consists of two elastic yttrium iron garnet crystals with attached mirror pads inside two separate microwave cavities, and an extra fixed mirror outside the microwave cavities is utilized to complete the optical ring cavity with the two mirror pads. A magnon mode supported by the yttrium iron garnet crystal couples directly to the microwave cavity mode via magnetic dipole interaction and couples indirectly to the optical cavity mode via magnomechanical displacement, which is caused by magnetostrictive interaction and also couples the magnon mode to a phonon mode. A squeezed light is fed into the ring cavity to entangle the two phonon modes. To activate the beam splitter interaction, each magnon mode and optical cavity mode is driven by a strong red-detuned driving field. Consequently, the stationary entanglement between the two microwave cavities is obtained. The transfer efficiency of the entanglement is \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$41\%$$\end{document}. To ensure the squeezing of the magnon mode generated by magnetostrictive interaction transferred into the optical field, we remove two microwave cavities. The squeezing of the optical output field can reach up to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim \!\! 30$$\end{document} dB at 10 mK and survives up to an environmental temperature about 500 mK. Our scheme may find various useful applications in quantum wireless fidelity network and the enhancement of sensitivity of measurements.

TI Numerically Exact Solution for a Real Polaritonic System under
   Vibrational Strong Coupling in Thermodynamic Equilibrium: Loss of
   Light-Matter Entanglement and Enhanced Fluctuations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The first numerically exact simulation of a full ab initio molecular quantum system (HD+) under strong ro-vibrational coupling to a quantized optical cavity mode in thermal equilibrium is presented. Theoretical challenges in describing strongly coupled systems of mixed quantum statistics (bosons and Fermions) are discussed and circumvented by the specific choice of our molecular system. Our numerically exact simulations highlight the absence of zero temperature for the strongly coupled matter and light subsystems, due to cavity-induced noncanonical conditions. Furthermore, we explore the temperature dependency of light-matter quantum entanglement, which emerges for the ground state but is quickly lost already in the deep cryogenic regime. This is in contrast to predictions from the Jaynes-Cummings model, which is the standard starting point to model collective strong-coupling chemistry phenomenologically. Moreover, we find that the fluctuations of matter remain modified by the quantum nature of the thermal and vacuum-field fluctuations for significant temperatures, e.g., at ambient conditions. These observations (loss of entanglement and coupling to quantum fluctuations) have implications for the understanding and control of polaritonic chemistry and materials science, since a semiclassical theoretical description of light-matter interaction becomes reasonable, but the typical (classical) canonical equilibrium assumption for the nuclear subsystem remains violated. This opens the door for quantum fluctuation-induced stochastic resonance phenomena under vibrational strong coupling, which have been suggested as a plausible theoretical mechanism to explain the experimentally observed resonance phenomena in the absence of periodic driving that has not yet been fully understood.

TI Optical phase singularities: Physical nature, manifestations and
   applications
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Over the past 30 years, physical optics has been enriched by the appearance of singular optics as a new branch approved in scientific classifiers. This review briefly outlines the main concepts of the singular optics, their role in physical research and applications, and prospects of further development. The wave singularities are considered as a sort of structured-light elements and analyzed based on the generic example of screw wavefront dislocation (optical vortex). Their specific topological and mechanical properties associated with the transverse energy circulation are discussed. Peculiar features of the non-linear optical phenomena with singular fields are exhibited, with the special attention to generation of multidimensional entangled quantum states of photons. Optical fields with multiple singularities, especially, the stochastic speckle fields, are discussed in the context of optical diagnostics of random scattering objects. The exact and approximate correspondences between characteristic parameters of the optical-field intensity and phase distributions are analyzed with the aim of recovering phase information from the intensity measurements ( "phase problem " solution). Rational singularity-based approaches to informative measurements of the scattered-field distribution are discussed, as well as their employment for the objects' diagnostics. In particular, the practical instruments are described for the high-precision rough-surface testing. Possible enhancements of the singular-optics ideas and concepts in a wider context, including the transformation optics, near-field optics (surface waves), partially-coherent fields, and wave fields of other physical nature, are briefly exposed.

TI Distinguishing phases via non-Markovian dynamics of entanglement in
   topological quantum codes under parallel magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the static and the dynamical behavior of localizable entanglement and its lower bounds on nontrivial loops of topological quantum codes with parallel magnetic field. Exploiting the connection between the stabilizer states and graph states in the absence of the parallel field and external noise, we identify a specific measurement basis, referred to as the canonical measurement basis, that optimizes localizable entanglement when measurement is restricted to single-qubit Pauli measurements only, thereby providing a lower bound. In situations where computing even the lower bound is difficult, we propose an approximation of the lower bound that can be computed for larger systems according to the computational resource in hand. Additionally, we compute a lower bound of the localizable entanglement that can be computed by determining the expectation value of an appropriately designed witness operator. We investigate the behavior of these lower bounds in the vicinity of the topological to nontopological quantum phase transition of the system, and perform a finite-size scaling analysis. We also investigate the dynamical features of these lower bounds when the system is subjected to Markovian or non-Markovian single-qubit dephasing noise. We find that in the case of the non-Markovian dephasing noise, at large time, the canonical measurement-based lower bound oscillates with a larger amplitude when the initial state of the system undergoing dephasing dynamics is chosen from the nontopological phase, compared to the same for an initial state from the topological phase. On the other hand, repetitive collapses followed by revivals to high value with time are observed for the proposed witness-based lower bound in the nontopological phase, which is absent in the topological phase. These features can be utilized to distinguish the topological phase of the system from the nontopological phase in the presence of dephasing noise.

TI Detecting single photons is not always necessary to evidence
   interference of photon probability amplitudes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Subtracting accidental coincidences is a common practice in quantum optics experiments. For zero mean Gaussian states, such as a squeezed vacuum, we show that if one removes accidental coincidences, the measurement results are quantitatively the same for both photon coincidences at very low flux and intensity covariances. Consequently, pure quantum effects at the photon level, like interference of photon wave functions or photon bunching, are reproduced in the correlation of fluctuations of macroscopic beams issued from spontaneous down-conversion. This is true both in experiment if the detection resolution is smaller than the coherence cell (size of the mode) and in stochastic simulations based on sampling the Wigner function. We also discuss the limitations of this correspondence, such as Bell inequalities (for which one cannot subtract accidental coincidences), highly multimode situations such as quantum imaging, and higher-order correlations.

TI Climbing to the Top of the ATLAS 13 TeV data
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The large amount of data recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to 140 fb(-1) of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of root s = 13 TeV, has brought our knowledge of the top quark to a higher level. The measurement of the top-antitop quark pair-production cross-section has reached a precision of 1.8% and the cross-section was measured differentially up to several TeV in multiple observables including the top-quark transverse momentum and top-quark-pair invariant mass. Single-top-quark production was studied in all production modes. Rare production processes where the top quark is associated with a vector boson, and four-top-quark production, have become accessible and cross-section measurements for several of these processes have reached uncertainties of around 10% or smaller. Innovative measurements of the top-quark mass and properties have also emerged, including the observation of quantum entanglement in the top-quark sector and tests of lepton-flavour universality using top-quark decays. Searches for flavour-changing neutral currents in the top-quark sector have been significantly improved, reaching branchingratio exclusion limits ranging from 10(-3) to 10(-5). Many of these analyses have been used to set limits on Wilson coefficients within the effective field theory framework. (c) 2024 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration.

TI Effect of Finite-Sized Optical Components and Pixels on Light-Field
   Imaging through Correlated Light
SO SENSORS
AB Diffraction-limited light-field imaging has been recently achieved by exploiting light spatial correlations measured on two high-resolution detectors. As in conventional light-field imaging, the typical operations of refocusing and 3D reconstruction are based on ray tracing in a geometrical optics context, and are thus well defined in the ideal case, both conceptually and theoretically. However, some properties of the measured correlation function are influenced by experimental features such as the finite size of apertures, detectors, and pixels. In this work, we take into account realistic experimental conditions and analyze the resulting correlation function through theory and simulation. We also provide an expression to evaluate the pixel-limited resolution of the refocused images, as well as a strategy for eliminating artifacts introduced by the finite size of the optical elements.

TI High-order continuous-variable coherence of phase-dependent squeezed
   state
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We study continuous variable coherence of phase-dependent squeezed state based on an extended Hanbury Brown-Twiss scheme. High-order coherence is continuously varied by adjusting squeezing parameter r, displacement alpha, and squeezing phase theta. We also analyze effects of background noise gamma and detection efficiency eta on the measurements. As the squeezing phase shifts from 0 to pi, the photon statistics of the squeezed state continuously change from the anti-bunching (g((n)) < 1) to super-bunching (g((n)) > n!) which shows a transition from particle nature to wave nature. The experiment feasibility is also examined. It provides a practical method to generate phase-dependent squeezed states with high-order continuous-variable coherence by tuning squeezing phase theta. The controllable coherence source can be applied to sensitivity improvement in gravitational wave detection and quantum imaging.

TI Deep learning framework based on ITOC optimization for coal spontaneous
   combustion temperature prediction: a coupled CNN-BiGRU-CBAM model
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Coal spontaneous combustion (CSC) poses a significant safety hazard in coal mines, requiring effective prevention and control strategies. Accurate temperature prediction, crucial for assessing coal oxidation stages and combustion risk, underpins early warning systems. This study analyzes programmed heating experimental data from Dongtan Mine coal samples and integrates the coal oxidation-pyrolysis coupled reaction mechanism. Pearson correlation analysis identified six key gas indicators-O-2, CO, C2H4, CO/Delta O-2, C2H4/C2H6, and C2H6-highly correlated with spontaneous combustion temperature. Based on these variables, a deep learning framework combining an Improved Tornado Optimization with Coriolis force (ITOC) strategy and a CNN-BiGRU-CBAM model is proposed. The ITOC algorithm incorporates cubic chaotic mapping initialization, quantum entanglement, and Coriolis force perturbation to enhance global optimization. Comparative experiments with five heuristic algorithms demonstrate ITOC's superior accuracy and convergence stability. Key CNN-BiGRU-CBAM hyperparameters-learning rate, BiGRU neuron count, and convolutional kernel size-were jointly optimized by ITOC, resulting in optimal values of 0.0093, 108 neurons, and 8.54, respectively. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets at an 8:2:1 ratio. Performance evaluation against benchmark models shows the proposed framework achieves a test set R2 of 0.9738, MAPE of 4.1254%, MAE of 6.2740, and RMSE of 12.4735. Validation on coal faces in Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi mines confirmed strong generalization and engineering adaptability, with predicted temperature ranges closely matching measurements. The ITOC-CNN-BiGRU-CBAM model offers a promising theoretical and practical approach for intelligent early warning and precise prevention of CSC hazards.

TI What if consciousness is not an emergent property of the brain?
   Observational and empirical challenges to materialistic models
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The nature of consciousness is considered one of science's most perplexing and persistent mysteries. We all know the subjective experience of consciousness, but where does it arise? What is its purpose? What are its full capacities? The assumption within today's neuroscience is that all aspects of consciousness arise solely from interactions among neurons in the brain. However, the origin and mechanisms of qualia (i.e., subjective or phenomenological experience) are not understood. David Chalmers coined the term "the hard problem" to describe the difficulties in elucidating the origins of subjectivity from the point of view of reductive materialism. We propose that the hard problem arises because one or more assumptions within a materialistic worldview are either wrong or incomplete. If consciousness entails more than the activity of neurons, then we can contemplate new ways of thinking about the hard problem. This review examines phenomena that apparently contradict the notion that consciousness is exclusively dependent on brain activity, including phenomena where consciousness appears to extend beyond the physical brain and body in both space and time. The mechanisms underlying these "non-local" properties are vaguely suggestive of quantum entanglement in physics, but how such effects might manifest remains highly speculative. The existence of these non-local effects appears to support the proposal that post-materialistic models of consciousness may be required to break the conceptual impasse presented by the hard problem of consciousness.

TI Spatial Isolation Implies Zero Knowledge Even in a Quantum World
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACM
AB Zero knowledge plays a central role in cryptography and complexity. The seminal work of Ben-Or et al. (STOC 1988) shows that zero knowledge can be achieved unconditionally for any language in NEXP, as long as one is willing to make a suitable physical assumption: if the provers are spatially isolated, then they can be assumed to be playing independent strategies.
   Quantum mechanics, however, tells us that this assumption is unrealistic, because spatially-isolated provers could share a quantum entangled state and realize a non-local correlated strategy. The MIP* model captures this setting.
   In this work, we study the following question: Does spatial isolation still suffice to unconditionally achieve zero knowledge even in the presence of quantum entanglement?
   We answer this question in the affirmative: we prove that every language in NEXP has a 2-prover zero knowledge interactive proof that is sound against entangled provers; that is, NEXP subset of ZK-MIP*.
   Our proof consists of constructing a zero knowledge interactive probabilistically checkable proof with a strong algebraic structure, and then lifting it to the MIP* model. This lifting relies on a new framework that builds on recent advances in low-degree testing against entangled strategies, and clearly separates classical and quantum tools.
   Our main technical contribution is the development of new algebraic techniques for obtaining unconditional zero knowledge; this includes a zero knowledge variant of the celebrated sumcheck protocol, a key building block in many probabilistic proof systems. A core component of our sumcheck protocol is a new algebraic commitment scheme, whose analysis relies on algebraic complexity theory.

TI Schrieffer-Wolff transformations for experiments: Dynamically
   suppressing virtual doublon-hole excitations in a Fermi-Hubbard
   simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In strongly interacting systems with a separation of energy scales, low-energy effective Hamiltonians help provide insights into the relevant physics at low temperatures. The emergent interactions in the effective model are mediated by virtual excitations of high-energy states: For example, virtual doublon-hole excitations in the Fermi-Hubbard model mediate antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions in the derived effective model, known as the t - J - 3s model. Formally this procedure is described by performing a unitary Schrieffer-Wolff basis transformation. In the context of quantum simulation, it can be advantageous to consider the effective model to interpret experimental results. However, virtual excitations such as doublon-hole pairs can obfuscate the measurement of physical observables. Here we show that quantum simulators allow one to access the effective model even more directly by performing measurements in a rotated basis. We propose a protocol to perform a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation on Fermi-Hubbard low-energy eigenstates (or thermal states) to dynamically prepare approximate t - J - 3s model states using fermionic atoms in an optical lattice. Our protocol involves performing a linear ramp of the optical lattice depth, which is slow enough to eliminate the virtual doublon-hole fluctuations but fast enough to freeze out the dynamics in the effective model. We perform a numerical study using exact diagonalization and find an optimal ramp speed for which the state after the lattice ramp has maximal overlap with the t - J - 3s model state. We compare our numerics to experimental data from our Lithium-6 fermionic quantum gas microscope and show a proof-of-principle demonstration of this protocol. More generally, this protocol can be beneficial to studies of effective models by enabling the suppression of virtual excitations in a wide range of quantum simulation experiments.

TI A superconducting quantum processor architecture design method for
   improving performance and reducing frequency collisions
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB More physical qubits and qubit connections integrated on a superconducting quantum processor can improve the ability to execute quantum programs, but on the other hand, they might increase the probability of frequency collisions. Considering a performance and frequency collisions trade-off, it is a feasible method to optimize processor architecture aiming at running specific quantum programs. To this end, we propose a method for designing superconducting quantum processor architectures for the purpose of running specific quantum programs. Different from existing methods, our method is mainly based on graph theory to optimize processor architecture design. First, we convert the trade-off problem into the optimization of the distance between two points as well as the maximum degree in the processor architecture graph. Second, we consider the actual physical routing constraints and build a mathematical model for the optimization problem. Finally, we propose an automatic processor architecture design flow based on the mathematical model, which is implemented with an improved genetic algorithm. To show the effectiveness of our method, we selected sixteen quantum programs with different qubit numbers and different functions for comparison. Simulation results show that the architecture schemes of our method outperform IBM's general-purpose square lattice architecture schemes. Compared to the general-purpose architecture schemes, the architecture schemes of our method have an average performance improvement of 15.61% and a minimum reduction of 21.33% in the probability of frequency collisions. Furthermore, in most of the selected quantum programs, our architecture schemes perform better than the eff-5-freq's architecture schemes, with an average 6.58% improvement in performance and a minimum 6.45% reduction in the probability of frequency collisions. Therefore, our method can provide superconducting quantum processor architecture design with better performance and lower probability of frequency collisions for quantum programs.

TI Refocusing Algorithm for Correlation Plenoptic Imaging
SO SENSORS
AB Correlation plenoptic imaging (CPI) is a technique capable of acquiring the light field emerging from a scene of interest, namely, the combined information of intensity and propagation direction of light. This is achieved by evaluating correlations between the photon numbers measured by two high-resolution detectors. Volumetric information about the object of interest is decoded, through data analysis, from the measured four-dimensional correlation function. In this paper, we investigate the relevant aspects of the refocusing algorithm, a post-processing method that isolates the image of a selected transverse plane within the 3D scene, once applied to the correlation function. In particular, we aim at bridging the gap between existing literature, which only deals with refocusing algorithms in case of continuous coordinates, and the experimental reality, in which the correlation function is available as a discrete quantity defined on the sensors pixels.

TI Quantum-limited imaging of a nanomechanical resonator with a spatial
   mode sorter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We explore the use of a spatial mode sorter to image a nanomechanical resonator, with the goal of studying the quantum limits of active imaging and extending the toolbox for optomechanical force sensing. In our experiment, we reflect a Gaussian laser beam from a vibrating nanoribbon and pass the reflected beam through a commercial spatial mode demultiplexer (Cailabs Proteus). The intensity in each demultiplexed channel depends on the mechanical modeshapes and encodes information about their displacement amplitudes. As a concrete demonstration, we monitor the angular displacement of the ribbon's fundamental torsion mode by illuminating in the fundamental Hermite-Gauss mode (HG00) and reading out in the HG10 mode. We show that this technique permits readout of the ribbon's torsional vibration with a precision near the quantum limit. Our results highlight new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and quantum optomechanics.

TI Nonvolatile programmable silicon photonics using an ultralow-loss
   Sb2Se3 phase change material
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The next generation of silicon-based photonic processors and neural and quantum networks need to be adaptable, reconfigurable, and programmable. Phase change technology offers proven nonvolatile electronic programmability; however, the materials used to date have shown prohibitively high optical losses, which are incompatible with integrated photonic platforms. Here, we demonstrate the capability of the previously unexplored material Sb2Se3 for ultralow-loss programmable silicon photonics. The favorable combination of large refractive index contrast and ultralow losses seen in Sb2Se3 facilitates an unprecedented optical phase control exceeding 10 pi radians in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. To demonstrate full control over the flow of light, we introduce nanophotonic digital patterning as a previously unexplored conceptual approach with a footprint orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art interferometer meshes. Our approach enables a wealth of possibilities in high-density reconfiguration of optical functionalities on silicon chip.

TI Electronic Quantum Materials Simulated with Artificial Model Lattices
SO ACS NANOSCIENCE AU
AB The band structure and electronic properties of a material are defined by the sort of elements, the atomic registry in the crystal, the dimensions, the presence of spin-orbit coupling, and the electronic interactions. In natural crystals, the interplay of these factors is difficult to unravel, since it is usually not possible to vary one of these factors in an independent way, keeping the others constant. In other words, a complete understanding of complex electronic materials remains challenging to date. The geometry of two- and one-dimensional crystals can be mimicked in artificial lattices. Moreover, geometries that do not exist in nature can be created for the sake of further insight. Such engineered artificial lattices can be better controlled and fine-tuned than natural crystals. This makes it easier to vary the lattice geometry, dimensions, spin-orbit coupling, and interactions independently from each other. Thus, engineering and characterization of artificial lattices can provide unique insights. In this Review, we focus on artificial lattices that are built atom-by-atom on atomically flat metals, using atomic manipulation in a scanning tunneling microscope. Cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy allows for consecutive creation, microscopic characterization, and band-structure analysis by tunneling spectroscopy, amounting in the analogue quantum simulation of a given lattice type. We first review the physical elements of this method. We then discuss the creation and characterization of artificial atoms and molecules. For the lattices, we review works on honeycomb and Lieb lattices and lattices that result in crystalline topological insulators, such as the Kekule and "breathing" kagome lattice. Geometric but nonperiodic structures such as electronic quasi-crystals and fractals are discussed as well. Finally, we consider the option to transfer the knowledge gained back to real materials, engineered by geometric patterning of semiconductor quantum wells.

TI Decodable hybrid dynamics of open quantum systems with Z2 symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We explore a class of "open" quantum circuit models with local decoherence ("noise") and local projective measurements, each respecting a global Z2 symmetry. The model supports a spin-glass phase where the Z2 symmetry is spontaneously broken [not possible in an equilibrium one-dimensional (1D) system], a paramagnetic phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate "trivial" phase. All three phases are also stable to Z2-symmetric local unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified by explicitly introducing a bath with its own "scrambling" dynamics, which does not change any of the universal physics. Within the spin-glass phase the circuit dynamics can be interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code measured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin-glass phase, we devise a decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and the ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final state. For a circuit with Ld qubits running for time T, the time needed to execute the decoder scales as O(LdT) (with dimensionality d). With this decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit state can be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1D circuit, and for a time at least linear in L in two dimensions below a finite-error threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare and contrast our decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the random bond Ising model.

TI su(d)-squeezing and many-body entanglement geometry in
   finite-dimensional systems
SO QUANTUM
AB Generalizing the well-known spin-squeezing inequalities, we study the relation between squeezing of collective N-particle su(d) operators and many-body entanglement geometry in multi-particle systems. For that aim, we define the set of pseudo-separable states, which are mixtures of products of single-particle states that lie in the (d2 1)-dimensional Bloch sphere but are not necessarily positive semidefinite. We obtain a set of necessary conditions for states of N qudits to be of the above form. Any state that violates these conditions is entangled. We also define a corresponding su(d)-squeezing parameter that can be used to detect entanglement in large particle ensembles. Geometrically, this set of conditions defines a convex set of points in the space of first and second moments of the collective N-particle su(d) operators. We prove that, in the limit N >> 1, such set is filled by pseudo-separable states, while any state corresponding to a point outside of this set is necessarily entangled. We also study states that are detected by these inequalities: We show that states with a bosonic symmetry are detected if and only if the two-body reduced state violates the positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion. On the other hand, highly mixed states states close to the su(d) singlet are detected which have a separable two-body reduced state and are also PPT with respect to all possible bipartitions. We also provide numerical examples of thermal equilibrium states that are detected by our set of inequalities, comparing the spin-squeezing inequalities with the su(3)-squeezing inequalities.

TI Topological edge states at Floquet quantum criticality
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Topologically protected edge states exactly at topological phase boundaries challenge the conventional belief that topological states must be associated with a bulk energy gap. Because periodically driven (Floquet) systems host unusually intricate topological phase boundaries, topological edge states can be prolific at such Floquet quantum criticality. Working on a class of chiral-symmetric, Floquet-driven Majorana fermion chains, we analytically and computationally show that the precise boundaries between different Floquet topological gapped phases can accommodate topological edge modes, including the so-called critical Majorana pi modes. We also identify a general bulk-edge correspondence formula to predict and understand the emergence of topological edge modes at Floquet quantum criticality. Of direct interest to quantum simulation experiments, our work opens an avenue for exploring topological physics intrinsic to nonequilibrium phase boundaries.

TI The Cosmological OTOC: A New Proposal for Quantifying Auto-Correlated
   Random Non-Chaotic Primordial Fluctuations
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The underlying physical concept of computing out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) is a significant new tool within the framework of quantum field theory, which now-a-days is treated as a measure of random fluctuations. In this paper, by following the canonical quantization technique, we demonstrate a computational method to quantify the two different types of cosmological auto-correlated OTO functions during the epoch when the non-equilibrium features dominates in primordial cosmology. In this formulation, two distinct dynamical time scales are involved to define the quantum mechanical operators arising from the cosmological perturbation scenario. We have provided detailed explanation regarding the necessity of this new formalism to quantify any random events generated from quantum fluctuations in primordial cosmology. We have performed an elaborative computation for the two types of two-point and four-point auto-correlated OTO functions in terms of the cosmological perturbation field variables and its canonically conjugate momenta to quantify random auto-correlations in the non-equilibrium regime. For both of the cases, we found significantly distinguishable non-chaotic, but random, behaviour in the OTO auto-correlations, which was not pointed out before in this type of study. Finally, we have also demonstrated the classical limiting behaviour of the mentioned two types of auto-correlated OTOC functions from the thermally weighted phase-space averaged Poisson brackets, which we found to exactly match the large time limiting behaviour of the auto-correlations in the super-horizon regime of the cosmological scalar mode fluctuation.

We investigate the fault-tolerant logical gates of the Z 2 toric code in this setup, which corresponds to e <-> m exchanging symmetry of the underlying Z 2 gauge theory. We find that nonorientable geometry provides a new way for the emergent symmetry to act on the code space, and discover the new realization of the fault-tolerant Hadamard gate of the two-dimensional surface code with a single cross cap connecting the vertices nonlocally along a slit, dubbed a nonorientable surface code. This Hadamard gate can be realized by a constant-depth local unitary circuit modulo nonlocality caused by a cross cap. Via folding, the nonorientable surface code can be turned into a bilayer local quantum code, where the folded cross cap is equivalent to a bilayer twist terminated on a gapped boundary and the logical Hadamard only contains local gates with intralayer couplings when being away from the cross cap, as opposed to the interlayer couplings on each site needed in the case of the folded surface code. We further obtain the complete logical Clifford gate set for a stack of nonorientable surface codes and similarly for codes defined on Klein-bottle geometries. We then construct the honeycomb Floquet code in the presence of a single cross cap, and find that the period of the sequential Pauli measurements acts as a HZ logical gate on the single logical qubit, where the cross cap enriches the dynamics compared with the orientable case. We find that the dynamics of the honeycomb Floquet code is precisely described by a condensation operator of the Z 2 gauge theory, and illustrate the exotic dynamics of our code in terms of a condensation operator supported at a nonorientable surface.

TI Parameterized entanglement measures based on Renyi-α entropy
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Parameterized entanglement measures have demonstrated their superiority compared with kinds of unparameterized entanglement measures. Entanglement concurrence has been widely used to describe entanglement in quantum experiments. As an entanglement measure it is related to specific quantum Renyi-alpha entropy. In the work, we propose a parameterized bipartite entanglement measure based on the general Renyi-alpha entropy, which is named alpha-logarithmic concurrence. This measure, different from existing parameterized measures, is defined first for pure states, then extended to the mixed states. Furthermore, we verify three necessary conditions for alpha-logarithmic concurrence to satisfy the entanglement measures. We show that this measure is easy to calculate for pure states. However, for mixed states, analytical calculations are only suitable for special two-qubit states or special higher-dimensional mixed states. Therefore, we devote our efforts to developing the analytical lower bound of the-logarithmic concurrence for general bipartite states. Surprisingly, this lower bound is a function on positive partial transposition criterion and realignment criterion of this mixed state. This shows the connection among the three entanglement measures. The interesting feature is that the lower bound depends on the entropy parameter associated with the detailed state. This allows us to choose appropriate parameter alpha such that G(alpha)(rho) >> 0 for experimental entanglement detection of specific state rho. Moreover, we calculate expressions of the alpha-logarithmic concurrence for isotropic states, and give a the analytic expressions for isotropic states with d = 2. Finally, the monogamy of the alpha-logarithmic concurrence is also discussed. We set up a mathematical formulation for the monogamous property in terms of alpha-logarithmic concurrence. Here we set up the functional relation between concurrence and alpha-logarithmic concurrence in two qubit systems. Then we obtain some useful properties of this function, and by combining the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality, we establish the monogamy inequality about alpha-logarithmic concurrence. We finally prove that the monogamy inequality holds true for alpha-logarithmic concurrence.

TI Topological squashed entanglement: Nonlocal order parameter for
   one-dimensional topological superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Identifying entanglement-based order parameters characterizing topological systems, in particular topological superconductors and topological insulators, has remained a major challenge for the physics of quantum matter in the last two decades. Here we show that the end-to-end, long-distance, bipartite squashed entanglement between the edges of a many-body system, defined in terms of the edge-to-edge quantum conditional mutual information, is the natural nonlocal order parameter for topological superconductors in one dimension as well as in quasi -one-dimensional geometries. For the Kitaev chain in the entire topological phase, the edge squashed entanglement is quantized to ln(2)/2, half the maximal Bell-state entanglement, and vanishes in the trivial phase. Such a topological squashed entanglement exhibits the correct scaling at the quantum phase transition, is stable in the presence of interactions, and is robust against disorder and local perturbations. Edge quantum conditional mutual information and edge squashed entanglement defined with respect to different multipartitions discriminate topological superconductors from symmetry breaking magnets, as shown by comparing the fermionic Kitaev chain and the spin-1/2 Ising model in transverse field. For systems featuring multiple topological phases with different numbers of edge modes, like the quasi-1D Kitaev ladder, topological squashed entanglement counts the number of Majorana excitations and distinguishes the different topological phases of the system. In fact, we show that the edge quantum conditional mutual information and the edge squashed entanglement remain valid detectors of topological superconductivity even for systems, like the Kitaev tie with long-range hopping, featuring geometrical frustration and a suppressed bulk-edge correspondence.

TI Dynamics of quantum correlation for three qubits in hierarchical
   environment
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Much attention has been paid to the dynamics of quantum correlation in an open quantum system coupled to a single-layered environment for a long time. However, the system can be influenced by the multilayer environment or hierarchical environment in realistic scenarios, which is attracting increasing interest at present. In this context, we explore in this paper the dynamics of quantum correlation for a quantum system consisting of three independent qubits, each being immersed in a single mode lossy cavity which is further connected to another cavity. The influences of cavity-cavity coupling strength Omega and the decay rate of cavity Gamma(1) on the measures of quantum correlation, including negativity, Bell non-locality as well as entanglement witness, are investigated in detail in a strong coupling regime and a weak coupling regime. It is shown that the phenomena of sudden death and sudden birth can happen to both Bell non-locality and entanglement witness. When the decay rate Gamma(1) = 0 is given, with the increase of Omega these measures eventually reach their stationary values over time after a short period of damping oscillations, in which these stationary values will become larger for the larger Omega. At the same time, the values or the survival times of quantum correlation considered by us in the weak coupling regime are better than in the strong coupling case. In addition, the non-zero Gamma(1) has a great negative effect on quantum correlation. Hence, in order to suppress the loss of quantum correlation better, the effective manipulation of quantum weak measurement and measurement reversal operator is considered further. Some interesting results are obtained.

TI Closing the door on the "puzzle of decoherence" of annihilation quanta
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB In positron annihilation, exploration of the polarization correlations of the emerging gamma quanta has gained interest, since they offer a possibility to improve signal-to-background in medical imaging using positron emission tomography. The annihilation quanta, which are predicted to be in an entangled state, have orthogonal polarizations and this property may be exploited to discriminate them from two uncorrelated gamma photons contributing to the background. Recent experimental studies of polarization correlations of the annihilation quanta after a prior Compton scattering of one of them, had rather different conclusions regarding the strength of the correlation after the scattering, showing its puzzling nature. The scattering was described as a decoherence process. In the present work, we perform for the first time, a study of the polarization correlations of annihilation quanta after decoherence via Compton scattering in the angular range 0 degrees - 50 degrees using single -layer gamma ray polarimeters. In addition, we compare the measured polarization correlations after Compton scattering at 30 degrees with an active and a passive scatterer element. The measured azimuthal correlation of back-to-back annihilation quanta is consistent with the Pryce-Ward formulation, as confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Further, the results indicate that the correlation, expressed in terms of the polarimetric modulation factor, shows no significant difference at small scattering angles (0 degrees - 30 degrees ) compared to the correlation measured for direct photons, while a moderate indication of a lower modulation is observed for 50 degrees scattering angle. The measured modulation is larger at all scattering angles than the one expected from the simulation of orthogonally polarized, independent annihilation quanta.

TI Highly-twisted states of light from a high quality factor photonic
   crystal ring
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Twisted light in the form of orbital angular momentum (OAM) can provide an additional spatial dimension for information transmission. Here, the authors demonstrate a prescription for OAM generation using photonic crystal ring resonators, in which high cavity quality factors (up to 10(6)) are retained.
   Twisted light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been extensively studied for applications in quantum and classical communications, microscopy, and optical micromanipulation. Ejecting high angular momentum states of a whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonator through a grating-assisted mechanism provides a scalable, chip-integrated solution for OAM generation. However, demonstrated OAM microresonators have exhibited a much lower quality factor (Q) than conventional WGM resonators (by >100x), and an understanding of the limits on Q has been lacking. This is crucial given the importance of Q in enhancing light-matter interactions. Moreover, though high-OAM states are often desirable, the limits on what is achievable in a microresonator are not well understood. Here, we provide insight on these two questions, through understanding OAM from the perspective of mode coupling in a photonic crystal ring and linking it to coherent backscattering between counter-propagating WGMs. In addition to demonstrating high-Q (10(5) to 10(6)), a high estimated upper bound on OAM ejection efficiency (up to 90%), and high-OAM number (up to l = 60), our empirical model is supported by experiments and provides a quantitative explanation for the behavior of Q and the upper bound of OAM ejection efficiency with l. The state-of-the-art performance and understanding of microresonator OAM generation opens opportunities for OAM applications using chip-integrated technologies.

TI Variational Quantum-Neural Hybrid Eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most representative quantum algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, and is generally speculated to deliver one of the first quantum advantages for the ground-state simulations of some nontrivial Hamiltonians. However, short quantum coherence time and limited availability of quantum hardware resources in the NISQ hardware strongly restrain the capacity and expressiveness of VQEs. In this Letter, we introduce the variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (VQNHE) in which the shallow-circuit quantum Ansatz can be further enhanced by classical post-processing with neural networks. We show that the VQNHE consistently and significantly outperforms the VQE in simulating ground-state energies of quantum spins and molecules given the same amount of quantum resources. More importantly, we demonstrate that, for arbitrary postprocessing neural functions, the VQNHE only incurs a polynomial overhead of processing time and represents the first scalable method to exponentially accelerate the VQE with nonunitary postprocessing that can be efficiently implemented in the NISQ era.

TI Progress toward favorable landscapes in quantum combinatorial
   optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The performance of variational quantum algorithms relies on the success of using quantum and classical computing resources in tandem. Here, we study how these quantum and classical components interrelate. In particular, we focus on algorithms for solving the combinatorial optimization problem MaxCut, and study how the structure of the classical optimization landscape relates to the quantum circuit used to evaluate the MaxCut objective function. In order to analytically characterize the impact of quantum features on the critical points of the landscape, we consider a family of quantum circuit ansatze composed of mutually commuting elements. We identify multiqubit operations as a key resource and show that overparameterization allows for obtaining favorable landscapes. Namely, we prove that an ansatz from this family containing exponentially many variational parameters yields a landscape free of local optima for generic graphs. However, we further prove that these ansatze do not offer superpolynomial advantages over purely classical MaxCut algorithms. We then present a series of numerical experiments illustrating that noncommutativity and entanglement are important features for improving algorithm performance.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Coprocessors in an Application-Centric,
   Hardware-Agnostic, and Scalable Way
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Existing protocols for benchmarking current quantum coprocessors fail to meet the usual standards for assessing the performance of high-performance-computing platforms. After a synthetic review of these protocols-whether at the gate, circuit, or application level-we introduce a newbenchmark, dubbed Atos Q-score, which is application-centric, hardware-agnostic, and scalable to quantum advantage processor sizes and beyond. The Q-score measures the maximum number of qubits that can be used effectively to solve the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. We give a robust definition of the notion of effective performance by introducing an improved approximation ratio based on the scaling of random and optimal algorithms. We illustrate the behavior of Q-score using perfect and noisy simulations of quantum processors. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of Q-score that makes it easy to compute the Q-score of any quantum hardware.

TI Phase-insensitive amplifier gain estimation at Cramer-Rao bound for
   two-mode squeezed state of light
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Phase-insensitive amplifiers (PIAs), as a class of important quantum devices, have found significant applications in the subtle manipulation of multiple quantum correlation and multipartite quantum entanglement. Gain is a very important parameter for quantifying the performance of a PIA. Its absolute value can be defined as the ratio of the output light beam power to the input light beam power, while its estimation precision has not been extensively investigated yet. Therefore, in this work, we theoretically study the estimation precision from the vacuum two-mode squeezed state (TMSS), the estimation precision of the coherent state, and the bright TMSS scenario, which has the following two advantages: it has more probe photons than the vacuum TMSS and higher estimation precision than the coherent state. The advantage in terms of estimation precision of the bright TMSS compared with the coherent state is researched. We first simulate the effect of noise from another PIA with gain M on the estimation precision of the bright TMSS, and we find that a scheme in which the PIA is placed in the auxiliary light beam path is more robust than two other schemes. Then, a fictitious beam splitter with transmission T is used to simulate the noise effects of propagation loss and imperfect detection, and the results show that a scheme in which the fictitious beam splitter is placed before the original PIA in the probe light beam path is the most robust. Finally, optimal intensity difference measurement is confirmed to be an accessible experimental technique to saturate estimation precision of the bright TMSS. Therefore, our present study opens a new avenue for quantum metrology based on PIAs.

TI Intra-Cavity Cascaded Pumped 946/1030 nm Dual-Wavelength Vortex Laser
   Using a Spot-Defect Mirror
SO PHOTONICS
AB Due to their unique properties, vortex lasers have high application value in frontier fields such as optical micromanipulation, super-resolution imaging, quantum entanglement, and optical communication. In this study, we demonstrated a 946/1030 nm Laguerre-Gaussian (LG(01)) mode dual-wavelength vortex laser by using an intracavity cascade pumped structure and a spot-defect output mirror. Using a coaxial linear cavity structure, the 808 nm laser diode (LD) was used to end-pump the Nd:YAG crystal to generate a 946 nm laser and then use it to directly pump the Yb:YAG crystal in the cavity to generate a 1030 nm laser, and finally a 946/1030 nm dual-wavelength laser came out. By making a spot defect in the center of the output mirror to suppress the oscillation of the fundamental Gaussian mode laser and carefully adjusting the position of the laser crystals, the LG(01) mode dual-wavelength vortex laser was output in single handedness. When the pump power was 40 W, the total output was 664 mW (356 and 308 mW at 946 and 1030 nm LG(01) mode vortex lasers), and the total optical-optical conversion efficiency was 1.7%; the output power fluctuations of 946 and 1030 nm LG(01) mode vortex lasers within 1 h were 3.43% and 3.13%, respectively; the beam quality factors M-2 of 946 and 1030 nm LG(01) mode vortex lasers were 2.35 and 2.40, respectively. It was proved that the generated dual-wavelength vortex laser had the wavefront phase expif by the self-interference method.

TI Variational learning algorithms for quantum query complexity
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum query complexity is pivotal in the analysis of quantum algorithms, encompassing well-known examples like search and period-finding algorithms. These algorithms typically involve a sequence of unitary operations and oracle calls dependent on an input variable. In this study, we introduce a variational learning approach to explore quantum query complexity. Our method employs an efficient parameterization of the unitary operations and utilizes a loss function derived from the algorithm's error probability. We apply this technique to various quantum query complexities, notably devising a new algorithm that resolves the 5-bit Hamming modulo problem with four queries, addressing an open question from Cornelissen et al (2021 arXiv:2112.14682). This finding is corroborated by a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach. Our numerical method exhibits superior memory efficiency compared to SDP and can identify quantum query algorithms (QQAs) that require a smaller workspace register dimension, an aspect not optimized by SDP. These advancements present a significant step forward in the practical application and understanding of QQAs.

TI Search for QCD axion dark matter with transmon qubits and quantum
   circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose a direct axion dark matter (DM) search using superconducting transmon quantum bits (qubits) as quantum sensors. With an external magnetic field applied, axion DM generates an oscillating electric field, which causes the excitation of the qubit. Such an excitation can be regarded as a signal of the axion DM. We provide a theoretical consideration of the excitation process of the qubits, taking into account the effects of the shielding cavity surrounding the qubits, and estimate the signal rate for the axion DM detection. We also discuss the enhancement of the DM signal by using cavity resonance and entangled quantum sensors realized by a quantum circuit. Combining these two effects, we can reach the parameter region suggested by QCD axion models.

TI Probing quantum chaos in multipartite systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Understanding the emergence of quantum chaos in multipartite systems is challenging in the presence of interactions. We show that the contribution of the subsystems to the global behavior can be revealed by probing the full counting statistics of the local, total, and interaction energies. As in the spectral form factor, signatures of quantum chaos in the time domain dictate a dip-ramp-plateau structure in the characteristic function, i.e., the Fourier transform of the eigenvalue distribution. With this approach, we explore the fate of chaos in interacting subsystems that are locally maximally chaotic. Global quantum chaos can be suppressed at strong coupling, as illustrated with coupled copies of random-matrix Hamiltonians and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our method is amenable to experimental implementation using single-qubit interferometry.

TI A Taxonomy of Small Markovian Errors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Errors in quantum logic gates are usually modeled by quantum process matrices (CPTP maps). But process matrices can be opaque and unwieldy. We show how to transform the process matrix of a gate into an error generator that represents the same information more usefully. We construct a basis of simple and physically intuitive elementary error generators, classify them, and show how to represent the error generator of any gate as a mixture of elementary error generators with various rates. Finally, we show how to build a large variety of reduced models for gate errors by combining elementary error generators and/or entire subsectors of generator space. We conclude with a few examples of reduced models, including one with just 9N(2) parameters that describes almost all commonly predicted errors on an N-qubit processor.

TI Quantum process in probability representation of quantum mechanics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this work, the operator-sum representation of a quantum process is extended to the probability representation of quantum mechanics. It is shown that each process admitting the operator-sum representation is assigned a kernel, convolving of which with the initial tomogram set characterizing the system state gives the tomographic state of the transformed system. This kernel, in turn, is broken into the kernels of partial operations, each of them incorporating the symbol of the evolution operator related to the joint evolution of the system and an ancillary environment. Such a kernel decomposition for the projection to a certain basis state and a Gaussian-type projection is demonstrated as well as qubit flipping and amplitude damping processes.

TI Entanglement-Free Parameter Estimation of Generalized Pauli Channels
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose a parameter estimation protocol for generalized Pauli channels acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space. The salient features of the proposed method include product probe states and measurements, the number of measurement configurations linear in d, minimal post-processing, and the scaling of the mean square error comparable to that of the entanglement-based parameter estimation scheme for generalized Pauli channels. We also show that while measuring generalized Pauli operators the errors caused by the Pauli noise can be modeled as measurement errors. This makes it possible to utilize the measurement error mitigation framework to mitigate the errors caused by the generalized Pauli channels. We use this result to mitigate noise on the probe states and recover the scaling of the noiseless probes, except with a noise strength-dependent constant factor. This method of modeling Pauli channel as measurement noise can also be of independent interest in other NISQ tasks, e.g., state tomography problems, variational quantum algorithms, and other channel estimation problems where Pauli measurements have the central role.

TI Spin Seebeck Effect as a Probe for Majorana Fermions in Kitaev Spin
   Liquids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids provide a paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient probe of the fractional quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids, focusing on the Kitaev honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using real-time dynamics, perturbation theory, and linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid via the low-energy fractional Majorana excitations. This identification underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin current with (up-) down-spin-like nature when the exchange coupling is (anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already found in a one-dimensional quantum spin liquid, our calculation reveals that the spin Seebeck effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the nature of fractional excitations in the quantum spin liquids. We also clarify contrasting field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in quantum spin liquids but also to generate and control them.

TI Integrating Categorization and Decision-Making
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB Though individual categorization or decision processes have been studied separately in many previous investigations, few studies have investigated how they interact by using a two-stage task of first categorizing and then deciding. To address this issue, we investigated a categorization-decision task in two experiments. In both, participants were shown six faces varying in width, first asked to categorize the faces, and then decide a course of action for each face. Each experiment was designed to include three groups, and for each group, we manipulated the probabilistic contingencies between stimulus, category assignments, and decision consequences. For each group, each participant received three different sequences of category response, category feedback, decision response, and decision feedback. We found that participants were only partially responsive in the appropriate directions to the contingencies assigned to each group. Comparisons of results from different sequences provided evidence for empirical interference effects of categorization on decisions. The empirical interference effect is defined as the difference between the probability of taking a hostile action in decision-alone conditions and the total probability of taking a hostile action in categorization-decision conditions. To test competing accounts for multiple empirical results, including two-stage choice probabilities and empirical interference effects, we compared a quantum cognition model versus a two-stage exemplar categorization model at both aggregate and individual levels. Using a Bayesian information criterion, we found that the quantum model provided an overall better model fit than the exemplar model. Although both models predicted empirical interference effects, the exemplar model was able to generate probabilistic deviation by incorporating category information of the first stage into the feature representation of the subsequent decision stage, while the quantum model produced interference effect by superposition, measurement, and quantum entanglement.

TI Interplay of Manganese Doping in Lead-Free
   Cs3Bi2Br9 Nanocrystals
SO ACS APPLIED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB In the pursuit of inorganic lead-free halide perovskites, bismuth-based halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) offer a nontoxic alternative with environmental stability. However, their low photoluminescence and large band gaps make them unrealistic for optoelectronic applications. The doping with transition metal ions is attractive for optoelectronics and beyond. However, the doping with magnetic ions and the exact substituting sites remain largely unexplored. In this work, we doped Mn2+ ions into lead-free two-dimensional vacancy-ordered Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals via a modified hot-injection method and deduced their impact on intrinsic structural and optoelectronic properties. The presence of Mn2+ ions is endorsed by photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, while high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping trace the atomically resolved crystal structure and chemical composition, which are validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our work substantiates the role of magnetic doping in wide band gap lead-free perovskite at the nanoscale level and opens opportunities for research in spintronics, magneto-optics, memristors, quantum computing, etc.

TI Deep quanvolutional neural networks with enhanced trainability and
   gradient propagation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we explore methods to enhance the performance of one of the frequently used variants of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks, known as Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional layers and addressing the challenges associated with training multi-layered or deep QuNNs. Traditional QuNNs mostly rely on static (non-trainable) quanvolutional layers, limiting their feature extraction capabilities. Our approach enables the training of these layers, significantly improving the scalability and learning potential of QuNNs. However, multi-layered deep QuNNs face difficulties in gradient-based optimization due to limited gradient flow across all the layers of the network. To overcome this, we propose Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), which utilize residual learning by adding skip connections between quanvolutional layers. These residual blocks enhance gradient flow throughout the network, facilitating effective training in deep QuNNs, thus enabling deep learning in QuNNs. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence on the optimal placement of these residual blocks, demonstrating how strategic configurations improve gradient flow and lead to more efficient training. Our findings represent a significant advancement in quantum deep learning, opening new possibilities for both theoretical exploration and practical quantum computing applications.

AB Quantum computing presents both opportunities and risks for modern software security, particularly in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines, which rely on traditional cryptographic mechanisms. As quantum threats become imminent, Quantum Secure DevOps (QSecOps) aims to integrate quantum-resistant security measures into software deployment workflows. However, its adoption remains challenging due to various technical and operational constraints. This study identifies and analyzes the key challenges in implementing QSecOps and develops a theoretical framework to assess their impact on DevOps security and performance. To conduct this study, we use literature survey approach to explore the challenge of QSecOps reported by the existing literature. By conducting the literature survey, we have identified 13 core challenges that could negatively impact the QSecOps. Addressing these challenges is essential for ensuring quantum-secure CI/CD pipelines. Further, a theoretical framework was developed based on the impact of identified challenging factors. The proposed framework provides practical insights for software engineers, security professionals, and DevOps teams to enhance quantum security integration and future-proof software deployment.

This market is currently dominated by non-European players by 75%, shaping the way that Europe is deploying and using cloud services. Although these players are bound to laws and regulations of foreign powers, such as PR China and USA, generating legitimate concerns for the EU, its businesses and citizens. EU's digital future resides on having installed secure, high-quality data processing capacity. This can only be offered by cloud services both centrally and at the edge. In this context NOUS's ambition is completely in line with the European Strategy for data as aims to create the foundations for a European Cloud Service which exploits the HPC network and tackles specific-to-the-EU-economy requirements as well as leverages different data spaces (Mobility, Energy, Green Deal and Manufacturing).

TI Operational definition of topological order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The unrivaled robustness of topologically ordered states of matter against perturbations has immediate applications in quantum computing and quantum metrology, yet their very existence poses a challenge to our understanding of phase transitions. In particular, topological phase transitions cannot be characterized in terms of local order parameters, as it is the case with conventional symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Currently, topological order is mostly discussed in the context of nonlocal topological invariants or indirect signatures like the topological entanglement entropy. However, a comprehensive understanding of what actually constitutes topological order enabling precise quantitative statements is still lacking. Here we show that one can interpret topological order as the ability of a system to perform topological error correction. We find that this operational approach corresponding to a measurable quantity both lays the conceptual foundations for previous classifications of topological order and also leads to a successful classification in the hitherto inaccessible case of topological order in open quantum systems. We demonstrate the existence of topological order in open systems and their phase transitions to topologically trivial states. Our results demonstrate the viability of topological order in nonequilibrium quantum systems and thus substantially broaden the scope of possible technological applications.

SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine learning techniques have achieved impressive results in recent years and the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum physics opens new promising avenues to speed up classical learning methods. Rather than viewing classical and quantum approaches as exclusive alternatives, their integration into hybrid designs has gathered increasing interest, as seen in variational quantum algorithms, quantum circuit learning, and kernel methods. Here we introduce deep hybrid classical-quantum reservoir computing for temporal processing of quantum states where information about, for instance, the entanglement or the purity of past input states can be extracted via a single-step measurement. We find that the hybrid setup cascading two reservoirs not only inherits the strengths of both of its constituents but is even more than just the sum of its parts, outperforming comparable non-hybrid alternatives. The quantum layer is within reach of state-of-the-art multimode quantum optical platforms while the classical layer can be implemented in silico.

TI Evidence of superconducting Fermi arcs
SO NATURE
AB An essential ingredient for the production of Majorana fermions for use in quantum computing is topological superconductivity1,2. As bulk topological superconductors remain elusive, the most promising approaches exploit proximity-induced superconductivity3, making systems fragile and difficult to realize4-7. Due to their intrinsic topology8, Weyl semimetals are also potential candidates1,2, but have always been connected with bulk superconductivity, leaving the possibility of intrinsic superconductivity of their topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, practically without attention, even from the theory side. Here, by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we identify topological Fermi arcs on two opposing surfaces of the non-centrosymmetric Weyl material trigonal PtBi2 (ref. 9). We show these states become superconducting at temperatures around 10 K. Remarkably, the corresponding coherence peaks appear as the strongest and sharpest excitations ever detected by photoemission from solids. Our findings indicate that superconductivity in PtBi2 can occur exclusively at the surface, rendering it a possible platform to host Majorana modes in intrinsically topological superconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junctions.
   We provide evidence for superconducting topological Fermi arcs in PbBi2-a Weyl semimetal previously studied mostly for its bulk properties-from which Marjorama fermions could be derived for research in quantum computers.

TI Understanding the Excess 1/f Noise in MOSFETs at Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES
AB Characterization, modeling, and development of cryo-temperature CMOS technologies (cryo-CMOS) have significantly progressed to help overcome the interconnection bottleneck between qubits and the readout interface in quantum computers. Nevertheless, available compact models still fail to predict the deviation of 1/f noise from the expected linear scaling with temperature ( $\textit{T}$ ), referred to as "excess 1/f noise ", observed at cryogenic temperatures. In addition, 1/f noise represents one of the main limiting factors for the decoherence time of qubits. In this article, we extensively characterize low-frequency noise on commercial 28-nm CMOS and on research-grade Ge-channel MOSFETs at temperatures ranging from 370 K down to 4 K. Our investigations exclude electron heating and bulk dielectric defects as possible causes of the excess 1/f noise at low temperatures. We show further evidence for a strong correlation between the excess 1/f noise and the saturation of the subthreshold swing (SS) observed at low temperatures. The most plausible cause of the excess noise is found in band tail states in the channel acting as additional capture/emission centers at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Non-Hermitian Optical Tunable System Based on Lithium Niobate Coupling
   Resonator
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Recently, an exceptional point (EP) was constructed in a coupled double-ring resonator. Generally, such non-Hermitian optical systems are realized via material selection and a spatially precise layout. However, because of material limitations, some system parameters cannot be changed after the waveguide is fabricated. In this study, We demonstrate a lithium niobate-based tunable system for controlling system dispersion and loss, the resonator structure made of lithium niobate is theoretically and numerically investigated and analyzed. Lithium niobate is chosen because it exhibits good electro-optic properties. Furthermore, the real part of the potential energy term of the non-Hermitian system is regulated using external electric field. Consequently, a frequency shift of up to 149 GHz is observed in the double characteristic peak of the transmission spectrum with a contrast of up to 0.43. In addition, a gain-influenced EP is observed in a coupled dual-ring resonator system by introducing gain material. It has potential application in future optical fiber communication, optical quantum computing, and environmental sensing.

TI Secure and Energy-Aware Cryptographic Framework for IoT-Enabled UAV
   Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The rapid convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), quantum computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified the urgency for lightweight yet resilient data protection mechanisms, particularly within unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Traditional cryptographic approaches, while mathematically secure, often fail to reconcile the competing requirements of robustness, computational efficiency, and energy sustainability when deployed on resource-constrained platforms such as drones. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel hybrid lightweight cryptographic model that strategically integrates symmetric and asymmetric primitives in a dual-layer design. The model leverages the efficiency of lightweight authenticated encryption for high-throughput data protection, while incorporating elliptic-curve and lattice-based key exchange mechanisms to ensure both forward secrecy and post-quantum resilience. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance compared to conventional methods, offering reduced computational overhead, lower energy consumption, and enhanced resistance to cyber threats. Crucially, the model maintains high levels of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity while extending operational endurance, making it particularly well-suited for next-generation UAV operating within the broader IoT ecosystem.

TI High-speed coherent opticalencryption/decryption system based
   oncross-phase encoding
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The optical network supporting emerging bandwidth-intensive services has become<br /> the cornerstone of the 5G era. However, the development of optical fiber eavesdropping and quantum computing has brought huge security challenges to traditional cryptography. As an effective approach to improving optical layer transmission security, all-optical logic gate encryption has important research significance. This paper proposes a high-speed coherent optical encryption and decryption system based on phase encoding with all-optical logic gates. The system ingeniously designs the phase encoding and decoding scheme between two quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signals, which doubles the encryption and decryption efficiency. In addition, the integration of physical-layer key distribution (PLKD) and physical-layer encryption (PLE) contributes to a reduction in overall system complexity. By adopting real-time signal processing in an all-optical domain, the single-wavelength rate of system security communication can reach 100 Gbps. The system is also applicable to other phase-modulated signals and provides a feasible scheme to enhance transmission security in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks featuring high speed, low latency, and high flexibility.<br /> 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Dynamic analysis of shortcut to adiabaticity based on physical
   information neural network
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB A quantum shortcut to adiabaticity scheme based on physics-informed neural networks is proposed in this work. Compared with traditional shortcut to adiabaticity technology, our method innovatively integrates machine learning methods by employing parameterized physics-informed neural networks to solve parameterized differential equations. The neural networks serve as an approximating function for quantum adiabatic evolution processes, while incorporating parameter-dependent differential equations and various physical constraints as components of the loss function. Through networks training, we effectively simulate quantum system dynamics and derive the driving control field for population inversion. Numerical simulations show that the quantum system can achieve rapid population inversion within significantly reduced time while maintaining high fidelity and exceptional robustness against parameter fluctuations. The neural networks exhibit remarkable computational capabilities, particularly suitable for generating control functions in complex quantum systems. Compared with conventional counter-diabatic driving and transitionless quantum driving methods, this PINNbased framework not only achieves better control performance but also provides the improved practicality for experimental implementations. The success of this method demonstrates its promising applications in quantum control tasks, including but not limited to quantum state preparation, quantum gate optimization, and adiabatic quantum computing acceleration.

TI Self-Induced Mode-Locking in Electrically Pumped Far-Infrared Random
   Lasers
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Mode locking, the self-starting synchronous oscillation of electromagnetic modes in a laser cavity, is the primary way to generate ultrashort light pulses. In random lasers, without a cavity, mode-locking, the nonlinear coupling amongst low spatially coherent random modes, can be activated via optical pumping, even without the emission of short pulses. Here, by exploiting the combination of the inherently giant third-order chi((3)) nonlinearity of semiconductor heterostructure lasers and the nonlinear properties of graphene, the authors demonstrate mode-locking in surface-emitting electrically pumped random quantum cascade lasers at terahertz frequencies. This is achieved by either lithographically patterning a multilayer graphene film to define a surface random pattern of light scatterers, or by coupling on chip a saturable absorber graphene reflector. Intermode beatnote mapping unveils self-induced phase-coherence between naturally incoherent random modes. Self-mixing intermode spectroscopy reveals phase-locked random modes. This is an important milestone in the physics of disordered systems. It paves the way to the development of a new generation of miniaturized, electrically pumped mode-locked light sources, ideal for broadband spectroscopy, multicolor speckle-free imaging applications, and reservoir quantum computing.

TI All-optical dissipative discrete time crystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Discrete time crystals are described by a subharmonic response with respect to an external drive and have been mostly observed in closed periodically-driven systems. Here, the authors demonstrate a dissipative discrete time crystal in a Kerr-nonlinear optical microcavity pumped by two lasers.
   Time crystals are periodic states exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking in either time-independent or periodically-driven quantum many-body systems. Spontaneous modification of discrete time-translation symmetry in periodically-forced physical systems can create a discrete time crystal (DTC) constituting a state of matter possessing properties like temporal rigid long-range order and coherence, which are inherently desirable for quantum computing and information processing. Despite their appeal, experimental demonstrations of DTCs are scarce and significant aspects of their behavior remain unexplored. Here, we report the experimental observation and theoretical investigation of DTCs in a Kerr-nonlinear optical microcavity. Empowered by the self-injection locking of two independent lasers with arbitrarily large frequency separation simultaneously to two same-family cavity modes and a dissipative Kerr soliton, this versatile platform enables realizing long-awaited phenomena such as defect-carrying DTCs and phase transitions. Combined with monolithic microfabrication, this room-temperature system paves the way for chip-scale time crystals supporting real-world applications outside sophisticated laboratories.

AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating optimization processes in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Compared to classical methods, QAOA efficiently solves optimization problems, often formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Classical quantum simulators are crucial for evaluating quantum algorithms due to limited quantum resources. However, QAOA's performance can vary with different simulation methods. This study analyzes QAOA's performance using various quantum simulators (e.g., density_matrix, statevector, and matrix_product_state) and demonstrates the benefits of HPC-QC integrated systems in solving QUBO problems on an active learning workflow. By simulating QAOA on dense, large-matrix QUBO problems, we evaluate accuracy and problem-solving time. We also assess QAOA's performance on local computers and HPC-QC integrated systems, using Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF)'s Frontier supercomputer with local Qiskit Aer and remote IBM Quantum simulators.

TI Hamiltonian Simulation with Random Inputs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The algorithmic error of digital quantum simulations is usually explored in terms of the spectral norm distance between the actual and ideal evolution operators. In practice, this worst-case error analysis may be unnecessarily pessimistic. To address this, we develop a theory of average-case performance of Hamiltonian simulation with random initial states. We relate the average-case error to the Frobenius norm of the multiplicative error and give upper bounds for the product formula (PF) and truncated Taylor series methods. As applications, we estimate average-case error for the digital Hamiltonian simulation of general lattice Hamiltonians and k -local Hamiltonians. In particular, for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with nspins, the error is quadratically reduced from Oon thorn in the worst case to Oop ffiffi thorn on average for both n the PF method and the Taylor series method. Numerical evidence suggests that this theory accurately characterizes the average error for concrete models. We also apply our results to error analysis in the simulation of quantum scrambling.

TI Krylov diagonalization of large many-body Hamiltonians on a quantum
   processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The estimation of low energies of many-body systems is a cornerstone of the computational quantum sciences. Variational quantum algorithms can be used to prepare ground states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, but their lack of convergence guarantees and impractical number of cost function estimations prevent systematic scaling of experiments to large systems. Alternatives to variational approaches are needed for large-scale experiments on pre-fault-tolerant devices. Here, we use a superconducting quantum processor to compute eigenenergies of quantum many-body systems on two-dimensional lattices of up to 56 sites, using the Krylov quantum diagonalization algorithm, an analog of the well-known classical diagonalization technique. We construct subspaces of the many-body Hilbert space using Trotterized unitary evolutions executed on the quantum processor, and classically diagonalize many-body interacting Hamiltonians within those subspaces. These experiments demonstrate exponential convergence towards an estimate of the ground state energy, and show that quantum diagonalization algorithms are poised to complement their classical counterparts at the foundation of computational methods for quantum systems.

TI All-optical stochastic switching of magnetisation textures in
   Fe3Sn2
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The all-optical control of magnetisation at room temperature broadens the scope of applications of spin degrees-of-freedom in data storage, spintronics, and quantum computing. Topological magnetic spin structures, such as skyrmions, are of particular interest due to their particle-like properties, small size and inherent stability. Controlling skyrmion states without strong magnetic fields or large current densities would create new possibilities for their application. In this work, we utilize femtosecond optical pulses to alter the helicity of the spin configuration in dipolar skyrmions formed in the kagome magnet Fe3Sn2 in the absence of an external magnetic field and at room temperature. In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is used to visualise the light-induced stochastic switching process of chiral N & eacute;el caps, while the internal Bloch component of the dipolar skyrmions remains unchanged. In addition to this switching process, we observe the interconversion between type I skyrmionic and type II bubble configurations depending on the external magnetic field and illumination conditions. To corroborate the spin states and the light-induced magnetisation dynamics, micromagnetic modelling and simulations of the resulting electron phase shift maps are conducted to elucidate the spin rearrangement induced by individual femtosecond optical pulses.

TI Hybrid Quantum Graph Neural Network for Brain Tumor MR Image
   Classification
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
AB Brain tumor rank as the tenth leading cause of mortality among both adults and children. Early detection and treatment significantly enhance survival rates. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated promise in identifying and classifying brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates classical and hybrid quantum-inspired graph neural networks for tumor classification. Classical Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) analyse complex relationships within medical imaging data, while hybrid Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN) improves performance by leveraging principles of quantum computing. Previous studies highlight the challenges posed by the diverse nature of brain imaging data. This study compares various classification approaches, emphasizing architectures, training techniques, and performance metrics. The objective is to train and evaluate models for identifying brain tumors from MRI scans. The hybrid QGNN demonstrates accuracy and loss metrics comparable to advanced classical GCNN, with accuracy improving from 0.41(41%) to 0.64(64%) during training and from 0.31(31%) to 0.52(52%) in validation datasets, thereby showcasing its effectiveness in distinguishing between normal and tumor images.

TI Complementary screening for quantum spin Hall insulators in
   two-dimensional exfoliable materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Quantum spin Hall insulators are a class of topological materials that has been extensively studied during the past decade. One of their distinctive features is the presence of a finite band gap in the bulk and gapless, topologically protected edge states that are spin-momentum locked. These materials are characterized by a Z(2) topological order where, in the two-dimensional case, a single topological invariant can be even or odd for a trivial or a topological material, respectively. Thanks to their interesting properties, such as the realization of dissipationless spin currents, spin pumping, and spin filtering, they are of great interest in the field of electronics, spintronics, and quantum computing. In this work we perform a high-throughput screening of quantum spin Hall insulators starting from a set of 783 two-dimensional exfoliable materials, recently identified from a systematic screening of the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, Crystallography Open Database, and Materials Platform for Data Science databases. We find four Z(2) topological insulators and seven direct gap metals that have the potential of becoming quantum spin Hall insulators under a reasonably weak external perturbation.

TI Optical noise-resistant nonreciprocal phonon blockade in a spinning
   optomechanical resonator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A scheme of nonreciprocal conventional phonon blockade (PB) is proposed in a spinning optomechanical resonator coupled with a two-level atom. The coherent coupling between the atom and breathing mode is mediated by the optical mode with a large detuning. Due to the Fizeau shift caused by the spinning resonator, the PB can be implemented in a nonreciprocal way. Specifically, when the spinning resonator is driven from one direction, the single-phonon (1PB) and two-phonon blockade (2PB) can be achieved by adjusting both the amplitude and frequency of the mechanical drive field, while phonon-induced tunneling (PIT) occurs when the spinning resonator is driven from the opposite direction. The PB effects are insensitive to cavity decay because of the adiabatic elimination of the optical mode, thus making the scheme more robust to the optical noise and still feasible even in a low-Q cavity. Our scheme provides a flexible method for engineering a unidirectional phonon source with external control, which is expected to be used as a chiral quantum device in quantum computing networks.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI A highly sensitive broadband superconducting thermoelectric
   single-photon detector
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We propose a passive single-photon detector based on the bipolar thermoelectric effect occurring in tunnel junctions between two different superconductors thanks to spontaneous electron-hole symmetry breaking. Our superconducting thermoelectric detector (STED) converts a finite temperature difference caused by the absorption of a single photon into an open circuit thermovoltage. Designed with feasible parameters, our STED is able to reveal single photons of frequency ranging from similar to 15 GHz to similar to 150 PHz depending on the chosen design and materials. In particular, this detector is expected to show values of the signal-to-noise ratio SNR similar to 15 at nu = 50 GHz when operated at a temperature of 10 mK. Interestingly, this device can be viewed as a digital single-photon detector, since it generates an almost constant voltage V-S for the full operation energies. Our STED can reveal single photons in a frequency range wider than four decades with the possibility to discern the energy of the incident photon by measuring the time persistence of the generated thermovoltage. Its broadband operation suggests that our STED could find practical applications in several fields of quantum science and technology, such as quantum computing, telecommunications, optoelectronics, THz spectroscopy, and astro-particle physics.

TI On Noise-Sensitive Automatic Tuning of Gate-Defined Sensor Dots
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this article, we analyze the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio. Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators, modify them for 1-D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results. Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our approach.

TI Back-gate effects on DC performance and carrier transport in 22 nm FDSOI
   technology down to cryogenic temperatures
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB This paper presents an in-depth DC characterization of a 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology down to deep cryogenic temperature, i.e., 2.95 K. The impact of the back-gate voltage (V-back) on device performance, i.e., threshold voltage (V-T) and carrier transport, is investigated over a wide temperature range. Moreover, semiclassical and quantum transports of two-dimensional carrier gas are investigated. The effective mobility (mu(eff)) extracted from short devices at cryogenic temperatures is lower than actual mobility due to the presence of ballistic transport. The discontinuous I-D-V-G is found in both long and extremely short transistors, which is ascribed to the intersubband transition happening during the scattering event. Oscillatory I-D-V-G due to resonant tunneling manifests itself in short devices at cryogenic temperatures and depends on V-back. On the other hand, the worse subthreshold swing is found for short devices in the saturation regime and at cryogenic temperatures due to source-to-drain tunneling.

TI Characterization of self-heating in cryogenic high electron mobility
   transistors using Schottky thermometry
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Cryogenic low-noise amplifiers based on high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are widely used in applications such as radio astronomy, deep space communications, and quantum computing. Consequently, the physical mechanisms governing the microwave noise figure are of practical interest. In particular, the magnitude of the contribution of thermal noise from the gate at cryogenic temperatures remains unclear owing to a lack of experimental measurements of thermal resistance under these conditions. Here, we report measurements of gate junction temperature and thermal resistance in a HEMT at cryogenic and room temperatures using Schottky thermometry. At temperatures & SIM;20 K, we observe a nonlinear trend of thermal resistance vs power that is consistent with heat dissipation by phonon radiation. Based on this finding, we consider heat transport by phonon radiation at the low-noise bias and liquid helium temperatures and estimate that the thermal noise from the gate is several times larger than previously assumed owing to self-heating. We conclude that without improvements in thermal management, self-heating results in a practical lower limit for microwave noise figure of HEMTs at cryogenic temperatures.

TI The intersection of field-limited density of states and matter in
   radioluminescence: nanophotonic control of energy transfer
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The unresolved correlation between a nanostructured environment, like a crystalline colloidal array (CCA), and the F & ouml;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between multiple embedded emitters is a fundamental aspect of quantum light-matter interactions with implications for various high-priority applications, such as telecommunications, energy-efficient lighting, and quantum computing technologies. This highly debated topic was explored in two series (n1 and n2) of organic radioluminescent nanoparticles, containing a copolymerized scintillator and two organic fluorophores, that self-assembled into a liquid ordered structure, or CCA. The three copolymerized emitters exhibited two sequential transfers of energy upon X-ray irradiation, resulting in emission spanning the visible spectrum. Nanophotonic manipulation of the radioluminescence of each nanoparticle series assembled in a CCA and the energy transfer efficiency between the three emitters copolymerized within each nanoparticle series was demonstrated by positioning the partial photonic bandgap of the liquid ordered structure within the spectral regions attributed to each copolymerized emitter. Enhanced and suppressed energy transfer was exhibited in each nanoparticle series, revealing control over FRET in a radioluminescent system through strategic placement of the bandgap.

TI Ultra-broadband near-field Josephson microwave microscopy
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Advanced microwave technologies constitute the foundation of a wide range of modern sciences, including microwave integrated circuits, quantum computing, microwave photonics, spintronics, etc. To facilitate the design of chip-based microwave devices, there is an increasing demand for state-of-the-art microscopic techniques that are capable of characterizing near-field microwave distribution and performance. In this work, we integrate Josephson junctions onto a nanosized quartz tip, forming a highly sensitive microwave mixer on-tip. This allows us to conduct spectroscopic imaging of near-field microwave distributions with high spatial resolution. By leveraging its microwave-sensitive characteristics, our Josephson microscopy achieves a broad detecting bandwidth of <= 200 GHz, as well as remarkable frequency and intensity resolutions. Near-field characterizations of microwave circuits are also conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of Josephson microscopy. Our work emphasizes the benefits of utilizing Josephson microscopy as a real-time, non-destructive technique to advance integrated microwave devices.
   Josephson microwave microscopy integrating Josephson junctions onto a nanoprobe enables spectroscopic imaging of near-field microwave with a broad bandwidth, presenting a non-destructive technique to characterize microwave devices.

TI Simulating nonlinear optical processes on a superconducting quantum
   device
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB Simulating plasma physics on quantum computers is difficult because most problems ofinterest are nonlinear, but quantum computers are not naturally suitable for nonlinearoperations. In weakly nonlinear regimes, plasma problems can be modelled as wave-waveinteractions. In this paper, we develop a quantization approach to convert nonlinearwave-wave interaction problems to Hamiltonian simulation problems. We demonstrateour approach using two qubits on a superconducting device. Unlike a photonic device,a superconducting device does not naturally have the desired interactions in itsnative Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, Hamiltonian simulations can still be performed bydecomposing required unitary operations into native gates. To improve experimentalresults, we employ a range of error-mitigation techniques. Apart from readout errormitigation, we use randomized compilation to transform undiagnosed coherent errors intowell-behaved stochastic Pauli channels. Moreover, to compensate for stochastic noise,we rescale exponentially decaying probability amplitudes using rates measured fromcycle benchmarking. We carefully consider how different choices of product-formulaalgorithms affect the overall error and show how a trade-off can be made to best utilizelimited quantum resources. This study provides an example of how plasma problems maybe solved on near-term quantum computing platforms

TI 2D High-Temperature Superconductor Integration in Contact Printed
   Circuit Boards
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Inherent properties of superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x films, such as the high superconducting transition temperature T-c, efficient Josephson coupling between neighboring CuO layers, and fast quasiparticle relaxation dynamics, make them a promising platform for advances in quantum computing and communication technologies. However, preserving two-dimensional superconductivity during device fabrication is an outstanding experimental challenge because of the fast degradation of the superconducting properties of two-dimensional flakes when they are exposed to moisture, organic solvents, and heat. Herein, to realize superconducting devices utilizing two-dimensional (2D) superconducting films, we develop a novel fabrication technique relying on the cryogenic dry transfer of printable circuits embedded into a silicon nitride membrane. This approach separates the circuit fabrication stage requiring chemically reactive substances and ionizing physical processes from the creation of the thin superconducting structures. Apart from providing electrical contacts in a single transfer step, the membrane encapsulates the surface of the crystal, shielding it from the environment. The fabricated atomically thin Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x -based devices show a high superconducting transition temperature of T-c similar or equal to 91 K close to that of the bulk crystal and demonstrate stable superconducting properties.

TI Real Space Visualization of Entangled Excitonic States in Charged
   Molecular Assemblies
SO ACS NANO
AB Entanglement of excitons holds great promise for the future of quantum computing, which would use individual molecular dyes as building blocks of their circuitry. Studying entangled excitonic eigenstates emerging in coupled molecular assemblies in the near-field with submolecular resolution has the potential to bring insight into the photophysics of these fascinating quantum phenomena. In contrast to far-field spectroscopies, near-field spectroscopic mapping permits direct identification of the individual eigenmodes, type of exciton coupling, including excited states otherwise inaccessible in the far field (dark states). Here we combine tip-enhanced spectromicroscopy with atomic force microscopy to inspect delocalized single-exciton states of charged molecular assemblies engineered from individual perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecules. Hyperspectral mapping of the eigenstates and comparison with calculated many-body optical transitions reveals a second low-lying excited state of the anion monomers and its role in the exciton entanglement within the assemblies. We demonstrate control over the exciton coupling by switching the assembly charge states. Our results reveal the possibility of tailoring excitonic properties of organic dye aggregates for advanced functionalities and establish the methodology to address them individually at the nanoscale.

TI Hybrid MEMS-CMOS ion traps for NISQ computing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Surging interest in engineering quantum computers has stimulated significant and focused research on technologies needed to make them manufacturable and scalable. In the ion trap realm this has led to a transition from bulk three-dimensional macro-scale traps to chip-based ion traps and included important demonstrations of passive and active electronics, waveguides, detectors, and other integrated components. At the same time as these technologies are being developed the system sizes are demanding more ions to run noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, growing from around ten ions today to potentially a hundred or more in the near future. To realize the size and features needed for this growth, the geometric and material design space of microfabricated ion traps must expand. In this paper we describe present limitations and the approaches needed to overcome them, including how geometric complexity drives the number of metal levels, why routing congestion affects the size and location of shunting capacitors, and how RF power dissipation can limit the size of the trap array. We also give recommendations for future research needed to accommodate the demands of NISQ scale ion traps that are integrated with additional technologies.

TI Fermionic Partial Tomography via Classical Shadows
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a tomographic protocol for estimating any k-body reduced density matrix (k-RDM) of an n-mode fermionic state, a ubiquitous step in near-term quantum algorithms for simulating many-body physics, chemistry, and materials. Our approach extends the framework of classical shadows, a randomized approach to learning a collection of quantum-state properties, to the fermionic setting. Our sampling protocol uses randomized measurement settings generated by a discrete group of fermionic Gaussian unitaries, implementable with linear-depth circuits. We prove that estimating all k-RDM elements to additive precision e requires on the order of ((n)(k))k(3/2) log(n) / epsilon(2) repeated state preparations, which is optimal up to the logarithmic factor. Furthermore, numerical calculations show that our protocol offers a substantial improvement in constant overheads for k >= 2, as compared to prior deterministic strategies. We also adapt our method to particle-number symmetry, wherein the additional circuit depth may be halved at the cost of roughly 2-5 times more repetitions.

TI Adaptive Epitaxy of C-Si-Ge-Sn: Customizable Bulk and Quantum Structures
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The successful demonstration of (Si)Ge1-xSnx alloys as direct-gap materials for infrared lasers has driven intense research on group IV-based devices for nanoelectronics, energy harvesting, and quantum computing applications. The material palette of direct-gap group-IV alloys can be further extended by introducing carbon to fine-tune their structural and electronic properties, significantly expanding their functionality. This work presents heteroepitaxial growth of C(Si)GeSn alloys using an industry-standard reduced-pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor. The introduction of CBr4 as a precursor enables controlled incorporation of C atoms (<1 at.%) into the epilayer lattice, while simultaneously increasing the Sn content in the CGeSn alloy up to approximate to 18 at.%. Carbon plays a key role in modulating strain, stabilizing the crystal structure, and influencing material properties. By leveraging alloying and strain engineering, quaternary CSiGeSn bulk layers and CGeSn/GeSn heterostructures are epitaxially grown. The impact of C incorporation on optical emission is investigated in LEDs based on CGeSn/GeSn multiple quantum wells, demonstrating enhanced near-infrared emission at 2.54 <mu>m, which is sustained up to room temperature.

TI A method of detecting magnetic interaction in the quantum spin liquid
   material NaYbSe2 through magnetic dilution
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum spin liquid (QSL) holds important application prospects in the realm of quantum computing, and the precise knowledge of magnetic interaction is essential for understanding the magnetism of QSL materials. Here, we report a method of detecting the magnetic interactions in the triangular-lattice QSL candidate NaYbSe2 through magnetic dilution. The single crystals of NaYb0.02Lu0.98Se2 were grown and they maintain the same crystal structure (space group R-3m) as NaYbSe2. Magnetization steps were observed at H-c = 31 kOe for H//ab and H-c = 53 kOe for H//c in the magnetization curves at 0.39 K, suggesting the formation of nearly isolated antiferromagnetic Yb-Yb dimers. Fitting the dimer magnetization curves yields anisotropic exchange parameters of J(perpendicular to)/k(B) approximate to -6.15 K and J(z)/k(B) approximate to -2.14 K and an average exchange of J(av)/k(B )= -6.44 K. Since NaYb0.02Lu0.98Se2 exhibits similar g-factor anisotropy, comparable Yb-Yb bond length, and Yb-Se-Yb superexchange angle to NaYbSe2, these exchange parameters can be viewed as the values of NaYbSe2.

TI Carbon market risk estimation using quantum conditional generative
   adversarial network and amplitude estimation
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND ECONOMICS
AB Accurately and efficiently estimating the carbon market risk is paramount for ensuring financial stability, promoting environmental sustainability, and facilitating informed decision-making. Although classical risk estimation methods are extensively utilized, the implicit pre-assumptions regarding distribution are predominantly contained and challenging to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. A quantum computing-based carbon market risk estimation framework is proposed to address this problem with the quantum conditional generative adversarial network-quantum amplitude estimation (QCGAN-QAE) algorithm. Specifically, quantum conditional generative adversarial network (QCGAN) is employed to simulate the future distribution of the generated return rate, whereas quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) is employed to measure the distribution. Moreover, the quantum circuit of the QCGAN improved by reordering the data interaction layer and data simulation layer is coupled with the introduction of the quantum fully connected layer. The binary search method is incorporated into the QAE to bolster the computational efficiency. The simulation results based on the European Union Emissions Trading System reveals that the proposed framework markedly enhances the efficiency and precision of value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk compared to original methods.

TI Using quantum annealers to calculate ground state properties of
   molecules
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum annealers are an alternative approach to quantum computing, which make use of the adiabatic theorem to efficiently find the ground state of a physically realizable Hamiltonian. Such devices are currently commercially available and have been successfully applied to several combinatorial and discrete optimization problems. However, the application of quantum annealers to problems in chemistry remains a relatively sparse area of research due to the difficulty in mapping molecular systems to the Ising model Hamiltonian. In this paper, we review two different methods for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians using Ising model-based quantum annealers. In addition, we compare the relative effectiveness of each method by calculating the binding energies, bond lengths, and bond angles of the H3+ and H2O molecules and mapping their potential energy curves. We also assess the resource requirements of each method by determining the number of qubits and computation time required to simulate each molecule using various parameter values. While each of these methods is capable of accurately predicting the ground state properties of small molecules, we find that they are still outperformed by modern classical algorithms and that the scaling of the resource requirements remains a challenge.

TI Strain Engineering of Ge Quantum Wells in Planar Ge/Si1-xGex
   Heterostructures
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Germanium (Ge) has been identified as a good candidate among semiconductor-based materials for quantum applications. One of the main reasons lies in the long coherence time of spins of localized holes, its ability to host superconducting pairing correlations, and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Recent studies reveal how the growth of strained germanium quantum wells (QWs) embedded in silicon-germanium (SiGe) barriers is crucial to enhance charges' mobility in this system. In this work, a study is presented of the distribution of in-plane and out-of-plane strain in germanium quantum wells embedded in Si1 - xGex barriers in order to engineer strain in the quantum well, thus tuning the charge mobility therein for quantum computing purposes. Therefore, experimental techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and geometric phase analysis (GPA) are combined with Schr & ouml;dinger-Poisson solver simulations in order to find the optimal quantum well thickness and silicon (Si) content in the Si1 - xGex barriers to enhance and control electrical properties in Ge/SiGe planar heterostructures.

TI Avoiding barren plateaus with classical deep neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising algorithms in the era of noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. Such algorithms are constructed using a parametrization U(theta) with a classical optimizer that updates the parameters theta in order to minimize a cost function C. For this task, in general the gradient descent method, or one of its variants, is used. This is a method where the circuit parameters are updated iteratively using the cost function gradient. However, several works in the literature have shown that this method suffers from a phenomenon known as the barren plateaus (BPs). In this paper, we propose a method to mitigate BPs. In general, the parameters theta used in the parametrization U are randomly generated. In our method they are obtained from a classical neural network (CNN). We show that this method, besides to being able to mitigate BPs during startup, is also able to mitigate the effect of BPs during the VQA training. In addition, we also show how this method behaves for different CNN architectures.

TI Economic Nationalism as the Fourth Era of International Trade Law
SO MANCHESTER JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB This article contextualizes and explains, from both theoretical and practical perspectives, some of the most recent and impactful changes to international trade law development in critical and emerging technology areas. It begins by describing developments in international trade law in the 20th and 21st centuries through the identification of four eras of that development: 1) pre-war protectionism (1921-1934); 2) post-war multilateralism (1947-2000); regionalism (2001-2016); and finally, post-multilateral economic nationalism (2017-present). It then focuses on this fourth era, which has been marked by unprecedented uses of unilateral regulatory barriers to trade including discriminatory tariffs, anti-dumping and countervailing duty impositions, export controls, sanctions, investment restrictions, and industry-specific subsidies, imposed by multiple countries, and led by the three largest economies (the US, China, and the EU), all in a significant deviation from the trade law and policy of these countries in previous eras. Understanding this turn to economic nationalism, as manifest in the current era of trade law development, is key to understanding current dynamics in global trade law and policy, particularly in critical and emerging technology areas such as artificial intelligence, microcomputing, quantum computing, neurotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology.

TI Configurable Readout Error Mitigation in Quantum Workflows
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Current quantum computers are still error-prone, with measurement errors being one of the factors limiting the scalability of quantum devices. To reduce their impact, a variety of readout error mitigation methods, mostly relying on classical post-processing, have been developed. However, the application of these methods is complicated by their heterogeneity and a lack of information regarding their functionality, configuration, and integration. To facilitate their use, we provide an overview of existing methods, and evaluate general and method-specific configuration options. Quantum applications comprise many classical pre- and post-processing tasks, including readout error mitigation. Automation can facilitate the execution of these often complex tasks, as their manual execution is time-consuming and error-prone. Workflow technology is a promising candidate for the orchestration of heterogeneous tasks, offering advantages such as reliability, robustness, and monitoring capabilities. In this paper, we present an approach to abstractly model quantum workflows comprising configurable readout error mitigation tasks. Based on the method configuration, these workflows can then be automatically refined into executable workflow models. To validate the feasibility of our approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and demonstrate it in a case study from the quantum humanities domain.

TI Single-Shot Fabrication of Semiconducting-Superconducting Nanowire
   Devices
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Semiconducting-superconducting hybrids are vital components for the realization of high-performance nanoscale devices. In particular, semiconducting-superconducting nanowires attract widespread interest owing to the possible presence of non-abelian Majorana zero modes, which are quasiparticles that hold promise for topological quantum computing. However, systematic search for Majoranas signatures is challenging because it requires reproducible hybrid devices and reliable fabrication methods. This work introduces a fabrication concept based on shadow walls that enables the in situ, selective, and consecutive depositions of superconductors and normal metals to form normal-superconducting junctions. Crucially, this method allows to realize devices in a single shot, eliminating fabrication steps after the synthesis of the fragile semiconductor/superconductor interface. At the atomic level, all investigated devices reveal a sharp and defect-free semiconducting-superconducting interface and, correspondingly, a hard induced superconducting gap resilient up to 2 T is measured electrically. While the cleanliness of the technique enables systematic studies of topological superconductivity in nanowires, it also allows for the synthesis of advanced nano-devices based on a wide range of material combinations and geometries while maintaining an exceptionally high interface quality.

TI Chaos in Control Systems: A Review of Suppression and Induction
   Strategies with Industrial Applications
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In control systems, chaos is a natural dualistic phenomenon that can be both a beneficial resource to be used and a negative phenomenon to be avoided. The study examines two opposing paradigms: positive chaotic control, which aims to enhance performance, and negative chaos management, which aims to stabilize a system. More sophisticated suppression methods, including adaptive neural networks, sliding mode control, and model predictive control, can decrease convergence times. Controlled chaotic dynamics have significantly impacted the domain of embedded control systems. Specialized controller designs include fractal-based systems and hybrid switching systems that offer better control of chaotic behavior in many situations. The paper highlights the key issues that are related to chaos-based systems, such as the need to implement them in real time, parameter sensitivity, and safety. Recent research suggests an increased interdependence between artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and sustainable technology. The synthesis shows that chaos control has evolved into an engineering field, significantly impacting the industry, which was initially a theoretical concept. It also offers exclusive ideas in the design and improvement of complex control systems.

TI Sketched Nanoscale KTaO3-Based Superconducting Quantum Interference
   Device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The discovery of two-dimensional superconductivity in LaAlO3/KTaO3 (111) and (110) interfaces has raised significant interest in this system. In this paper, we report the first successful fabrication of a direct current superconducting quantum interference device (dc-SQUID) in the KTO system. The key device elements, superconducting weak links, are created by conductive atomic force microscope lithography, which can reversibly control the conductivity at the LAO/KTO (110) interface with nanoscale resolution. The periodic modulation of the SQUID critical current Ic(B) with magnetic field corresponds well with our theoretical modeling, which reveals a large kinetic inductance of the superconducting twodimensional electron gas in KTO. The kinetic inductance of the SQUID is tunable by electrical gating from the back, due to the large dielectric constant of KTO. The demonstration of weak links and SQUIDs in KTO broadens the scope for exploring the underlying physics of KTO superconductivity, including the role of spin-orbit coupling, pairing symmetry, and inhomogeneity. It also promotes KTO as a versatile platform for a growing family of quantum devices, which could be applicable in the realm of quantum computing and information.

TI Giant spin splitting and its origin in methylhydrazinium lead halide
   perovskites
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Spin splitting, or removal of spin degeneracy in the electronic energy band/level, is often a measure of spin-orbit coupling strength and a way to manipulate spin degrees of freedom. We use first-principles simulations to predict giant spin splitting in methylhydrazinium lead halide (MHyPbX(3), MHy=CH3NH2NH2, X = Br and Cl) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. The values can reach up to 408.0 meV at zero Kelvin and 281.6 meV at room temperature. The origin of the effect is traced to the large distortion of PbX3 framework, driven primarily by Pb ions in the ferroelectric Gamma(3-) mode. The Pb displacements consist of a combination of polar and antipolar arrangements and result in up to 39.2 meV/atom enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling energy in the polar phase of the materials. The spin-orbit coupling gives origin to persistent spin textures in MHyPbX(3), which are desirable for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Our findings reveal an additional functionality for hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite and open a way for the design of more materials with giant spin splitting.

TI Code conversion with the quantum Golay code for a universal transversal
   gate set
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The [[7,1,3]] Steane code and [[23,1,7]] quantum Golay code have been identified as good candidates for fault -tolerant quantum computing via code concatenation. These two codes have transversal implementations of all Clifford gates but require some other scheme for fault -tolerant T gates. Using magic states, Clifford operations, and measurements is one common scheme, but magic -state distillation can have a large overhead. Code conversion is one avenue for implementing a universal gate set fault tolerantly without the use of magic -state distillation. Analogously to how the [[7,1,3]] Steane code can be fault tolerantly converted to and from the [[15,1,3]] Reed -Muller code which has a transversal T gate, the [[23,1,7]] Golay code can be converted to a [[95,1,7]] triorthogonal code with a transversal T gate. A crucial ingredient of this procedure is the [[49,1,5]] triorthogonal code, which can itself be seen as being related to the self -dual [[17,1,5]] two-dimensional color code. Additionally, a method for code conversion based on a transversal CNOT between the codes, rather than stabilizer measurements, is described.

TI Molecular design, synthesis, properties, and applications of organic
   triplet emitters exhibiting blue, green, red and white room-temperature
   phosphorescence
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB At room temperature, many organic compounds can emit light not only from singlet excited states but also from triplet excited states. This phenomenon is known as room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP). RTP has numerous potential applications in various areas, including industry, medicine, and daily life. RTP materials can be used in white light-emitting, memorising, sensing, bioimaging, semiconducting, 3D printing, microfluidic visualisation, quantum computing, X-ray detection, etc. They have advantages over fluorescent and metal-based phosphorescent materials. They are characterized by different emission spectra, longer lifetimes, and higher environmental sensitivity. However, challenges related to the tuning of emission colours, realization of dual emission, and meeting application-specific requirements still need to be overcome. Various molecular design strategies and synthetic approaches have been developed to overcome these challenges and to develop efficient RTP materials. This review article discusses recent advances in the synthesis and properties of RTP materials, focusing on emission colours and applications.
   Theoretical and experimental approaches for the development of organic room temperature phosphorescence compounds exhibiting blue, green, red, and white emissions for many potential applications are analysed and classified.

TI Random Telegraph Noise of a 28-nm Cryogenic MOSFET in the Coulomb
   Blockade Regime
SO IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS
AB We observe rich phenomena of two-level random telegraph noise (RTN) from a commercial bulk 28-nm p-MOSFET (PMOS) near threshold at 14 K, where a Coulomb blockade (CB) hump arises from a quantum dot (QD) formed in the channel. Minimum RTN is observed at the CB hump where the high-current RTN level dramatically switches to the low-current level. The gate-voltage dependence of the RTN amplitude and power spectral density match well with the transconductance from the DC transfer curve in the CB hump region. Our work unequivocally captures these QD transport signatures in both current and noise, revealing quantum confinement effects in commercial short-channel PMOS even at 14 K, over 100 times higher than the typical dilution refrigerator temperatures of QD experiments (< 100 mK). We envision that our reported RTN characteristics rooted from the QD and a defect trap would be more prominent for smaller technology nodes, where the quantum effect should be carefully examined in cryogenic CMOS circuit designs.

TI Horizontal Current Bipolar Transistor fT and
   fmax Recovery at Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS
AB RF characterization of the Horizontal Current Bipolar Transistor (HCBT) is performed in a cryostat over the temperature range from 300 K down to 20 K. Following the expected decrease of small-signal current gain (h(21)), cut-off frequency (f(T)) and maximum frequency of oscillations (f(max)) from 300 K to 80 K, a recovery of all parameters is observed below 80 K, in contrast to any other published Si BJT technology. Compared with a commercial bipolar junction transistor (BJT) having a similar f(T) and f(max) at 300 K, the HCBT demonstrates a 3.2 times higher f(T) and 2.5 times higher f(max) at 20 K. The f(T) recovery is attributed to the mobility improvement in the freeze-out regime, whereas f(max) increases even more due to the reduction of the effective collector-base capacitance(C-BC) below 80 K. These characteristics could facilitate the use of Si BJTs in cryogenic applications such as quantum computing.

TI QROP: Quantum Learning-Based Identification of Retinopathy of
   Prematurity
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a serious eye disease for premature infants. One of the main reasons for ROP is the use of oxygen for prolonged periods. In ROP, the abnormal blood vessels extend into the vitreous, the gel-like substance, and the retina may become partially detached with the formation of a ridge. Early detection and treatment of ROP are important to prevent blindness. This work aims (i) to classify normal and ROP-affected retinal images using a quantum neural network (QNN) and (ii) to compare the performance of the proposed quantum ROP (QROP) system with the existing ROP identification methods. QROP uses the HVDROPDB dataset fundus images of preterm infants. These images are captured using RetCam and Neo imaging devices. Only 15 parameters and a few samples extracted from the database were used for model training to achieve desirable evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score and specificity. The proposed system achieves 97.06% accuracy with the HVDROPDB Neo dataset, 91.18% accuracy with the HVDROPDB RetCam dataset, and 85.29% accuracy when evaluated on the images from variable imaging devices and of different resolutions.

TI Perfect linear optics using silicon photonics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently there has been growing interest in using photonics to perform the linear algebra operations of neuromorphic and quantum computing applications, aiming at harnessing silicon photonics' (SiPho) high-speed and energy-efficiency credentials. Accurately mapping, however, a matrix into optics remains challenging, since state-of-the-art optical architectures are sensitive to fabrication imperfections. This leads to reduced fidelity that degrades as the insertion losses of the optical matrix nodes or the matrix dimensions increase. In this work, we present the experimental deployment of a 4 x 4 coherent crossbar (Xbar) as a silicon chip and validate experimentally its theoretically predicted fidelity restoration credentials. We demonstrate the experimental implementation of 10,000 arbitrary linear transformations achieving a record-high fidelity of 99.997% +/- 0.002, limited mainly by the measurement equipment. Our work represents an integrated optical circuit providing almost unity and loss-independent fidelity in the realization of arbitrary matrices, highlighting light's credentials in resolving complex computations.
   The Authors demonstrate a fidelity-restorable universal integrated linear optical circuit that relies on a novel 4 x 4 silicon photonic crossbar architecture. Its experimental characterization yields a fidelity of 99.93 +/- 0.06%, calculated over 10,000 matrices.

TI Narrow-linewidth exciton-polariton laser
SO OPTICA
AB Exciton-polariton lasers are a promising source of coherent light for low -energy applications due to their low -threshold operation. However, a detailed experimental study of their spectral purity, which directly affects their coherence properties, is still missing. Here, we present a high -resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single -mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra -narrow linewidth of 56 MHz or 0.24 mu eV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7 ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. The long coherence time of the exciton-polariton system uncovered here opens up opportunities for manipulating its macroscopic quantum state, which is essential for applications in classical and quantum computing.

TI Near ultraviolet photonic integrated lasers based on silicon nitride
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Low phase noise lasers based on the combination of III-V semiconductors and silicon photonics are well established in the near-infrared spectral regime. Recent advances in the development of low-loss silicon nitride-based photonic integrated resonators have allowed them to outperform bulk external diode and fiber lasers in both phase noise and frequency agility in the 1550 nm-telecommunication window. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a hybrid integrated laser composed of a gallium nitride-based laser diode and a silicon nitride photonic chip-based microresonator operating at record low wavelengths as low as 410 nm in the near-ultraviolet wavelength region suitable for addressing atomic transitions of atoms and ions used in atomic clocks, quantum computing, or for underwater LiDAR. By self-injection locking of the Fabry-Perot diode laser to a high-Q (0.4 x 10(6)) photonic integrated microresonator, we reduce the optical phase noise at 461 nm by a factor greater than 100x, limited by the device quality factor and back-reflection.

TI Elevating image segmentation with multilevel two-dimensional quantum
   representation
SO PLOS ONE
AB In the rapidly advancing field of image analysis and processing, accurately segmenting images into meaningful regions remains a critical challenge. Drawing from recent advancements in quantum computing and information theory, our research introduces an innovative approach to image segmentation. This work presents a novel multilevel segmentation method that utilizes a two-dimensional quantum image representation, offering a more sophisticated and efficient technique for image thresholding. In this framework, the image's 2D histogram is treated as a quantum system, with quantum R & eacute;nyi entropy used to quantify the information contained within the image. To enhance segmentation quality, we first improve the contrast of the images by applying a new contrast enhancement algorithm before performing the segmentation. The resulting entropy-based fitness function is then optimized using Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to determine the optimal thresholding values. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted between the proposed quantum method and traditional classical approaches, evaluated on a set of benchmark images using nine metrics, including the Wilcoxon test for statistical significance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSO optimizer, the superiority of the two-dimensional quantum image representation.

TI Chiral spontaneous photon-pair generation with plasmonic bound states in
   the continuum
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) has proven to be a robust and prominent method for creating non-classical light sources of entangled single-photon pairs. However, such sources suffer from low efficiency due to the inherent weakness of the SPDC process. Moreover, there is no control of polarization in the generated photons. Circularly polarized SPDC-based sources with an efficient chiral response are currently missing, which severely precludes the realization of a wide range of practical applications in quantum computing and communications. The current work solves these inherent problems by demonstrating a novel chiral plasmonic metasurface that leverages a strong quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) resonance, which significantly increases the SPDC photon generation efficiency and realizes circularly polarized (chiral) single-photon pairs. The presented metasurface design is ultrathin, supports efficient free space outcoupling of chiral classical and quantum radiation, and operates at room temperature. Hence, it offers the potential to realize a compact and integrable quantum source of circularly polarized entangled single-photon pairs. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group.

TI Component-wise AO basis reduction: norm loss, negative contribution
   normalization, and functional implications
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Atomic orbital (AO) normalization is a foundational assumption in electronic structure theory, yet in practice, the norm of contracted basis functions can deviate from unity due to internal reduction and transformation mechanisms applied by quantum chemistry packages. This work presents a systematic framework for analyzing the physical and numerical consequences of primitive basis function elimination and AO-level norm inconsistency. The implemented methodology quantifies norm loss, separates constructive and destructive contributions, and enables precise renormalization by retaining both positive and negative terms within AO representations. Using two representative systems-a Raman-active carotenoid (lycopene) and a phosphorus dimer with through-space J(P-P) coupling-sensitivity to AO normalization was evaluated. While vibrational frequencies remained stable across normalization schemes, Raman intensities and J-coupling constants showed non-negligible shifts: up to 6 Hz for phosphorus and over 50 units in Raman activity. The results demonstrate that AO normalization is not merely a numerical refinement, but a physically impactful step with implications for precision spectroscopy and quantum computing applications.

TI Thermionic Emission in Artificially Structured Single-Crystalline
   Elemental Metal/Compound Semiconductor Superlattices
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Metal/semiconductor superlattices represent a fascinating frontier in materials science and nanotechnology, where alternating layers of metals and semiconductors are precisely engineered at the atomic and nano-scales. Traditionally, epitaxial metal/semiconductor superlattice growth requires constituent materials from the same family, exhibiting identical structural symmetry and low lattice mismatch. Here, beyond this conventional constraint, a novel class of epitaxial lattice-matched metal/semiconductor superlattices is introduced that utilizes refractory hexagonal elemental transition metals and wide-bandgap III-nitride semiconductors. Exemplified by the Hf/AlN superlattices exhibiting coherent layer-by-layer epitaxial growth, cross-plane thermionic emission is observed through current-voltage measurements accomplished for the first time in any metal/semiconductor superlattices. Further, thermoreflectance measurements reveal significant enhancement in cross-plane Seebeck coefficients attributed to carrier energy filtering by Schottky barriers. Demonstration of artificially structured elemental-metal/wide-bandgap compound-semiconductor superlattices promises to usher in new fundamental physics studies and cutting-edge applications such as tunable hyperbolic metamaterials, quantum computing, and thermionic-emission-based thermoelectric and thermophotonic energy conversion devices.

TI Mitigating the Effects of Au-Al Intermetallic Compounds Due to
   High-Temperature Processing of Surface-Electrode Ion Traps
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Stringent physical requirements need to be met for the high-performing surface-electrode ion traps used in quantum computing and timekeeping. In particular, these traps must survive a high-temperature environment for vacuum chamber preparation and support high RF voltage on closely spaced electrodes. Due to the use of gold wire bonds on aluminum pads, intermetallic growth can lead to wire bond failure via breakage or high resistance, limiting the lifetime of a trap assembly to a single multiday bake at 200 degree celsius. Using traditional thick metal stacks to prevent intermetallic growth, however, can result in trap failure due to RF breakdown events. Through high-temperature experiments, we conclude that an ideal metal stack for ion traps is Ti/Pt/Au (20/100/250 nm), which allows for a cumulative bakeable time of roughly 86 days without compromising the trap voltage performance. This increase in the bakeable lifetime of ion traps will remove the need to discard otherwise functional ion traps when vacuum hardware is upgraded, which will greatly benefit ion trap experiments.

TI 300 mm CMOS-compatible superconducting HfN and ZrN thin films for
   quantum applications
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The rising interest in increased manufacturing maturity of quantum processing units is pushing the development of alternative superconducting materials for semiconductor fab process technology. However, these are often facing CMOS process incompatibility. In contrast to common CMOS materials, such as Al, TiN, and TaN, reports on the superconductivity of other suitable transition-metal nitrides are scarce, despite potential superiority. Here, we demonstrate fully CMOS-compatible fabrication of HfN and ZrN thin films on state-of-the-art 300 mm semiconductor process equipment, utilizing reactive DC magnetron sputtering on silicon wafers. Measurement of mechanical stress and surface roughness of the thin films demonstrates process compatibility. We investigated the materials phase and stoichiometry by structural analysis. The HfN and ZrN samples exhibit superconducting phase transitions with critical temperatures up to 5.84 and 7.32 K, critical fields of 1.73 and 6.40 T, and coherence lengths of 14 and 7 nm, respectively. A decrease in the critical temperature with decreasing film thickness indicates mesoscopic behavior due to geometric and grain-size limitations. The results promise a scalable application of HfN and ZrN in quantum computing and related fields.

TI Evidence of decoupling of surface and bulk states in Dirac semimetal
   Cd3As2
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Dirac semimetals have attracted a great deal of current interests due to their potential applications in topological quantum computing, low-energy electronic devices, and single photon detection in the microwave frequency range. Herein are results from analyzing the low magnetic (B) field weak-antilocalization behaviors in a Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin flake device. At high temperatures, the phase coherence length l (phi) first increases with decreasing temperature (T) and follows a power law dependence of l (phi) proportional to T (-0.4). Below similar to 3 K, l (phi) tends to saturate to a value of similar to 180 nm. Another fitting parameter alpha, which is associated with independent transport channels, displays a logarithmic temperature dependence for T > 3 K, but also tends to saturate below similar to 3 K. The saturation value, similar to 1.45, is very close to 1.5, indicating three independent electron transport channels, which we interpret as due to decoupling of both the top and bottom surfaces as well as the bulk. This result, to our knowledge, provides first evidence that the surfaces and bulk states can become decoupled in electronic transport in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2.

TI Robust and compact reversible logic gate for low-power and
   high-performance computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Reversible logic is a design paradigm suitable to energy-efficient digital systems and has lately received recognition as a viable option for designing sophisticated digital applications. It possesses the capacity to revolutionize progress in quantum and low-power computing. This research presents an innovative reversible gate designed with merely 10 transistors. The suggested gate includes capabilities for several logic operations such as XOR, XNOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, half-adder and parity generator. This proposed design can attain a minimal quantum cost, which is strongly advocated in quantum computing. We have verified the design's resilience using Monte Carlo and process corner analysis after modeling it with Cadence Virtuoso at 45 nm technology and 1 V supply voltage. This confirms the robustness of the design amidst variation. In contrast to current reversible gates, the proposed structure achieves an 18 percent reduction in delay and a 12 percent reduction in power delay product, rendering it an appealing option for high-speed and low-energy circuit design. To illustrate its adaptability in alternative designs, we have utilized it to the construction of a 4-bit binary-to-Gray code converter circuit.

TI Anomalous magnetoresistance around the critical temperature in
   heterostructures of high-Tc superconducting
   YBa2Cu3O7-x and ferromagnetic
   SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Heterostructures based on superconductors and ferromagnets show strong potential for innovating device applications in spintronics and quantum computing. SrRuO3 (SRO) has recently attracted much attention among transition metal oxides because it is the only 4d oxide to exhibit itinerant ferromagnetism and metallic conductivity. YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) is one of the most studied high critical temperature (high-Tc) superconductors with a wide range of potential applications. We report morphological, structural, magnetic and magnetotransport characterization of YBCO/SRO (HS-YS) and SRO/YBCO (HS-SY) heterostructures grown on low miscut SrTiO3 (001) single crystals by high oxygen pressure sputtering. All samples exhibit epitaxial growth with good crystal quality and sharp interfaces. The heterostructures exhibit Tc of 87 K and 57 K for HS-YS and HS-SY, respectively, both reduced compared to bulk YBCO (91 K). The reduction in Tc and intriguing features in magnetoresistance measurements around the onset of superconductivity are robust indicators that a proximity effect takes place in such heterostructures, and inspire further theoretical and experimental investigations.

TI Harmonic balance simulation of the influence of component uniformity and
   reliability on the performance of a Josephson traveling wave parametric
   amplifier
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA), which is a quantum-limited amplifier with high gain and large bandwidth, is the core device of large-scale measurement and control systems for quantum computing. A typical JTWPA consists of thousands of Josephson junctions connected in series to form a transmission line and hundreds of shunt LC resonators periodically loaded along the line for phase matching. Because the variation of these capacitors and inductors can be detrimental to their high-frequency characteristics, the fabrication of a JTWPA typically necessitates precise processing equipment. To guide the fabrication process and further improve the design for manufacturability, it is necessary to understand how each electronic component affects the amplifier. In this paper, we use the harmonic balance method to conduct a comprehensive study on the impact of nonuniformity and fabrication yield of the electronic components on the performance of a JTWPA. The results provide insightful and scientific guidance for device design and fabrication processes.

TI Single atom in a superoscillatory optical trap
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Optical tweezers have become essential tools to manipulate atoms or molecules at a single particle level. However, using standard diffraction-limited optical systems, the transverse size of the trap is lower bounded by the optical wavelength, limiting the application range of optical tweezers. Here we report trapping of single ultracold atom in an optical trap that can be continuously tuned from a standard Airy focus to a subwavelength hotspot smaller than the usual Abbe's diffraction limit. The hotspot was generated using the effect of superoscillations, by the precise interference of multiple free-space coherent waves. We argue that superoscillatory trapping and continuous potential tuning offer not only a way to generate compact and tenable ensembles of trapped atoms for quantum simulators but will also be useful in single molecule quantum chemistry and the study of cooperative atom-photon interactions within subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters.
   Optical trapping of single atoms is relevant for applications to quantum chemistry and quantum computing. This works demonstrates the use of superoscillatory field leading to rapid local spatial variations of the intensity and phase of light to trap a single cold Caesium atom into a reconfigurable sub-wavelength optical trap.

TI Fortifying the Blockchain: A Systematic Review and Classification of
   Post-Quantum Consensus Solutions for Enhanced Security and Resilience
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The inherent security and computational demands of classical consensus protocols are often presumed impervious to various forms of attack. However, quantum computing advancements present considerable threats to the assumed attack resistance of classical security strategies currently deployed within blockchain systems. Adopting consensus algorithms fortified with post-quantum security measures can significantly enhance traditional blockchains' privacy and security dimensions. Notable advantages of such post-quantum solutions in blockchain consensus include accelerated transaction verification, clarified mining authorship, and resilience against quantum attacks. Yet, a comprehensive analysis of the implications of post-quantum solutions for blockchain consensus is notably absent in the existing scholarly discourse. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically reviewing Post-Quantum Blockchain Consensus (PQBC). The four primary contributions of this study are (i) a systematic approach to presenting a comprehensive overview of PQBC, (ii) the systematic selection and analysis of 29 key studies from an initial pool of 1192 papers, (iii) a critical review of methods, enhancements to security, scalability, trust, and privacy, as well as the evaluation employed for PQBC, and (iv) a discussion of primary gaps and prospective directions for future PQBC research.

TI Nonreciprocal transmission of multi-band optical signals in thermal
   atomic systems
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Multi-band signal propagation and processing play an important role in quantum communications and quantum computing. In recent years, optical nonreciprocal devices such as an optical isolator and circulator are proposed via various configurations of atoms, metamaterials, nonlinear waveguides, etc. In this work, we investigate all-optical controlled nonreciprocity of multi-band optical signals in thermal atomic systems. Via introducing multiple strong coupling fields, nonreciprocal propagation of the probe field can happen at some separated frequency bands, which results from combination of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect and atomic thermal motion. In the proposed configuration, the frequency shift resulting from atomic thermal motion takes converse effect on the probe field in the two opposite directions. In this way, the probe field can propagate almost transparently within some frequency bands of EIT windows in the opposite direction of the coupling fields. However, it is well blocked within the considered frequency region in the same direction of the coupling fields because of destruction of the EIT. Such selectable optical nonreciprocity and isolation for discrete signals may be greatly useful in controlling signal transmission and realizing selective optical isolation functions.

TI Nanomechanical Dissipation and Strain Engineering
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Nanomechanical resonators have applications in a wide variety of technologies ranging from biochemical sensors to mobile communications, quantum computing, inertial sensing, and precision navigation. The quality factor of the mechanical resonance is critical for many applications. Until recently, mechanical quality factors rarely exceeded a million. In the past few years however, new methods have been developed to exceed this boundary. These methods involve careful engineering of the structure of the nanomechanical resonator, including the use of acoustic bandgaps and nested structures to suppress dissipation into the substrate, and the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering to increase the mechanical frequency and suppress intrinsic dissipation. Together, they have allowed quality factors to reach values near a billion at room temperature, resulting in exceptionally low dissipation. This review aims to provide a pedagogical introduction to these new methods, primarily targeted to readers who are new to the field, together with an overview of the existing state-of-the-art, what may be possible in the future, and a perspective on the future applications of these extreme-high quality resonators.

TI Observation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB When magnetic atoms are inserted inside a superconductor, the superconducting order is locally depleted as a result of the antagonistic nature of magnetism and superconductivity. Thereby, distinctive spectral features, known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, appear inside the superconducting gap. The search for Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in different materials is intense, as they can be used as building blocks to promote Majorana modes suitable for topological quantum computing. Here, the first observation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in graphene, a non-superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is reported. Superconductivity in graphene is induced by proximity effect brought by adsorbing nanometer-scale superconducting Pb islands. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy the superconducting proximity gap is measured in graphene, and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states are visualized in graphene grain boundaries. The results reveal the very special nature of those Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, which extends more than 20 nm away from the grain boundaries. These observations provide the long-sought experimental confirmation that graphene grain boundaries host local magnetic moments and constitute the first observation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in a chemically pure system.

TI MgO surface lattice phonons observation during interstellar ice
   transition
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Relevant information on the origins of the solar system and the early evolution of life itself can be derive from systematic and controlled exploration of water ice here on Earth. Therefore, over the last decades, a huge effort on experimental methodologies has been made to study the multiple crystal ice phases, which are observed outside our home-gravitational-potential. By employing (100)-oriented MgO lattice surface as a microcantilever sensor, we conducted the first ever study on the dynamics of the Structural Phase Transition at 185 K in water ice by means of coherent elastic scattering of electron diffraction. We estimate the amount of phonons caused by this transition applying precise quantum computing key tools, and resulting in a maximum value of 1.23 +/- 0.02. Further applications of our microcantilever sensor were assessed using unambiguous mapping of the surface stress induced by the c(4x2) -> p(3x2) Structural Phase Transition of the interstellar ice formulated on the Williamsom-Hall model. This development paves the way and thus establishes an efficient characterization tool of the surface mechanical strains of materials with potential applications arising from interstellar ice inclusive glaciers to the wide spectrum of solid-state physics.

We characterize the sample complexity of binary quantum hypothesis testing in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.

TI Plumbene: a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental
   advances
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Plumbene, a two-dimensional (2D) material consisting of a single layer of lead (Pb) atoms in a honeycomb lattice, stands as a pioneering addition to the elemental 2D material family. This comprehensive review encapsulates the theoretical predictions and experimental advancements that underscore its potential. With properties shaped by significant spin-orbit coupling and structural buckling, plumbene offers a playground for phenomena like the quantum spin Hall effect, superconductivity, and topological phase transitions. Despite promising theoretical insights, experimental realization has encountered challenges, primarily due to high reactivity of Pb and the need for precise fabrication conditions. This paper critically examines the electronic, thermal, mechanical, and topological attributes of plumbene, alongside synthesis methods, functionalization techniques, and substrate effects. It further proposes directions for addressing synthesis challenges and integrating plumbene into advanced technologies, particularly in electronic, spintronic, and quantum computing applications. This review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and experimental progress, fostering a deeper understanding of this intriguing material.

TI Loss tangent fluctuations due to two-level systems in superconducting
   microwave resonators
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLSs). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor Qi as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of Qi at low powers over periods of 12-16 h (relative standard deviation sigma Qi/Qi=13%). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips, and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power Qi fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence, due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.

TI Zeeman- and Orbital-Driven Phase Shifts in Planar Josephson Junctions
SO ACS NANO
AB We perform supercurrent and tunneling spectroscopy measurements on gate-tunable InAs/Al Josephson junctions (JJs) in an in-plane magnetic field and report on phase shifts in the current-phase relation measured with respect to an absolute phase reference. The impact of orbital effects is investigated by studying multiple devices with different superconducting lead sizes. At low fields, we observe gate-dependent phase shifts of up to phi(0) = 0.5 pi, which are consistent with a Zeeman field coupling to highly transmissive Andreev bound states via Rashba spin-orbit interaction. A distinct phase shift emerges at larger fields, concomitant with a switching current minimum and the closing and reopening of the superconducting gap. These signatures of an induced phase transition, which might resemble a topological transition, scale with the superconducting lead size, demonstrating the crucial role of orbital effects. Our results elucidate the interplay of Zeeman, spin-orbit, and orbital effects in InAs/Al JJs, giving improved understanding of phase transitions in hybrid JJs and their applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.

TI Metaheuristics Algorithm-Based Minimization of Communication Costs in
   Federated Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Federated learning (FL) technique resolves the issue of training machine learning (ML) techniques on distributed networks, including the huge volume of modern smart devices. FL clients frequently use Wi-Fi and have to interact in unstable network surroundings. However, as the present FL aggregation approaches receive and send a large number of weights, accuracy can be decreased considerably in unstable network surroundings. Therefore, this study presents a Quantum with Metaheuristics Algorithm Based Minimization of Communication Costs in Federated Learning (QMAMCC-FL) technique. The presented QMAMCC-FL technique is designed a federated hybrid convolutional neural network with a gated recurrent unit (HCNN-GRU) model with a quantum Aquila optimization (QAO) algorithm. The QMAMCC-FL technique upgrades the global model via weight collection of the learned model, which is commonly used in FL. The proposed model can be employed to increase the performance of network communication and reduce the size of data transmitted from clients to servers such as smartphones and tablets. The experimental analysis of the QMAMCC-FL approach is tested, and the outcomes show better performance over other existing models.

TI Robust optimization for quantum reinforcement learning control using
   partial observations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The current quantum reinforcement learning control models often assume that the quantum states are known a priori for control optimization. However, full observation of the quantum state is experimentally infeasible due to the exponential scaling of the number of required quantum measurements on the number of qubits. In this paper, we investigate a robust reinforcement learning method using partial observations to overcome this difficulty. This control scheme is compatible with near-term quantum devices, where the noise is prevalent and predetermining the dynamics of the quantum state is practically impossible. We show that this simplified control scheme can achieve similar or even better performance when compared to the conventional methods relying on full observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme on examples of quantum state control and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It has been shown that high-fidelity state control can be achieved even if the noise amplitude is at the same level as the control amplitude. Besides, an acceptable level of optimization accuracy can be achieved for a QAOA with a noisy control Hamiltonian. This robust control optimization model can be trained to compensate for the uncertainties in practical quantum computing.

TI Least Squares Boosting Ensemble and Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm
   Optimization for Predicting the Surface Roughness in Face Milling
   Process of Aluminum Material
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Surface roughness is a significant factor in determining the product quality and highly impacts the production price. The ability to predict the surface roughness before production would save the time and resources of the process. This research investigated the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning and quantum behaved evolutionary computation methods in predicting the surface roughness of aluminum material in a face-milling machine. Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and least squares gradient boosting ensemble (LSBoost) were utilized to simulate numerous face milling experiments and have predicted the surface roughness values with high extent of accuracy. The algorithms have shown a superior prediction performance over genetics optimization algorithm (GA) and the classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) in terms of statistical performance indicators. The QPSO outperformed all the simulated algorithms with a root mean square error of RMSE = 2.17% and a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.95 that closely matches the actual surface roughness experimental values.

TI High Responsivity Circular Polarized Light Detectors based on Quasi
   Two-Dimensional Chiral Perovskite Films
SO ACS NANO
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) has considerable technological potential, from quantum computing to bioimaging. To maximize the opportunity, high performance photodetectors that can directly distinguish left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light are needed. Hybrid organic- inorganic perovskites containing chiral organic ligands are an emerging candidate for the active material in CPL photo-detecting devices, but current studies suggest there to be a trade-off between the ability to differentially absorb CPL and photocurrent responsivity in chiral perovskites devices. Here, we report a CPL detector based on quasi two-dimensional (quasi-2D) chiral perovskite films. We find it is possible to generate materials where the circular dichroism (CD) is comparable in both 2D and quasi-2D films, while the responsivity of the photodetector improves for the latter. Given this, we are able to showcase a CPL photodetector that exhibits both a high dissymmetry factor of 0.15 and a high responsivity of 15.7 A W-1. We believe our data further advocates the potential of chiral perovskites in CPL-dependent photonic technologies.

TI Half Metallic Ferromagnetism and Transport Properties of Zinc
   Chalcogenides ZnX2Se4 (X = Ti, V, Cr) for
   Spintronic Applications
SO MATERIALS
AB In ferromagnetic semiconductors, the coupling of magnetic ordering with semiconductor character accelerates the quantum computing. The structural stability, Curie temperature (T-c), spin polarization, half magnetic ferromagnetism and transport properties of ZnX2Se4 (X = Ti, V, Cr) chalcogenides for spintronic and thermoelectric applications are studied here by density functional theory (DFT). The highest value of T-c is perceived for ZnCr2Se4. The band structures in both spin channels confirmed half metallic ferromagnetic behavior, which is approved by integer magnetic moments (2, 3, 4) mu(B) of Ti, V and Cr based spinels. The HM behavior is further measured by computing crystal field energy & UDelta;E-crystal, exchange energies & UDelta;(x)(d), & UDelta;(x) (pd) and exchange constants (N-o alpha and N-o beta). The thermoelectric properties are addressed in terms of electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and power factor in within a temperature range 0-400 K. The positive Seebeck coefficient shows p-type character and the PF is highest for ZnTi2Se4 (1.2 x 10(11) W/mK(2)) among studied compounds.

TI Self-selective formation of ordered 1D and 2D GaBi structures on
   wurtzite GaAs nanowire surfaces
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Scaling down material synthesis to crystalline structures only few atoms in size and precisely positioned in device configurations remains highly challenging, but is crucial for new applications e.g., in quantum computing. We propose to use the sidewall facets of larger III-V semiconductor nanowires (NWs), with controllable axial stacking of different crystal phases, as templates for site-selective growth of ordered few atoms 1D and 2D structures. We demonstrate this concept of self-selective growth by Bi deposition and incorporation into the surfaces of GaAs NWs to form GaBi structures. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we observe the crystal structure dependent self-selective growth process, where ordered 1D GaBi atomic chains and 2D islands are alloyed into surfaces of the wurtzite (Wz) {11 (2) over bar0} crystal facets. The formation and lateral extension of these surface structures are controlled by the crystal structure and surface morphology uniquely found in NWs. This allows versatile high precision design of structures with predicted novel topological nature, by using the ability of NW heterostructure variations over orders of magnitude in dimensions with atomic-scale precision as well as controllably positioning in larger device structures.

TI Ultra-high-quality two-dimensional electron systems
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Two-dimensional electrons confined to GaAs quantum wells are hallmark platforms for probing electron-electron interactions. Many key observations have been made in these systems as sample quality has improved over the years. Here, we present a breakthrough in sample quality via source-material purification and innovation in GaAs molecular beam epitaxy vacuum chamber design. Our samples display an ultra-high mobility of 44 x 10(6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at an electron density of 2.0 x 10(11) cm(-2). These results imply only 1 residual impurity for every 10(10) Ga/As atoms. The impact of such low impurity concentration is manifold. Robust stripe and bubble phases are observed, and several new fractional quantum Hall states emerge. Furthermore, the activation gap (Delta) of the fractional quantum Hall state at the Landau-level filling (nu) = 5/2, which is widely believed to be non-Abelian and of potential use for topological quantum computing, reaches Delta approximate to 820 mK. We expect that our results will stimulate further research on interaction-driven physics in a two-dimensional setting and substantially advance the field.
   Source-material purification and optimized vacuum chamber design lead to a breakthrough in GaAs sample quality.

TI Large superconducting diode effect in ion-beam patterned Sn-based
   superconductor nanowire/topological Dirac semimetal planar
   heterostructures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-quality superconductor/topological material heterostructures are highly desired for realisation of topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. Here, we demonstrate a method to directly draw nanoscale superconducting beta-Sn patterns in the plane of a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) alpha-Sn thin film by irradiating a focused ion beam and taking advantage of the heat-driven phase transition of alpha-Sn into superconducting beta-Sn. The beta-Sn nanowires embedded in a TDS alpha-Sn thin film exhibit a large superconducting diode effect (SDE), whose rectification ratio eta reaches a maximum of 35% when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the current. The results suggest that the SDE may occur at the alpha-Sn/beta-Sn interfaces where the TDS alpha-Sn becomes superconducting by a proximity effect. Our work thus provides a universal platform for investigating quantum physics and devices based on topological superconducting circuits of any shape.
   Topological superconductivity may have important implications for fault-tolerant quantum computing, but its practical implementation remains challenging. Here, the authors report the fabrication of nanoscale heterojunctions based on superconducting beta-Sn and topological Dirac semimetal alpha-Sn, showing superconducting diode rectification ratios up to 35%.

AB Quantum computing is performed on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware in the short term. Only small circuits can be executed reliably on a quantum machine due to the unavoidable noisy quantum operations on NISQ devices, leading to the under-utilization of hardware resources. With the growing demand to access quantum hardware, how to utilize it more efficiently while maintaining output fidelity is becoming a timely issue. A parallel circuit execution technique has been proposed to address this problem by executing multiple programs on hardware simultaneously. It can improve the hardware throughput and reduce the overall runtime. However, accumulative noises such as crosstalk can decrease the output fidelity in parallel workload execution. In this paper, we first give an in-depth overview of state-of-the-art parallel circuit execution methods. Second, we propose a Quantum Crosstalk-aware Parallel workload execution method (QuCP) without the overhead of crosstalk characterization. Third, we investigate the trade-off between hardware throughput and fidelity loss to explore the hardware limitation with parallel circuit execution. Finally, we apply parallel circuit execution to VQE and zero-noise extrapolation error mitigation method to showcase its various applications on advancing NISQ computing.

TI A Searchable Encryption Scheme Based on Lattice for Log Systems in
   Blockchain
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB With the increasing popularity of cloud storage, data security on the cloud has become increasingly visible. Searchable encryption has the ability to realize the privacy protection and security of data in the cloud. However, with the continuous development of quantum computing, the standard Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) scheme cannot resist quantum based keyword guessing attacks. Further, the credibility of the server also poses a significant threat to the security of the retrieval process. This paper proposes a searchable encryption scheme based on lattice cryptography using blockchain to address the above problems. Firstly, we design a lattice-based encryption primitive to resist quantum keyword guessing attacks. Moreover, blockchain is to decentralize the cloud storage platform's jurisdiction of data. It also ensures that the traceability of keyword retrieval process and maintains the credibility of search result, which malicious platforms are prevented as much as possible from deliberately sending wrong search results. Last but not least, through security analysis, our proposed scheme satisfies the credibility and unforgeability of the keyword ciphertext. The comprehensive performance evaluates that our scheme has certain advantages in terms of efficiency compared with others.

TI ASSESSING THE AIRCRAFT CREW ACTIVITY BASING ON VIDEO OCULOGRAPHY DATA
SO EKSPERIMENTALNAYA PSIKHOLOGIYA
AB Mathematical models and methods for crew training level assessing based on video oculography data are presented. The results obtained are based on comparing the studied fragments of oculomotor activity of pilots with comparable patterns of video oculography data of various types and performance quality contained in a pre-formed specialized database. To obtain estimates, a complex combination of random process analysis and multivariate statistical analysis is used. The "intelligence" of diagnostic tools is contained in empirical data and can flexibly change as they accumulate. The considered example of determining the flight mode and pilot qualification based on video oculography data allows us to talk about the possibility of significant discrimination of the gaze movement trajectories of pilots at different flight phases and significant discrimination of the gaze movement trajectories of experienced and inexperienced pilots at certain phases of flight. An important new component of the presented results is a discriminant analysis for solving the problem of flight exercises classification, based on the principles of quantum computing. The scope of the considered approach is not limited to aviation applications and can be extended to tasks that are similar in content.

TI Spatially Controlled Optical Vortex Generation Using Low-Loss Antimony
   Telluride Metasurfaces
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Optical vortex beams, endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM) due to their helical wavefronts, are essential for advancements in optical manipulation, quantum computing, and communication technologies. Existing methods for generating vortex beams often struggle with issues such as low efficiency, limited scalability, and rigid control over beam properties. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel vortex beam generator utilizing a plasmonic metasurface constructed from the antimony telluride (Sb2Te3). Distinct from traditional plasmonic materials, Sb2Te3 offers significantly lower optical losses in the visible spectrum, enhancing both efficiency and beam quality. By integrating the Pancharatnam-Berry phase mechanism with Sb2Te3's low-loss characteristics, the approach facilitates unprecedented control over the beam's propagation trajectory and OAM mode. This design allows not only customizable beam trajectories but also manipulation of OAM for controlled topological charge evolution, which is beneficial for scalable and integrated photonic systems. The demonstrated vortex beam, using Sb2Te3, paves the way for more compact, efficient vortex beam generation, broadening their potential applications in photonic technologies.

TI Confining single Er3+ ions in sub-3 nm NaYF4
   nanoparticles to induce slow relaxation of the magnetisation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Molecular systems known as single-molecule magnets (SMMs) exhibit magnet-like behaviour of slow relaxation of the magnetisation and magnetic hysteresis and have potential application in high-density memory storage or quantum computing. Often, their intrinsic magnetic properties are plagued by low-energy molecular vibrations that lead to phonon-induced relaxation processes, however, there is no straightforward synthetic approach for molecular systems that would lead to a small amount of low-energy vibrations and low phonon density of states at the spin-resonance energies. In this work, we apply knowledge accumulated over the last decade in molecular magnetism to nanoparticles, incorporating Er3+ ions in an ultrasmall sub-3 nm diamagnetic NaYF4 nanoparticle (NP) and probing the slow relaxation dynamics intrinsic to the Er3+ ion. Furthermore, by increasing the doping concentration, we also investigate the role of intraparticle interactions within the NP. The knowledge gained from this study is anticipated to enable better design of magnetically high-performance molecular and bulk magnets for a wide variety of applications, such as molecular electronics.

AB Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, while accessible via cloud platforms, face challenges due to limited availability and suboptimal quality. These challenges raise the risk of cloud providers offering fraudulent services. This emphasizes the need for users to detect such fraud to protect their investments and ensure computational integrity. This study introduces a novel dynamic fingerprinting method for detecting fraudulent service provision on quantum cloud platforms, specifically targeting machine substitution and profile fabrication attacks. The dynamic fingerprint is constructed using a single probing circuit to capture the unique error characteristics of quantum devices, making this approach practical because of its trivial computational costs. When the user examines the service, the execution results of the probing circuit act as the device-side fingerprint of the quantum device providing the service. The user then generates the user-side fingerprint by estimating the expected execution result, assuming the correct device is in use. We propose an algorithm for users to construct the user-side fingerprint with linear complexity. By comparing the device-side and user-side fingerprints, users can effectively detect fraudulent services. Our experiments on the IBM Quantum platform, involving seven devices with varying capabilities, confirm the method's effectiveness.

TI Toward Quaternary QCA: Novel Majority and XOR Fuzzy Gates
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB As an emerging nanotechnology, quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) has been considered an alternative to CMOS technology that suffers from problems such as leakage current. Moreover, QCA is suitable for multi-valued logic due to the simplicity of implementing fuzzy logic in a way much easier than CMOS technology. This paper uses a quaternary cell with two isolated layers because of requiring three particles to design this quaternary cell. Moreover, due to the instability of the basic gates, the three particles cannot be placed in one layer. The first layer of the proposed two-layer cell includes a ternary cell and the second one includes a binary cell. It is assumed that the overall polarization of the quaternary QCA (QQCA) cell is determined as the combined polarization of the two layers. The proposed QQCA cell can also be implemented in one layer. Simulations of the QQCA cell are performed based on analytical calculations. Moreover, a majority fuzzy gate, an XOR fuzzy gate, and a crossbar structure are simulated.

TI Conditions for a quadratic quantum speedup in nonlinear transforms with
   applications to energy contract pricing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Computing nonlinear functions over multilinear forms is a general problem with applications in risk analysis. For instance in the domain of energy economics, accurate and timely risk management demands for efficient simulation of millions of scenarios, largely benefiting from computational speedups. We develop a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on polynomial approximation of nonlinear functions, computed through Quantum Hadamard Products, and we rigorously assess the conditions for its end-to-end speedup for different implementation variants against classical algorithms. In our setting, a quadratic quantum speedup, up to polylogarithmic factors, can be proven only when forms are bilinear and approximating polynomials have second degree, if efficient loading unitaries are available for the input data sets. We also enhance the bidirectional encoding, that allows tuning the balance between circuit depth and width, proposing an improved version that can be exploited for the calculation of inner products. Lastly, we exploit the dynamic circuit capabilities, recently introduced on IBM Quantum devices, to reduce the average depth of the Quantum Hadamard Product circuit. A proof of principle is implemented and validated on IBM Quantum systems.

TI Power monitoring in a feedforward photonic network using two output
   detectors
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Programmable feedforward photonic meshes of Mach-Zehnder interferometers are computational optical circuits that have many classical and quantum computing applications including machine learning, sensing, and telecommunications. Such devices can form the basis of energy-efficient photonic neural networks, which solve complex tasks using photonics-accelerated matrix multiplication on a chip, and which may require calibration and training mechanisms. Such training can benefit from internal optical power monitoring and physical gradient measurement for optimizing controllable phase shifts to maximize some task merit function. Here, we design and experimentally verify a new architecture capable of power monitoring any waveguide segment in a feedforward photonic circuit. Our scheme is experimentally realized by modulating phase shifters in a 6 x 6 triangular mesh silicon photonic chip, which can non-invasively (i.e., without any internal "power taps ") resolve optical powers in a 3 x 3 triangular mesh based on response measurements in only two output detectors. We measure roughly 3% average error over 1000 trials in the presence of systematic manufacturing and environmental drift errors and verify scalability of our procedure to more modes via simulation.

TI Generalised probabilistic theories in a new light
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In this paper, a modified formulation of generalised probabilistic theories that will always give rise to the structure of Hilbert space of quantum mechanics, in any finite outcome space, is presented and the guidelines to how to extend this work to infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces are given. Moreover, this new formulation which will be called as extended operational-probabilistic theories, applies not only to quantum systems, but also equally well to classical systems, without violating Bell's theorem, and at the same time solves the measurement problem. A new answer to the question of why our universe is quantum mechanical rather than classical will be presented. Besides, this extended probability theory shows that it is non-determinacy, or to be more precise, the non-deterministic description of the universe, that makes the laws of physics the way they are. In addition, this paper shows that there is still a possibility that there might be a deterministic level from which our universe emerges, which if understood correctly, may open the door wide to applications in areas such as quantum computing. In addition, this paper explains the deep reason why complex Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics are needed.

TI Kerr reversal in Josephson meta-material and traveling wave parametric
   amplification
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Josephson meta-materials have recently emerged as very promising platform for superconducting quantum science and technologies. Their distinguishing potential resides in ability to engineer them at sub-wavelength scales, which allows complete control over wave dispersion and nonlinear interaction. In this article we report a versatile Josephson transmission line with strong third order nonlinearity which can be tuned from positive to negative values, and suppressed second order non linearity. As an initial implementation of this multipurpose meta-material, we operate it to demonstrate reversed Kerr phase-matching mechanism in traveling wave parametric amplification. Compared to previous state of the art phase matching approaches, this reversed Kerr phase matching avoids the presence of gaps in transmission, can reduce gain ripples, and allows in situ tunability of the amplification band over an unprecedented wide range. Besides such notable advancements in the amplification performance with direct applications to superconducting quantum computing and generation of broadband squeezing, the in-situ tunability with sign reversal of the nonlinearity in traveling wave structures, with no counterpart in optics to the best of our knowledge, opens exciting experimental possibilities in the general framework of microwave quantum optics, single-photon detection and quantum limited amplification.

TI PPSEB: A Postquantum Public-Key Searchable Encryption Scheme on
   Blockchain for E-Healthcare Scenarios
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB In the current E-healthcare scenarios, medical institutions are used to encrypt the information and store it in an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system in order to ensure the privacy of medical information. To realize data sharing, a Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) scheme is indispensable, ensuring doctors search for medical information in the state of ciphertext. However, the traditional PEKS scheme cannot resist the keyword guessing quantum computing attacks, and its security depends on the confidentiality of the secret key. In addition, classical PEKS hand over the search process to a third party, affecting the search results' accuracy. Therefore, we proposed a postquantum Public-key Searchable Encryption scheme on Blockchain (PPSEB) for E-healthcare scenarios. Firstly, we utilized a lattice-based cryptographic primitive to ensure the security of the search process and achieve forward security to avoid key leakage of medical information. Secondly, we introduced blockchain technology to solve the problem of third-party untrustworthiness in the search process. Finally, through security analysis, we prove the correctness and forward security of the solution in the E-healthcare scenarios, and the comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of our scheme compared with other existing schemes.

TI Leveraging AI in Photonics and Beyond
SO PHOTONICS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been spreading in most scientific areas and have become a heated focus in photonics research in recent years. Forward modeling and inverse design using AI can achieve high efficiency and accuracy for photonics components. With AI-assisted electronic circuit design for photonics components, more advanced photonics applications have emerged. Photonics benefit a great deal from AI, and AI, in turn, benefits from photonics by carrying out AI algorithms, such as complicated deep neural networks using photonics components that use photons rather than electrons. Beyond the photonics domain, other related research areas or topics governed by Maxwell's equations share remarkable similarities in using the help of AI. The studies in computational electromagnetics, the design of microwave devices, as well as their various applications greatly benefit from AI. This article reviews leveraging AI in photonics modeling, simulation, and inverse design; leveraging photonics computing for implementing AI algorithms; and leveraging AI beyond photonics topics, such as microwaves and quantum-related topics.

TI Experimental Characterization of the MOSFET Fano Factor at Cryogenic
   Temperatures for Accurate Cryo-CMOS RF Modeling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB Multiple independent researchers have hypothesized that MOSFET channel noise can be described down to deep cryogenic temperatures using a temperature-independent suppressed shot noise model containing just one fitting parameter, the Fano factor F . However, experimental data to back-up these claims have not been available to date. In this article, we describe a carefully constructed experiment through which we are able to provide such data. Using a combination of room temperature and cryogenic MOSFET measurements in conjunction with cryogenic amplifier measurements, we extract F at both room temperature and 8K for transistors from 22 nm FDSOI, 45 nm PDSOI and 65nm bulk CMOS processes over a range of current densities. We find that, as predicted, F does indeed appear to be temperature-independent. The implications of this finding are described, both in terms of the transistor noise parameters as well as the parameters used in conventional MOSFET channel noise models.

TI Broadband and fabrication-tolerant 3-dB couplers with topological valley
   edge modes
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB 3-dB couplers, which are commonly used in photonic integrated circuits for on-chip information processing, precision measurement, and quantum computing, face challenges in achieving robust performance due to their limited 3-dB bandwidths and sensitivity to fabrication errors. To address this, we introduce topological physics to nanophotonics, developing a framework for topological 3-dB couplers. These couplers exhibit broad working wavelength range and robustness against fabrication dimensional errors. By leveraging valley-Hall topology and mirror symmetry, the photonic-crystal-slab couplers achieve ideal 3-dB splitting characterized by a wavelength-insensitive scattering matrix. Tolerance analysis confirms the superiority on broad bandwidth of 48 nm and robust splitting against dimensional errors of 20 nm. We further propose a topological interferometer for on-chip distance measurement, which also exhibits robustness against dimensional errors. This extension of topological principles to the fields of interferometers, may open up new possibilities for constructing robust wavelength division multiplexing, temperature-drift-insensitive sensing, and optical coherence tomography applications.
   By bridging topology with nanophotonics, we realize on-chip topological 3-dB couplers with the superiority on the broad bandwidth of 48 nm and the tolerance against dimensional errors of 20 nm.

TI Interfacially Enhanced Superconductivity in
   Fe(Te,Se)/Bi4Te3 Heterostructures
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Realizing topological superconductivity by integrating high-transition-temperature (T-C) superconductors with topological insulators can open new paths for quantum computing applications. Here, a new approach is reported for increasing the superconducting transition temperature (T-C(onset)) by interfacing the unconventional superconductor Fe(Te,Se) with the topological insulator Bi-Te system in the low-Se doping regime, near where superconductivity vanishes in the bulk. The critical finding is that the T-C(onset) of Fe(Te,Se) increases from nominally non-superconducting to as high as 12.5 K when Bi2Te3 is replaced with the topological phase Bi4Te3. Interfacing Fe(Te,Se) with Bi4Te3 is also found to be critical for stabilizing superconductivity in monolayer films where T-C(onset) can be as high as 6 K. Measurements of the electronic and crystalline structure of the Bi4Te3 layer reveal that a large electron transfer, epitaxial strain, and novel chemical reduction processes are critical factors for the enhancement of superconductivity. This novel route for enhancing T-C in an important epitaxial system provides new insight on the nature of interfacial superconductivity and a platform to identify and utilize new electronic phases.

TI Lattice-Based Authentication Scheme to Prevent Quantum Attack in Public
   Cloud Environment
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Public cloud computing provides a variety of services to consumers via high-speed internet. The consumer can access these services anytime and anywhere on a balanced service cost. Many traditional authentication protocols are proposed to secure public cloud computing. However, the rapid development of high-speed internet and organizations' race to develop quantum computers is a nightmare for existing authentication schemes. These traditional authentication protocols are based on factorization or discrete logarithm problems. As a result, traditional authentication protocols are vulnerable in the quantum computing era. Therefore, in this article, we have proposed an authentication protocol based on the lattice technique for public cloud computing to resist quantum attacks and prevent all known tradi-tional security attacks. The proposed lattice-based authentication protocol is provably secure under the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model. At the same time, the result obtained during the experiments proved that our protocol is lightweight compared to the existing lattice-based authentication protocols, as listed in the performance analysis section. The comparative analysis shows that the protocol is suitable for practical implementation in a quantum-based environment.

TI The taming of Clar's hydrocarbon
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Triangulene is the smallest non-Kekule graphene fragment known as Clar's hydrocarbon. Due to its open-shell electronic structure, triangulene is a promising molecular building block of carbon-based organic materials for spintronics and quantum molecular science. It comprises six benzenoid rings arranged in a triangular shape with two unpaired electrons delocalized over the entire conjugated core, making this molecule highly reactive. A triplet ground state is predicted for this hydrocarbon by Ovchinnikov's rule, or Lieb's theorem, in accord with Hund's rule. The pioneering work on triangulene was performed almost 70 years ago by Erich Clar, who attempted to prepare the pristine compound. Since then, several synthetic approaches to prepare this molecule have been exploited. The extreme reactivity of triangulene can be circumvented using on-surface techniques or by installation of sterically demanding substituents, which kinetically stabilize the diradical core against oligomerization in solution. The first two examples of a persistent derivative of triangulene were simultaneously and independently developed last year. This article presents a historical development in the synthesis of triangulene and its derivatives and outlines possible future applications in ferromagnetic materials, electrically conductive polymers or quantum computing.

TI Exceptionally High Blocking Temperature of 17 K in a Surface-Supported
   Molecular Magnet
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are among the most promising building blocks for future magnetic data storage or quantum computing applications, owing to magnetic bistability and long magnetic relaxation times. The practical device integration requires realization of 2D surface assemblies of SMMs, where each magnetic unit shows magnetic relaxation being sufficiently slow at application-relevant temperatures. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, it is shown that sub-monolayers of Dy-2@C-80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerenes prepared on graphene by electrospray deposition exhibit magnetic behavior fully comparable to that of the bulk. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature T-B(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk sample but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface-supported single-molecule magnet. The reported findings give a boost to the efforts to stabilize and address the spin degree of freedom in molecular magnets aiming at the realization of SMM-based spintronic units.

TI Amplitude Ratios and Neural Network Quantum States
SO QUANTUM
AB Neural Network Quantum States (NQS) represent quantum wavefunctions by artificial neural networks. Here we study the wavefunction access provided by NQS defined in [Science, 355, 6325, pp. 602-606 (2017)] and relate it to results from distribution testing. This leads to improved distribution testing algorithms for such NQS. It also motivates an independent definition of a wavefunction access model: the amplitude ratio access. We compare it to sample and sample and query access models, previously considered in the study of dequantization of quantum algorithms. First, we show that the amplitude ratio access is strictly stronger than sample access. Second, we argue that the amplitude ratio access is strictly weaker than sample and query access, but also show that it retains many of its simulation capabilities. Interestingly, we only show such separation under computational assumptions. Lastly, we use the connection to distribution testing algorithms to produce an NQS with just three nodes that does not encode a valid wavefunction and cannot be sampled from.

TI Quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence
SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
AB Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces a quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a levelset method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the scalar field offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimisation is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.

TI Electronic and optical properties of molybdenum disulfide
   (MoS2) mono layer using density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This work presents a detailed computational study of the electronic and optical properties of monolayer MoS2, focusing on its potential for optoelectronic and quantum applications. This study employs first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TDDFPT) to investigate the material's band structure, projected density of states (PDOS), absorption spectrum, dielectric function, and joint density of states (JDOS). The direct bandgap at the K-point, as revealed by the band structure, highlights MoS2's suitability for high-efficiency photodetectors and light-emitting devices. The PDOS and absorption spectrum confirm the dominant role of Mo-d and S-p orbitals in shaping the conduction and valence bands, respectively, with the absorption peak at 0.94 eV aligning with experimental observations. The dielectric function reveals a smooth transition from transparency to refractivity at higher photon energies, supporting its potential in photonic and integrated circuit applications. In addition, the JDOS shows selective optical transitions, suggesting MoS2's promise for UV detection and high-energy light emitters. These findings establish monolayer MoS2 as a versatile material with significant promise for future optoelectronic systems and quantum computing applications.

TI Fast ground-state-to-ground-state separation of small ion crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Rapid separation of linear crystals of trapped ions into different subsets is critical for realizing trapped ion quantum computing architectures where ions are rearranged in trap arrays to achieve all-to-all connectivity between qubits. We introduce a general theoretical framework that can be used to describe the separation of same-species and mixed-species crystals into smaller subsets. The framework relies on an efficient description of the evolution of Gaussian motional states under quadratic Hamiltonians that only requires a special solution of the classical equations of motion of the ions to describe their quantum evolution under the influence of a time-dependent applied potential and the ions' mutual Coulomb repulsion. We provide time-dependent applied potentials suitable for separation of a mixed-species three-ion crystal on timescales similar to that of free expansion driven by Coulomb repulsion, with all modes along the crystal axis starting and ending close to their ground states. Three separately confined mixed-species ions can be combined into a crystal held in a single well without energy gain by time-reversal of this separation process.

AB Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT) is a novel technology that allows charging an electric vehicle while driving thanks to a dedicated road infrastructure. DWPT's capabilities in automatically establishing charging sessions and billing without users' intervention make it prone to cybersecurity attacks. Hence, security is essential in preventing fraud, impersonation, and user tracking. To this aim, researchers proposed different solutions for authenticating users. However, recent advancements in quantum computing jeopardize classical public key cryptography, making currently existing solutions in DWPT authentication nonviable. To avoid the resource burden imposed by technology upgrades, it is essential to develop post-quantum-resistant solutions. In this paper, we propose DynamiQS, the first post-quantum secure authentication protocol for dynamic wireless charging. DynamiQS is privacy-preserving and secure against attacks on the DWPT. We leverage an Identity-Based Encryption with Lattices in the Ring Learning With Error framework. Furthermore, we show the possibility of using DynamiQS in a real environment, leveraging the results of cryptographic computation on real constrained devices and simulations. DynamiQS reaches a total time cost of around 281 ms, which is practicable in dynamic charging settings (car and charging infrastructure).

TI Floquet topological superconductors with many Majorana edge modes:
   topological invariants, entanglement spectrum and bulk-edge
   correspondence
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB One-dimensional (1D) Floquet topological superconductors possess two types of degenerate Majorana edge modes at zero and p quasienergies, leaving more room for the design of boundary time crystals and quantum computing schemes than their static counterparts. In this work, we discover Floquet superconducting phases with large topological invariants and arbitrarily many Majorana edge modes in periodically driven Kitaev chains (KCs). Topological winding numbers defined for the Floquet operator and Floquet entanglement Hamiltonian are found to generate consistent predictions about the phase diagram, bulk-edge correspondence and numbers of zero and p Majorana edge modes of the system under different driving protocols. The bipartite entanglement entropy further shows non-analytic behaviors around the topological transition point between different Floquet superconducting phases. These general features are demonstrated by investigating the KC with periodically kicked pairing or hopping amplitudes. Our discovery reveals the rich topological phases and many Majorana edge modes that could be brought about by periodic driving fields in 1D superconducting systems. It further introduces a unified description for a class of Floquet topological superconductors from their quasienergy bands and entanglement properties.

TI Low-threshold InP quantum dot and InGaP quantum well visible lasers on

SO OPTICA
AB Monolithically combining silicon nitride (SiNx) photonics technology with III-V active devices could open a broad range of on-chip applications spanning a wide wavelength range of similar to 400-4000 nm. With the development of nitride, arsenide, and antimonide lasers based on quantum well (QW) and quantum dot (QD) active regions, the wavelength palette of integrated III-V lasers on Si currently spans 400 nm to 11 mu m, with a crucial gap in the red-wavelength regime of 630-750 nm. Here, we demonstrate red In0.6Ga0.4 PQW and far-red In PQD lasers monolithically grown on CMOS-compatible Si (001) substrates with continuous-wave operation at room temperature. A low-threshold current density of 550 A/cm(2) and 690 A/cm(2) with emission at 680-730 nm was achieved for QW and QD lasers on Si, respectively. This work represents a step toward the integration of visible red lasers on Si, allowing the utilization of integrated photonics for applications including biophotonic sensing, quantum computing, and near-eye displays.

TI Statistical field theory of the transmission of nerve impulses
SO THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING
AB Background: Stochastic processes leading voltage-gated ion channel dynamics on the nerve cell membrane are a sufficient condition to describe membrane conductance through statistical mechanics of disordered and complex systems.
   Results: Voltage-gated ion channels in the nerve cell membrane are described by the Ising model. Stochastic circuit elements called "Ising Neural Machines" are introduced. Action potentials are described as quasi-particles of a statistical field theory for the Ising system.
   Conclusions: The particle description of action potentials is a new point of view and a powerful tool to describe the generation and propagation of nerve impulses, especially when classical electrophysiological models break down.
   The particle description of action potentials allows us to develop a new generation of devices to study neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, even integrated by connectomes. It is also suitable for the study of complex networks, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, cryptography, ultra-fast lines for entanglement experiments and many other applications of medical, physical and engineering interest.

TI Proxy Signature for Sensor Networks against Cyber Attack
SO SENSORS AND MATERIALS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) needs complex sensor networks. The increasing number of sensors and their networks underlines the importance of network security. Traditional digital signature schemes validate signatures from each node of networks, which need huge resources for storage and computation. To reduce the resources needed for security, a new scheme with a proxy signature is proposed. If an IoT application adopts the scheme and assigns its signing rights to the underlying nodes, the storage of their public keys is no longer necessary as the application trusts the signing rights. The development of computing technology introduces many risks to cryptographic schemes with a traditional digital signature, and a system with improved security at the quantum-resistant level is required. We propose a scheme with lattice-based cryptography using the bonsai-tree technique for a security system. The new scheme effectively protects the system from a chosen static message attack in the standard model. In the new scheme, an IoT application securely recognizes its honest nodes in the underlying sensor networks at a low storage cost, even in quantum computing.

TI Tunable multiple optomechanically induced transparency and slow/fast
   light via optical parametric amplifiers in a distant electro-optical
   system
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB We investigate the tunable multiple optomechanically induced transparency in a distant electro-optical system. It consists of two distant optomechanical cavities with two optical parametric amplifiers, which are coupled to charged mechanical oscillators by Coulomb interaction. The system displays the phenomena of tunable multiple optomechanically induced transparency. Specifically, the number and the width of the transparency windows can be manipulated by the coupling parameters. It is found that the larger the Coulomb coupling between the two mechanical resonators, and the coupling between the cavities, as well as the parametric gain of the optical parametric amplifier, the wider the transparency windows. Furthermore, we also study the slow/fast light effect associated with the rapid phase dispersion and group delay of the output probe field. Our approach is feasible for controlling multipartite induced transparency, which represents a valuable step toward quantum networks with photonic and phononic circuits.

TI Nonequilibrium quantum battery based on quantum measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose and analyze the charging and discharging processes of measurement-assisted quant um batteries, exploring how different measurement schemes affect their performance. It is found that applying projective measurements with a general basis and optimizing the measurement parameters can enhance the battery's performance, including increases in both charging energy and ergotropy. Compared to local measurement schemes, the quantum battery exhibits significantly improved performance under nonlocal measurement schemes. However, this performance improvement comes at the cost of higher resource expenditure in nonlocal schemes. Additionally, the quantum battery can function as a quantum energy source, driving the qubit-resonator system to facilitate energy pumping. Our findings provide deeper insights into the fundamental properties of quantum batteries driven by quantum measurements, offering a pathway toward the design of more efficient and controllable quantum battery systems.

The interactions were studied using multi-frequency cw EPR: in a trimer linked via non-covalent H-bonding interactions no measurable interaction between rings was seen, while in a trimer linked via iso-nicotinate groups isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of +0.42 and -0.8 GHz, respectively, were observed. The latter are the same as those for a simpler hetero-dimer system, showing how the spin-spin interactions can be built in a predictable and modular manner in these systems.

   loss
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) enable high-bandwidth neuromorphic processors and low-decoherence quantum computing on chip-scale platforms, but robust, scalable optical packaging remains a major challenge. Efficient fiber-to-chip coupling is critical to minimize loss and maintain high optical bandwidth for photonic computing. We present a plug-and-play fiber-to-PIC solution using female multifiber termination push-on cables, with alignment counterparts additively fabricated on the chip via two-photon polymerization. We develop 3D out-of-plane couplers achieving -0.41-decibel peak transmission and broadband performance with losses below 0.55 decibels in the 1500-to 1600-nanometer range. Integration with the plug-and-play interface adds only 0.37 +/- 0.12 decibels, yielding a record-low 0.78-decibel loss for passive out-of-plane packaging. Reproducibility is demonstrated by interfacing a 17-port photonic circuit for incoherent photonic computing, coupling the full 100-nanometer spectrum of a superluminescent LED to enable low-noise operation at 17.6 gigabaud. This passive, multiport, and reconfigurable approach delivers high performance, reliability, and versatility, advancing photonic packaging toward the scalability of electronic chip integration.

AB In recent years, short squeeze events, such as the GameStop case in early 2021, have gained prominence, highlighting the need for advanced analyses of such phenomena. While traditional econometric and neural network approaches have struggled with predictive accuracy, our study addresses these gaps by analyzing the GameStop short squeeze using high-frequency intraday market data. We propose a novel hybrid approach that integrates an Autoregressive Moving Average-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model with Neural Networks, as well as exploiting fractal dynamics to capture multiscale temporal dependencies and hierarchical patterns in financial markets. This fractal framework effectively addresses the nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the financial markets. Our methods deliver high predictive accuracy, with the ARMA-GARCH-Quantum approach standing out. This method highlights its greater adaptability and accuracy, proving the benefits of integrating fractal principles into predictive modeling. By enhancing adaptability and precision, this study contributes valuable tools for market forecasting and risk management, aiding regulators and financial managers in monitoring and mitigating abnormal price movements that could distort markets or spark crises.

In this study, theoretical simulations of the local environment and experimental analyses on the luminescent characteristics of what we believe to be a novel Nd3+doped fluoro-sulfo-phosphate (FSP) laser glass were performed to mitigate the concentration and hydroxyl quenching effects. Based on that, a highly Nd3+-doped (4 mol%) FSP fiber with a large emission cross-section (3.24 x 10-20 cm2), wide bandwidth (33.7 nm), long lifetime (354 mu s), and high gain coefficient (4.24 dB/cm) was designed. Utilizing this fiber, a 1065 nm SFFL with a low pump threshold of 18 mW, a narrow linewidth of 6.5 kHz, and a 0.9 mu m compact all-fiber laser were demonstrated, highlighting the potential of Nd3+-doped FSP fiber in high-performance fiber lasers.

In addition to the study of a spherical-shell-shaped BEC, we studied the formation of a cylindrical-shell-shaped harmonically-trapped dipolar BEC of164Dy atoms theoretically using an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high atom density. To test the robustness of the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC, here we study its expansion in the same model. We find that as the harmonic trap in the x and y directions are removed, maintaining the axial trap, the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC expands in the x-y plane without deformation, maintaining its shell-shaped structure. After an adequate radial expansion, the axial trap can be relaxed for a desired axial expansion of the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC allowing its observation.

AB Invertible programming languages specify transformations to be run in two directions, such as compression/decompression or encryption/decryption. Two key concepts in invertible programming languages are partial invertibility and local invertibility. Partial invertibility lets invertible code be parameterized by the results of non-invertible code, whereas local invertibility requires all code to be invertible. The former allows for more flexible programming, while the latter has connections to domains such as low-energy computing and quantum computing. We find that existing approaches lack a satisfying treatment of partial invertibility, leaving the connection to local invertibility unclear.
   In this paper, we identify four core constructs for partially invertible programming, and show how to give them a locally invertible interpretation. We show the expressiveness of the constructs by designing the functional invertible language Kalpis, and show how to give them a locally invertible semantics using the novel arrow combinator language rrArr-the key idea is viewing partial invertibility as an invertible effect. By formalizing the two systems and giving Kalpis semantics by translation to rrArr, we reconcile partial and local invertibility, solving an open problem in the field. All formal developments are mechanized in Agda.

TI Rydberg Macrodimers: Diatomic Molecules on the Micrometer Scale
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Controlling molecular binding at the level of single atoms is one of the holy grails of quantum chemistry. Rydberg macrodimers-bound states between highly excited Rydberg atoms -provide a novel perspective in this direction. Resulting from binding potentials formed by the strong, long-range interactions of Rydberg states, Rydberg macrodimers feature bond lengths in the micrometer regime, exceeding those of conventional molecules by orders of magnitude. Using single-atom control in quantum gas microscopes, the unique properties of these exotic states can be studied with unprecedented control, including the response magnetic fields or the polarization of light in their photoassociation. The high accuracy achieved in spectroscopic studies macrodimers makes them an ideal testbed to benchmark Rydberg interactions, with direct relevance to quantum computing and information protocols where these are employed. This review provides a historic overview and summarizes the recent findings in the field of Rydberg macrodimers. Furthermore, it presents new data on interactions between macrodimers, leading to a phenomenon analogous to Rydberg blockade at the level of molecules, opening the path toward studying many-body systems of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules.

TI Materials for emergent silicon-integrated optical computing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Progress in computing architectures is approaching a paradigm shift: traditional computing based on digital complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology is nearing physical limits in terms of miniaturization, speed, and, especially, power consumption. Consequently, alternative approaches are under investigation. One of the most promising is based on a "brain-like" or neuromorphic computation scheme. Another approach is quantum computing using photons. Both of these approaches can be realized using silicon photonics, and at the heart of both technologies is an efficient, ultra-low power broad band optical modulator. As silicon modulators suffer from relatively high power consumption, materials other than silicon itself have to be considered for the modulator. In this Perspective, we present our view on such materials. We focus on oxides showing a strong linear electro-optic effect that can also be integrated with Si, thus capitalizing on new materials to enable the devices and circuit architectures that exploit shifting computational machine learning paradigms, while leveraging current manufacturing infrastructure. This is expected to result in a new generation of computers that consume less power and possess a larger bandwidth.

TI Decoding Quantum Search Advantage: The Critical Role of State Properties
   in Random Walks
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum algorithms have demonstrated provable speedups over classical counterparts, yet establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand the quantum advantage remains a core challenge. In this work, we decode the quantum search advantage by investigating the critical role of quantum state properties in random-walk-based algorithms. We propose three distinct variants of quantum random-walk search algorithms and derive exact analytical expressions for their success probabilities. These probabilities are fundamentally determined by specific initial state properties: the coherence fraction governs the first algorithm's performance, while entanglement and coherence dominate the outcomes of the second and third algorithms, respectively. We show that increased coherence fraction enhances success probability, but greater entanglement and coherence reduce it in the latter two cases. These findings reveal fundamental insights into harnessing quantum properties for advantage and guide algorithm design. Our searches achieve Grover-like speedups and show significant potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.

TI Exponential Speedups for Quantum Walks in Random Hierarchical Graphs
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB There are few known exponential speedups for quantum algorithms and these tend to fall into even fewer families. One speedup that has mostly resisted generalization is the use of quantum walks to traverse the welded-tree graph, due to Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman. We show how to generalize this to a large class of hierarchical graphs in which the vertices are grouped into "supervertices" which are arranged according to a d-dimensional lattice. Supervertices can have different sizes, and edges between supervertices correspond to random connections between their constituent vertices. The hitting times of quantum walks on these graphs are related to the localization properties of zero modes in certain disordered tight binding Hamiltonians. The speedups range from superpolynomial to exponential, depending on the underlying dimension and the random graph model. We also provide concrete realizations of these hierarchical graphs, and introduce a general method for constructing graphs with efficient quantum traversal times using graph sparsification.

TI Quantum analog of the maximum power transfer theorem
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We discover the quantum analog of the well-known classical maximum power transfer theorem. Our theoretical framework considers the continuous steady-state problem of coherent energy transfer through an N-node bosonic network coupled to an external dissipative load. We present an exact solution for optimal power transfer in the form of the maximum power transfer theorem known in the design of electrical circuits. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of quantum impedance matching with Thevenin equivalent networks, which are shown to be exact analogs to their classical counterparts. Our results are applicable to both ordered and disordered quantum networks with graph-like structures ranging from nearest-neighbor to all-to-all connectivities. This work points towards universal design principles adapting ideas from the classical regime to the quantum domain for various quantum optical applications in energy-harvesting, wireless power transfer, and energy transduction.

TI Circular photonic crystal grating design for charge-tunable quantum
   light sources in the telecom C-band
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Efficient generation of entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths is a key ingredient for long-range quantum networks. While embedding semiconductor quantum dots into hybrid circular Bragg gratings has proven effective, it conflicts with p - i - n diode heterostructures which offer superior coherence. We propose and analyze hybrid circular photonic crystal gratings, incorporating air holes to facilitate charge carrier transport without compromising optical properties. Through numerical simulations, a broad cavity mode with a Purcell factor of 23 enhancing both exciton and biexciton transitions, and exceptional collection efficiency of 92.4% into an objective with numerical aperture of 0.7 are achieved. Furthermore, our design demonstrates direct coupling efficiency over 90.5% into a single -mode fiber over the entire telecom C -band. The hybrid circular photonic crystal grating thereby emerges as a promising solution for the efficient generation of highly coherent, polarization -entangled photon pairs.

TI Inverse Design of Ultrathin Metamaterial Absorber
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Electromagnetic absorbers combining ultrathin profiles with robust absorptivity across wide incidence angles are essential for applications such as stealth applications, wireless communications, and quantum computing. Traditional designs, including Salisbury screens, typically require thicknesses of at least a quarter-wavelength (lambda/4), restricting their use in compact systems. While metamaterial absorbers (MMAs) offer reduced thicknesses, their absorptivity generally decreases under oblique incidence conditions. Here, we introduce an adjoint optimization-based inverse design method that merges the ultrathin advantage of MMAs with the angle-insensitive characteristics of Salisbury screens. By leveraging the computational efficiency of the adjoint method, we systematically optimize absorber structures as thin as lambda/20. The optimized structures achieve absorption exceeding 90% at the target frequency (7.5 GHz) and demonstrate robust performance under oblique incidence, maintaining over 90% absorption up to 50 degrees, approximately 80% at 60 degrees, and around 70% at 70 degrees. Comparative analysis against particle swarm optimization further highlights the superior efficiency of the adjoint method, reducing the computational effort by approximately 98%. This inverse design framework thus provides substantial improvements in both the performance and computational cost, offering a promising solution for advanced electromagnetic absorber design.

TI Industrial Policy in the Competition Between an Existing Hegemon and a
   Rising Superpower: The Case of the US and China
SO CHINESE ECONOMY
AB Central to the current US-China geopolitical rivalry is the strategic use of industrial policy (IP) by both countries, which is an unexpected reverse of view on IP. This paper examines the role of IP in the economic competition between the US, the incumbent global hegemon, and China, the rising superpower. Both countries increasingly view IP as essential to winning the rivalry. While the methods differ -more market-driven in the US and more state-led in China - their IP reflects shared goals: securing technological leadership and strengthening national security through self-reliance. China's IP works well in achieving scale, coordination, and technological catch-up, particularly in manufacturing and infrastructure-based sectors. Its strategy can effectively target national priorities but may limit creativity and dynamic innovation. IP in the US works better in fostering breakthrough innovations in fields like artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, and quantum computing. But the US may need to improve its long-term planning and government support for critical technologies like semiconductors and clean energy. The two models are likely to coexist, each dominating different areas of technological competition.

TI Mitigating coherent loss in superconducting circuits using molecular
   self-assembled monolayers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In planar superconducting circuits, decoherence due to materials imperfections, especially two-level-system (TLS) defects at different interfaces, is a primary hurdle for advancing quantum computing and sensing applications. Traditional methods for mitigating TLS loss, such as etching oxide layers at metal and substrate interfaces, have proven to be inadequate due to the persistent challenge of oxide regrowth. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that employs molecular self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to chemically bind at different interfaces of superconducting circuits. This technique is specifically tested here on coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators, in which this method not only impedes oxide regrowth after surface etching but can also tailors the dielectric properties at different resonators interfaces. The deployment of SAMs results in a consistent improvement in the measured quality factors across multiple resonators, surpassing those with only oxide-etched resonators. The efficiency of our approach i3s supported by microwave measurements of multiple devices conducted at millikelvin temperatures and correlated with detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations of SAM-passivated resonators. The compatibility of SAMs materials with the established fabrication techniques offers a promising route to improve the performance of superconducting quantum devices.

TI Pulse optimization for high-precision motional-mode characterization in
   trapped-ion quantum computers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB High-fidelity operation of quantum computers requires precise knowledge of the physical system through characterization. For motion-mediated entanglement generation in trapped ions, it is crucial to have precise knowledge of the motional-mode parameters such as the mode frequencies and the Lamb-Dicke parameters. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art mode-characterization schemes do not easily render the mode parameters in a sufficiently accurate and efficient fashion for large-scale devices, due to the unwanted excitation of adjacent modes in the frequency space when targeting a single mode, an effect known as the cross-mode coupling. Here, we develop an alternative scheme that leverages the degrees of freedom in pulse design for the characterization experiment such that the effects of the cross-mode coupling is actively silenced. Further, we devise stabilization methods to accurately characterize the Lamb-Dicke parameters even when the mode frequencies are not precisely known due to experimental drifts or characterization inaccuracies. We extensively benchmark our scheme in simulations of a three-ion chain and discuss the parameter regimes in which the shaped pulses significantly outperform the traditional square pulses.

TI Energy efficient half-flux-quantum circuit aiming at milli-kelvin stage
   operation
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Half-flux-quantum (HFQ) circuits are based on 0-7r superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and is one of the energy-efficient superconductor digital circuits. The bit energy is determined by the critical current Icn of 0-7r SQUID, which can be easily tuned with the loop inductance and junction critical current. In this work, an alternative 7r-7r-7r SQUID is adopted to demonstrate HFQ circuits to simplify the fabrication process and enhance circuit energy efficiency. The properties of superconductor/ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions (7r-JJs) are measured with temperature dependence from 4.2 K down to 10 mK. HFQ toggle flip-flops (TFFs) are successfully demonstrated at frequencies of up to 6.7 GHz and 44.5 GHz at temperatures of 4.2 K and 10 mK, respectively. Comparing the HFQ TFF with its rapid single-flux quantum counterpart under the same fabrication process, it is anticipated that the HFQ TFF will exhibit approximately 70% reduction in both static and dynamic energy dissipation. This research establishes the foundation for developing cryogenic interface control and readout circuits for large-scale quantum computing in the future.

TI Metasurface-Enabled Honey Encryption: A New Paradigm for Secure Data
   Transmission
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Honey encryption is a potent data security method that thwarts attackers by generating deceptive yet plausible messages, but its large-scale adoption is hindered by cumbersome and time-intensive encryption processes, and this study aims to address this limitation by proposing a novel encryption framework that, for the first time to our knowledge, integrates honey encryption with metasurfaces to enhance both security and efficiency. The methodology involves employing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based iterative algorithm to optimize the phase distribution of metasurfaces, ensuring it matches the amplitude of the target image, which enables rapid and effective encryption and decryption processes. Key results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional encryption methods in both security and transmission efficiency, with successful realization of secure data transmission through metasurface-based modulation. In conclusion, this integration of honey encryption and metasurface technology not only addresses the inefficiencies of conventional honey encryption but also shows significant promise for wide-ranging applications in data encryption and secure communications, leveraging the advancing metasurface technology.

TI Classical Simulation of Circuits with Realistic Odd-Dimensional
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Classically simulating circuits with bosonic codes is challenging due to the prohibitive cost of simulating quantum systems with many, possibly infinite, energy levels. We propose an algorithm to simulate circuits with encoded Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, specifically for odd-dimensional encoded qudits. Our approach is tailored to be especially effective in the most challenging but practically relevant regime, where the codeword states exhibit high (but finite) squeezing. Our algorithm leverages the Zak-Gross Wigner function introduced by Davis, Fabre, and Chabaud, which represents infinitely squeezed encoded stabilizer states positively. The run-time of the algorithm scales with the negativity of the Wigner function, allowing for efficient simulation of certain large-scale circuits-namely, input stabilizer GKP states undergoing generalized GKP-encoded Clifford operations followed by modular measurement-with a high degree of squeezing. For stabilizer GKP states exhibiting 12 dB of squeezing, our algorithm can simulate circuits with up to 1000 modes with less than double the number of samples required for a single input mode, which is in stark contrast to existing simulators. Therefore, this approach holds significant potential for benchmarking early implementations of quantum computing architectures utilizing bosonic codes.

TI Kinetic inductance parametric converter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Parametric converters are parametric amplifiers that mix two spatially separate nondegenerate modes and are commonly used for amplifying and squeezing microwave signals in quantum computing and sensing. In Josephson parametric converters, the strong localized nonlinearity of the Josephson junction limits the amplification and squeezing, as well as the dynamic range, in current devices. In contrast, a weak distributed nonlinearity can provide higher gain and dynamic range, when implemented as a kinetic inductance (KI) nanowire of a dirty superconductor, and has additional benefits such as resilience to magnetic field, higher-temperature operation, and simplified fabrication. Here, we propose, demonstrate, and analyze the performance of a KI parametric converter that relies on the weak distributed nonlinearity of a Nb-Ti-N KI nanowire. The device utilizes three-wave mixing induced by a dc current bias. We demonstrate its operation as a nondegenerate parametric amplifier with high phase-sensitive gain, reaching two-mode amplification and deamplification of approximately 30 dB for two resonances separated by 0.8 GHz, in excellent agreement with our theory of the device. We observe a dynamic range of -108 dBm at 30 dB gain. Our device can significantly broaden applications of quantum-limited signal processing devices including phase-preserving amplification and two-mode squeezing.

TI Diameter-dependent phase selectivity in 1D-confined tungsten phosphides
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Topological materials confined in 1D can transform computing technologies, such as 1D topological semimetals for nanoscale interconnects and 1D topological superconductors for fault-tolerant quantum computing. As such, understanding crystallization of 1D-confined topological materials is critical. Here, we demonstrate 1D template-assisted nanowire synthesis where we observe diameter-dependent phase selectivity for tungsten phosphides. A phase bifurcation occurs to produce tungsten monophosphide and tungsten diphosphide at the cross-over nanowire diameter regime of 35-70 nm. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to identify the two phases and to map crystallographic orientations of grains at a few nm resolution. The 1D-confined phase selectivity is attributed to the minimization of the total surface energy, which depends on the nanowire diameter and chemical potentials of precursors. Theoretical calculations are carried out to construct the diameter-dependent phase diagram, which agrees with experimental observations. Our findings suggest a crystallization route to stabilize topological materials confined in 1D.
   Topological materials confined in 1D could transform computing technology, but their crystallization is poorly understood. Here, the authors demonstrate template-based synthesis of 1D nanowires, revealing diameter-dependent phase selectivity.

TI Discrete-time semiclassical Szegedy quantum walks
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum walks are promising tools based on classical random walks, with plenty of applications such as many variants of optimization. Here we introduce the semiclassical walks in discrete time, which are algorithms that combines classical and quantum dynamics. Specifically, a semiclassical walk can be understood as a classical walk where the transition matrix encodes the quantum evolution. We have applied this algorithm to Szegedy's quantum walk, which can be applied to any arbitrary weighted graph. We first have solved the problem analytically on regular 1D cycles to show the performance of the semiclassical walks. Next, we have simulated our algorithm in a general inhomogeneous symmetric graph, finding that the inhomogeneity drives a symmetry breaking on the graph. Moreover, we show that this phenomenon is useful for the problem of ranking nodes in symmetric graphs, where the classical PageRank fails. We have demonstrated experimentally that the semiclassical walks can be applied on real quantum computers using the platform IBM Quantum.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Valley splittings in Si/SiGe quantum dots with a germanium spike in the
   silicon well
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Silicon-germanium heterostructures have successfully hosted quantum dot qubits, but the intrinsic near-degeneracy of the two lowest valley states poses an obstacle to high-fidelity quantum computing. We present a modification to the Si/SiGe heterostructure by the inclusion of a spike in germanium concentration within the quantum well in order to increase the valley splitting. The heterostructure is grown by chemical vapor deposition and magnetospectroscopy is performed on gate-defined quantum dots to measure the excited state spectrum. We demonstrate a large and widely tunable valley splitting as a function of applied vertical electric field and lateral dot confinement. We further investigate the role of the germanium spike by means of tight-binding simulations in single-electron dots and show a robust doubling of the valley splitting when the spike is present, as compared to a standard (spike-free) heterostructure. This doubling effect is nearly independent of the electric field, germanium content of the spike, and spike location. This experimental evidence of a stable, tunable quantum dot, despite a drastic change to the heterostructure, provides a foundation for future heterostructure modifications.

TI An Adaptation of Fitts' Law for Performance Evaluation and Optimization
   of Augmented Reality (AR) Interfaces
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB There is growing widespread adoption of augmented reality in tech-driven industries and sectors of society, such as medicine, gaming, flight simulation, education, interior design and modelling, entertainment, construction, tourism, repair and maintenance, public safety, agriculture, and quantum computing. However, ensuring smooth and intuitive interactions with augmented objects is challenging, requiring practical performance evaluation and optimization models to assess and improve users' experiences with AR-enhanced systems. In this paper, we apply Fitts' Law to model and predict interaction task difficulty with objects distributed across four spatial quadrants. We use genetic optimization algorithms to fine-tune Fitts' Law parameters, achieving a model that significantly enhances predictive accuracy. Our optimized model demonstrates an approximately 40% reduction in interaction task difficulty across all quadrants, leading to a more ergonomic and intuitive user interface. This study contributes to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field by offering a refined metric for evaluating and optimizing AR interfaces and addressing the unique challenges of three-dimensional interaction environments. Therefore, we propose a practical framework for the performance evaluations and optimization of augmented reality and other user interfaces.

AB Memory management across discrete CPU and GPU physical memory is traditionally achieved through explicit GPU allocations and data copy or unified virtual memory. The Grace Hopper Superchip, for the first time, supports an integrated CPU-GPU system page table, hardware-level addressing of system allocated memory, and cache-coherent NVLink-C2C interconnect, bringing an alternative solution for enabling a Unified Memory system. In this work, we provide the first in-depth study of the system memory management on the Grace Hopper Superchip, in both in-memory and memory oversubscription scenarios. We provide a suite of six representative applications, including the Qiskit quantum computing simulator, using system memory and managed memory. Using our memory utilization profiler and hardware counters, we quantify and characterize the impact of the integrated CPU-GPU system page table on GPU applications. Our study focuses on first-touch policy, page table entry initialization, page sizes, and page migration. We identify practical optimization strategies for different access patterns. Our results show that as a new solution for unified memory, the system-allocated memory can benefit most use cases with minimal porting efforts.

TI Security Concepts in Emerging 6G Communication: Threats,
   Countermeasures, Authentication Techniques and Research Directions
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Challenges faced in network security have significantly steered the deployment timeline of Fifth Generation (5G) communication at a global level; therefore, research in Sixth Generation (6G) security analysis is profoundly necessitated. The prerogative of this paper is to present a survey on the emerging 6G cellular communication paradigm to highlight symmetry with legacy security concepts along with asymmetric innovative aspects such Artificial Intelligence (AI), Quantum Computing, Federated Learning, etc. We present a taxonomy of the threat model in 6G communication in five security legacy concepts, including Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication and Access control (CIA(3)). We also suggest categorization of threat-countering techniques specific to 6G communication into three types: cryptographic methods, entity attributes and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Thus, with this premise, we distributed the authentication techniques in eight types, including handover authentication, mutual authentication, physical layer authentication, deniable authentication, token-based authentication, certificate-based authentication, key agreement-based authentication and multi-factor authentication. We specifically suggested a series of future research directions at the conclusive edge of this survey.

TI An In Vivo Proposal of Cell Computing Inspired by Membrane Computing
SO PROCESSES
AB Intractable problems are challenging and not uncommon in Computer Science. The computing generation we are living in forces us to look for an alternative way of computing, as current computers are facing limitations when dealing with complex problems and bigger input data. Physics and Biology offer great alternatives to solve these problems that traditional computers cannot. Models like Quantum Computing and cell computing are emerging as possible solutions to the current problems the conventional computers are facing. This proposal describes an in vivo framework inspired by membrane computing and based on alternative computational frameworks that have been proven to be theoretically correct such as chemical reaction series. The abilities of a cell as a computational unit make this proposal a starting point in the creation of feasible potential frameworks to enhance the performance of applications in different disciplines such as Biology, BioMedicine, Computer networks, and Social Sciences, by accelerating drastically the way information is processed by conventional architectures and possibly achieving results that presently are not possible due to the limitations of the current computing paradigm. This paper introduces an in vivo solution that uses the principles of membrane computing and it can produce non-deterministic outputs.

TI 3D Flat Band in Ultra-Thin Kagome Metal Mn3Sn Film
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Flat bands with narrow energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands are experimentally realized in 2D twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive alternative platform as they can natively host flat bands that are observed experimentally in quasi-2D bulk-crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in ultra-thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron-electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and band structure calculations are used to show that ultra-thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering is demonstrated. The realization of tunable kagome-derived flat bands in an ultra-thin kagome metal represents a promising platform to study strongly correlated and topological phenomena, with applications in quantum computing, spintronics and low-energy electronics.

TI A Quantum-Inspired Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Parking Lot
   Rental to Shared E-Scooter Services
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Electric scooter sharing mobility services have recently spread in major cities all around the world. However, the bad parking behavior of users has become a major source of issues, provoking accidents and compromising urban decorum of public areas. Reducing wild parking habits can be pursued by setting reserved parking spaces. In this work, we consider the problem faced by a municipality that hosts e-scooter sharing services and must choose which locations in its territory may be rented as reserved parking lots to sharing companies, with the aim of maximizing a return on renting and while taking into account spatial consideration and parking needs of local residents. Since this problem may result difficult to solve even for a state-of-the-art optimization software, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic solution algorithm combining a quantum-inspired ant colony optimization algorithm with an exact large neighborhood search. Results of computational tests considering realistic instances referring to the Italian capital city of Rome show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid metaheuristic.

TI Single-Photon Emitting Arrays by Capillary Assembly of Colloidal
   Semiconductor CdSe/CdS/SiO2 Nanocrystals
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The controlled placement of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) onto planar surfaces is crucial for scalable fabrication of single-photon emitters on-chip, which are critical elements of optical quantum computing, communication, and encryption. The positioning of colloidal semiconductor NCs such as metal chalcogenides or perovskites is still challenging, as it requires a nonaggressive fabrication process to preserve the optical properties of the NCs. In this work, periodic arrays of 2500 nanoholes are patterned by electron beam lithography in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin film on indium tin oxide/glass substrates. Colloidal core/shell CdSe/CdS NCs, functionalized with a SiO2 capping layer to increase their size and facilitate deposition into 100 nm holes, are trapped with a close to optimal Poisson distribution into the PMMA nanoholes via a capillary assembly method. The resulting arrays of NCs contain hundreds of single-photon emitters each. We believe this work paves the way to an affordable, fast, and practical method for the fabrication of nanodevices, such as singlephoton-emitting light-emitting diodes based on colloidal semiconductor NCs.

TI Quantum Dot Photoluminescence Enhancement in GaAs Nanopillar Oligomers
   Driven by Collective Magnetic Modes
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Single photon sources based on semiconductor quantum dots are one of the most prospective elements for optical quantum computing and cryptography. Such systems are often based on Bragg resonators, which provide several ways to control the emission of quantum dots. However, the fabrication of periodic structures with many thin layers is difficult. On the other hand, the coupling of single-photon sources with resonant nanoclusters made of high-index dielectric materials is known as a promising way for emission control. Our experiments and calculations show that the excitation of magnetic Mie-type resonance by linearly polarized light in a GaAs nanopillar oligomer with embedded InAs quantum dots leads to quantum emitters absorption efficiency enhancement. Moreover, the nanoresonator at the wavelength of magnetic dipole resonance also acts as a nanoantenna for a generated signal, allowing control over its radiation spatial profile. We experimentally demonstrated an order of magnitude emission enhancement and numerically reached forty times gain in comparison with unstructured film. These findings highlight the potential of quantum dots coupling with Mie-resonant oligomers collective modes for nanoscale single-photon sources development.

TI Chiral photon blockade in the spinning Kerr resonator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose how to achieve chiral photon blockade by spinning a nonlinear optical resonator. We show that by driving such a device at a fixed direction, completely different quantum effects can emerge for the counter -propagating optical modes, due to the spinninginduced breaking of time -reversal symmetry, which otherwise is unattainable for the same device in the static regime. Also, we find that in comparison with the static case, robust non -classical correlations against random backscattering losses can be achieved for such a quantum chiral system. Our work, extending previous works on the spontaneous breaking of optical chiral symmetry from the classical to purely quantum regimes, can stimulate more efforts towards making and utilizing various chiral quantum effects, including applications for chiral quantum networks or noise -tolerant quantum sensors.

TI Hamiltonian tomography by the quantum quench protocol with random noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this article, we introduce a framework for Hamiltonian tomography of multiqubit systems with random noise. We adopt the quantum quench protocol to reconstruct a many-body Hamiltonian by local measurements that are distorted by random unitary operators and time uncertainty. In particular, we consider a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian describing interactions of two spins 1/2 and three-qubit Hamiltonians of a heteronuclear system within the radio-frequency field. For a sample of random Hamiltonians, we report the fidelity of reconstruction versus the amount of noise quantified by two parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between the accuracy of Hamiltonian tomography and the number of pairs of quantum states involved in the framework. The results provide valuable insight into the robustness of the protocol against random noise.

TI A New Approach to Design of Cost-Efficient Reversible Quantum Dual-Full
   Adder and Subtractor
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
   SCIENCES
AB This paper proposed the design and development of reversible cost-efficient innovative quantum dual -full adder and subtractor or QD-FAS circuit using quantum gate. The proposed circuit can be used as full adder and full subtractor simultaneously, which is designed using double Peres gate or DPG and Feynman gate or FG. The quantum cost, garbage output and constant input of the QD-FAS is 8, 1 and 1. Which is better w.r.t previously reported work. The QD-FAS circuit, as proposed, includes shared sum and difference terminals, as well as a carry -out and a borrow output terminal. Notably, this innovation showcases a remarkable 27.27% reduction in quantum cost. The improvement in garbage output is even more striking, showing a 50% enhancement. When assessing the overall advancement in quantum cost, it falls within the range of 27.27% to 66.66%. To confirm the viability of this design, extensive testing is carried out using the IBM Qiskit simulator. This design holds significant importance in a variety of applications, including quantum computing, cryptography, and the realm of reversible Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU).

AB In an AI-driven digital age, it appears that traditional Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) theories and paradigms need to be reassessed, as they should be realigned and augmented to better serve a broader purpose and context. Current Human-Centered Design (HCD) approaches lack the flexibility, volatility and openness to accommodate the new requirements of a highly demanding intelligent digital reality, like randomness, uncertainty, multi-purpose dynamic interactions, adaptability, data-driven design and decision-making, etc. In this respect, this paper (a) embraces an alternative Quantum User Experience theoretical stance - by creating parallels to the fields of (Quantum) Physics, to facilitate the understanding of HCI phenomena in a blended digital-physical ecosystem; and (b) proposes a Human-AI Quantum Experience Design Paradigm that focuses on the dynamics generated by the respective micro- and macro-experiences. Accordingly, the 5 phases: Explore. Define. Engineer. Transform. Adopt., are outlined and brought into perspective of an extended HCD scope. Main aim is to present a promising theoretical standpoint to the HCI community that might be able to address core theoretical challenges and discrepancies, and complement HCD practices towards inclusive and sustainable human experiences.

TI Insights into security and privacy issues in smart healthcare systems
   based on medical images
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB The advent of the fourth industrial revolution along with developments in other emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence as well as cloud and quantum computing, smart healthcare systems (SHS) are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. Meanwhile, patients, doctors, and other medical personnel rely on the safe and efficient storage, transmission, and analysis of medical images and electronic health records for successful diagnosis, treatment, and management of different ailments. Moreover since, for various reasons, medical images are always the target of different illicit criminal activities, studies to utilise advanced information technologies to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such data have become a major priority in all SHS platforms. Our study evaluates recent efforts to deploy emerging technologies to design, secure, and enhance the efficiency of SHS that are based on medical images. It is hoped that this work will stimulate further interest aimed at the pursuit of more advanced algorithms and frameworks covering all aspects of security and privacy in emerging and future smart healthcare applications.

   first-principles investigation
SO REVISTA MEXICANA DE FISICA
AB Topological insulators are novel quantum material states with insulating bulk band gaps and topologically protected metallic surface states that have been extensively studied owing to their intriguing properties for spintronic and quantum-computing applications. The structural, mechanical, electronic, thermal, and optical properties of inverse Heusler compounds La2RuPb and, Sc-2 RuPb in two Hg2CuTi, Cu-2 MnAl-type structures were calculated using the full potential linear muffin-tin orbital simulation methodology as implemented in the computer code,which is based on density functional theory.We employed the local-density approximation for the exchange and correlation potential (XC) terms. Consequently, the optical characteristics of La-2 RuPb, Sc-2 RuPb and elastic constants C-ij and their corresponding elastic moduli were computed for the first time. According to our structural calculations, La-2 RuPb is more stable in its Hg-2 CuTi-type structure than Sc-2 RuPb in its Cu-2 MnAl-type structure. However, the mechanical characteristics demonstrate their stability in the final stages of elastic deformation.

   oncological medical imaging
SO COMPUTATIONAL PARTICLE MECHANICS
AB Medical imaging is the process of visualizing the diseased part, inside the patient's body, with the aid of images. The field of medical imaging depends on several disciplines of science and technology, including physics, biological sciences, engineering, artificial intelligence and mathematics. These disciplines contribute in designing the imaging devices, installation of the devices and the collection and analysis of the images for better understanding and future forecasting of the disease prognosis and prevention. In this manuscript, medical images are analyzed with the aid of the a new hybrid machine learning approach, where the breast cancer images are studied in a novel manner with the help of a newly devised algorithm that is conceptually more sound as compared to already existing algorithms. Step by step stages are followed by the algorithm to process, filter, segment, statistically analyze and to classify the medical images. The results from different classification tools are compared in a novel manner, inspired from the explainable artificial intelligence tools for classification. The algorithm devised during this research can serve as a useful tool, in the evolving field of particle - physics -imaging.

TI The Magnetic Genome of Two-Dimensional van der Waals Materials
SO ACS NANO
AB Magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials has recently emerged as one of the most promising areas in condensed matter research, with many exciting emerging properties and significant potential for applications ranging from topological magnonics to low-power spintronics, quantum computing, and optical communications. In the brief time after their discovery, 2D magnets have blossomed into a rich area for investigation, where fundamental concepts in magnetism are challenged by the behavior of spins that can develop at the single layer limit. However, much effort is still needed in multiple fronts before 2D magnets can be routinely used for practical implementations. In this comprehensive review, prominent authors with expertise in complementary fields of 2D magnetism (i.e., synthesis, device engineering, magneto-optics, imaging, transport, mechanics, spin excitations, and theory and simulations) have joined together to provide a genome of current knowledge and a guideline for future developments in 2D magnetic materials research.

TI Topological synchronization of quantum van der Pol oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB To observe synchronization in large networks of classical or quantum systems demands both excellent control of the interactions between nodes and very accurate preparation of initial conditions due to the involved nonlinearities and dissipation. This limits its applicability for future devices. We demonstrate a route toward significantly enhancing the robustness of synchronized behavior in open nonlinear systems that utilizes the power of topology. In nontrivial topological lattices of quantum van der Pol oscillators, boundary synchronization emerges in the classical mean field as well as the quantum regime. In addition to its robustness against disorder and initial state perturbations, the observed dynamics is independent of the underlying topological model provided the existence of topological zero-energy modes. Our work extends the notion of topology to the general nonlinear dynamics and open quantum system realm with applications to networks where specific nodes need special protection like power grids or quantum networks.

TI An Overlap-Integral Approach to Quantum Optical Simulation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A technique for the simulation of multimode quantum optical interferometry and protocols in quantum communications is introduced. This technique is very efficient at simulating in the single-photon-counting regime. This works by treating the photons in the system as members of a multiphoton pulse and reducing the computation of measurable quantities to overlap integrals that may be precomputed and combined in a recursive algorithm. The simulation of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect are demonstrated using this technique. The results of these simulations perfectly agree with the theoretical results. Additionally, since the effects of the components in the system can be integrated into the quantum operators involved, the technique is agnostic to the components introduced into the system.

TI A Review of Global Optimization Methods for Molecular Structures:
   Algorithms, Applications and Perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY
AB This review presents a comprehensive overview of global optimization techniques applied to the prediction of chemical structures, including molecular conformations, crystal polymorphs, and reaction pathways. These approaches typically involve a two-step process: a global search to identify candidate structures, followed by local refinement to determine the most stable configurations. Global optimization methods are commonly grouped into two categories, known as stochastic and deterministic methods, based on their exploration strategies and underlying theoretical principles. A historical perspective highlights the progression of these methods, from early foundational algorithms to more advanced and efficient modern techniques. For each category, key algorithmic frameworks are outlined, widely used software tools are discussed, and representative applications are examined, such as conformer sampling, cluster structure prediction, and surface adsorption. The review concludes by considering future directions, including the integration of accurate quantum methods, the development of flexible hybrid algorithms, and the use of quantum computing to address increasingly complex chemical problems.

TI Quantum private set computing protocol based on measurement device
   independence
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Secure multi-party computation (SMC) is an important privacy-preserving technology with broad applications in fields such as data mining and cloud computing. As a significant branch of SMC, private set computation (PSC) allows the computation of the intersection or union of private datasets from two or more participants while protecting their data privacy. Quantum private set computation (QPSC) is a new direction that combines PSC with quantum mechanics and has recently garnered widespread attention. Most existing QPSC protocols rely on quantum measurements performed by participants or third parties, but the measurement devices used in practice may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a measurement-device-independent QPSC protocol. In this protocol, participants can utilize post-selected Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state entanglement to compute the private intersection and union of their datasets securely. Analysis shows that this protocol is correct and can resist potential external and internal attacks. Finally, the protocol's feasibility is verified through simulation on the HIQ quantum computing cloud platform using the MindSpore Quantum framework.

TI Giant g-factors and fully spin-polarized states in metamorphic
   short-period InAsSb/InSb superlattices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Realizing a large Lande g-factor of electrons in solid-state materials has long been thought of as a rewarding task as it can trigger abundant immediate applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Here, by using metamorphic InAsSb/InSb superlattices (SLs), we demonstrate an unprecedented high value of g approximate to 104, twice larger than that in bulk InSb, and fully spin-polarized states at low magnetic fields. In addition, we show that the g-factor can be tuned on demand from 20 to 110 via varying the SL period. The key ingredients of such a wide tunability are the wavefunction mixing and overlap between the electron and hole states, which have drawn little attention in prior studies. Our work not only establishes metamorphic InAsSb/InSb as a promising and competitive material platform for future quantum devices but also provides a new route toward g-factor engineering in semiconductor structures.
   Semiconductors with large Lande g-factors allow for both highly spin-polarized states, and precise control of the spin dynamics. Here, the authors make superlattices of two semiconductors, InSb, and InAsSb, and by tuning the conduction and valence band overlap, achieve a Lande g-factor of 104.

TI Observation of the topological phase transition from the spatial
   correlation of a biphoton in a one-dimensional topological photonic
   waveguide array
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a simple method, using the first singular value (FSV) of the spatial correlation of biphotons, to characterize topological phase transitions (TPTs) in one-dimensional (1D) topological photonic waveguide arrays (PWAs). After analyzing the spatial correlation of biphotons using the singular value decomposition, we found that the FSV of the spatial correlation of biphotons in real space can characterize TPTs and distinguish between the topological trivial and nontrivial phases in PWAs based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The analytical simulation results were demonstrated by applying the coupled-mode theory to biphotons and were found to be in good agreement with those of the numerical simulation. Moreover, the numerical simulation of the FSV (of the spatial correlation of biphotons) successfully characterized the TPT in a PWA based on the Aubry-Andre-Har per and Rice-Mele models, demonstrating the universality of this method for 1D topological PWAs. Our method provides biphotons with the possibility of acquiring information regarding TPTs directly from the spatial correlation in real space, and their potential applications in quantum topological photonics and topological quantum computing as quantum simulators and information carriers.

TI Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall State at Filling Factor ν=3/4
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) exemplify exotic phases of low-disorder two-dimensional (2D) electron systems when electron-electron interaction dominates over the thermal and kinetic energies. Particularly intriguing among the FQHSs are those observed at even-denominator Landau level filling factors, as their quasiparticles are generally believed to obey non-Abelian statistics and be of potential use in topological quantum computing. Such states, however, are very rare and fragile, and are typically observed in the excited Landau level of 2D electron systems with the lowest amount of disorder. Here we report the observation of a new and unexpected even-denominator FQHS at filling factor v = 3/4 in a GaAs 2D hole system with an exceptionally high quality (mobility). Our magnetotransport measurements reveal a strong minimum in the longitudinal resistance at v = 3/4, accompanied by a developing Hall plateau centered at (h/e2)/(3/4). This even-denominator FQHS is very unusual as it is observed in the lowest Landau level and in a 2D hole system. While its origin is unclear, it is likely a non-Abelian state, emerging from the residual interaction between composite fermions.

TI 1/ω electric-field noise in surface ion traps from correlated adsorbate
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Ion traps are promising architectures for implementing quantum computers, but they suffer from excessive "anomalous" ion motional heating that limit their overall coherence and practicality for scalable quantum computing. The exact microscopic origins of anomalous heating remain an open question, but experiments point to adsorbates on trap electrodes as one likely source. Many different models of anomalous heating have been proposed, but these models have yet to pinpoint the atomistic origin of the experimentally observed 1/omega electricfield noise scaling seen in ion traps at frequencies between 0.1-10 MHz. In this work, we show that a model based on previously proposed surface-induced dipole fluctuations on adsorbates, but which also incorporates interparticle interaction dynamics through molecular dynamics simulations of up to multiple monolayers of adsorbates, gives rise to 1/omega frequency scaling at the MHz frequencies typically employed in ion traps. These results demonstrate that moderate-to-high densities of adsorbates can give rise to a set of activated motions that produce the 1/omega noise observed in ion traps and that collective adsorbate motions produce the observed noise spectra that a noninteracting model does not capture.

TI A Post-Quantum Public-Key Signcryption Scheme over Scalar Integers Based
   on a Modified LWE Structure
SO SENSORS
AB To ensure confidentiality and integrity in the era of quantum computing, most post-quantum cryptographic schemes are designed to achieve either encryption or digital signature functionalities separately. Although a few signcryption schemes exist that combine these operations into a single, more efficient process, they typically rely on complex vector, matrix, or polynomial-based structures. In this work, a novel post-quantum public-key encryption and signature (PQES) scheme based entirely on scalar integer operations is presented. The proposed scheme employs a simplified structure where the ciphertext, keys, and core cryptographic operations are defined over scalar integers modulo n, significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. By avoiding high-dimensional lattices or ring-based constructions, the PQES approach enhances implementability on constrained devices while maintaining strong security properties. The design is inspired by modified learning-with-errors (LWE) assumptions, adapted to scalar settings, making it suitable for post-quantum applications. Security and performance evaluations, achieving a signcryption time of 0.0007 s and an unsigncryption time of 0.0011 s, demonstrate that the scheme achieves a practical balance between efficiency and resistance to quantum attacks.

TI Spin-polarized Majorana zero modes in proximitized superconducting
   penta-silicene nanoribbons
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We theoretically propose penta-silicene nanoribbons (p-SiNRs) with induced p-wave superconductivity as a platform for the emergence of spin-polarized Majorana zero-modes (MZMs). The model explicitly considers the key ingredients of well-known Majorana hybrid nanowire setups: Rashba spin-orbit coupling, magnetic field perpendicular to the nanoribbon plane, and first nearest neighbor hopping with p-wave superconducting pairing. The energy spectrum of the system, as a function of chemical potential, reveals the existence of MZMs with a well-defined spin orientation localized at the opposite ends of both the top and bottom chains of the p-SiNR, associated with well-localized and nonoverlapping wave function profiles. Well-established experimental techniques enable the fabrication of highly ordered p-SiNRs, complemented by a thin lead film on top, responsible for inducing p-wave superconductivity through proximity effect. Moreover, the emergence of MZMs with explicit opposite spin orientations for some set of model parameters opens a new avenue for exploring quantum computing operations, which accounts for both MZMs and spin properties, as well as for new MZMs probe devices based on spin-polarized electronic transport mechanisms.

TI Atomic origin of room-temperature two-dimensional itinerant
   ferromagnetism in an oxide-monolayer heterostructure
SO APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY
AB Materials with room-temperature two-dimensional itinerant ferromagnetism enable ultracompact device density and quantum computing in next-generation nano-spintronics. Among numerous candidates, perovskite-based heterostructures have offered an excellent platform to manipulate spin-orbital-charge coupling, unveiling a series of emergent spin-dependent phenomena. In this work, we have fulfilled a robust room-temperature soft ferromagnetism together with a metallic characteristic based on a high quality SrRuO3-monolayer-based superlattice. Further examination on this short-range ferromagnetism has been carried out by synchrotron-related spectroscopy, where charge-transfer-induced antiferromagnetic coupling between partial Ru and Ti ions have been found. Although such local antiferromagnetic coupling would break long range ferromagnetic order, it simultaneously stabilize the localized intralayer ferromagnetic order in the SrRu0 3 monolayers, which is confirmed by theoretical calculations. Our study not only represents a methodological advance of achieving fantastic magnetic properties in functional oxide monolayer, but is promising to unlock new opportunities for oxide-based spintronic devices toward room-temperature applications.

TI Low-noise cascaded frequency conversion of 637.2 nm light to the
   telecommunication C-band in a single-waveguide device
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Interconnected quantum devices are the building blocks of quantum networks, where state transduction plays a central role. The frequency conversion of photons into the telecommunication C-band is decisive in taking advantage of current low-loss transmission lines. Here, we report the difference frequency conversion of 637.2 nm fluorescent light from a cluster of NV centers in diamond to tunable wavelengths between 1559.0 nm and 1564.9 nm. In order to avoid detrimental noise from spontaneous emissions, we use a two-step conversion device based on a single-pumped periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. We observed a total external (internal) conversion efficiency of 3.0 +/- 0.1 (20.5 +/- 0.8) % with a noise rate of 2.4 +/- 0.8 (16 +/- 5) cps/GHz.

AB With the development of quantum computing and other scientific fields, the dilution refrigerator, as a major ultra-low temperature refrigeration equipment, is required to provide more cooling capacity. Due to Kapitza resistance, one of the key factors that limit the cooling power, the silver powder sintered heat exchanger is an essential component of the dilution refrigerator. This study examines the sintering of silver nano-powder samples with particle sizes of 50 nm, 100 nm, and 200 nm, sintering pressures of 0.4 MPa, 0.7 MPa, and 1.0 MPa, and sintering temperatures of 220 degrees C and 200 degrees C. The porosity and specific surface area of these samples were measured. The 200 nm silver powder was found to have the best performance under the conditions of 1.0 MPa and 200 degrees C, with a specific surface area of 3.56 m (2) /g. It was successfully applied to a dilution refrigerator and achieved a minimum temperature of 19 mK and a cooling capacity of 350 mu W at 100 mK. The results may be helpful in guiding the design of future large cooling capacity dilution refrigerators.

TI Research on PID Parameter Optimisation for BP Neural Network Based on
   Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB With the continuous development of industrial intelligent technology, traditional PID algorithms have certain limitations in effectively controlling nonlinear or complex control systems. Therefore, new intelligent PID algorithms are gradually replacing traditional PID algorithms, enabling automatic parameter optimisation. However, these intelligent algorithms face challenges such as getting stuck in local optima and suboptimal convergence effects in certain complex control systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved quantum genetic algorithm that encodes individuals as quantum states and applies quantum operations to update the population, obtaining classical solutions and utilising quantum crossover and quantum mutation to evolve and improve the solutions. This study conducted simulation experiments on a second-order oscillatory process using traditional PID, BP neural network (BPNN) PID, genetic algorithm (GA) BP- NN_PID and the proposed improved quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) BPNN_PID controllers, and recorded the corresponding output responses. The experimental results showed that the QGA enhanced BPNN_PID controller outperforms others, with rise time 2.8 s, overshoot 2.7% and settling time 9.4 s. Additionally, the improved controller exhibits reduced oscillation in the output and demonstrates good control performance for systems that require fast and stable output.

TI A quantum direct torque control method for permanent magnet synchronous
   machines
SO COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB This study compares classical direct torque control (DTC) methods with a proposed quantum direct torque control (QDTC) strategy for synchronous machines. A quantum comparator developed by implementing a quantum subtractor between real numbers ranging from-100 % +100 %, and a quantum sign function is developed using this digital quantum subtractor. The QDTC implementation involved the use of quantum versions of the classic logical AND and OR gates. Simulation results indicate that the QDTC method significantly reduces torque ripple, with a ripple torque factor of 0.0392 compared to 0.0417 for the classical DTC. The QDTC approach also required 5.2 % fewer commutations (9.81 x 104) compared to the classical approach (1.035 x 105), which increases the longevity of the power components. Finally, the total harmonic distortion (THD) was lower for the QDTC method compared to the classical strategy. The results indicate that the proposed QDTC method either matches or surpasses the performance of the classical method across several metrics. Specifically, the reduced torque ripple and commutation frequency leads to smoother motor operation and longer component lifespans, while lower THD indicative of greater motor efficiency.

TI Characterizing low-frequency vibratory motion with radio-frequency
   cavities
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Radio-frequency (RF) cavities, previously employed in particle physics, quantum computing, and gravitational wave research, offer unique advantages in terms of sensitivity and non-invasiveness as a method of sensing motion in both macroscopic and microscopic systems. This research aims to address how an RF cavity can effectively detect and characterize the low-frequency vibratory motion of a room-temperature mm-scale levitated particle. In this case, the particle in question is a diamagnetically levitated slab of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Cavity-based identification of the slab's rigid-body modes is substantiated by calculations of the force acting on the particle and validated through slow-motion video object tracking. We find that this system can accurately measure oscillations in all six center-of-mass degrees of freedom. Calculations indicate that this system could potentially detect forces on the scale of tens of femto-Newtons and center of mass displacements of less than 10 nm. This work provides a non-invasive method of conducting position and vibration measurements in the field of levitodynamics without the ultra-cold temperatures or bulky precision laser setups that superconducting quantum interference devices and conventional interferometric methods utilize.<br />

TI Quantum state preparation of topological chiral spin liquids via Floquet
   engineering
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB In condensed matter, Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Quantum Hall states (in the continuum) or Fractional Chern Insulators (on the lattice). As the latter, CSL are remarkable states of matter, exhibiting topological order and chiral edge modes. Preparing CSL on quantum simulators like cold atom platforms is still an open challenge. Here we propose a simple setup on a finite cluster of spin-1/2 located at the sites of a square lattice. Using a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) non-chiral spin liquid as initial state on which fast time-modulations of strong nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings are applied, following different protocols (out-of-equilibrium quench or semi-adiabatic ramping of the drive), we show the slow emergence of such a CSL phase. An effective Floquet dynamics, obtained from a high-frequency Magnus expansion of the drive Hamiltonian, provides a very accurate and simple framework fully capturing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. An analysis of the resulting prepared states in term of Projected Entangled Pair states gives further insights on the topological nature of the chiral phase. Finally, we discuss possible applications to quantum computing.

TI Manipulating Topological Phases in Magnetic Topological Insulators
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) are a group of materials that feature topological band structures with concurrent magnetism, which can offer new opportunities for technological advancements in various applications, such as spintronics and quantum computing. The combination of topology and magnetism introduces a rich spectrum of topological phases in MTIs, which can be controllably manipulated by tuning material parameters such as doping profiles, interfacial proximity effect, or external conditions such as pressure and electric field. In this paper, we first review the mainstream MTI material platforms where the quantum anomalous Hall effect can be achieved, along with other exotic topological phases in MTIs. We then focus on highlighting recent developments in modulating topological properties in MTI with finite-size limit, pressure, electric field, and magnetic proximity effect. The manipulation of topological phases in MTIs provides an exciting avenue for advancing both fundamental research and practical applications. As this field continues to develop, further investigations into the interplay between topology and magnetism in MTIs will undoubtedly pave the way for innovative breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of topological physics as well as practical applications.

TI Non-volatile compact optical phase shifter based on Ge2Sb2Te5 operating
   at 2.3 μm
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB We investigate an optical phase shifter based on Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) integrated with a Si waveguide at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. Since the optical absorption of both amorphous and crystalline GST can be reduced at a longer wavelength, we demonstrate that the optical loss of the phase shifter can be reduced at MIR wavelengths. The measured optical loss per pi phase shift of a phase-change material (PCM) phase shifter at 2.32 pm wavelength is 2.6 dB/pi, which is more than 80 times smaller than that at 1.55 pm wavelength (21.7 dB/pi) and more than 5 times smaller than that at 1.92 pm wavelength (9.7 dB/pi). Moreover, resonance wavelength tuning of an add-drop micro-ring resonator using a PCM phase shifter at 2.32 pm wavelength is demonstrated owing to the low-loss optical phase shift. These findings reinforce the applicability of the approach toward a low-loss optical phase shifter based on PCMs operating at MIR wavelengths on a Si photonic platform for quantum computing, sensing, and optical communication.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Superconducting quantum interference at the atomic scale
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB A single spin in a Josephson junction can reverse the flow of the supercurrent by changing the sign of the superconducting phase difference across it. At mesoscopic length scales, these pi-junctions are employed in various applications, such as finding the pairing symmetry of the underlying superconductor, as well as quantum computing. At the atomic scale, the counterpart of a single spin in a superconducting tunnel junction is known as a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state. Observation of the supercurrent reversal in that setting has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate such a 0 to pi transition of a Josephson junction through a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state as we continuously change the impurity-superconductor coupling. We detect the sign change in the critical current by exploiting a second transport channel as reference in analogy to a superconducting quantum interference device, which provides our scanning tunnelling microscope with the required phase sensitivity. The measured change in the Josephson current is a signature of the quantum phase transition and allows its characterization with high resolution.
   Continuously changing the coupling between a magnetic impurity and a superconductor allows the observation of the reversal of supercurrent flow at the atomic scale.

TI Performance of a Kinetic Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier
   at 4 Kelvin: Toward an Alternative to Semiconductor Amplifiers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Most microwave readout architectures in quantum computing or sensing rely on a semiconductor amplifier at 4 K, typically a high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Despite its remarkable noise performance, a conventional HEMT dissipates several milliwatts of power, posing a practical challenge to scale up the number of qubits or sensors addressed in these architectures. As an alternative, we present an amplification chain consisting of a kinetic inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifier (KITWPA) placed at 4 K, followed by a HEMT placed at 70 K, and demonstrate a chain-added noise TE = 6.3 +/- 0.5 K between 3.5 and 5.5 GHz. While, in principle, any parametric amplifier can be quantum limited even at 4 K, in practice we find the performance of the KITWPA to be limited by the temperature of its inputs and by an excess of noise Tex = 1.9 K. The dissipation of the rf pump of the KITWPA constitutes the main power load at 4 K and is about 1% that of a HEMT. These combined noise and power dissipation values pave the way for the use of the KITWPA as a replacement for semiconductor amplifiers.

TI Al-Ge-Al Nanowire Heterostructure: From Single-Hole Quantum Dot to
   Josephson Effect
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low-dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high-performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al-Ge-Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal-semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low-temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i-Ge) quantum dots. In particular, demonstrating the ability to tune the Ge quantum dot device from completely insulating, through a single-hole-filling quantum dot regime, to a supercurrent regime, resembling a Josephson field effect transistor with a maximum critical current of 10 nA at a temperature of 390 mK. The realization of a Josephson field-effect transistor with high junction transparency provides a mechanism to study sub-gap transport mediated by Andreev states. The presented results reveal a promising intrinsic Ge-based architecture for hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices for the study of Majorana zero modes and key components of quantum computing such as gatemons or gate tunable superconducting quantum interference devices.

TI Spectral Signatures of Vibronic Coupling in Trapped Cold Ionic Rydberg
   Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through statedependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.

TI Two quantum Ising algorithms for the shortest-vector problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computers are expected to break today's public key cryptography within a few decades. New cryptosystems are being designed and standardized for the postquantum era, and a significant proportion of these rely on the hardness of problems like the shortest-vector problem to a quantum adversary. In this paper we describe two variants of a quantum Ising algorithm to solve this problem. One variant is spatially efficient, requiring only O(N log(2) N) qubits, where N is the lattice dimension, while the other variant is more robust to noise. Analysis of the algorithms' performance on a quantum annealer and in numerical simulations shows that the more qubit-efficient variant will outperform in the long run, while the other variant is more suitable for near-term implementation.

TI Floquet-Engineered System-Reservoir Interaction in the Transverse Field
   Ising Model
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Periodically driving a quantum many-body system can drastically change its properties, leading to exotic non-equilibrium states of matter without a static analog. In this scenario, parametric resonances and the complexity of an interacting many-body system are pivotal in establishing non-equilibrium states. A Floquet-engineered transverse field Ising model for the controlled propagation in one dimension of spin waves is reported. The underlying mechanisms behind the proposal rely on high-frequency drivings using characteristic parametric resonances of the spin lattice. Many-body resonances modulating spin-spin exchange or individual spin gaps inhibit interactions between spins thus proving a mechanism for controlling spin-wave propagation and a quantum switch. The schemes may be implemented in circuit QED with direct applications in coupling-decoupling schemes for system-reservoir interaction and routing in quantum networks.

TI Four-body coupler for superconducting qubits based on Josephson
   parametric oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically propose a circuit of the four-body coupler for superconducting qubits based on Josephson parametric oscillators (JPOs). Our coupler for the four-body interaction has a superconducting loop, similar to a capacitively shunted flux qubit, where an external magnetic flux set to half a flux quantum is threaded. This coupler circuit is a specific setup of the circuit called superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive elements (SNAIL) and also is a generalization of the previously proposed one for the four-body interaction of JPOs. We clarify roles of circuit parameters in the four-body interaction and, in particular, show that the four-body coupling constant in our circuit can be significantly increased by tuning capacitance of the coupler or the area ratio of the Josephson junctions of the coupler.

TI Hot Schrödinger cat states
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The observation of quantum phenomena often necessitates sufficiently pure states, a requirement that can be challenging to achieve. In this study, our goal is to prepare a nonclassical state originating from a mixed state, using dynamics that preserve the initial low purity of the state. We generate a quantum superposition of displaced thermal states within a microwave cavity using only unitary interactions with a transmon qubit. We measure the Wigner functions of these "hot" Schr & ouml;dinger cat states for an initial purity as low as 0.06. This corresponds to a cavity mode temperature of up to 1.8 kelvin, 60 times hotter than the cavity's physical environment. Our realization of highly mixed quantum superposition states could be implemented with other continuous-variable systems, e.g., nanomechanical oscillators, for which ground-state cooling remains challenging.

TI Triply-resonant sum frequency conversion with gallium phosphide ring
   resonators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate quasi-phase matched, triply-resonant sum frequency conversion in 10.6-mu m-diameter integrated gallium phosphide ring resonators. A small-signal, waveguide-to-waveguide power conversion efficiency of 8 +/- 1.1%/mW; is measured for conversion from telecom (1536 nm) and near infrared (1117 nm) to visible (647 nm) wavelengths with an absolute power conversion efficiency of 6.3 +/- 0.6%; measured at saturation pump power. For the complementary difference frequency generation process, a single photon conversion efficiency of 7.2%/mW from visible to telecom is projected for resonators with optimized coupling. Efficient conversion from visible to telecom will facilitate long-distance transmission of spin-entangled photons from solid-state emitters such as the diamond NV center, allowing long-distance entanglement for quantum networks.

TI Frequency conversion to the telecom O-band using pressurized hydrogen
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Large-scale quantum networks rely on optical fiber networks and photons as so-called flying qubits for information transport. While dispersion and absorption of optical fibers are minimum at the infrared telecom wavelengths, most atomic and solid state platforms operate at visible or near -infrared wavelengths. Quantum frequency conversion is required to bridge these two wavelength regimes, and nonlinear crystals are currently employed for this process. Here, we report a novel approach of frequency conversion to the telecom band. This interaction is based on coherent Stokes Raman scattering (CSRS), a four -wave mixing process resonantly enhanced in a dense molecular hydrogen gas. We show the conversion of photons from 863 nm to the telecom O -band and demonstrate that the input polarization state is preserved. This process is intrinsically broadband and can be adapted to any other wavelength. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group

TI Efficient quantum frequency translation of broadband single photons by
   Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We experimentally demonstrate frequency translation of a non-classical optical field by Bragg-scattering four wave mixing, driven by orthogonally polarized pump pulses in a birefringent optical fiber. Heralded single photons are up- and down-translated by 6.8 THz between bands at 688.1 nm and 678.2 nm, each with efficiency > 97%. The input and output spectral shape and bandwidth show negligible modulation. Second-order auto-correlation measurements of the 678.2 nm and 688.1 nm fields at maximum conversion yield values of 0.0302 +/- 0.0005 and 0.028 +/- 0.001, respectively, compared with the input second-order correlation of 0.026 +/- 0.001; this indicates that the frequency translation process preserves the non-classical nature of the field. The high efficiency, broad bandwidth, and low noise render this scheme useful for quantum networks and sources.

TI Finite-key analysis for quantum conference key agreement with asymmetric
   channels
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As an essential ingredient of quantum networks, quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) provides unconditional secret keys among multiple parties, which enables only legitimate users to decrypt the encrypted message. Recently, some QCKA protocols employing twin-field was proposed to promote transmission distance. These protocols, however, suffer from relatively low conference key rate and short transmission distance over asymmetric channels, which demands a prompt solution in practice. Here, we consider a tripartite QCKA protocol utilizing the idea of sending-or-not-sending twin-field scheme and propose a high-efficiency QCKA over asymmetric channels by removing the symmetry parameters condition. Besides, we provide a composable finite-key analysis with rigorous security proof against general attacks by exploiting the entropic uncertainty relation for multiparty system. Our protocol greatly improves the feasibility to establish conference keys over asymmetric channels.

TI Feedback-Based Quantum Optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB It is hoped that quantum computers will offer advantages over classical computers for combinatorial optimization. Here, we introduce a feedback-based strategy for quantum optimization, where the results of qubit measurements are used to constructively assign values to quantum circuit parameters. We show that this procedure results in an estimate of the combinatorial optimization problem solution that improves monotonically with the depth of the quantum circuit. Importantly, the measurement-based feedback enables approximate solutions to the combinatorial optimization problem without the need for any classical optimization effort, as would be required for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. We demonstrate this feedback-based protocol on a superconducting quantum processor for the graph -partitioning problem MaxCut, and present a series of numerical analyses that further investigate the protocol's performance.

TI Bound Entanglement from Randomized Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB If only limited control over a multiparticle quantum system is available, a viable method to characterize correlations is to perform random measurements and consider the moments of the resulting probability distribution. We present systematic methods to analyze the different forms of entanglement with these moments in an optimized manner. First, we find the optimal criteria for different forms of multiparticle entanglement in three-qubit systems using the second moments of randomized measurements. Second, we present the optimal inequalities if entanglement in a bipartition of a multiqubit system shall be analyzed in terms of these moments. Finally, for higher-dimensional two-particle systems and higher moments, we provide criteria that are able to characterize various examples of bound entangled states, showing that detection of such states is possible in this framework.

TI Controllable spin-resolved photon emission enhanced by a slow-light mode

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report the slow-light enhanced spin-resolved in-plane emission from a single quantum dot (QD) in a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). The slow light dispersions in PCWs are designed to match the emission wavelengths of single QDs. The resonance between two spin states emitted from a single QD and a slow light mode of a waveguide is investigated under a magnetic field with Faraday configuration. Two spin states of a single QD experience different degrees of enhancement as their emission wavelengths are shifted by combining diamagnetic and Zeeman effects with an optical excitation power control. A circular polarization degree up to 0.81 is achieved by changing the off-resonant excitation power. Strongly polarized photon emission enhanced by a slow light mode shows great potential to attain controllable spin-resolved photon sources for integrated optical quantum networks on chip.

TI Network Quantum Steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The development of large-scale quantum networks promises to bring a multitude of technological applications as well as shed light on foundational topics, such as quantum nonlocality. It is particularly interesting to consider scenarios where sources within the network are statistically independent, which leads to so-called network nonlocality, even when parties perform fixed measurements. Here we promote certain parties to be trusted and introduce the notion of network steering and network local hidden state (NLHS) models within this paradigm of independent sources. In one direction, we show how the results from Bell nonlocality and quantum steering can be used to demonstrate network steering. We further show that it is a genuinely novel effect by exhibiting unsteerable states that nevertheless demonstrate network steering based upon entanglement swapping yielding a form of activation. On the other hand, we provide no-go results for network steering in a large class of scenarios by explicitly constructing NLHS models.

TI Nonuniform phases in the geometrically frustrated dissipative XYZ model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the steady-state phase diagram of the dissipative spin-1/2 XYZ model on a two-dimensional triangular lattice, in which each site is coupled to a local environment. By means of cluster mean-field approximation, we find that the steady-state phases of the system are rather rich, in particular there exist various types of nonuniform antiferromagnetic phases due to the geometrical frustration. As the short-range correlations are included in the analysis, the numerical results show that the oscillatory phase disappears while the triantiferromagnetic and biantiferromagnetic phases remain to exist in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, the existence of the spin-density-wave phase, which is missed by the single-site mean-field analysis, is also revealed by the spin-structure factor.

TI Probing off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization with tensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Energy filter methods in combination with quantum simulation can efficiently access the properties of quantum simulating this algorithm with tensor networks can be used to investigate the microcanonical properties of large spin chains, as recently shown by Y. Yang et al. [Phys. Rev. B 106, 024307 (2022)]. Here we extend this strategy to explore the properties of off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the energy eigenbasis, fundamentally connected to the thermalization behavior and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We test the method on integrable and nonintegrable spin chains of up to 60 sites, much larger than accessible with exact diagonalization. Our results allow us to explore the scaling of the off-diagonal functions with the size and energy difference, and to establish quantitative differences between integrable and nonintegrable cases.

TI Scanning Cavity Microscopy of a Single-Crystal Diamond Membrane
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Efficient optical interfacing of spin-bearing quantum emitters is a crucial ingredient for quantum networks. A promising route therefore is to incorporate host materials as minimally processed membranes into open-access microcavities: it enables significant emission enhancement and efficient photon collection, minimizes deteriorating influence on the quantum emitter, and allows for full spatial and spectral tunability. Here, we study the properties of a high-finesse fiber Fabry-Perot microcavity with integrated single-crystal diamond membranes by scanning cavity microscopy. We observe the spatially resolved effects of the diamond-air interface on the cavity-mode structure: a strong correlation of the cavity finesse and mode structure with the diamond thickness and surface topography, prevalent transverse-mode mixing under diamondlike conditions, and mode-character-dependent polarization-mode splitting. Our results reveal the influence of the diamond surface on the achievable Purcell enhancement, which helps to clarify the route towards optimized spin-photon interfaces.

TI Level splitting induced by collective interaction in a waveguide QED
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems, noninteracting quantum entities can be coupled through the vacuum field of the waveguide, leading to both coherent and dissipative interactions. We systematically demonstrate that the reflection spectrum is clear and direct in representing the collective interaction using the mirror reflection properties of semi-infinite waveguides. Due to the destructive interference with its mirror image, the emitter is decoupled from the waveguide, suppressing the decay so that the reflection spectrum shows an anticrossing phenomenon induced by coherent interaction. Moreover, the reflection spectrum of an anti-parity-time symmetric Hamiltonian caused by dissipative coupling exhibits an unconventional splitting characterized by level attraction transitioning at exceptional points. Our findings highlight the significance of exploring non-Hermitian effects in waveguide quantum systems, offering potential applications in quantum networks reliant on long-distance interactions.

TI Large Coherent States Formed from Disordered k-Regular Random
   Graphs
SO ENTROPY
AB The present work is motivated by the need for robust, large-scale coherent states that can play possible roles as quantum resources. A challenge is that large, complex systems tend to be fragile. However, emergent phenomena in classical systems tend to become more robust with scale. Do these classical systems inspire ways to think about robust quantum networks? This question is studied by characterizing the complex quantum states produced by mapping interactions between a set of qubits from structure in graphs. We focus on maps based on k-regular random graphs where many edges were randomly deleted. We ask how many edge deletions can be tolerated. Surprisingly, it was found that the emergent coherent state characteristic of these graphs was robust to a substantial number of edge deletions. The analysis considers the possible role of the expander property of k-regular random graphs.

TI Localized Dynamics in the Floquet Quantum East Model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce and study the discrete -time version of the quantum East model, an interacting quantum spin chain inspired by simple kinetically constrained models of classical glasses. Previous work has established that its continuous -time counterpart displays a disorder -free localization transition signaled by the appearance of an exponentially large (in the volume) family of nonthermal, localized eigenstates. Here we combine analytical and numerical approaches to show that (i) the transition persists for discrete times, in fact, it is present for any finite value of the time step apart from a zero measure set; (ii) it is directly detected by following the nonequilibrium dynamics of the fully polarized state. Our findings imply that the transition is currently observable in state-of-the-art platforms for digital quantum simulation.

TI Optimizing the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol parameters
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols allow for information theoretically secure distribution of (classical) cryptographic key material. However, due to practical limitations the performance of QKD implementations is somewhat restricted. For this reason, it is crucial to find optimal protocol parameters, while guaranteeing information theoretic security. The performance of a QKD implementation is determined by the tightness of the underlying security analysis. In particular, the security analyses determines the key-rate, i.e., the amount of cryptographic key material that can be distributed per time unit. Nowadays, the security analyses of various QKD protocols are well understood. It is known that optimal protocol parameters, such as the number of decoy states and their intensities, can be found by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The complexity of this optimization problem is typically handled by making a number of heuristic assumptions. For instance, the number of decoy states is restricted to only one or two, with one of the decoy intensities set to a fixed value, and vacuum states are ignored as they are assumed to contribute only marginally to the secure key-rate. These assumptions simplify the optimization problem and reduce the size of search space significantly. However, they also cause the security analysis to be non-tight, and thereby result in sub-optimal performance. In this work, we follow a more rigorous approach using both linear and nonlinear programs describing the optimization problem. Our approach, focusing on the decoy-state BB84 protocol, allows heuristic assumptions to be omitted, and therefore results in a tighter security analysis with better protocol parameters. We show an improved performance for the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol, demonstrating that the heuristic assumptions typically made are too restrictive. Moreover, our improved optimization frameworks shows that the complexity of the performance optimization problem can also be handled without making heuristic assumptions, even with limited computational resources available.

TI Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on SVM Optimized with Adaptive
   Quantum DE Algorithm
SO SHOCK AND VIBRATION
AB In order to optimize traditional fault diagnosis models for practical applications, a fault diagnosis model based on support vector machines optimized with the adaptive quantum differential evolution of (AQDE-SVM) is proposed in this study. First, the traditional differential evolution is rewritten based on real number encoded into a qubit encoding. Second, this study proposes an adaptive quantum rotation gate and uses this gate to update the probability amplitude of the qubits. Finally, compared with quantum genetic algorithm support vector machines (QGA-SVM) and differential evolution-support vector machines (DE-SVM), etc., the results show that the algorithm proposed in this study has a higher diagnosis accuracy and shorter running time, providing great practical engineering value in the application of rolling bearing fault diagnosis.

TI Experimental Genuine Tripartite Nonlocality in a Quantum Triangle
   Network
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum networks are the center of many of the recent advances in quantum science, not only lead-ing to the discovery of new properties in the foundations of quantum theory but also allowing for novel communication and cryptography protocols. It is known that networks beyond that in the paradigmatic Bell's theorem imply new and sometimes stronger forms of nonclassicality. Due to a number of prac-tical difficulties, however, the experimental implementation of such networks remains far less explored. Going beyond what has been previously tested, here we verify the nonlocality of an experimental trian-gle network, consisting of three independent sources of bipartite entangled photon states interconnecting three distant parties. By performing separable measurements only and evaluating parallel chained Bell inequalities, we show that such networks can lead to a genuine form of tripartite nonlocality, where clas-sical models are unable to mimic the quantum predictions even if some of the parties are allowed to communicate.

TI Spin two-axis-twisting via coherent population trapping based cavity QED
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a spin two-axis-twisting mechanism via coherent population trapping (CPT) based atom-photon interactions. CPT happens and the atoms are trapped in the dark state (coherent superposition of two ground states) when the ground states are resonantly coupled to a common excited state. Close to CPT, the atoms behave as two dark-state based spins, which interact with the common cavity vacuum fields. The otherwise nonexistent interaction is created between them and is identified to be responsible for the two-axis-twisting of the ground state spin. The essential difference from the previous schemes is the compatibility of the twisting spin squeezing with the resonant atom-light interaction. The CPT resonant unit serves as a kind of new ingredients for the quantum networks.

TI Autonomic end-to-end quality-of-service assurance over QKD-secured
   optical networks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides future-proof security for data communications over optical networks. Currently, sophisticated QKD systems are developed and the scale of QKD-secured optical networks (QKD-ONs) becomes larger. Given the complex network conditions and dynamic end-to-end security services in QKD-ONs, autonomic management and control becomes a promising paradigm to support end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) assurance in an efficient and stable way without requiring human intervention. Hence, to enable and utilize the autonomic functionalities over QKD-ONs for realizing the end-to-end QoS assurance becomes a challenge. This work enhances the software defined networking (SDN) technique to tackle this challenge because SDN can add programmability and flexibility for QKD-ON's management and control. A new architecture of SDN-based QKD-ONs supporting autonomic end-to-end QoS assurance is designed, where a knowledge engine with autonomic control loops is developed in the SDN controller. We present the autonomic end-to-end QoS assurance procedure, and the cross-layer collaborative QoS assurance (CLC-QA) strategy for implementing the autonomic functionalities in the network level over QKD-ONs. We also establish an experimental testbed of SDN-based QKD-ONs supporting autonomic end-to-end QoS assurance, and perform the numerical simulation to verify our proposed approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that our presented approaches can achieve the millisecond-level overall latency of 337 ms and 618 ms, during the first and second autonomic adjustment without human intervention in case of the autonomic QoS protection. Moreover, the CLC-QA strategy is evaluated under different traffic loads by being compared with the baseline strategy without cross-layer collaboration. It can improve 22.5% protection success ratio and save 5.7% average key consumption. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Observation of universal Hall response in strongly interacting Fermions
SO SCIENCE
AB The Hall effect, which originates from the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, has deep consequences for the description of materials, extending far beyond condensed matter. Understanding such an effect in interacting systems represents a fundamental challenge, even for small magnetic fields. In this work, we used an atomic quantum simulator in which we tracked the motion of ultracold fermions in two-leg ribbons threaded by artificial magnetic fields. Through controllable quench dynamics, we measured the Hall response for a range of synthetic tunneling and atomic interaction strengths. We unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior above an interaction threshold, in agreement with theoretical analyses. The ability to reach hard-to-compute regimes demonstrates the power of quantum simulation to describe strongly correlated topological states of matter.

SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Quantum mechanics imposes a lower bound on the time required for a quantum system to reach certain given targets. In this paper, from a geometric perspective, we introduce a new quantum speed limit (QSL) based on the Bloch angle and derive the condition for it to saturate. Experimentally, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring this QSL using a photonic system through direct Bloch angle measurements via a swap test, bypassing the need for comprehensive quantum state tomography. Compared to the existing Bloch-angle-based QSL mentioned in prior work, our QSL requires fewer computational and experimental resources and provides tighter constraints for specific dynamics. Our work underscores the Bloch angle's effectiveness in providing tighter and experimentally accessible QSLs and advances the understanding of quantum dynamics.

Inspired by the similarities between the light field and bosonic atoms, we represent the light propagation in medium by the atomic transport in accompany of the laser-atom interaction. An artificial magneto-optic Faraday effect (MOFE) is readily signaled by the spin imbalance of atoms, with the setup of laser fields offering a high controllability for quantum manipulation. The present scheme is really feasible and can be realized with existing experimental techniques of ultracold atoms. It generalizes the crucial concept of the MOFE to ultracold atomic physics, and opens a new way of quantum emulating and exploring the MOFE and associated intriguing physics.

TI Multi-field-driven optomechanical entanglement
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Cavity optomechanical (COM) entanglement, playing an essential role in building quantum networks and enhancing quantum sensors, is usually weak and easily destroyed by noises. As feasible and effective ways to overcome this obstacle, optical or mechanical parametric modulations have been used to improve the quality of quantum squeezing or entanglement in various COM systems. However, the possibility of combining these powerful means to enhance COM entanglement has yet to be explored. Here, we fill this gap by studying a COM system containing an intra-cavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA), driven optically and mechanically. By tuning the relative strength and the frequency mismatch of optical and mechanical driving fields, we find that constructive interference can emerge and significantly improve the strength of COM entanglement and its robustness to thermal noises. This work sheds what we believe to be a new light on preparing and protecting quantum states with multi-field driven COM systems for diverse applications.

TI Quantifying high-order interdependencies in entangled quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We leverage recent advances in information theory to develop a method to characterize the dominant character of the high -order dependencies of quantum systems. To this end, we introduce the Q -information: an informationtheoretic measure capable of distinguishing quantum states dominated by synergy or redundancy. We illustrate the measure by investigating the properties of paradigmatic entangled qubit states and find that-in contrast to classical systems-quantum systems need at least four variables to exhibit high -order properties. Furthermore, our results reveal that unitary evolution can radically affect the internal information organization in a way that strongly depends on the corresponding Hamiltonian. Overall, the Q -information sheds light on aspects of the internal organization of quantum systems and their time evolution, opening different avenues for studying several quantum phenomena and related technologies.

TI Optimal design of nanomagnets for on-chip field gradients
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The generation of localized magnetic field gradients by on-chip nanomagnets is useful for a variety of technological applications, in particular, for spin qubits. To advance beyond the empirical design of these nanomagnets, we propose a systematic and general approach based on the micromagnetic formulation of an optimal field gradient source. We study the different field configurations that can be realized and find out quantitatively the most suitable ferromagnetic layer geometries. Using micromagnetic simulations, we then investigate the minimum requirements for reaching magnetic saturation in these nanomagnets. In terms of either longitudinal- or transverse-field gradient, the results provide an optimal solution for uniform, saturated nanomagnets, where the magnetic material can be selected according to the strength of the external fields that can be used.

TI Average steered coherence in correlated amplitude damping channel
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The combined effects of memory effects due to correlated actions of the amplitude damping channel on two qubits and temporal correlations in the time evolution of each qubit on the average steered coherence (ASC) are explored. For the input Bell states, it is shown that the two kinds of memory effects are beneficial for enhancing ASC of the output states in a wide time region. In particular, the ASC is immune to decoherence for some input states if the actions of the amplitude damping channel are fully correlated. Moreover, in the infinite-time limit, the positive role of the non-Markovian effect on the steady-state ASC disappears, whereas the correlated actions of the channel are still beneficial to certain input states.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Computers and the Impact of Quantum Noise
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Benchmarking is how the performance of a computing system is determined. Surprisingly, even for classical computers this is not a straightforward process. One must choose the appropriate benchmark and metrics to extract meaningful results. Different benchmarks test the system in different ways, and each individual metric may or may not be of interest. Choosing the appropriate approach is tricky. The situation is even more open ended for quantum computers, where there is a wider range of hardware, fewer established guidelines, and additional complicating factors. Notably, quantum noise significantly impacts performance and is difficult to model accurately. Here, we discuss benchmarking of quantum computers from a computer architecture perspective and provide numerical simulations highlighting challenges that suggest caution.

TI Defect-Free Arbitrary-Geometry Assembly of Mixed-Species Atom Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Optically trapped mixed-species single atom arrays with arbitrary geometry are an attractive and promising platform for various applications, because tunable quantum systems with multiple components provide extra degrees of freedom for experimental control. Here, we report the first demonstration of twodimensional 6 x 4 dual-species atom assembly of 85Rb (87Rb) atoms with a filling fraction of 0.88 (0.89). This mixed-species atomic synthesis is achieved via rearranging initially randomly distributed atoms by a sorting algorithm (heuristic heteronuclear algorithm) which is designed for bottom-up atom assembly with both user-defined geometries and two-species atom number ratios. Our fully tunable hybrid-atom systems with scalable advantages are a good starting point for high-fidelity quantum logic, many-body quantum simulation, and single molecule array formation.

TI Dynamic control of spontaneous emission using magnetized InSb
   higher-order-mode antennas
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB We exploit InSb's magnetic-induced optical properties to design THz sub-wavelength antennas that actively tune the radiative decay rates of dipole emitters at their proximity. The proposed designs include a spherical InSb antenna and a cylindrical Si-InSb hybrid antenna demonstrating distinct behaviors. The former dramatically enhances both radiative and non-radiative decay rates in the epsilon-near-zero region due to the dominant contribution of the Zeeman-splitting electric octupole mode. The latter realizes significant radiative decay rate enhancement via magnetic octupole mode, mitigating the quenching process and accelerating the photon production rate. A deep-learning-based optimization of emitter positioning further enhances the quantum efficiency of the proposed hybrid system. These novel mechanisms are promising for tunable THz single-photon sources in integrated quantum networks.

TI Ground states of one-dimensional dipolar lattice bosons at unit filling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recent experiments on ultracold dipoles in optical lattices open exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of extended Hubbard models. When considered in one dimension, these models present at unit filling a particularly interesting ground-state physics, including a symmetry-protected topological phase known as Haldane insulator. We show that the tail of the dipolar interaction beyond nearest-neighbors, which may be tailored by means of the transversal confinement, does not only modify quantitatively the Haldane insulator regime and lead to density waves of larger periods, but results as well in unexpected insulating phases. These insulating phases may be topological or topologically trivial, and are characterized by peculiar correlations of the site occupations. These phases may be realized and observed in state-of-the-art experiments.

TI Condensation in hybrid superconducting-cavity-microscopic-spins systems
   with finite-bandwidth drive
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Using Keldysh field theory, we find conditions for nonequilibrium condensation in the open Tavis-Cummings model under a direct finite-bandwidth incoherent cavity drive. Experimentally, we expect the condensation transition to be easily accessible to hybrid superconducting systems coupled to microscopic spins, as well as to many other incoherently driven light-matter systems. In our theoretical analysis, we explicitly incorporate the drive???s spectral distribution into the saddle-point description. We show that the injected incoherent photons create a drive-dependent effective coupling between spin-1/2 particles. The condensation transition arises at a critical regime of driving which we can now accurately predict. Our results also provide important guidelines for future quantum simulation experiments of nonequilibrium phases with hybrid devices.

TI Floquet Hamiltonian engineering of an isolated many-body spin system
SO SCIENCE
AB Controlling interactions is the key element for the quantum engineering of many-body systems. Using time-periodic driving, a naturally given many-body Hamiltonian of a closed quantum system can be transformed into an effective target Hamiltonian that exhibits vastly different dynamics. We demonstrate such Floquet engineering with a system of spins represented by Rydberg states in an ultracold atomic gas. By applying a sequence of spin manipulations, we change the symmetry properties of the effective Heisenberg XYZ Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the relaxation behavior of the total spin is drastically modified. The observed dynamics can be qualitatively captured by a semiclassical simulation. Engineering a wide range of Hamiltonians opens vast opportunities for implementing quantum simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in a single experimental setting.

TI Entropic and trace-distance-based measures of non-Markovianity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze and compare different measures for the degree of non-Markovianity in the dynamics of open quantum systems. These measures are based on the distinguishability of quantum states, which is quantified, on the one hand, by the trace distance or, more generally, by the trace norm of the Helstrom matrix and, on the other hand, by entropic quantifiers: the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Holevo or quantum skew divergence. We explicitly construct a qubit dynamics for which the trace-norm-based non-Markovianity measure is nonzero, while all the entropic measures turn out to be zero. This leads to the surprising conclusion that the non-Markovianity measure which employs the trace norm of the Helstrom matrix is strictly stronger than all entropic non-Markovianity measures.

AB The proper functioning of some micro-fabricated novel quantum devices, such as superconducting resonators and qubits, is severely affected by the presence of parasitic structural material defects known as tunneling two-level-systems (TLS). Recent experiments have reported unambiguous evidence of the strong interaction between individual (coherent) TLS using strain-assisted spectroscopy. This work provides an alternative and simple theoretical insight that illustrates how to obtain the spectral response of such strongly interacting defects residing inside the amorphous tunnel barrier of a qubit's Josephson junction. Moreover, the corresponding spectral signatures obtained here may serve to quickly and efficiently elucidate the actual state of these interacting TLS in experiments based on strain or electric-field spectroscopy.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Following recent advancements, we consider a scenario of multipartite postquantum steering and general no-signaling assemblages. We introduce the notion of the edge of the set of no-signaling assemblages and we present its characterization. Next, we use this concept to construct witnesses for no-signaling assemblages without a local hidden state model. Finally, in the simplest nontrivial case of steering with two untrusted subsystems, we discuss the possibility of quantum realization of assemblages on the edge. In particular, for three-qubit states, we obtain a no-go-type result, which states that it is impossible to produce an assemblage on the edge using measurements described by positive operator valued measures as long as the rank of a given state is greater than or equal to 3.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the steady-state phases of the dissipative spin-1/2 J(1)-J(2) XYZ model on a two-dimensional square lattice. We show the next-nearest-neighboring interaction plays a crucial role in determining the steady-state properties. By means of the Gutzwiller mean-field (MF) factorization, we find the emergence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) steady-state phases. The existence of such AFM steady-state phases in thermodynamic limit is confirmed by cluster mean-field (CMF) analysis. Moreover, we find evidence of the limit cycle phase through the largest quantum Lyapunov exponent in small cluster and check the stability of the oscillation by calculating the averaged oscillation amplitude up to 4 x 4 CMF approximation.

TI Limitations to Dynamical Error Suppression and Gate-Error Virtualization
   from Temporally Correlated Nonclassical Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Realistic multiqubit noise processes often result in error mechanisms that are not captured by the probabilistic Markovian error models commonly employed in circuit-level analyses of quantum fault tolerance. By working within an open-quantum system Hamiltonian formulation, we revisit the validity of the notion of a constant gate error in the presence of noise that is both temporally correlated and nonclassical, and the impact of which is mitigated through perfect instantaneous dynamical decoupling subject to finite timing constraints. We study a minimal exactly solvable single-qubit model under Gaussian quantum dephasing noise, showing that the fidelity of a dynamically protected idling gate can depend strongly on its location in the circuit and the history of applied control, even when the system-side error propagation is fully removed through perfect reset operations. For digital periodic control, we prove that, under mild conditions on the low-frequency behavior of the nonclassical noise spectrum, the gate fidelity saturates at a value that is strictly smaller than the one attainable in the absence of control history; the presence of high-frequency noise peaks is also found as especially harmful, due to the possible onset of control-induced resonances. We explicitly relate these features to the evolution of the bath statistics during the computation, which has not been fully accounted for in existing treatments. We find that only if decoupling can keep the qubit highly pure over a time scale larger than the correlation time of the noise, the bath approximately converges to its original statistics and a stable-in-time control performance is recovered. Our work highlights the significance of the full bath evolution between circuit locations and suggests that additional trade-offs and design constraints may arise in layered quantum fault-tolerant architectures from the need to appropriately reequilibrate the quantum bath statistics, particularly when Markovian noise is present alongside temporally correlated noise.

TI Experimental Single-Setting Quantum State Tomography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers solve ever more complex tasks using steadily growing system sizes. Character-izing these quantum systems is vital, yet becoming increasingly challenging. The gold-standard method for this task is quantum state tomography (QST), capable of fully reconstructing a quantum state with-out prior knowledge. The measurement and classical computing costs, however, increase exponentially with the number of constituents (e.g., qubits)-a daunting bottleneck given the scale of existing and near -term quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate a scalable and practical QST approach that only uses a single measurement setting, namely symmetric informationally complete (SIC) positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). We implement these nonorthogonal measurements on an ion trap quantum pro-cessor by utilizing additional energy levels within each ion-without requiring ancillary ions to assist in measurements. More precisely, we locally map the SIC POVM to orthogonal states embedded in a higher-dimensional system, which we read out using repeated in-sequence detections, thereby providing full tomographic information in every shot. Combining this SIC tomography with the recently devel-oped randomized measurement toolbox ("classical shadows") proves to be a powerful combination. SIC tomography alleviates the need for choosing measurement settings at random ("derandomization"), while classical shadows enable the estimation of arbitrary polynomial functions of the density matrix orders of magnitudes faster than standard methods. The latter enables in-depth entanglement characterization, which we experimentally showcase on a five-qubit absolutely maximally entangled state. Moreover, the fact that the full tomography information is available in every shot enables online QST in real time (i.e., while the experiment is running). We demonstrate this on an eight-qubit entangled state (which has 28 center dot 28 - 1 = 65 535 degrees of freedom), as well as for fast state identification. All in all, these features single out SIC-based classical shadow estimation as a highly scalable and convenient tool for quantum state characterization.

TI Fast Feedback Control of Mechanical Motion Using Circuit Optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Measurement-based control, using an active-feedback loop, is a standard tool in technology. Feedback control is also emerging as a useful and fundamental tool in quantum technology and in related fundamental studies, where it can be used to prepare and stabilize pure quantum states in various quantum systems. Feedback cooling of center-of-mass micromechanical oscillators, which typically exhibit high thermal noise far above the quantum regime, has been particularly actively studied and has recently been shown to allow ground-state cooling by means of optical measurements. Here we realize measurement-based feedback operations in an electromechanical system, cooling the mechanical thermal noise down to three quanta, limited by added amplifier noise. We also obtain significant cooling when the system is pumped at the blue optomechanical sideband, where the system is unstable without feedback.

TI Dynamics of closed quantum systems under stochastic resetting
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider a closed quantum system subject to a stochastic resetting process. The generic expression for the resulting density operator is formulated for arbitrary resetting dynamics, fully characterised by the distribution of times between consecutive reset events. We analyse the behaviour of the state in the long-time regime, as well as the evolution of relevant quantities in the study of quantum coherence and closed- versus open-system dynamics. Our general results are complemented with examples involving particular resetting distributions, and special attention is paid to the two-level (qubit) system, in which we elucidate the effects of the renewal process on the speed of evolution toward an orthogonal state, and gain insight into the resetting applied to open systems.

TI Non-Markovian temperature sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the sensing performance of a single-qubit quantum thermometer within a non-Markovian dynamical framework. By employing an exactly numerical hierarchical equations of the motion method, we go beyond traditional paradigms of the Born-Markov theory, the pure dephasing mechanism, and the weak-coupling approximation, which were commonly used in many previous studies of quantum thermometry. We find (i) the non-Markovian characteristics may boost the estimation efficiency, (ii) the sensitivity of quantum thermometry can be effectively optimized by engineering the proportions of different coupling operators in the whole sensor-reservoir interaction Hamiltonian, and (iii) a threshold, above which the strong sensor-reservoir coupling can significantly enhance the sensing precision in the long-encoding-time regime. Our results may have certain applications for high-resolution quantum thermometry.

TI Bogoliubov polaritons mediated strong indirect interaction between
   distant whispering-gallery-mode resonators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a method to achieve a strong indirect interaction between two distant whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonators in a hybrid quantum system at room temperature, even when the distance between them exceeds 40 wavelengths. By exploiting the quantum critical point, we can greatly enhance both the effective damping rate and the coupling strengths between a WGM resonator and a low-frequency polariton. We introduce a large effective frequency detuning to suppress the effective damping rate while maintaining the enhanced coupling strength. The strong indirect interaction between separated WGM resonators is mediated by a far-off-resonant low-frequency polariton through virtual excitations in a process similar to Raman process. This proposal provides a viable approach to building a quantum network based on strongly coupled WGM resonators.

TI Enhancement of Photoluminescence Collection from Diamond-Based Quantum
   Emitter with Diamond Photonic Nanopillar
SO ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND
AB This work aimed to examine the effects of photonic diamond nanopillar toward enhancing the collection efficiency of photoluminescence signal from quantum emitters in diamond. In this work, the finite element methods were used as a platform to characterize the emission pattern and the collection efficiency. The collection efficiency value was then characterize based on various variables, including pillar diameters, dipole orientation, emission wavelength, and emitter placement inside the photonic structure. From the simulations, the collection efficiency from an optimized nanopillar structure can be improved up to three times the bulk value, particularly in pillar diameters ranging from 70-100nm. Furthermore, the multivariable dependency studies provide valuable insight into the design and engineering tolerance of future practical quantum-based devices.

TI Cascading quantum walks with Chebyshev map for designing a robust
   medical image encryption algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The secure storage and transmission of healthcare data have become a critical concern due to their increasing use in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Medical images contain confidential patient information, and unauthorized access to or modification of these images can have severe consequences. Chaotic maps are commonly used for constructing medical image cipher systems, but with the growth of quantum technology, these systems may become vulnerable. To address this issue, a new medical image cipher algorithm based on cascading quantum walk with Chebyshev map has been presented in this paper. The proposed system has been tested and found to have high levels of security and efficiency, with UACI, NPCR, Chi-square, and global information entropy values averaging at 33.48095%, 99.62984%, 248.92128, and 7.99923, respectively.

TI Optimal sparse eigenspace and low-rank density matrix estimation for
   quantum systems
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE
AB Quantum state tomography, which aims to estimate quantum states that are described by density matrices, plays an important role in quantum science and quantum technology. This paper examines the eigenspace estimation and the reconstruction of large low-rank density matrix based on Pauli measurements. Both ordinary principal component analysis (PCA) and iterative thresholding sparse PCA (ITSPCA) estimators of the eigenspace are studied, and their respective convergence rates are established. In particular, we show that the ITSPCA estimator is rate-optimal. We present the reconstruction of the large low-rank density matrix and obtain its optimal convergence rate by using the ITSPCA estimator. A numerical study is carried out to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Numerical analysis of photon absorption of gate-defined quantum dots
   embedded in asymmetric bull's-eye optical cavities
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Improving the photon-spin conversion efficiency without polarization dependence is a major challenge in realizing quantum interfaces gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) for polarization-encoded photonic quantum network systems. Previously, we reported the design of an air-bridge bull's-eye cavity that enhances the photon absorption efficiency of an embedded gate-defined QD regardless of the photon polarization. Here, we numerically demonstrate that a further 1.6 times improvement in efficiency is possible by simply adjusting the distance of the substrate from the semiconductor slab where the bull's-eye structure is formed. Our analysis clarifies that the upward-preferred coupling and narrow far-field emission pattern realized by substrate-induced asymmetry enable the improvement.

AB The generation of entanglement between distant quantum systems is at the core of quantum networking. In recent years, numerous theoretical protocols for remote-entanglement generation have been proposed, many of which have been experimentally realized. Here, we provide a modular theoretical framework to elucidate the general mechanisms of photon-mediated entanglement generation between single spins in atomic or solid -state systems. Our framework categorizes existing protocols at various levels of abstraction and allows for combining the elements of different schemes in new ways. These abstraction layers make it possible to readily compare protocols for different quantum hardware. To enable the practical evaluation of protocols tailored to specific experimental parameters, we have devised numerical simulations based on the framework with our codes available online.

TI Quantum twin interferometers
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum-correlated interferometer is an emerging tool in quantum technology that offers classical-limit-breaking phase sensitivity. However, to date, there exists a configurational bottleneck for its practicability due to the low phase-sensing power limited by the current detection strategies. Here, we establish an innovative development termed as "quantum twin interferometer" with dual pairs of entangled twin beams arranged in the parallel configuration, allowing full exploitation of the quantum resource through the configuration of entangled detection. We observe the distributed phase sensing with 3-decibel quantum noise reduction in phase-sensing power at the level of milliwatts, which advances the record of signal-to-noise ratio so far achieved in photon-correlated interferometers by three orders of magnitude. The developed techniques in this work can be used to revolutionize a diversity of quantum devices requiring phase measurement.

We simulate and fabricate a chip-based magnetic trap capable of levitating superconducting particleswith diameters from 0.5 mu m to 200 mu m. The trap consists of two stacked silicon chips, each patterned with a planar multi-winding superconducting coil made of niobium. The two coils generate amagnetic field resembling a quadrupole near the trap center, in which we demonstrate trapping of a spherical 50 mu m diameter SnPb microparticle at temperatures of 4 K and 40 mK.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We report an axion dark matter search with a haloscope equipped with a microwave photon counter. The haloscope is a tunable high quality factor three-dimensional microwave cavity placed in a magnetic field. The photon counter, operated cyclically, maps an incoming microwave photon onto the state of a superconducting transmon qubit. The measurement protocol continuously monitors the power emitted by the haloscope cavity as well as the dark count background and enables tuning of the cavity frequency to probe different axion masses. With this apparatus, we enhance by a factor of 20 the search speed that can be reached with quantum-limited linear amplifiers and set a new standard for probing the existence of axions with resonant detectors above 5 GHz.

TI Fuzzy gauge theory for quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have an infinite -dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of "qubitization " scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called "fuzzy gauge theory, " building on the success of the fuzzy sigma-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource -efficient for quantum simulations.

TI Quantum heat engine with long-range advantages
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Long-range interacting quantum devices provides a promising route for quantum technology applications. Here, the presence of long-range interactions is shown to enhance the performances of a quantum heat engine featuring a many-body working substance. We focus on the paradigmatic example of a Kitaev chain undergoing a quantum Otto cycle and show that a substantial thermodynamic advantage may be achieved as the range of the interactions among its constituents increases. The advantage is most significant for the realistic situation of a finite time cycle: the presence of long-range interactions reduces the non-adiabatic energy losses, by suppressing the detrimental effects of dynamically generated excitations. This effect allows mitigating the trade-off between power and efficiency, paving the way for a wide range of experimental and technological applications.

We review the state of the art in the noise performance of conventional (solid-core) optical fibers from the perspective of precision optical measurements and quantum technology that rely on precise transfer of information over long distances. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of this platform and point to the opportunities that structured fiber technology offers to overcome some of these limitations.

AB Performance of linear avalanche photodiode-based balanced homodyne receiver (APD BHD) is examined and compared to reference BHD based on PIN photodiodes, in terms of common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), quantum-to-classical noise clearance (QCNR) and sensitivity in coherent reception of quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation format. NIST randomness validation was performed on sampled data for quantum random number generator (QRNG). Achieved CMRR values were 50 dB and 30 dB at 100 MHz and 1 GHz, respectively. QCNR of 20 dB at low input power of -20 dBm was demonstrated. Optical sensitivity of APD BHD coherent receiver compared to its PIN BHD counterpart can be improved by 3 dB at low local oscillator (LO) powers, whereas for high LO powers the sensitivity of APD BHD approaches the values for PIN BHD.

TI Persistent current of SU(N) fermions
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study the persistent current in a system of SU(N) fermions with repulsive interaction, confined in a ring-shaped potential and pierced by an effective magnetic flux. Several surprising effects emerge. As a combined result of spin correlations, (effective) magnetic flux and interaction, spinons can be created in the ground state such that the elementary flux quantum can change its nature. The persistent current landscape is affected dramatically by these changes. In particular, it displays a universal behaviour. Despite its mesoscopic character, the persistent current is able to detect a quantum phase transition (from metallic to Mott phases). Most of, if not all, our results could be experimentally probed within the state-of-the-art quantum technology, with neutral matter-wave circuits providing a particularly relevant platform for our work.

TI Optical self-cooling of a membrane oscillator in a cavity optomechanical
   experiment at room temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Thermal noise is a major obstacle to observing quantum behavior in macroscopic systems. To mitigate its effect, quantum optomechanical experiments are typically performed in a cryogenic environment. However, this condition represents a considerable complication in the transition from fundamental research to quantum technology applications. It is therefore interesting to explore the possibility of achieving the quantum regime in room-temperature experiments. In this work we test the limits of sideband-cooling vibration modes of a SiN membrane in a cavity optomechanical experiment. We obtain an effective temperature of a few millikelvins, corresponding to a phononic occupation number of around 100. We show that further cooling is prevented by the excess classical noise of our laser source, and we outline the road toward the achievement of ground state cooling.

TI Ultra-low frequency noise external cavity diode laser systems for
   quantum applications
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present two distinct ultra-low frequency noise lasers at 729 nm with a fast frequency noise of 30 Hz2/Hz, corresponding to a Lorentzian linewidth of 0.1 kHz. The characteristics of both lasers, which are based on different types of laser diodes, are investigated using experimental and theoretical analysis with a focus on identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each type of system. Specifically, we study the differences and similarities in mode behavior while tuning frequency noise and linewidth reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the locking capability of these systems on medium-finesse cavities. The results provide insights into the unique operational characteristics of these ultra-low noise lasers and their potential applications in quantum technology that require high levels of control fidelity.

TI Exploring spin squeezing in the Mott insulating regime: Role of
   anisotropy, inhomogeneity, and hole doping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin squeezing in systems with single-particle control is a well-established resource of modern quantum technology. Applied in an optical lattice clock it can reduce the statistical uncertainty of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we consider dynamic generation of spin squeezing with ultra-cold bosonic atoms with two internal states loaded into an optical lattice in the strongly interacting regime as realized with state-of-the-art experiments using a quantum gas microscope. We show that anisotropic interactions and inhomogeneous magnetic fields generate scalable spin squeezing if their magnitudes are sufficiently small, but not negligible. The effect of nonuniform filling caused by hole doping, nonzero temperature, and external confinement is studied at a microscopic level demonstrating their limiting role in the dynamics and scaling of spin squeezing.

TI Microwave sensing of Andreev bound states in a gate-defined
   superconducting quantum point contact
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We use a superconducting microresonator as a cavity to sense absorption of microwaves by a superconducting quantum point contact defined by surface gates over a proximitized two-dimensional electron gas. Renormalization of the cavity frequency with phase difference across the point contact is consistent with coupling to Andreev bound states. Near pi phase difference, we observe random fluctuations in absorption with gate voltage, related to quantum interference-induced modulations in the electron transmission. Close to pinch-off, we identify features consistent with the presence of a single Andreev bound state and describe the Andreev-cavity interaction using a Jaynes-Cummings model. By fitting the weak Andreev-cavity coupling, we extract similar to GHz decoherence consistent with charge noise and the transmission dispersion associated with a localized state.

TI Cumulative generation of maximal entanglement between spectrally
   distinct qubits using squeezed light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate how to create maximal entanglement between two qubits that are encoded in two spectrally distinct solid-state quantum emitters embedded in a waveguide interferometer. The optical probe is provided by readily accessible squeezed light, generated by parametric down-conversion. By continuously illuminating the emitters, the photon scattering and incremental path-erasure builds up entanglement. Our method does not require perfectly identical emitters, and accommodates spectral variations due to the fabrication process. Furthermore, for some linewidth and energy ratios, the entanglement buildup can be significantly faster than for more similar emitters. It is also robust enough to create entanglement with a concurrence above 99% in the event of scattering losses and detector inefficiencies and can form the basis for practical entangled networks.

TI Inferring general links between energetics and information with unknown
   environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Identifying general links between energetics and information in realistic open quantum systems is a longstanding problem in quantum thermodynamics and quantum information processing. However, the generality of existing efforts is often impeded by their specific assumptions about environments. Here we address the problem by developing a trajectory-level thermodynamic inference theory to establish general links using just the knowledge of the system, enabling a single framework applicable to a diverse range of environments. Underpinning the framework is a notion of excess energy introduced for inferring the net energy gain of the system after completing an information processing trajectory. We show that fluctuation behaviors of the excess energy encode general links between energetics and information with a conceptual advantage that they completely avoid a priori assumptions about environments and system-environment coupling forms. Crucially, we obtain a single thermodynamic inequality that integrates upper bounds on heat dissipation and extracted work in terms of system's information content change, providing complementary constraints that greatly expand the context of existing well-adopted results based on the second law of thermodynamics. We also uncover lower bounds on the precision of the fluctuating system's energy and information content changes in terms of their Fano factors and a correlation function between them. By extending relations between energetics and information to higher-order fluctuations, we thus reveal a trade-off that a more precise inference of energy or information content changes requires a looser energetic-information link. We showcase the implications of these general links in a number of quantum information and thermodynamic tasks of application relevance. Our framework provides a toolkit for analyzing the interplay between energetics and information from the trajectory level in generic quantum systems, thereby adding an indispensable structure to the thermodynamics of information.

TI Internal disorder of hydrogenic-like atom trapped in dielectric
   spherical microcavity
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The research on the disorder of quantum system plays a very important role in the field of quantum information, and has received much attention from theoretical and experimental researchers. However, it is very difficult to study the disorder of atoms trapped in microcavity due to their complex nonlocal space-time evolution characteristics. To solve this problem, we present a method to study the internal disorder of hydrogenic atoms trapped in microcavity, that is, to characterize and investigate the disorder of the confined system by using the quantum information entropy and shape complexity of the system. The Shannon information entropy and shape complexity in position space and momentum space (Sr, Sp, C[r], C[p]) are calculated and analyzed for different quantum states of hydrogenic atom in InN dielectric spherical microcavity, and pay special attention to the exploration of the influence of quantum confinement effect on the disorder of the system. The results show that when the radius of the spherical microcavity is very small, the quantum confinement effect is more significant, and a series of extreme points appears in the shape complexity curve of the system, which is caused by the joint interaction of information entropy and spatial inhomogeneity. With the increase of the radius of the spherical cavity, the effect of quantum confinement is weakened, and the Shannon information entropy and shape complexity of the confined hydrogenic atom are similar to the counterparts of the hydrogenic atom in free space. Our work provides an effective method to study the internal disorder of a confined quantum. This work provides an effective method for studying the internal disorder of confined quantum systems and presents some references for the information measurement of confined quantum systems.

TI Antibunched entangled photon pair emission via two-photon excitation in
   a four-level quantum dot within an optical cavity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entangled photon pairs are a crucial resource in quantum information processing. However, common sources of entangled photon pairs, such as generation by spontaneous parametric down-conversion, impose a Poisson distribution on the pairs, limiting their applicability to quantum information processing. Therefore, generating entangled photon pairs exhibiting a sub-Poisson distribution (i.e., entangled photon bundle) would be crucial/an important advancement in the current research context. Recently, it has been proposed that antibunched photon pairs can be generated using pulsed excitation of quantum dots based on photon blockade. In this work we propose a scheme to generate entangled photon pairs with strong antibunching properties via continuous driving. Under two-photon resonant continuous pumping, a quantum dot is first excited to a biexciton state and then emits a pair of entangled photons into a two-mode cavity. Owing to the strong coupling between the quantum dot and optical modes of the cavity, at most one pair of left-/right-polarized photons exists at a time in the cavity. Specifically, the antibunching effect, average photon number, and entanglement of the left-or right-polarized photons can be resonantly enhanced when the coupling strengths between the exciton (biexciton) transition and cavity modes are equal. Moreover, our results show that the binding energy of the biexciton substantially affects the antibunching effect, average photon number, and entanglement of the left-/right-polarized photons. With suitable parameters, we can realize photon pairs with strong antibunching, a large average photon number, and deep entanglement. Hence, the studied quantum dot-cavity system is a promising source of antibunched entangled photon pairs.

TI Modulation of topological phase transitions and topological quantum
   states by counter-rotating wave effect in one-dimensional
   superconducting microwave cavity lattice
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In this work, a one-dimensional lattice theory scheme is proposed based on superconducting microwave cavity, which includes two different types of microwave cavity unit cells. The coupling between the unit cells is controlled by flux qubits to simulate and study their topological insulator characteristics. Specifically, by mapping the counter-rotating wave terms into the p-wave superconducting pairing term, a one-dimensional superconducting microwave cavity lattice scheme with a p-wave superconducting pairing term is obtained. It is found that the p-wave superconducting pairing term can modulate the topological quantum state of the system, allowing the topological quantum information transmission channels with four edge states to be created. In addition, when the p-wave superconducting pairing term interacts with the nearest-neighbor, the energy band undergoes fluctuations, thus inducing new energy bands to be generated, but the degeneracy of the edge states remains stable, which can realize the multiple topological quantum state transmission paths. However, when its regulation exceeds the threshold, the energy gap of the system will close, causing the edge states to annihilate in a new energy band. Furthermore, with defects considered to exist in the system, when the strength of the defect is small, the edge state produces small fluctuations, but it can be clearly distinguished, showing its robustness. When the strength of the defect exceeds the threshold, the edge state and energy band will cause irregular fluctuations, allowing the edge state to integrate into an energy band. Our research results have important theoretical value and practical significance, and can be applied to quantum optics and quantum information processing in the future.

TI Exact Results for a Boundary-Driven Double Spin Chain and

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We derive an exact solution for the steady state of a setup where two XX- coupled N- qubit spin chains (with possibly nonuniform couplings) are subject to boundary Rabi drives and common boundary loss generated by a waveguide (either bidirectional or unidirectional). For a wide range of parameters, this system has a pure entangled steady state, providing a means for stabilizing remote multiqubit entanglement without the use of squeezed light. Our solution also provides insights into a single boundary -driven dissipative XX spin chain that maps to an interacting fermionic model. The nonequilibrium steady state exhibits surprising correlation effects, including an emergent pairing of hole excitations that arises from dynamically constrained hopping. Our system could be implemented in a number of experimental platforms, including circuit QED.

TI Quantum thermo-dynamical construction for driven open quantum systems
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum dynamics of driven open systems should be compatible with both quantum mechanic and thermodynamic principles. By formulating the thermodynamic principles in terms of a set of postulates we obtain a thermodynamically consistent master equation. Following an axiomatic approach, we base the analysis on an autonomous description, incorporating the drive as a large transient control quantum system. In the appropriate physical limit, we derive the semi-classical description, where the control is incorporated as a time-dependent term in the system Hamiltonian. The transition to the semi-classical description reflects the conservation of global coherence and highlights the crucial role of coherence in the initial control state. We demonstrate the theory by analyzing a qubit controlled by a single bosonic mode in a coherent state.

TI Triangle Measure of Tripartite Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Although genuine multipartite entanglement has already been generated and verified by experiments, most of the existing measures cannot detect genuine entanglement faithfully. In this work, by exploiting for the first time a previously overlooked constraint for the distribution of entanglement in three-qubit systems, we reveal a new genuine tripartite entanglement measure, which is related to the area of a so-called concurrence triangle. It is compared with other existing measures and is found superior to previous attempts for different reasons. A specific example is illustrated to show that two tripartite entanglement measures can be inequivalent due to the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space. The properties of the triangle measure make it a candidate in potential quantum tasks and available to be used in any multiparty entanglement problems.

TI Quantum XYZ Product Codes
SO QUANTUM
AB We study a three-fold variant of the hypergraph product code construction, differing from the standard homological product of three classical codes. When instantiated with 3 classical LDPC codes, this "XYZ product" yields a non CSS quantum LDPC code which might display a large minimum distance. The simplest instance of this construction, corresponding to the product of 3 repetition codes, is a non CSS variant of the 3-dimensional toric code known as the Chamon code. The general construction was introduced in Denise Maurice's PhD thesis, but has remained poorly understood so far. The reason is that while hypergraph product codes can be analyzed with combinatorial tools, the XYZ product codes also depend crucially on the algebraic properties of the parity-check matrices of the three classical codes, making their analysis much more involved.
   Our main motivation for studying XYZ product codes is that the natural representatives of logical operators are two-dimensional objects. This contrasts with standard hypergraph product codes in 3 dimensions which always admit one-dimensional logical operators. In particular, specific instances of XYZ product codes with constant rate might display a minimum distance as large as Theta(N-2/3). While we do not prove this result here, we obtain the dimension of a large class of XYZ product codes, and when restricting to codes with dimension 1, we reduce the problem of computing the minimum distance to a more elementary combinatorial problem involving binary 3-tensors. We also discuss in detail some families of XYZ product codes that can be embedded in three dimensions with local interaction. Some of these codes seem to share properties with Haah's cubic codes and might be interesting candidates for self-correcting quantum memories with a logarithmic energy barrier.

We introduce a novel two-channel quantum dot all-optical modulator (QD-AOM) designed to simultaneously modulate telecommunication wavelengths of 1.32 mu m and 1.55 mu m by utilizing the interaction between two pump signals (683 nm and 866 nm) and two probe signals (1.32 mu m and 1.55 mu m). This innovative device leverages InAs/AlAs core/shell colloidal quantum dots, offering a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient solution for next-generation optical communication networks and ultrafast quantum information processing. Theoretical modeling was performed by solving the 3D Schrodinger equation, coupled rate and propagation equations to simulate the device's performance. The model accounts for carrier transfer processes and the interaction between channels through Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Simulations demonstrated that the QD-AOM achieved modulation depths of 65% and 62% for channels corresponding to 1.55 mu m and 1.32 mu m, respectively, with bandwidths of 26.3 GHz and 19.7 GHz. The device maintained high stability and efficiency at room temperature, with minimal variation in modulation depth across different temperatures, indicating its robustness for practical applications. Its broadband response, high modulation depth, and robust performance make it an ideal candidate for integration into future high-speed communication systems, signal processing, and other photonics-based applications.

TI Waveguides in a quantum perspective
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Solid state quantum devices, operated at dilution cryostat temperatures, are relying on microwave signals to both drive and read-out their quantum states. These signals are transmitted into the cryogenic environment, out of it towards detection devices, or even between quantum systems by well-designed waveguides, almost lossless when made of superconducting materials. Here we report on the quantum theory that describes the simplest Cartesian-type geometries: parallel plates, and rectangular tubes. The aim of the article is twofold: first on a technical and pragmatic level, we provide a full and compact quantum description of the different traveling wave families supported by these guides. Second, on an ontological level, we interpret the results and discuss the nature of the light fields corresponding to each mode family. The concept of potential difference is extended from transverse electric-magnetic (TEM) waves to all configurations, by means of a specific gauge fixing. The generalized flux phi<^> introduced in the context of quantum electronics becomes here essential: it is the scalar field, conjugate of a charge Q<^>, that confines light within the electrodes, let them be real or virtual. The gap in the dispersion relations of non-TEM waves turns out to be linked either to a potential energy necessary for the photon confinement, or to a kinetic energy arising from a photon mass. We finally compute the field zero-point fluctuations in every configuration. The theory is predictive: the lowest transverse magnetic modes should have smaller quantum noise than the higher ones, which at large wavevectors recover a conventional value similar to TEM and transverse electric ones. Such low-noise modes might be particularly useful for the routing of quantum information.

TI Broadband Hybridly Polarized Vector Vortex Raman Microchip Laser
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Hybridly polarized (HP) vector vortex Raman lasers dramatically extend their applications on optical microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information. Spatial light modulators and waveplates are widely used for generating HP vector vortex lasers, however, the performance and beam quality of HP vector vortex lasers are restricted by diffraction loss and low damage threshold of these optical elements. Here, HP vector vortex Raman microchip lasers constructed with Yb3+:Y3Al5O12 (Yb:YAG) and vanadate (YVO4) crystals is demonstrated. The states of polarization (SoP) of HP vector vortex lasers are combination of radial and anti-radial polarizations (RP-ARP), azimuthal and anti-azimuthal polarizations (AP-AAP). The SoP of HP vector vortex lasers can be controlled by adjusting the length of YVO4 crystal and applying pump power. Maximum output powers are 456 and 586 mW with optical efficiency of 7.1% and 9.2% for HP vector vortex lasers with SoP of RP-ARP and AP-AAP. The HP vector vortex Raman lasers with SoP of RP-ARP and AP-AAP oscillate approximate to 1076 nm with bandwidths of 11.4 and 10.8 nm. High beam quality is achieved for HP vector vortex lasers with measured M2 nearly equal to theoretical value. The broadband HP vector vortex Raman lasers with high beam quality extend applications on optical trapping, and quantum information processing.
   Broadband hybridly polarized (HP) vector vortex Raman lasers are generated in an annular beam-pumped Yb:YAG/YVO4 Raman microchip laser. States of polarization of HP vector vortex Raman laser can be controlled by adjusting the thickness of YVO4 crystal.

TI Rapid mixing of path integral Monte Carlo for 1D stoquastic Hamiltonians
SO QUANTUM
AB Path integral quantum Monte Carlo (PIMC) is a method for estimating thermal equilibrium properties of stoquastic quantum spin systems by sampling from a classical Gibbs distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The PIMC method has been widely used to study the physics of materials and for simulated quantum annealing, but these successful applications are rarely accompanied by formal proofs that the Markov chains underlying PIMC rapidly converge to the desired equilibrium distribution.
   In this work we analyze the mixing time of PIMC for 1D stoquastic Hamiltonians, including disordered transverse Ising models (TIM) with long-range algebraically decaying interactions as well as disordered XY spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. By bounding the convergence time to the equilibrium distribution we rigorously justify the use of PIMC to approximate partition functions and expectations of observables for these models at inverse temperatures that scale at most logarithmically with the number of qubits.
   The mixing time analysis is based on the canonical paths method applied to the single-site Metropolis Markov chain for the Gibbs distribution of 2D classical spin models with couplings related to the interactions in the quantum Hamiltonian. Since the system has strongly nonisotropic couplings that grow with system size, it does not fall into the known cases where 2D classical spin models are known to mix rapidly.

TI Locality and entanglement harvesting in covariantly bandlimited scalar
   fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Considerations of high energies in quantum field theories on smooth manifolds have led to generalized uncertainty principles and the possibility of a physical minimal length in quantum gravitational scenarios. In these models, the minimal length would be a physical limit, not just a mathematical tool, and should be Lorentz invariant. In this paper, we study two-qubit communication and entanglement harvesting in a field subject to a covariant bandlimit (minimum length) and present the changes induced by this bandlimit. We find the bandlimit introduces nonlocality and acausal communication in a manner unlike noncovariant bandlimits or other quantum optical approximations. We also observe that this covariant bandlimit introduces uncertainties in time and temporal ordering with the unusual behavior attributed to the behavior of virtual particles being modified by the covariant cutoff.

TI Quantum speed limits on operator flows and correlation functions
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum speed limits (QSLs) identify fundamental time scales of physical pro-cesses by providing lower bounds on the rate of change of a quantum state or the expectation value of an observable. We in-troduce a generalization of QSL for uni-tary operator flows, which are ubiquitous in physics and relevant for applications in both the quantum and classical domains. We derive two types of QSLs and assess the existence of a crossover between them, that we illustrate with a qubit and a ran-dom matrix Hamiltonian, as canonical ex-amples. We further apply our results to the time evolution of autocorrelation func-tions, obtaining computable constraints on the linear dynamical response of quan-tum systems out of equilibrium and the quantum Fisher information governing the precision in quantum parameter estima-tion.

TI Plasma-Induced 2D Electron Transport at Hetero-Phase Titanium Oxide
   Interface
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Interfaces of metal oxide heterojunctions display a variety of intriguing physical properties that enable novel applications in spintronics, quantum information, neuromorphic computing, and high-temperature superconductivity. One such LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) heterojunction hosts a 2D electron liquid (2DEL) presenting remarkable 2D superconductivity and magnetism. However, these remarkable properties emerge only at very low temperatures, while the heterostructure fabrication is challenging even at the laboratory scale, thus impeding practical applications. Here, a novel plasma-enabled fabrication concept is presented to develop the TiO2/Ti3O4 hetero-phase bilayer with a 2DEL that exhibits features of a weakly localized Fermi liquid even at room temperature. The hetero-phase bilayer is fabricated by applying a rapid plasma-induced phase transition that transforms a specific portion of anatase TiO2 thin film into vacancy-prone Ti3O4 in seconds. The underlying mechanism relies on the screening effect of the achieved high-density electron liquid that suppresses the electron-phonon interactions. The achieved "adiabatic" electron transport in the hetero-phase bilayer offers strong potential for low-loss electric or plasmonic circuits and hot electron harvesting and utilization. These findings open new horizons for fabricating diverse multifunctional metal oxide heterostructures as an innovative platform for emerging clean energy, integrated photonics, spintronics, and quantum information technologies.
   A new non-thermal plasma method is used to fabricate a TiO2/Ti3O4 hetero-phase bilayer in just seconds. The high-concentration electron gas at the heterointerface condenses into 2D electron liquid (2DEL) at room temperature. The 2DEL shields the scattering between electrons and phonons, allowing electrons to flow "adiabatically". These features are suitable for low-loss electronics or plasmonics and hot electron utilization.image

TI Quantum Optimization with Lagrangian Decomposition for Multiple-process
   Scheduling in Steel Manufacturing
SO ISIJ INTERNATIONAL
AB Steel manufacturing involves multiple processes, and optimizing the production schedule is essential for improving the quality, cost, and delivery of products. However, the corresponding optimization problems are usually NP-hard and generally intractable even for modern high-performance computers. Recent advances in quantum computers, such as those developed by D-Wave Systems, have opened new possibilities for handling this type of optimization problem. Nevertheless, a major obstacle to the application of currently available quantum computers is the relatively small number of quantum bits, which limits the feasible problem size. To overcome this obstacle, we propose an algorithm for solving optimization problems based on Lagrangian decomposition and coordination. D-Wave quantum computers can explore diverse solutions simultaneously, and we leverage this unique characteristic to obtain the upper bound for Lagrangian decomposition and coordination. We apply the proposed algorithm to a simplified problem of two-process production scheduling. By decomposing the problem into two stages for the processes, the number of steel products that can be handled increases from five to eight (60% increase). The optimal solutions are reached even for the extended case of the eight products. The proposed algorithm is a promising technique for enabling the application of quantum computers to real-world problems by thoroughly exploiting quantum bits.

TI The Case for a Defect Genome Initiative
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) has streamlined the materials discovery effort by leveraging generic traits of materials, with focus largely on perfect solids. Defects such as impurities and perturbations, however, drive many attractive functional properties of materials. The rich tapestry of charge, spin, and bonding states hosted by defects are not accessible to elements and perfect crystals, and defects can thus be viewed as another class of "elements" that lie beyond the periodic table. Accordingly, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) to accelerate functional defect discovery for energy, quantum information, and other applications is proposed. First, major advances made under the MGI are highlighted, followed by a delineation of pathways for accelerating the discovery and design of functional defects under the DGI. Near-term goals for the DGI are suggested. The construction of open defect platforms and design of data-driven functional defects, along with approaches for fabrication and characterization of defects, are discussed. The associated challenges and opportunities are considered and recent advances towards controlled introduction of functional defects at the atomic scale are reviewed. It is hoped this perspective will spur a community-wide interest in undertaking a DGI effort in recognition of the importance of defects in enabling unique functionalities in materials.
   Point defects in crystalline solids are likened to new "elements" beyond the periodic table. In the spirit of the Material Genome Initiative, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) is proposed to fast-track defect discoveries for energy, quantum, and other applications.

TI Activated Single Photon Emitters And Enhanced Deep-Level Emissions in
   Hexagonal Boron Nitride Strain Crystal
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The peculiar defect-related photon emission processes in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become a topic of intense research due to their potential applications in quantum information and sensing technologies. Here, it is reported on exotic single photons and enhanced deep-level emissions in 2D hBN strain crystal, which is fabricated by transferring multilayer hBN onto hexagonal close-packed silica spheres on a silica substrate. Effective activation of single photon emission is realized from the defect ensembles in the multilayer hBN at positions that are in contact with the apex of the SiO2 spheres. At these points, the local tensile strain-induced overall blue shift of the SPE ensembles is up to 12 nm. Furthermore, high spatial resolution cathodoluminescence measurements show remarkable strain-enhanced deep-level emissions in the multilayer hBN with the emission intensity distribution following the periodic hexagonal pattern of the strain crystal. The maximum deep-level emission enhancement is up to 350% with an energy redshift of 6 nm. These results provide a simple on-chip compatible method for activating and tuning the defect-related photon emissions in multilayer hBN, demonstrating the potential of hBN strain crystal as a building block for future on-chip quantum nanophotonic devices.
   The unique photon emissions from defects in 2D hexagonal boron nitride have garnered significant attention due to their potential in quantum information technologies. In this study, effective single photon emission, and intensified deep-level emissions within a strained 2D hBN crystal are successfully induced. Furthermore, the underlying physical mechanisms and the rules governing strain modulation are also well elucidated.image

TI The connected wedge theorem and its consequences
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In the AdS/CFT correspondence, bulk causal structure has consequences for boundary entanglement. In quantum information science, causal structures can be replaced by distributed entanglement for the purposes of information processing. In this work, we deepen the understanding of both of these statements, and their relationship, with a number of new results. Centrally, we present and prove a new theorem, the n-to-n connected wedge theorem, which considers n input and n output locations at the boundary of an asymptotically AdS(2+1) spacetime described by AdS/CFT. When a sufficiently strong set of causal connections exists among these points in the bulk, a set of n associated regions in the boundary will have extensive-in-N mutual information across any bipartition of the regions. The proof holds in three bulk dimensions for classical spacetimes satisfying the null curvature condition and for semiclassical spacetimes satisfying standard conjectures. The n-to-n connected wedge theorem gives a precise example of how causal connections in a bulk state can emerge from large-N entanglement features of its boundary dual. It also has consequences for quantum information theory: it reveals one pattern of entanglement which is sufficient for information processing in a particular class of causal networks. We argue this pattern is also necessary, and give an AdS/CFT inspired protocol for information processing in this setting.
   Our theorem generalizes the 2-to-2 connected wedge theorem proven in [3]. We also correct some errors in the proof presented there, in particular a false claim that existing proof techniques work above three bulk dimensions.

TI All-optical manipulation of two-way multi-channel based on optical
   nonreciprocity
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Owing to the potential applications in all-optical quantum information processing and quantum optical networks, magnet-free optical non-reciprocity transmission has attracted great interest and has been studied in many fields, such as parity-time-symmetry enhanced nonlinearity, optomechanical systems, photonic crystal, cold atomic Bragg lattices, chiral quantum optics, and hot atoms. In particular, the random thermal motion of hot atoms can be a useful resource to realize optical non-reciprocity. Here in this work, based on the susceptibility-momentum-locking of atomic thermal motion and the strong coupling characteristics of cavities, a magnetic-free optical reciprocity-nonreciprocity transmission conversion scheme is designed and realized through the atom-cavity compound system. Theoretical and experimental analysis show that the coupling field conditions determine the nonreciprocity of the system. Under the action of single traveling-wave field, the nonreciprocity in hot atoms depends on the propagation direction of the coupling field due to the Doppler effect. Therefore, by changing the opening and closing of the opposite coupling field, the two-way single channel optical nonreciprocal transmission based on intracavity electromagnetically induced transparency can be controlled. When the two coupling fields propagate simultaneously in the opposite directions, however, the cavity transmission changes from single-dark-state to double-dark-state peaks, in which the reciprocity outputs depend on the frequency difference between the two coupling fields. By tuning the frequency difference, the two-way multi-channel reciprocal-nonreciprocal transmission regulation based on double dark polar peaks can be realized. The study can be applied to all-optical quantum devices and quantum information processing, such as optical transistors, optical switching and routing, and quantum gate manipulation.

TI Ab initio ultrafast spin dynamics in solids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin relaxation and decoherence is at the heart of spintronics and spin-based quantum information science. Currently, theoretical approaches that can accurately predict spin relaxation of general solids including necessary scattering pathways and are capable of nanosecond to millisecond simulation time are urgently needed. We present a first-principles real-time density-matrix approach based on Lindblad dynamics to simulate ultrafast spin dynamics for general solid-state systems. Through the complete first-principles descriptions of pump, probe, and scattering processes including electron-phonon, electron-impurity, and electron-electron scatterings with self-consistent electronic spin-orbit couplings, our method can directly simulate the ultrafast pump-probe measurements for coupled spin and electron dynamics over nanoseconds at any temperatures and doping levels. We first apply this method to a prototypical system GaAs and obtain excellent agreement with experiments. We found that the relative contributions of different scattering mechanisms and phonon modes differ considerably between spin and carrier relaxation processes. In sharp contrast to previous work based on model Hamiltonians, we point out that the electron-electron scattering is negligible at room temperature but becomes dominant at low temperatures for spin relaxation in n-type GaAs. We further examine ultrafast dynamics in novel spin-valleytronic materials: monolayer and bilayer WSe2 with realistic defects. We find that spin relaxation is highly sensitive to local symmetry and chemical bonds around defects. For the bilayer WSe2, we identify the scattering pathways in ultrafast dynamics and determine relevant dynamical properties, essential to its utilization of unique spin-valley-layer locking effects. Our work provides a predictive computational platform for spin dynamics in solids, which has potential for designing new materials ideal for spintronics and quantum information technology.

TI Violation of Bell?s inequality with quantum-dot single-photon sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the possibility of realizing a loophole-free violation of Bell's inequality using deterministic single-photon sources. We provide a detailed analysis of a scheme to achieve such violations over long distances with immediate extensions to device-independent quantum key distribution. We investigate the effect of key experimental imperfections that are unavoidable in real-world single-photon sources including the finite degree of photon indistinguishability, single-photon purity, and the overall source efficiency. We benchmark the performance requirements to state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon sources based on quantum dots in photonic nanostructures and find that experimental realizations appear to be within reach. We also evaluate the requirements for a postselected version of the protocol, which relaxes the demanding requirements with respect to the source efficiency.

TI Single-photon scattering under control of artificial gauge field
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The mechanism of controlling single-photon scattering in a hybrid system consisting of superconducting qubits coupled to a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) topological photonic lattice is investigated under the influence of an artificial gauge field. This research is driven by the growing interest in the intersection between quantum optics and condensed matter physics, particularly in the field of topological quantum optics, where the robustness of photon transport against defects and impurities can be used for quantum information processing. To achieve this, a theoretical model, which incorporates the phase of the artificial gauge field into the coupling between superconducting qubits and the SSH photonic lattice, is developed in this work. The analytical expressions for the reflection and transmission amplitudes of single photons are derived by using the probability-amplitude method. The results show that the artificial gauge field can effectively control single photon scattering in both the upper energy band and the lower energy band of the SSH lattice, thereby enabling total transmission in the upper band and total reflection in the lower band. This band-dependent scattering behavior exhibits a high degree of symmetry with respect to the lattice momentum and energy bands. Importantly, the reflection coefficient can be made independent of the lattice coupling strength and dependent solely on the topological properties of the lattice. This finding suggests a robust method of detecting topological invariants in photonic lattices. Furthermore, our analysis is extended to various coupling configurations between superconducting qubits and the photonic lattice, highlighting the versatility of the artificial gauge field in manipulating photon transport. These findings not only provide new insights into the control of photon transport in topological photonic lattices, but also open the door to the development of novel quantum optical devices and robust quantum information processing platforms.

TI Adaptive projected variational quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an adaptive quantum algorithm to prepare accurate variational time evolved wave functions. The method is based on the projected variational quantum dynamics (pVQD) algorithm, that performs a global optimization with linear scaling in the number of variational parameters. Instead of fixing a variational ansatz at the beginning of the simulation, the circuit is grown systematically during the time evolution. Moreover, the adaptive step does not require auxiliary qubits and the gate search can be performed in parallel on different quantum devices. We apply the algorithm, named adaptive pVQD, to the simulation of driven spin models and fermionic systems, where it shows an advantage when compared to both Trotterized circuits and nonadaptive variational methods. Finally, we use the shallower circuits prepared using the adaptive pVQD algorithm to obtain more accurate measurements of physical properties of quantum systems on hardware.

TI Enhancing the operational efficiency of quantum random number generators
SO INFOCOMMUNICATIONS JOURNAL
AB Random numbers are of vital importance in today's world and used for example in many cryptographical protocols to secure the communication over the inter net The generators producing these numbers are Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs) or True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). A subclass of TRNGs are the Quantum based Random Number Generators (QRNGs) whose generation processes are based on quantum phenomena. However, the achievable quality, of the numbers generated from a practical implementation can differ from the theoretically possible. To ease this negative effect post-processing can be used, which contains the use of extractors. They extract as much entropy as possible from the original source and produce a new output with better properties. The quality and the different properties of a given output can be measured with the help of statistical tests. In our work we examined the effect of different extractors on two QRNG outputs and found that with the right extractor we can improve their quality.

TI Low-noise single-photon counting superconducting nanowire detectors at
   infrared wavelengths up to 29 μm
SO OPTICA
AB We report on the extension of the spectral sensitivity of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to a wavelength of 29 mu m. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a single-photon counting detector at these long infrared wavelengths. We achieve saturated internal detection efficiency from 10 to 29 mu m, while maintaining dark count rates below0.1 counts per second. Extension of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to this spectral range provides low-noise and high-timing-resolution photon counting detection, effectively providing a new class of single-photon sensitive detectors for these wavelengths. These detectors are important for applications such as exoplanet spectroscopy, infrared astrophysics, physical chemistry, remote sensing, and direct dark-matter detection.

TI Measurement analysis of coherence in femtosecond laser-induced molecular
   alignment
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Femtosecond laser-induced excitation of molecular rotational states can lead to phenomena such as alignment and orientation, which fundamentally stem from the coherence between the induced rotational states. In recent years, the quantitative study of coherence in the field of quantum information has received widespread attention. Different kinds of coherence measures have been proposed and investigated. In this work, the quantitative correlation is investigated in detail between the intrinsic coherence measurement and the degree of molecular alignment induced by femtosecond laser pulses at finite temperatures. By examining the molecular alignment induced by ultrafast non-resonant laser pulses, a quantitative relationship is established between the l1 norm coherence measure C-lf (p) and the alignment amplitude D < cos(2) theta > . Here, C-lf (p) represents the sum of the absolute values of all off-diagonal elements of the density matrix rho, D < cos(2) theta > represents the difference between the maximum alignment and the minimum alignment. A quadratic relationship C-l1 = (a + b epsilon(2)(0))xD < cos(2) theta > between the the l(1) norm coherence measure and D < cos(2) theta > with respect to the electric field intensity E0 is obtained. This relationship is validated through numerical simulations of the CO molecule, and the ratio coefficients a and b for different temperatures are obtained. Furthermore, a mapping relationship between this ratio and the pulse intensity area is established. The findings of this study provide an alternative method for experimentally detecting the coherence measure within femtosecond laser-excited rotational systems, thereby extending the potential applicability of molecular rotational states to the study of the coherence measure in the field of quantum resources. This will facilitate the interdisciplinary integration of ultrafast strong-field physics and quantum information.

TI Information theoretic measures on the two-photon transitions of hydrogen
   atom embedded in weakly coupled plasma environment
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The quantum information theoretic measures in terms of Shannon entropy and Fisher entropy (both in position and momentum spaces) on the ground, excited as well as virtual states arising out of the two-photon transitions (1s -> nl; n = 2 - 4, l = 0, 2) of H atom embedded in classical weakly coupled plasma environment are done for the first time. Fourth order time dependent perturbation theory is adopted within a variational framework for calculating the two photon excitation energies and their respective wavefunctions from an analysis of the pole positions of the non linear response of the system. The representation of virtual state follows from an analysis of the linear response at such poles using a novel method developed by us. Ground and perturbed state wave functions of appropriate symmetries are represented by linear combination of Slater-type orbitals. The analytic form of the momentum space wave functions of ground, excited and virtual states are determined by taking Fourier transformation of the respective position space wave functions. The quantum information measures give interesting insights on the delocalization patterns of the all the real and virtual states under question w.r.t. the increase in plasma strength. The estimated data values are found to be in excellent agreement with the few existing in literature for the ground as well as excited states participating in the two-photon transitions. Such data for the virtual states are completely new and can be set as benchmark for future works in related disciplines.

TI Annealing for prediction of grand canonical crystal structures:
   Implementation of n-body atomic interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose an annealing scheme usable on modern Ising machines for crystal structures prediction (CSP) by taking into account the general n -body atomic interactions and in particular three-body interactions which are necessary to simulate covalent bonds. The crystal structure is represented by discretizing a unit cell and placing binary variables which express the existence or nonexistence of an atom on every grid point. The resulting quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) or higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems implement the CSP problem and is solved using simulated and quantum annealing. Using the example of Lennard-Jones clusters we show that it is not necessary to include the target atom number in the formulation allowing for simultaneous optimization of both the particle density and the configuration and argue that this is advantageous for use on annealing machines as it reduces the total amount of interactions. We further provide a scheme that allows for reduction of higher-order interaction terms that is inspired by the underlying physics. We show for a covalently bonded monolayer MoS2 crystal that we can simultaneously optimize for the particle density as well as the crystal structure using simulated annealing. We also show that we reproduce ground states of the interatomic potential with high probability that are not represented on the initial discretization of the unit cell.

TI Enhanced QSimon Algorithm for Attacking the Offset Two-Round Scheme
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB QSimon algorithm (a full quantum version of Simon's algorithm) is used to find periods in commitment functions and does not require classical calculations. However, QSimon algorithm circuit is incomplete, and the implementation of an essential component (solving boolean linear equations) has high resource consumption. This work further studies QSimon algorithm and applies QSimon algorithm to attack the offset two-round (OTR) scheme. QSimon algorithm is established by quantum boolean linear equations solving algorithm and general quantum truncation technique, which can obtain the period of any truncated function with overwhelming probability. The confidentiality and integrity of the OTR scheme are compromised by employing QSimon algorithm. The attacks ensure a high success rate and realize exponential speedup compared with classical versions.

TI Distributed hybrid quantum-classical performance prediction for
   hyperparameter optimization
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of neural networks is a computationally expensive procedure, which requires a large number of different model configurations to be trained. To reduce such costs, this work presents a distributed, hybrid workflow, that runs the training of the neural networks on multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) on a classical supercomputer, while predicting the configurations' performance with quantum-trained support vector regression (QT-SVR) on a quantum annealer (QA). The workflow is shown to run on up to 50 GPUs and a QA at the same time, completely automating the communication between the classical and the quantum systems. The approach is evaluated extensively on several benchmarking datasets from the computer vision (CV), high-energy physics (HEP), and natural language processing (NLP) domains. Empirical results show that resource costs for performing HPO can be reduced by up to 9% when using the hybrid workflow with performance prediction, compared to using a plain HPO algorithm without performance prediction. Additionally, the workflow obtains similar and in some cases even better accuracy of the final hyperparameter configuration, when combining multiple heuristically obtained predictions from the QA, compared to using just a single classically obtained prediction. The results highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms. The workflow code is made available open-source to foster adoption in the community.

Using the delayed self-heterodyne method, the experimentally measured linewidth was 45 kHz. The laser has an on-chip optical output power of 18 mW around 1550 nm at an injection current of 95 mA. The laser operates in a single-mode regime with a side-mode suppression ratio of 54 dB.

AB Using density functional theory in the noncollinear approximation, the behavior of quantum states of hole qubits in a Ge/Co:ZnO system was studied in this work. A detailed analysis of the electronic structure and the distribution of total charge density and hole states was carried out. It was shown that in the presence of holes, the energetically more favorable quantum state is the state |0>, in contrast to the state |1> when there is no hole in the system. The favorability of hole states was found to be dependent on the polarity of the applied electric field.

TI Symmetry operators of the asymmetric two-photon quantum Rabi model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The true level crossings in a subspace of the asymmetric two-photon quantum Rabi model (tpQRM) have been observed when the bias parameter of qubit is an even multiple of the renormalized cavity frequency. Generally, such level crossings imply the existence of the hidden symmetry because the bias term breaks the obvious symmetry exactly. In this work, we propose a Bogoliubov operator approach for the asymmetric tpQRM to derive the symmetry operators associated with the hidden symmetry hierarchically. The explicit symmetry operators consisting of Lie algebra at low biases can be easily obtained in our general scheme. We believe the present approach can be extended for other asymmetric Rabi models to find the relevant hidden symmetry.

TI Simulating Chemistry on Bosonic Quantum Devices
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Bosonic quantum devices offer a novel approach to realize quantum computations, where the quantum two-level system (qubit) is replaced with the quantum (an)harmonic oscillator (qumode) as the fundamental building block of the quantum simulator. The simulation of chemical structure and dynamics can then be achieved by representing or mapping the system Hamiltonians in terms of bosonic operators. In this Perspective, we review recent progress and future potential of using bosonic quantum devices for addressing a wide range of challenging chemical problems, including the calculation of molecular vibronic spectra, the simulation of gas-phase and solution-phase adiabatic and nonadiabatic chemical dynamics, the efficient solution of molecular graph theory problems, and the calculations of electronic structure.

TI Less entanglement exhibiting more nonlocality with noisy measurements
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality test is widely used as a mean of invalidating the local deterministic theories. Most attempts to experimentally test nonlocality have presumed unphysical idealizations that do not hold in real experiments, namely, noiseless measurements. We demonstrate an experimental violation of the CHSH inequality that is free of idealization and rules out local models with high confidence. We show that the CHSH inequality can always be violated for any nonzero noise parameter of the measurement. Intriguingly, less entanglement exhibits more nonlocality in the CHSH test with noisy measurements. Furthermore, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate how the CHSH test with noisy measurements can be used to detect weak entanglement on two-qubit states. Our results offer a deeper insight into the relation between entanglement and nonlocality.

TI Quantum State Learning via Single-Shot Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A novel machine-learning algorithm based on single-shot measurements, named single-shot measurement learning, is demonstrated achieving the theoretical optimal accuracy. The method is at least as efficient as existing tomographic schemes and computationally much less demanding. The merits are attributed to the inclusion of weighted randomness in the learning rule governing the exploration of diverse learning routes. These advantages are explored experimentally by a linear-optical setup that is designed to draw the fullest potential of the proposed method. The experimental results show an unprecedented high level of accuracy for qubit-state learning and reproduction exhibiting (nearly) optimal infidelity scaling, O(N-0.983), for the number N of unknown state copies, down to < 10(-5) without any compensation for experimental nonidealities. Extension to high dimensions is discussed with simulation results.

TI Quantum 2-Player Games and Realizations with Circuits
SO RESEARCH
AB Game theory problems are widely applied in many research areas such as computer science and finance, with the key issue being how to quickly make decisions. Here, we present a novel quantum algorithm for game theory problems based on a continuous quantum walk. Our algorithm exhibits quantum advantage compared to classical game algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the analogy between the wave function of the Schr & ouml;dinger equation and the voltage in Kirchhoff's law to effectively translate the design of quantum game trees into classical circuit networks. We have theoretically simulated the quantum game trees and experimentally validated the quantum functionality speedup on classical circuit networks. Due to the robust scalability and stability inherent in classical circuit networks, quantum game trees implemented within this framework hold promise for addressing more intricate application scenarios.

TI Combinatorial optimization through variational quantum power method
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The power method (or iteration) is a well-known classical technique that can be used to find the dominant eigenpair of a matrix. Here, we present a variational quantum circuit method for the power iteration, which can be used to find the eigenpairs of unitary matrices and so their associated Hamiltonians. We discuss how to apply the circuit to combinatorial optimization problems formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization and discuss its complexity. In addition, we run numerical simulations for random problem instances with up to 21 parameters and observe that the method can generate solutions to the optimization problems with only a few number of iterations and the growth in the number of iterations is polynomial in the number of parameters. Therefore, the circuit can be simulated on the near-term quantum computers with ease.

TI Magnetic phases of spatially modulated spin-1 chains in Rydberg
   excitons: Classical and quantum simulations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In this work, we study the magnetic phases of a spatially modulated chain of spin-1 Rydberg excitons. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique, we study various magnetic and topologically nontrivial phases using both single-particle properties, such as local magnetization and quantum entropy, and many-body ones, such as pair-wise Neel and long-range string correlations. In particular, we investigate the emergence and robustness of the Haldane phase, a topological phase of anti-ferromagnetic spin-1 chains. Furthermore, we devise a hybrid quantum algorithm employing restricted Boltzmann machine to simulate the ground state of such a system that shows very good agreement with the results of exact diagonalization and DMRG.

TI Dynamic portfolio optimization with real datasets using quantum
   processors and quantum-inspired tensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper we tackle the problem of dynamic portfolio optimization, i.e., determining the optimal trading trajectory for an investment portfolio of assets over a period of time, taking into account transaction costs and other possible constraints. This problem is central to quantitative finance. After a detailed introduction to the problem, we implement a number of quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms on different hardware platforms to solve its discrete formulation using real data from daily prices over 8 years of 52 assets, and do a detailed comparison of the obtained Sharpe ratios, profits, and computing times. In particular, we implement classical solvers (Gekko, exhaustive), D-wave hybrid quantum annealing, two different approaches based on variational quantum eigensolvers on IBM-Q (one of them brand-new and tailored to the problem), and for the first time in this context also a quantum-inspired optimizer based on tensor networks. In order to fit the data into each specific hardware platform, we also consider doing a preprocessing based on clustering of assets. From our comparison, we conclude that D-wave hybrid and tensor networks are able to handle the largest systems, where we do calculations up to 1272 fully-connected qubits for demonstrative purposes. Finally, we also discuss how to mathematically implement other possible real-life constraints, as well as several ideas to further improve the performance of the studied methods.

TI Computational overhead of locality reduction in binary optimization
   problems
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently, there has been considerable interest in solving optimization problems by mapping these onto a binary representation, sparked mostly by the use of quantum annealing machines. Such binary representation is reminiscent of a discrete physical two-state system, such as the Ising model. As such, physics-inspired techniques-commonly used in fundamental physics studies-are ideally suited to solve optimization problems in a binary format. While binary representations can be often found for paradigmatic optimization problems, these typically result in k-local higher-order unconstrained binary optimization cost functions. In this work, we discuss the effects of locality reduction needed for the majority of the currently available quantum and quantum-inspired solvers that can only accommodate 2-local (quadratic) cost functions. General locality reduction approaches require the introduction of ancillary variables which cause an overhead over the native problem. Using a parallel tempering Monte Carlo solver on Microsoft Azure Quantum, as well as k-local binary problems with planted solutions, we show that post reduction to a corresponding 2-local representation the problems become considerably harder to solve. We further quantify the increase in computational hardness introduced by the reduction algorithm by measuring the variation of number of variables, statistics of the coefficient values, and the population annealing entropic family size. Our results demonstrate the importance of avoiding locality reduction when solving optimization problems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterizing cryogenic amplifiers with a matched temperature-variable
   noise source
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We present a cryogenic microwave noise source with a characteristic impedance of 50 Omega, which can be installed in a coaxial line of a cryostat. The bath temperature of the noise source is continuously variable between 0.1 K and 5 K without causing significant back-action heating on the sample space. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we perform Y-factor measurements of an amplifier cascade that includes a traveling wave parametric amplifier and a commercial high electron mobility transistor amplifier. We observe system noise temperatures as low as 680-200+20 mK at 5.7 GHz corresponding to 1.5-0.7+0.1 excess photons. The system we present has immediate applications in the validation of solid-state qubit readout lines.

TI Gravitational decoherence of photons
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Models of gravitational decoherence are not commonly applied to ultra-relativistic systems, including photons. As a result, few quantum optical tests of gravitational decoherence have been developed. In this paper, we generalize the gravitational decoherence model of Anastopoulos and Hu (2013 Class. Quantum Grav. 30 165007) to photons. In this model, decoherence originates from a bath of stochastic gravitational perturbations, possibly of fundamental origin. We derive a master equation for general states of the electromagnetic field; the only free parameter is a noise temperature Theta of the gravitational fluctuations. We find that interference experiments with long baselines, accessible in near-future experiments, can, in principle, lead to strong constraints in Theta.

TI Multiplexed Sensing of Magnetic Field and Temperature in Real Time Using
   a Nitrogen-Vacancy Ensemble in Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) defect in diamond is a versatile quantum sensor, being able to measure physical quantities such as magnetic field, electric field, temperature, and pressure. In the present work, we demonstrate multiplexed sensing of magnetic field and temperature using a N-V ensemble in diamond. The dual-frequency-driving technique we employ is based on frequency-division multiplexing, which enables the sensing of both measurables in real time. The pair of N-V resonance frequencies for dual-frequency driving must be selected to avoid coherent population trapping of N-V spin states. With enhanced optical collection efficiency higher than 50% and a type 1b diamond crystal with a natural abundance of 13C spins, we achieve sensitivities of about 70 pT/A/Hz and 25 mu K/A/Hz simultaneously. We demonstrate a high isolation factor of 34 dB in the N-V thermometry signal against the magnetic field; and we provide a theoretical description for the isolation factor. This work paves the way for extending the application of N-V diamond sensors into more demanding conditions.

TI Reachable-set characterization of an open quantum system by the quantum
   speed limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In recent years, the idea of reachable-set characterization based on the quantum speed limit (QSL) was proposed by Arenz et al. [New J. Phys. 19, 103015 (2017)]; that is, the reachable set of the target unitary gate in a closed qubit system can be characterized by considering the QSL as the necessary condition that the control setup must satisfy in order to achieve the goal. Inspired by this idea, in this paper we characterize a general Markovian open quantum system based on the QSL derived by Kobayashi and Yamamoto [Phys. Rev. A 102, 042606 (2020)]. Note that this bound is not only explicitly computable with respect to system parameters but also tighter than the other bounds. Some examples for demonstrating this analysis will be given.

TI Hidden symmetry and tunneling dynamics in asymmetric quantum Rabi models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM) has a broken Z(2) symmetry, with generally a nondegenerate eigenvalue spectrum. In some special cases where the asymmetric parameter is a multiple of the cavity frequency, stable level crossings typical of the Z(2)-symmetric quantum Rabi model are recovered, however, without any obvious paritylike symmetry. This unknown "symmetry" has thus been referred to as hidden symmetry in the literature. Here, we show that this hidden symmetry is not limited to the AQRM, but exists in various related light-matter interaction models with an asymmetric qubit bias term. Conditions under which the hidden symmetry exists in these models are determined and discussed. By investigating tunneling dynamics in the displaced oscillator basis, a strong connection is found between the hidden symmetry and selective tunneling.

TI Theory of homotopes with applications to mutually unbiased bases,
   harmonic analysis on graphs, and perverse sheaves
SO RUSSIAN MATHEMATICAL SURVEYS
AB This paper is a survey of contemporary results and applications of the theory of homotopes. The notion of a well-tempered element of an associative algebra is introduced, and it is proved that the category of representations of the homotope constructed by a well-tempered element is the heart of a suitably glued t-structure. The Hochschild and global dimensions of homotopes are calculated in the case of well-tempered elements. The homotopes constructed from generalized Laplace operators in Poincare groupoids of graphs are studied. It is shown that they are quotients of Temperley-Lieb algebras of general graphs. The perverse sheaves on a punctured disc and on a 2-dimensional sphere with a double point are identified with representations of suitable homotopes. Relations of the theory to orthogonal decompositions of the Lie algebras sl(n, C) into a sum of Cartan subalgebras, to classifications of configurations of lines, to mutually unbiased bases, to quantum protocols, and to generalized Hadamard matrices are discussed.

TI Data needs and challenges for quantum dot devices automation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Gate-defined quantum dots are a promising candidate system for realizing scalable, coupled qubit systems and serving as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. However, present-day quantum dot devices suffer from imperfections that must be accounted for, which hinders the characterization, tuning, and operation process. Moreover, with an increasing number of quantum dot qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control infeasible. Thus, it is imperative that reliable and scalable autonomous tuning approaches are developed. This meeting report outlines current challenges in automating quantum dot device tuning and operation with a particular focus on datasets, benchmarking, and standardization. We also present insights and ideas put forward by the quantum dot community on how to overcome them. We aim to provide guidance and inspiration to researchers invested in automation efforts.

TI Ultrananocrystalline Diamond Nanowires: Fabrication, Characterization,
   and Sensor Applications
SO MATERIALS
AB The aim of this review is to provide a survey of the recent advances and the main remaining challenges related to the ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) nanowires and other nanostructures which exhibit excellent capability as the core components for many diverse novel sensing devices, due to the unique material properties and geometry advantages. The boron or nitrogen doping introduced in the gas phase during deposition promotes p-type or n-type conductivity. With the establishment of the UNCD nanofabrication techniques, more and more nanostructure-based devices are being explored in measuring basic physical and chemical parameters via classic and quantum methods, as exemplified by gas sensors, ultraviolet photodetectors, piezoresistance effect-based devices, biological applications and biosensors, and nitrogen-vacancy color center-based magnetic field quantum sensors. Highlighted finally are some of the remaining challenges and the future outlook in this area.

TI Harnessing triaryloxonium ions for aryne generation
SO NATURE SYNTHESIS
AB Arynes are highly reactive and versatile intermediates for the functionalization of aromatic rings that are often generated using strong bases or fluoride sources, which, in some cases, can limit functional group tolerance. Here we demonstrate that triaryloxonium ions can be transformed into arynes through treatment with solid potassium phosphate at room temperature. A substantial range of functional group-bearing arynes, including 4,5-pyrimidynes, may be generated and trapped using cycloaddition reactions with high yields. Other arynophiles including nitrones, alkenes and azides are compatible with these conditions. Quantum computation in conjunction with an intramolecular kinetic isotope study is consistent with an elimination, unimolecular, conjugate base-like mechanism of elimination to form the aryne. These investigations demonstrate that the oxonium ion is a powerful electron-withdrawing group and a particularly effective leaving group. We anticipate that this study will stimulate further investigations into the synthetic utility of aryl oxonium ions.

TI Implementing a fast unbounded quantum fanout gate using power-law
   interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The standard circuit model for quantum computation presumes the ability to directly perform gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits, which is unlikely to be practical for large-scale experiments. Power-law interactions with strength decaying as 1/r alpha in the distance r provide an experimentally realizable resource for information processing, whilst still retaining long-range connectivity. We leverage the power of these interactions to imple-ment a fast quantum fanout gate with an arbitrary number of targets. Our implementation allows the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor's algorithm to be performed on a D-dimensional lattice of qubits in time that scales (poly)logarithmically in the number of qubits, using interactions with alpha 2D. As a corollary, we show that power-law systems with alpha 2D are difficult to simulate classically even for short times, under a standard assumption that factoring is classically intractable. Complementarily, we develop a technique to give a general lower bound-linear in the size of the system-on the time required to implement the QFT and the fanout gate in systems that are constrained by a linear light cone. This allows us to prove an asymptotically tighter lower bound for long-range systems than was possible with previously available techniques.

TI Isotropic antenna based on Rydberg atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Governed by the hairy ball theorem, classical antennas with isotropic responses to linearly polarized radio waves are unrealizable. Also, their calibrations face a causal dilemma. Therefore, radio wave measurements based on classical antennas are challenging to achieve high accuracy. This work shows that the antenna based on Rydberg atoms can theoretically achieve an ideal isotropic response to linearly polarized radio waves; that is, it has zero isotropic deviation. Although this conclusion is straightforward, it is not theoretically clear when complex atomic energy levels are taken into account. Experimental results of isotropic deviation within 5 dB and 0.3 dB possible with optimization in microwave and terahertz wave measurements support the theory and is at least 15 dB improvement than the classical omnidirectional antenna. Combined with the SI traceable and ultrawideband property, the ideal isotropic response will make radio wave measurement based on atomic antenna much more accurate and reliable than the traditional method. This isotropic atomic antenna is an excellent example of what a tailored quantum sensor can realize, but a classical sensor cannot. It has crucial applications in fields such as radio wave electrometry.

TI Wave-particle complementarity: detecting violation of local realism with
   photon-number resolving weak-field homodyne measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Nowadays photon-number resolving weak-field homodyne measurements allow realization of emblematic gedankenexperiments revealing correlations of optical fields. This covers experiments on (a) excitation of a pair of spatial modes by a single photon, and (b) two spatial modes in a weakly squeezed vacuum state, involving constant local oscillator strengths. Proving Bell nonclassicality of such correlations demands measurements of complementary observables. We show that typical arrangement of weak-field homodyne detection with measurement settings defined by phases of local oscillators of constant strength does not provide enough complementarity for confirming Bell nonclassicality. In the case of experiment (a) we provide an exact local hidden variable model restoring all quantum probabilities, whereas in the case of experiment (b) we show that the claims of its nonclassicality are unfounded. A full complementarity of wave aspects vs particle (number) can be achieved in a measurement situation in which respectively the local oscillators are on or off. This is shown to lead to an operational scenario, in the case of both experiments (a) and (b), which reveals indisputable violations of local realism. Such schemes may find possible applications in device-independent quantum protocols.

TI Quantum mechanisms for selective detection in complex gas mixtures using
   conductive sensors
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we consider new quantum mechanisms for selective detection in complex gaseous media which provide the highest possible efficiency of quantum sensors and for the first time analyze their nature. On the basis of these quantum mechanisms, the concepts of quantum detection and innovative methods of analysis are developed, which are virtually impossible to implement in the conventional conductive sensors and nanosensors. Examples of original solutions to problems in the field of detection and analysis of human breath using point-contact sensors are considered. A new method of analysis based on detection of metastable quantum states of the "point-contact sensor-breath" system in dynamic mode is proposed. The conductance histogram of dendritic Yanson point contacts recorded for this system is a unique energy signature of breath which allows differentiation between the states of human body. We demonstrate that nanosized Yanson point contacts, which, thanks to their quantum properties, can replace a massive spectrometer, open up wide opportunities for solving complex problems in the field of breath analysis using a new generation of portable high-tech quantum sensor devices.

TI Imaging electromagnetic boundary of microdevice using a wide field
   quantum microscope
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Imaging of electronic device surface or sub -surface electromagnetic fields under operating conditions is important for device design and diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a method to characterize specific magnetic field properties of electromagnetic devices at micronscale using a solid-state quantum sensor, namely diamond nitrogen -vacancy (NV) centers. By employing a wide -field magnetic field measurement technique based on NV centers, we rapidly obtain the first -order magnetic field distribution of anomalous regions. Furthermore, we approximate the second -order magnetic field (magnetic gradient tensor) using the differential gradient method. To visualize the electromagnetic anomalous regions boundary, we utilize the tensor invariants of the magnetic gradient tensor components, along with their nonlinear combinations. The identification error rate of the anomalous regions is within 12.5%. Additionally, the electromagnetic field of anomalous regions is simulated showing the measurement accuracy. Our study shows that the experimental results are very similar to the theoretical simulation of the electromagnetic field (error: 7%). This work is essential for advancing electromagnetic field characterization of electronic devices and the advancement of quantum magnetic sensor applications.

TI Effects of nonstandard interaction on temporal and spatial correlations
   in neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Effects of physics beyond the standard model in the neutrino sector are conveniently incorporated through non-standard interaction parameters. Assuming new physics in the form of dimension-6 vector operators, a recent global analysis of neutrino oscillation data including results from COHERENT experiment suggests two favourable new physics scenarios. These are LMA-Light (with normal mass ordering) and LMA-Dark (with inverted mass ordering) sectors of parameters. In this work, we study the effects of new physics solutions on Leggett-Garg-type (LGtI) inequality which quantifies temporal correlations in the system along with flavour entropy and genuine tripartite entanglement which can be considered as measures of spatial correlations. We show that the violation of LGtI for nu mu energy around 3 GeV in the DUNE experimental set-up can not only be an indication of presence of new physics but such a new physics is expected to be in the form of LMA-Dark sector with inverted ordering. Further, we show that the LMA-Light solution, in general, decreases the values of all measures of quantum correlations in comparison to their SM predictions. On the other hand, the Dark solution can significantly enhance the values of these measures.

TI Optimal control for quantum detectors
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum systems are promising candidates for sensing of weak signals as they can be highly sensitive to external perturbations, thus providing excellent performance when estimating parameters of external fields. However, when trying to detect weak signals that are hidden by background noise, the signal-to-noise ratio is a more relevant metric than raw sensitivity. We identify, under modest assumptions about the statistical properties of the signal and noise, the optimal quantum control to detect an external signal in the presence of background noise using a quantum sensor. Interestingly, for white background noise, the optimal solution is the simple and well-known spin-locking control scheme. Using numerical techniques, we further generalize these results to the case of background noise with a Lorentzian spectrum. We show that for increasing correlation time, pulse based sequences, such as CPMG, are also close to the optimal control for detecting the signal, with the crossover dependent on the signal frequency. These results show that an optimal detection scheme can be easily implemented in near-term quantum sensors without the need for complicated pulse shaping.

TI Wideband and low-spurious optical waveform generator for optically
   addressable quantum systems manipulation and control
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical manipulation of quantum systems requires stable laser sources able to produce complex waveforms over a large frequency range. In the visible region, such waveforms can be generated using an acousto-optic modulator driven by an arbitrary waveform generator, but these suffer from a limited tuning range typically of a few tens of MHz. Visible -range electro-optic modulators are an alternative option offering a larger modulation bandwidth, however they have limited output power which drastically restricts the scalability of quantum applications. There is currently no architecture able to perform phase -stabilized waveforms over several GHz in the visible or near infrared region while providing sufficient optical power for quantum applications. Here we propose and develop a modulation and frequency conversion set-up able to deliver optical waveforms over a large frequency range, with a high spurious extinction ratio, scalable to the entire visible/near infrared region with high optical power. The optical waveforms are first generated at telecom wavelength and then converted to the emitter wavelength through a sum frequency generation process. By adapting the pump laser frequency, the optical waveforms can be tuned to interact with a broad range of optical quantum emitters or qubits such as alkali atoms, trapped ions, rare earth ions, or fluorescent defects in solid-state matrices. Using this architecture, we were able to detect and study a single erbium ion in a nanoparticle. We also generated high bandwidth signals at 606 nm, which would enable frequency multiplexing of on -demand read-out Pr 3 + :Y 2 SiO 5 quantum memories.

TI Highly Sensitive Magnetometer with Continuous Excitation Ramsey Protocol
   by Utilizing Long Dephasing Time of Millimeter-Scale Spin Ensembles in
   (111) Diamond
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB We developed a highly sensitive magnetometer with continuous excitation (CE) Ramsey protocol for (111) diamonds. The distinctive feature of the magnetometer is the magnet array and antenna design to realize a uniform bias field and efficient application of quantum manipulation techniques of spin bath driving and double quantum Ramsey in millimeter-scale spin ensembles directed to the surface normal. CE- and pulsed-Ramsey show dephasing times of 16.4$16.4$ and 20.5 mu s$20.5\ \mu {\mathrm{s}}$, respectively, with an excitation power of 160 mW. Analysis of the compositions of dephasing factors unveils the dephasing channels limiting the dephasing time. Thanks to the long dephasing time, a sensitivity of 15.8pT/Hz$15.8\ {\mathrm{pT}}/\sqrt {{\mathrm{Hz}}} $ is achieved in CE-Ramsey. Furthermore, the comparison of sensitivity between CE- and pulsed-Ramsey indicated that the noise induced by laser pulsing exists. This work paves the way for realizing ultra-high sensitivity magnetometers with simple implementation.

TI Single-shot characterization of vector beams by generalized measurements
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Vector vortex beams, featuring independent spatial modes in orthogonal polarization components, offer an increase in information density for emerging applications in both classical and quantum communication technology. Recent advances in optical instrumentation have led to the ability of generating and manipulating such beams. Their tomography is generally accomplished by projection measurements to identify polarization as well as spatial modes. In this paper we demonstrate spatially resolved generalized measurements of arbitrary vector vortex beams. We perform positive operator valued measurements (POVMs) in an interferometric setup that characterizes the vector light mode in a single-shot. This offers superior data acquisition speed compared to conventional Stokes tomography techniques, with potential benefits for communication protocols as well as dynamic polarization microscopy of materials.

TI Bulk-boundary correspondence from hyperinvariant tensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We introduce a tensor network designed to faithfully simulate the AdS/CFT correspondence, akin to the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), following hyperinvariant tensor network. The proposed construction integrates bulk indices within the network architecture to uphold the key features of the HAPPY code, including complementary recovery. This framework accurately reproduces the boundary conformal field theory's (CFT) two- and three-point correlation functions, while considering the image of any bulk operator. Furthermore, we provide an explicit methodology for calculating the correlation functions in an efficient manner. Our findings highlight the physical aspects of the relation between bulk and boundary within the tensor network models, contributing to the understanding and simulation of holographic principles in quantum information.

TI Quantum photon pair generation in hollow-core photonic crystal fibers: a
   simulation-based study
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of entangled photon pair generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HC-PCFs). By analyzing various fiber geometries, dispersion profiles, and anti-resonant characteristics, we identify optimal configurations that enhance photon-pair generation efficiency. Our study highlights the crucial roles of group velocity dispersion engineering, pump parameters, and phase-matching conditions in shaping the joint spectral amplitude (JSA) of the emitted photons. Utilizing gas-filled or evacuated HC-PCFs significantly reduces Raman noise by minimizing field overlap with the glass, while maintaining strong nonlinear interactions. The results reveal practical regimes for improving spectral purity and heralding efficiency. These findings provide practical design guidelines for scalable, low-noise quantum light sources suitable for quantum communication technologies. We bridge fiber design and nonlinear optics to create a predictive model and practical design charts for application-specific quantum light sources.

TI Coherent equalization of linear quantum systems
SO AUTOMATICA
AB This paper introduces a H infinity -like methodology of coherent filtering for equalization of passive linear quantum systems to help mitigate degrading effects of quantum communication channels. For such systems, which include a wide range of linear quantum optical devices and signals, we seek to find a near optimal equalizing filter which is itself a passive quantum system. The problem amounts to solving an optimization problem subject to constraints dictated by the requirement for the equalizer to be physically realizable. By formulating these constraints in the frequency domain, we show that the problem admits a convex H infinity -like formulation. This allows us to derive a set of suboptimal coherent equalizers using J -spectral factorization. An additional semidefinite relaxation combined with the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation is shown to lead to a tractable algorithm for the design of a near optimal coherent equalizer.

TI Polychromatic and collimated lights generated by nondegenerate four-wave
   mixing in cesium vapor
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate the generation of polychromatic and collimated lights at 456 nm, 459 nm, and 761 nm based on cesium (133Cs) 6S1/2 - 6P3/2 - 8S1/2 - 7P3/2, 7P1/2, 6P1/2 - 6S1/2 multi-diamond-type atomic system via two-photon excitation with two IR pump lasers at 852 nm and 795 nm. The 456 nm, 459 nm (7P3/2, 7P1/2 -, 6S1/2) collimated blue lights result from the self-seeded four-wave mixing process (FWM), and the 761 nm coherent light (8S1/2 -, 6P1/2) is from a seeded FWM process with the injection of a third laser at 895 nm. We measure the dependency of generated polychromatic fields on the temperature of 133Cs vapor cell and the powers of input lasers, clearly demonstrating the competition between the self-seeded FWM and seeded FWM, as they share the same excitation path. This work is helpful to further produce entangled multi-color photons for quantum communication.

TI Site-controlled telecom-wavelength single-photon emitters in
   atomically-thin MoTe2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) have advanced to the forefront of quantum communication and transduction research. To date, QEs capable of operating in O-C telecommunication bands have not been demonstrated in TMDCs. Here we report site-controlled creation of telecom QEs emitting over the 1080 to 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength range via coupling of 2D molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) to strain inducing nano-pillar arrays. Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiments conducted at 10 K reveal clear photon antibunching with 90% single-photon purity. The photon antibunching can be observed up to liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). Polarization analysis further reveals that while some QEs display cross-linearly polarized doublets with similar to 1 meV splitting resulting from the strain induced anisotropic exchange interaction, valley degeneracy is preserved in other QEs. Valley Zeeman splitting as well as restoring of valley symmetry in cross-polarized doublets are observed under 8 T magnetic field.

TI Two-dimensional and absolutely entanglement-breaking subspaces
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Entanglement-breaking (EB) subspaces determine the additivity of entanglement of formation (EOF), which is a long-standing issue in quantum information. We explicitly construct the two-dimensional EB subspaces of any bipartite system, when system dimensions are equal, and we apply the subspaces to construct EB spaces of arbitrary dimensions. We also present partial construction when system dimensions are different. Then, we present the notion and properties of EB subspaces for some systems, and in particular the absolute EB subspaces. We construct some examples of absolute EB subspaces, as well as EB subspaces for some systems by using multiqubit Dicke states.

TI Random access test as an identifier of nonclassicality*
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Random access codes (RACs) are an intriguing class of communication tasks that reveal an operational and quantitative difference between classical and quantum information processing. We formulate a natural generalization of RACs and call them random access tests (RATs), defined for any finite collection of measurements in an arbitrary finite dimensional general probabilistic theory. These tests can be used to examine collective properties of collections of measurements. We show that the violation of a classical bound in a RAT is a signature of either measurement incompatibility or super information storability. The polygon theories are exhaustively analysed and a critical difference between even and odd polygon theories is revealed.

TI Generation of X-ray photon echo mediated by collective nuclear
   excitation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photon echo is a fundamental phenomenon that enables the coherent re-emission of a photon after a controlled delay, playing a crucial role in quantum information processing. Here, we propose a scheme for generating X-ray photon echoes via the dynamical control of collective nuclear excitation using an applied magnetic field. This mechanism facilitates the controllable exchange of nuclear coherence and the photonic field, enabling the on-demand generation of individual X-ray photons. Our scheme broadens the possibilities for realizing quantum qubits in the X-ray regime and advancing X-ray quantum optics.

TI Strong coupling of excitons in monolayer WS2 with guided-mode resonance
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Strong photon-exciton coupling has garnered considerable interest due to its potential applications in quantum information processing, quantum light sources, and even quantum metrology. Here, we designed an "open cavity" consisting of monolayer WS2 and a square perforated SiN structure. By taking advantage of the guided-mode resonance with high quality factor excited in perforated SiN structure, the strong photon-exciton coupling with the Rabi splitting energies of about 40 meV can be obtained. Furthermore, the Rabi splitting can be engineered by varying the hole filling factor. Our findings provide a new way to achieve the TMD-based light-matter strong coupling.

TI Entanglement preparation and nonreciprocal excitation evolution in giant
   atoms by controllable dissipation and coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the dynamics of a giant atom (or atoms) in a waveguide QED scenario, where the atom couples to the coupled resonator waveguide via two sites. For a single-giant-atom setup, we find that the atomic dissipation rate can be adjusted by tuning its size. For the two-giant-atom system, the waveguide will induce the controllable individual and collective dissipation as well as effective interatom coupling. As a result, we can realize theoretically the robust entangled state preparation and nonreciprocal excitation evolution. We hope our study can be applied in quantum information processing based on a photonic and acoustic waveguide setup.

TI Observation of quantum temporal correlations well beyond Lüders bound
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ability of achieving strong quantum spatial correlations has helped the emergence of quantum information science. In contrast, how to achieve strong quantum temporal correlations (QTCs) has remained as a longstanding challenge, thus hindering their applications in time-domain quantum control. Here we experimentally demonstrate that by using a parity-time (PT)-symmetric single ion, the conventional QTC limit known as the L & uuml;ders bound can be well surpassed within a standard measurement scenario, approaching the predicted maximum QTC value. Our work, as a step toward quantum engineering of PT devices in the time domain, can stimulate more efforts on operating various quantum devices with the aid of strong QTC resources.

TI Phononic metagrating for lattice wave manipulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The control of the phonon-wave behavior is of prominent interest for applications in thermal management and the processing of quantum information. In this work, we design and characterize a phonon-based grating nanostructure in a suspended single-layer graphene. The anomalous transmission of lattice waves and the controllable angle of the transmitted wave can be achieved via a skillful design of the underlying nanostructure and the mode conversion can be monitored in situ. An interesting nonlocal effect emerges due to the inherently strong covalent bondings. These features distinctly differ from former scenarios with acoustic waves. This work paves the way for the regulation of phonon transport by designing phonon-based metagrating structures.

TI No Intrinsic Decoherence of Inflationary Cosmological Perturbations
SO UNIVERSE
AB After a brief summary of the four main veins in the treatment of decoherence and quantum to classical transition in cosmology since the 1980s, we focus on one of these veins in the study of quantum decoherence of cosmological perturbations in inflationary universe, the case when it does not rely on any environment. This is what 'intrinsic' in the title refers to-a closed quantum system, consisting of a quantum field which drives inflation. The question is whether its quantum perturbations, which interact with the density contrast giving rise to structures in the universe, decohere with an inflationary expansion of the universe. A dominant view which had propagated for a quarter of a century asserts yes, based on the belief that the large squeezing of a quantum state after a duration of inflation renders the system effectively classical. This paper debunks this view by identifying the technical fault-lines in its derivations and revealing the pitfalls in its arguments which drew earlier authors to this wrong conclusion. We use a few simple quantum mechanical models to expound where the fallacy originated: The highly squeezed ellipse quadrature in phase space cannot be simplified to a line, and the Wigner function cannot be replaced by a delta function. These measures amount to taking only the leading order in the relevant parameters in seeking the semiclassical limit and ignoring the subdominant contributions where quantum features reside. Doing so violates the bounds of the Wigner function, and its wave functions possess negative eigenvalues. Moreover, the Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty relation for a pure state is violated. For inflationary cosmological perturbations, in addition to these features, entanglement exists between the created pairs. This uniquely quantum feature cannot be easily argued away. Indeed, it could be our best hope to retroduce the quantum nature of cosmological perturbations and the trace of an inflation field. All this points to the invariant fact that a closed quantum system, even when highly squeezed, evolves unitarily without loss of coherence; quantum cosmological perturbations do not decohere by themselves.

We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.

AB The approach by Ettore Majorana for non-adiabatic transitions between two quasi-crossing levels is revisited and significantly extended. We rederive the transition probability, known as the Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana formula, and introduce Majorana's approach to modern readers. This result, typically referred as the Landau-Zener formula, was published by Majorana before Landau, Zener and Stuckelberg. Moreover, we go well beyond previous results and we now obtain the full wave function, including its phase, which is important nowadays for quantum control and quantum information. The asymptotic wave function correctly describes the dynamics away from the avoided-level crossing, while it has limited accuracy in that region.

TI Measures from conical 2-designs depend only on two constants
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum measurements are important tools in quantum information, represented by positive, operator-valued measures. A wide class of symmetric measurements is given via generalized equiangular measurements (GEAMs) that form conical 2-designs. We show that only two positive constants are needed to fully characterize a variety of important quantum measures constructed from such operators. Examples are given for entropic uncertainty relations, the Brukner-Zeilinger invariants, quantum coherence, quantum concurrence, and the Schmidt-number criterion for entanglement detection. Our results indicate that similar relations may also hold for conical 2-designs from beyond the class of GEAMs.

AB It was conjectured 30 years ago that gravity could arise from the entropic rearrangement of information. We offer a set of microscopic quantum models which realize this idea in detail. In particular, we suggest a simple mechanism by which Newton's law of gravity arises from extremization of the free energy of a collection of qubits or oscillators, rather than from the exchange of virtual quanta of a fundamental field. We give both a local and a nonlocal version of the construction and show how to distinguish a range of these entropic models from ordinary perturbative quantum gravity using existing observations and near-term experiments.

TI Broadband diffraction of correlated photons from crystal superlattices
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Sources of broadband quantum correlated photons present a valuable resource for quantum metrology, sensing, and communication. Here, we report the generation of spectrally broadband correlated photons from frequency nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a custom-designed lithium niobate superlattice. The superlattice induces a nonlinear interference between the pump, signal and idler, resulting in an experimentally observed comb-like emission spanning 0.060 mu m and 1.4 mu m of spectral bandwidth at 0.647 mu m and 3.0 mu m wavelengths, respectively. While this broad mid-infrared bandwidth is attractive to quantum metrology and sensing due to the enablement of fast spectral multiplexing for data acquisition, the comb-like structure, achieved without an input frequency comb, offers targeted frequencies for quantum communication applications. In addition to useful technological applications, our concept offers an interesting analogy between optical diffraction in quantum and classical optics.

TI Efficient quantum random number generation via simultaneously detecting
   photons in temporal and spatial dimensions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) produce true random numbers with significant applications in quantum communication and numerical computation, where high-rate random number generation is critical. Photon detection-based quantum random-number generation methods have been widely studied. However, the generation rate is constrained by the count rate of single-photon detectors. This study proposes an efficient method that enhances random number generation by simultaneously detecting photons in temporal and spatial dimensions. We achieved simultaneous detection of photon arrival time and spatial position by employing a laboratory-developed 5 x 5 single-photon detector array and a high-saturation count rate multichannel time-to-digital converter. The maximum efficiency of the method was 21.1 bits per event and it maintained a consistent efficiency of 17.6 bits per event while achieving a random number generation rate of 2.1 Gbps. The proposed QRNG approach offers a promising pathway for significantly increasing random number generation rates, benefiting applications that require secure and high-speed random number sequences.

TI Consequences of the single-pair measurement of the Bell parameter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bell inequalities represent a milestone for contemporary physics, both for quantum foundation investigations and technological applications (e.g., quantum communication and entanglement certification). Although loophole-free tests have been recently performed, a strong debate is still ongoing on the actual meaning of Bell inequality tests, for example, on the possible additional hypotheses and eventual loopholes to be included in Bell's theorem, as well as on the implications for certain interpretations of quantum mechanics. A recent work [S. Virzi et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 9, 045027 (2024)] challenges some of the statements appeared in this debate, achieving an experimental estimation of the entire Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) parameter from a single entangled pair owing to a weak-interaction-based measurement approach. Here, we analyze the implications of this result for quantum mechanics foundations investigation, illustrating how it can tackle some of the aforementioned interpretations of Bell inequality tests and, more in general, of quantum mechanics itself.

TI Ideal pairing of the Stokes and anti-Stokes photons in the Raman process
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A quantum model of the Raman process with the independent Stokes and anti-Stokes nonlinear interactions is developed to study nonclassical correlations between the photons in the Stokes and anti-Stokes fields. The role of the laser pump amplitude, the ratio of the Stokes and anti-Stokes coupling constants, and the population and losses of the vibrational mode in forming the correlations is elucidated. The g((2)) intensity cross-correlation function, noise-reduction factor, two-mode principal squeezing variance, logarithmic negativity, nonclassicality depth, steering parameter, and the Bell parameter are analyzed side by side to shed light to the correlations between the Stokes and anti-Stokes fields. Conditions for having the Stokes and anti-Stokes fields composed of only photon pairs, similarly as it occurs in twin beams in parametric down-conversion, are revealed. They allow for nonzero mean thermal phonon numbers.

We also show that the new quantum divergence satisfies the Data Processing Inequality in quantum information theory.

TI Drone-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detection system with
   a detection efficiency of more than 90%
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Conventional superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have been typically limited in their applications due to their size, weight, and power consumption, which confine their use to laboratory settings. However, with the rapid development of remote imaging, sensing technologies, and long-range quantum communication with fewer topographical constraints, the demand for high-efficiency single-photon detectors integrated with avionic platforms is rapidly growing. We herein designed and manufactured the first drone-based SNSPD system with a system detection efficiency (SDE) as high as 91.8%. This drone-based system incorporates high-performance NbTiN SNSPDs, a self-developed miniature liquid helium dewar, and custom-built integrated electrical setups, making it capable of being launched in complex topographical conditions. Such a drone-based SNSPD system may open the use of SNSPDs for applications that demand high SDE in complex environments.

   superconducting circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quest to realize novel phases of matter with topological order is an important pursuit with implications for strongly correlated physics and quantum information. Utilizing ideas from state-of-the-art coherent control of artificial quantum systems such as superconducting circuits, we present a proposal to realize bosonic fractional quantum Hall physics on small lattices by creating nearly flat topological bands using staggered flux patterns. Fingerprints of fractionalization through charge pumping can be observed with nearly perfect quantization using as few as 24 lattice sites (two photons). We suggest an implementation using a finite lattice of superconducting qubits with cylindrical connectivity on both triangular and square lattices.

TI Statistical properties of linear Majorana fermions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB A Majorana fermion is the single fermionic particle that is its own antiparticle. Its dynamics is determined by the Majorana equation, where the spinor field is by definition equal to its charge-conjugate field. In this paper, we investigated Shannon's entropy of linear Majorana fermions to understand how this quantity is modified due to an external potential of the linear type linear. Subsequently, we turn our attention to the construction of an ensemble of these Majorana particles to study the thermodynamic properties of the model. Finally, we show how Shannon's entropy and thermodynamic properties are modified under the linear potential action.

TI Quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We study the quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels. Our focus is on exploring how classical correlations between successive actions of a dephasing channel influence the decoherence of two gravitational cats (two qubits) at a thermal regime. The results show that the quantum coherence, local quantum Fisher information, and Bell non-locality can be significantly enhanced by augmenting classical correlations throughout the entire duration when the two qubits pass the channel. However, the gravitational interaction and energy gap between states exhibit intricate impacts on the quantum characteristics of gravitational cats. New features are reported that can be significant for both gravitational physics and quantum information processing.

TI Localizable quantum coherence
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Coherence is a fundamental notion in quantum mechanics, defined relative to a reference basis. As such, it does not necessarily reveal the locality of interactions nor takes into account the accessible operations in a composite quantum system. In this paper, we put forward a notion of localizable coherence as the coherence that can be stored in a particular subsystem, either by measuring or just by disregarding the rest. We examine its spreading, its average properties in the Hilbert space and show that it can be applied to reveal the real-space structure of states of interest in quantum many-body theory, for example, localized or topological states.

AB We report direct visualization of gigahertz-frequency Lamb-wave propagation in aluminum nitride phononic circuits by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). Consistent with finite-element modeling, the acoustic eigenmodes in both a horn-shaped coupler and a subwavelength waveguide are revealed in the TMIM images. Using fast Fourier-transform filtering, we quantitatively analyze the acoustic loss of individual Lamb modes along the waveguide and the power-coupling coefficient between the waveguide and the parabolic couplers. Our work provides insightful information on the propagation, mode conversion, and attenuation of acoustic waves in piezoelectric nanostructures, which is highly desirable for designing and optimizing phononic devices for microwave-signal processing and quantum-information transduction.

TI Design of Long-Wave Fully Polarized HgCdTe Photodetector Based on
   Silicon Metasurface
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Polarization-sensitive photodetection is critical for advanced optical systems, yet achieving simultaneous high-fidelity recognition of the circularly polarized (CP) and linearly polarized (LP) light with compact designs remains challenging. Here, we use COMSOL 5.6 software to demonstrate a silicon metasurface-integrated MCT photodetector that resolves both CP and LP signals through a single ultrathin platform. The device deciphers LP states via four orientation-specific linear gratings for differential detection, while chiral symmetric silicon nanostructures enable direct CP discrimination with an exceptional extinction ratio of 30 dB. The proposed architecture combines two breakthroughs: (1) superior polarization reconstruction capability, achieved via the synergy of grating-induced polarization selectivity and chiral near-field enhancement, and (2) a fabrication-simplified process that eliminates multilayer stacking or complex alignment steps. This work establishes a new paradigm for miniaturized, high-performance polarization optics, with potential applications in polarization imaging, quantum communication, and hyperspectral sensing.

TI Optimum ratio between two bases in the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol
   with second-order analysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol, we optimize the ratio of the choice of two bases, the bit basis and the phase basis, by using the second-order expansion for the length of the generation keys under the coherent attack. This optimization addresses the trade-off between the loss of transmitted bits due to the disagreement of their bases and the estimation error of the error rate in the phase basis. Then, we derive the optimum ratio and the optimum length of the generation keys with the second-order asymptotics. Surprisingly, the second order has the order n(3/4), which is much larger than the second-order n(1/2). in the conventional setting when n is the number of quantum communication. This fact shows that our setting has much larger importance for the second-order analysis than the conventional problem. To illustrate this importance, we numerically plot the effect of the second-order correction.

AB Squeezed light is a fundamental nonclassical resource in quantum optics, and considerable progress has been made in its generation and manipulation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a compact higher-order spatial modes squeezed light source, achieved by integrating second-harmonic generation and optical parametric oscillation within a single doubly resonant cavity. The HG2m,2n pump field, which is essential for the generation of HGm,n mode squeezed states, is produced via internal second-harmonic generation, substantially enhancing both the conversion efficiency and mode purity. With this configuration, we successfully generated squeezed vacuum states in the HG0,0, HG1,0, and HG2,0 modes, achieving squeezing levels of-4.53 +/- 0.26 dB, -3.68 +/- 0.19 dB, and-2.58 +/- 0.08 dB, respectively. This platform provides a viable pathway for scalable, multimode quantum state generation, with broad potential in quantum metrology and quantum communication.

TI Dynamical Landauer Principle: Quantifying Information Transmission by
   Thermodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Energy transfer and information transmission are two fundamental aspects of nature. They are seemingly unrelated, while recent findings suggest that a deep connection between them is to be discovered. This amounts to asking: Can we phrase the processes of transmitting classical bits equivalently as specific energy-transmitting tasks, thereby uncovering foundational links between them? We answer this question positively by showing that, for a broad class of classical communication tasks, a quantum dynamics' ability to transmit n bits of classical information is equivalent to its ability to transmit n units of energy in a thermodynamic task. This finding not only provides an analytical correspondence between information transmission and energy extraction tasks, but also quantifies classical communication by thermodynamics. Furthermore, our findings uncover the dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between transmitting information and energy. In the asymptotic regime, our results further provide thermodynamic meanings for the well-known Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland theorem in quantum communication theory.

TI Heralded and high-efficient entanglement concentrations based on linear
   optics assisted by time-delay degree of freedom
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entanglement concentration is a critical technique to prevent degraded fidelity and security in long-distance quantum communication. We propose novel practical entanglement concentration protocols (ECPs) for less-entangled Bell and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with unknown parameters by solely using simple linear optics. We avoid the need for the post-selection principles or photon-number-resolving detectors to identify the parity-check measurement completely by orchestrating auxiliary time degree of freedom, and the success of ECPs is exactly heralded by the detection signatures without destroying the incident qubits. Additionally, the outting incident photons kept are in the maximally entangled or the less-entangled state, and the success probability can be increased by recycling the latter. The heralded and the basic linear optical elements make our practical ECPs are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.

TI Nonlinear Multimodal Interference as Ultrafast Photonic Device for
   Dual-Wavelength Domain-Wall Dark Pulse Generation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In comparison to bright pulses, better stability that is not susceptible to loss makes dark pulses accessible for applications in such fields as signal processing, optics sensing, and quantum communication. Here we investigate the dual-wavelength domain-wall dark pulse generation in a graded-index multimode fiber (GIMF) based anomalous dispersion single-mode fiber (SMF) laser. By optimizing intra-cavity nonlinearity and pulse polarization, the mode-locked states can evolve each other between bright pulses, dark pulses, and bright-dark pulse pairs. The evolution mechanism among them may be relevant to the coherent mode superposition, spectral filtering, and mode selection in SMF-GIMF-SMF hybrid-fiber modulation devices that affect the pulse formation and evolution in temporal, frequency, and space domains. These results provide a valuable reference for promoting further development of nonlinear optics and ultrafast optics, in which ultrafast photonic devices, with low cost, simple manufacture as well as wide adaptability, as novel pulsed generation technique, play a vital role.

TI Impacts of low-order aberrations on capacity of orbital-angular-momentum
   quantum states
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We use Hypergeometric Gaussian-II (HyGG-II) modes to investigate the impacts of non-Kolmogorov atmospheric turbulence on the Holevo channel capacity of a quantum communication scheme. The capacity of HyGG-II modes can be higher than that of Laguerre-Gaussian modes via modulating the hollowness parameter. The influences of low-order turbulence aberrations including tilt, defocus, astigmatism, and coma on the capacity are also explored. Generally, tilt aberration dominates among all low-order aberrations and defocus and astigmatism aberrations are always negligible. By contrast, the effect of coma aberration can be enhanced to be non-negligible when the turbulence strength or the channel zenith angle is enhanced. We also show that only the total and tilt aberrations are sensitive to the non-Kolmogorov power-law exponent. Our results may contribute to the quantum optical communication as well as aberration compensation in turbulent channels utilizing the novel family of vortex beams.

TI Temperature-independent almost perfect photon entanglement from quantum
   dots via the SUPER scheme
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Entangled photon pairs are essential for quantum communication technology. They can be generated on-demand by semiconductor quantum dots, but several mechanisms are known to reduce the degree of entanglement. While some obstacles like the finite fine-structure splitting of the exciton states can currently be overcome, the excitation scheme itself can impair the entanglement fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that the swing-up of quantum emitter population (SUPER) scheme, using two red-detuned laser pulses applied to a quantum dot in a cavity, yields almost perfectly entangled photons. The entanglement remains robust against phonon influences even at elevated temperatures, due to decoupling of the excitation and emission process. With this achievement, quantum dots are ready to be used as entangled photon pair sources in applications requiring high degrees of entanglement up to temperatures of approximately 80 K.

TI Cavity-enhanced photon indistinguishability at room temperature and
   telecom wavelengths
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Indistinguishable single photons in the telecom-bandwidth of optical fibers are indispensable for long-distance quantum communication. Solid-state single photon emitters have achieved excellent performance in key benchmarks, however, the demonstration of indistinguishability at room-temperature remains a major challenge. Here, we report room-temperature photon indistinguishability at telecom wavelengths from individual nanotube defects in a fiber-based microcavity operated in the regime of incoherent good cavity-coupling. The efficiency of the coupled system outperforms spectral or temporal filtering, and the photon indistinguishability is increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the free-space limit. Our results highlight a promising strategy to attain optimized non-classical light sources.
   Carbon nanotube-based single photon emitters allow for room-temperature operation, but suffer from vanishing indistinguishability due to strong dephasing. Following a theoretical proposal, the authors tackle the problem experimentally by using a cavity to enhance the photon coherence time and the emission spectral density in the regime of incoherent good cavity-coupling.

TI Some Parameterized Quantum Midpoint and Quantum Trapezoid Type
   Inequalities for Convex Functions with Applications
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum information theory, an interdisciplinary field that includes computer science, information theory, philosophy, cryptography, and entropy, has various applications for quantum calculus. Inequalities and entropy functions have a strong association with convex functions. In this study, we prove quantum midpoint type inequalities, quantum trapezoidal type inequalities, and the quantum Simpson's type inequality for differentiable convex functions using a new parameterized q-integral equality. The newly formed inequalities are also proven to be generalizations of previously existing inequities. Finally, using the newly established inequalities, we present some applications for quadrature formulas.

TI Dilemma breaking in quantum games by joint probabilities approach
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Classical games get fundamentally modified in the quantum realm because of non-locality and entanglement, that bypass some of the crucial features of the classical problem that define a dilemma. We will analyze how the dilemma can be shunted and even completely eliminated by the players using quantum strategies from the viewpoint of joint probabilities. In this approach, the game information (entropy) needs to be incorporated into the game strategies. We also connect the potential of the formalism of quantum games with the transmission of quantum information in quantum noisy channels and recent considerations of the connection between thermalization mechanisms in statistical mechanics, the many body problem and cooperative games considered here in the quantum regime.

TI Broadband terahertz metasurfaces for anomalous reflection and vortex
   beam generation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This paper presents a broadband terahertz (THz) meta-atom composed of copper and polyimide, capable of efficient wavefront modulation. By leveraging the Pancharatnam-Berry phase mechanism, the meta-atom achieves full 0-2 pi phase coverage across a wide frequency range of 1.6-3.2 THz under circularly polarized wave illumination through the rotation of its top metallic structure. Based on this design, we further demonstrate three types of broadband metasurfaces by strategically arranging the meta-atoms, achieving anomalous reflection, orbital angular momentum (OAM) generation, and deflected OAM generation, respectively. The proposed broadband THz metasurfaces hold significant potential for advanced applications in quantum communication and optical sensing systems. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Near-Unity Absorption in Semiconductor Metasurfaces Using Kerker
   Interference
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The ability to detect light with high efficiency is an important device metric for single-photon detectors and cameras, essential for applications ranging from quantum communication to biomedical imaging. However, these photodetectors have limited detection efficiency in the 850-1100 nm wavelength range, known as the 'valley of death'. Here, we demonstrate a near-perfect absorber in the 'valley of death' using a semiconductor metasurface with spectral and spatial selectivity on a high refractive index substrate. Our design leverages higher order optical modes of InGaAs resonators to generate Kerker interference at the target wavelength of 920 nm, which leads to a measured peak absorption efficiency of similar to 94%. In addition, numerical calculations show that our design enables spatial control of the absorption profile within the resonators, which is promising for improving response time. Our approach offers tunability over a desired spectral range and paves the way for development of high-performance photodetectors.

TI Accurate Zernike-corrected phase screens for arbitrary power spectra
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB Wave propagation through random continuous media remains an important fundamental problem with applications ranging from remote sensing to quantum communication. Typically, such media are characterized by smooth refractive index fluctuations whose impact on the wave can be captured by the stochastic parabolic equation. The latter can be solved numerically by means of a split-step method, which replaces the continuous medium with a number of discrete phase screens derived from the medium's power spectrum. We introduce and benchmark highly accurate and efficient hybrid phase screens for arbitrary power spectra, which are based on the combination of Zernike and Fourier phase screens. (c) The Authors.

TI Measurement device hacking-free mutual quantum identity authentication
   over a deployed optical fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum identity authentication serves as a crucial technology for secure quantum communication, but its security often faces challenges due to quantum hacking of measurement devices. This study introduces a measurement-device-independent mutual quantum identity authentication (MDI MQIA) scheme capable of ensuring secure user authentication, despite the use of measurement devices vulnerable to quantum hacking. To realize the MDI MQIA scheme, we proposed and applied a modified Bell state measurement based on linear optics, enabling the probabilistic measurement of all Bell states. Furthermore, the proposed experimental setup adopted a plug-and-play architecture, thus efficiently establishing the indistinguishability of two photons prepared by the communication members. Finally, we successfully performed a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of the proposed scheme using a field-deployed fiber, achieving quantum bit error rates of less than 3%.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Engineering Purcell factor anisotropy for dark and bright excitons in
   two dimensional semiconductors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Tightly bound dark excitons in atomically thin semiconductors can be used for various optoelectronic applications including light storage and quantum communication. Their optical accessibility is however limited due to their out-of-plane transition dipole moment. We thus propose to strengthen the coupling of dark excitons in two dimensional materials with out-of-plane resonant modes of a cavity at room temperature, by engineering the anisotropy in the Purcell factor. A silica micro-disk characterised by high confinement of light in small modal volume, high Q-factor and free spectral range is used to couple to the excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). We show numerically that the tapering of sidewalls of the micro-disk is an extremely versatile route for achieving the selective coupling of whispering gallery modes to light emitted from out-of-plane dipoles to the detriment of that from in-plane ones for four representative monolayer TMDCs.

The proposed method is applied to an electrochemically-reduced In-Sn-oxide (ITO) films known to be simultaneously transparent and superconducting. Relationship between the processing parameters and superconducting characteristics of the ITO films is considered, and prospects for using such samples in integrated photonic-superconducting chips for quantum-information processing are discussed.

TI Efficient quantum digital signatures without symmetrization step
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum digital signatures (QDS) exploit quantum laws to guarantee non-repudiation, unforgeability and transferability of messages with information-theoretic security. Current QDS protocols face two major restrictions, including the requirement of the symmetrization step with additional secure classical channels and the quadratic scaling of the signature rate with the probability of detection events. Here, we present an efficient QDS protocol to overcome these issues by utilizing the classical post-processing operation called post-matching method. Our protocol does not need the symmetrization step, and the signature rate scales linearly with the probability of detection events. Simulation results show that the signature rate is three orders of magnitude higher than the original protocol in a 100-km-long fiber. This protocol is compatible with existing quantum communication infrastructure, therefore we anticipate that it will play a significant role in providing digital signatures with unconditional security.

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Spatial distribution-controlled single-photon emitters operating is demonstrated in telecom wavelength range at room-temperature with GaN thin film grown on a patterned sapphire substrate (PSSs) with varying pattern sizes and dimensions. The analysis focuses on the various optical properties of defects within the GaN thin film, particularly their interactions with PSS. The confocal fluorescence mapping at room temperature revealed localized single-photon emitters inside the GaN layers located between the patterns. In addition, compared to conventional sapphire substrates, PSS can scatter photons outside the total reflection cone, thereby enhancing the light extraction efficiency. From the samples, the single photon emission is observed in the telecom wavelength ranging from 1.1 to 1.35 mu m at room temperature, which is critical for advancing quantum communication technologies, and elucidate how the physical characteristics of PSS influence the performance and efficiency of GaN-based single-photon emitters.

TI Evidencing quantum gravity with thermodynamical observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Proposed experiments for obtaining empirical evidence for a quantum description of gravity in a tabletop setting focus on detecting quantum information signatures, such as entanglement or non-Gaussianity production, in gravitationally interacting quantum systems. Here, we explore an alternative approach where the quantization of gravity could be inferred through measurements of macroscopic, thermodynamical quantities, without the need for addressability of individual quantum systems. To demonstrate the idea, we take as a case study a gravitationally self-interacting Bose gas and consider its heat capacity. We find a clear-cut distinction between the predictions of a classical gravitational interaction and a quantum gravitational interaction in the heat capacity of the Bose gas.

TI Microwave Photon Detection at Parametric Criticality
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The detection of microwave fields at single-photon power levels is a much-sought-after technology, with practical applications in nanoelectronics and quantum information science. Here we demonstrate a simple yet powerful criticality-enhanced method of microwave photon detection by operating a magneticfield-tunable Kerr Josephson parametric amplifier at the border of a first-order phase transition and close to the critical point. We obtain an efficiency of 73% and a dark-count rate of 167 kHz, corresponding to a responsivity of 1.3 x 1017 W-1 and noise-equivalent power of 3.28 zW/root Hz. We verify the single-photon operation by extracting the Poissonian statistics of a coherent probe signal.

TI A Single-Molecule Digital Full Adder
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB A specifically designed aza-starphene molecule is presented where contacting one, two, and/or three single Al adatoms allows this molecule to function as a "3-inputs & 2-outputs" digital full adder on a Au(111) surface. Sequentially positioning single Al adatoms with atomic precision to interact with aza-starphene, inputs one classical digit per Al, which is converted to quantum information by the molecule. The intramolecular logical calculations do not require a solid-state digital full adder cascade-like architecture. The measured Boolean truth table results in part from the quantum level repulsion effect and in part from a nonlinear magnetic effect also intrinsic to the aza-starphene molecule with its contacted Al adatoms.

TI Direct measurement of ultrafast temporal wavefunctions
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The large capacity and robustness of information encoding in the temporal mode of photons is important in quantum information processing, in which characterizing temporal quantum states with high usability and time resolution is essential. We propose and demonstrate a direct measurement method of temporal complex wavefunctions for weak light at a single-photon level with subpicosecond time resolution. Our direct measurement is realized by ultrafast metrology of the interference between the light under test and self-generated monochromatic reference light; no external reference light or complicated post-processing algorithms are required. Hence, this method is versatile and potentially widely applicable for temporal state characterization. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Optimization of hollow-core fibers with elliptical tubes for improved

SO OPTICAL FIBER TECHNOLOGY
AB Hollow core fibers with elliptical tubes offer more design flexibility and can achieve better performance compared to their circular counterparts. We optimize the elliptical tubes of a hollow-core fiber to achieve a higher order mode extinction ratio (HOMER) exceeding 5500 along with a confinement loss of 0.012 dB/m in the telecommunication band; 4.7 x 10(-4) dB/m with HOMER > 4300 in the visible band. We also derive an empirical relation between the structural parameters to obtain avoided crossings between the core higher order modes and the cladding modes to achieve the best single-mode guidance, besides achieving minimum confinement loss for the fundamental mode. We investigate the effect of bends on not just the confinement loss, but also on the HOMER. We have also included the dispersion and fabrication tolerances. These fibers find applications in quantum communication, sensing, and high-power laser delivery.

For this purpose, we propose and implement graded In content digitally alloyed InGaAs metamorphic buffer layer with maximal In content of 42% and GaAs/AlAs distributed Bragg reflector underneath to enhance the extraction efficiency of QD emission. The fundamental limit of the emission rate for the investigated structures is 0.5 GHz based on an emission lifetime of 1.95 ns determined from time-resolved photoluminescence. We prove the relevance of a proposed technology platform for the realization of non-classical light sources in the context of fiber-based quantum communication applications.

TI Enhancing the spectrum of timed Dicke state via squeezing a cavity mode
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work we present transmission spectra of a two atom timed Dicke state in an optical cavity which is subject to the parametric driving. In the proposed scheme, the parametric driving can squeeze the cavity mode and exponentially enhance the atom-cavity interaction. We show that the interaction between the timed Dicke state and squeezed cavity mode induces the quantum interference and normal mode splitting on the transmission spectra. In addition, we demonstrated that the spectra intensities are exponential quadratic enhanced under the parametric driving, which may provide a feasible scheme for sensitivity enhancement of the single photon measurement.

TI Bidirectional Information Flow Quantum State Tomography
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The exact reconstruction of many-body quantum systems is one of the major challenges in modern physics, because it is impractical to overcome the exponential complexity problem brought by high-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Recently, machine learning techniques are well used to promote quantum information research and quantum state tomography has also been developed by neural network generative models. We propose a quantum state tomography method, which is based on a bidirectional gated recurrent unit neural network, to learn and reconstruct both easy quantum states and hard quantum states in this study. We are able to use fewer measurement samples in our method to reconstruct these quantum states and to obtain high fidelity.

TI Simple and general bounds on quantum random access codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Random access codes are a type of communication task that is widely used in quantum information science. The optimal average success probability that can be achieved through classical strategies is known for any random access code. However, only a few cases are solved exactly for quantum random access codes. In this paper, we provide bounds for the fully general setting of n-independent variables, each selected from a d-dimensional classical alphabet and encoded in a D-dimensional quantum system subject to an arbitrary quantum measurement. The bound recovers the exactly known special cases, and we demonstrate numerically that even though the bound is not tight overall, it can still yield a good approximation.

In this paper, we highlight the influence of the propagation environment on the quantum illumination radar scheme. Our approach consists in describing the quantum information evolution inside the radar and the entanglement rate with a mathematical parameter which represents the interaction strength of the propagation medium on the quantum system used by the radar.

We derive an analytical expression for the entanglement of formation without performing the Markov and the secular approximations. We observe a variety of qualitative features such as entanglement sudden death, dynamical generation, and protection for two types of Lorentzian spectral densities, assuming the two modes initially excited in a twin-beam state. Our quantitative analysis shows that these cases with different reservoir spectrum, the environmental temperature and the initial amount of entanglement differ significantly in these qualitative features.

This design leverages the large transition dipole moments of Rydberg atoms to mediate fast, high-fidelity gates between qubits encoded in coherent molecular degrees of freedom.

The molecule-Rydberg interaction can also be used to enable nondestructive molecule detection and rotational state readout.

In obtaining the results, we have derived recurrence relations of the underlying integrals over the Cauchy-Laguerre biorthogonal polynomials that may be of independent interest.

Here, we present what we believe to be the first chip-size fully integrated fiber-coupled heralded single photon source (HSPS) module based on a hybrid integration of a nonlinear lithium niobate waveguide into a polymer board. Photon pairs at 810 nm (signal) and 1550 nm (idler) are generated via parametric down-conversion pumped at 532 nm in the LiNbO3 waveguide. The pairs are split in the polymer board and routed to separate output ports. The module has a size of (2 x 1) cm2 and is fully fiber-coupled with one pump input fiber and two output fibers. We measure a heralded second-order correlation function of g(2) h = 0.05 with a heralding efficiency of & eta;h = 3.5 % at low pump powers.

TI Prior entanglement exponentially improves one-server quantum private
   information retrieval for quantum messages
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) for quantum messages is a quantum communication task, in which a user retrieves one of the multiple quantum states from the server without revealing which state is retrieved. In the one-server setting, we find an exponential gap in the communication complexities between the presence and absence of prior entanglement in this problem with the one-server setting. To achieve this aim, as the first step, we prove that the trivial solution of downloading all messages is optimal under QPIR for quantum messages, which is a similar result to that of classical PIR but different from QPIR for classical messages. As the second step, we propose an efficient one-server one-round QPIR protocol with prior entanglement by constructing a reduction from a QPIR protocol for classical messages to a QPIR protocol for quantum messages in the presence of prior entanglement.

TI Observation of highly correlated ultrabright biphotons through increased
   atomic ensemble density in spontaneous four-wave mixing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The pairing ratio, a crucial metric assessing a biphoton source's ability to generate correlated photon pairs, remains underexplored despite theoretical predictions. This study presents experimental findings on the pairing ratio, utilizing a double-A spontaneous four-wave mixing biphoton source in cold atoms. At an optical depth (OD) of 20, we achieved an ultrahigh biphoton generation rate of up to 1.3 x 107 per second, with a successful pairing ratio of 61%. Increasing the OD to 120 significantly improved the pairing ratio to 89%, while maintaining a consistent biphoton generation rate. This achievement, marked by high generation rates and robust biphoton pairing, holds great promise for advancing efficiency in quantum communication and information processing. Additionally, in a scenario with a lower biphoton generation rate of 5.0 x 104 per second, we attained an impressive signal-to-background ratio of 241 for the biphoton wavepacket, surpassing the Cauchy-Schwarz criterion by approximately 1.5 x 104 times.

AB A transducer of single photons between microwave and optical frequencies can be used to realize quantum communication over optical fiber links between distant superconducting quantum computers. A promising scalable approach to constructing such a transducer is to use ensembles of quantum emitters interacting simultaneously with electromagnetic fields at optical and microwave frequencies. However, inhomogeneous broadening in the transition frequencies of the emitters can be detrimental to this collective action. In this paper, we utilize a gradient-based optimization strategy to design the temporal shape of the laser field driving the transduction system to mitigate the effects of inhomogeneous broadening. We study the improvement of transduction efficiencies as a function of inhomogeneous broadening in different single-emitter cooperativity regimes and correlate it with a restoration of super-radiance effects in the emitter ensembles. Furthermore, to assess the optimality of our pulse designs, we provide certifiable bounds on the design problem and compare them to the achieved performance.

TI Ultrafast dynamics of exciton-polariton in optically tailored potential
   landscapes at room temperature
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB In this work, by using femtosecond angle-resolved spectroscopic imaging technique, the ultrafast dynamics of confined exciton-polaritons in an optical induced potential well based on a ZnO whispering-gallery microcavity is explicitly visualized. The sub-picosecond transition between succeeding quantum harmonic oscillator states can be experimentally distinguished. The landscape of the potential well can be modified by the pump power, the spatial distance and the time delay of the two input laser pulses. Clarifying the underlying mechanism of the polariton harmonic oscillator is interesting for the applications of polariton-based optoelectronic devices and quantum information processing.

TI Quantum space-time marginal problem: global causal structure from local
   causal information
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Spatial and temporal quantum correlations can be unified in the framework of the pseudo-density operators (PDOs), and quantum causality between the involved events in an experiment is encoded in the corresponding PDO. We study the relationship between local causal information and global causal structure. A space-time marginal problem is proposed to infer global causal structures from given marginal causal structures where causal structures are represented by the reduced PDOs; we show that there almost always exists a solution in this case. By imposing the corresponding constraints on this solution set, we could obtain the required solutions for special classes of marginal problems, like a positive semidefinite marginal problem, separable marginal problem, etc. We introduce a space-time entropy and propose a method to determine the global causal structure based on the maximum entropy principle. The notion of quantum pseudo-channel (QPC) is also introduced and we demonstrate that the QPC marginal problem can be solved by transforming it into a PDO marginal problem via the channel-state duality.

TI Simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same
   photonic quantum states
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum communication realizes information-theoretic security using photonic quantum states, for example, quantum secure direct communication (QSDC), which can achieve secure and reliable communication in a channel with both noise and eavesdroppers. However, QSDC suffers from large losses and short communication distances, thus being impractical for applications. Here, we have proposed a one-way quasi-QSDC protocol with single photons. This protocol enables the simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same single photons and is robust against loss and error because it uses error correction and spectrum expansion techniques. In a proof-of-principle demonstration using weak coherent pulses, the system achieved a real-time secure transmission rate of 2.38 kilobits per second over a 104.8-kilometer standard telecommunication fiber, which set world records in both aspects. This system paved the way for the practical application of QSDC and offers a unique method to detect eavesdropping online, which is crucial in certain circumstances.

TI Multilevel Spiral Axicon for High-Order Bessel-Gauss Beams Generation
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB This paper presents an efficient method to generate high-order Bessel-Gauss beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) by using a thin and compact optical element such as a multilevel spiral axicon. This approach represents an excellent alternative for diffraction-free OAM beam generation instead of complex methods based on a doublet formed by a physical spiral phase plate and zero-order axicon, phase holograms loaded on spatial light modulators (SLMs), or the interferometric method. Here, we present the fabrication process for axicons with 16 and 32 levels, characterized by high mode conversion efficiency and good transmission for visible light (lambda = 633 nm wavelength). The Bessel vortex states generated with the proposed diffractive optical elements (DOEs) can be exploited as a very useful resource for optical and quantum communication in free-space channels or in optical fibers.

TI LNL-FPC: THE LINEAR/NON-LINEAR FIXPOINT CALCULUS
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We describe a type system with mixed linear and non-linear recursive types called LNL-FPC (the linear/non-linear fixpoint calculus). The type system supports linear typing, which enhances the safety properties of programs, but also supports non-linear typing as well, which makes the type system more convenient for programming. Just as in FPC, we show that LNL-FPC supports type-level recursion, which in turn induces term-level recursion. We also provide sound and computationally adequate categorical models for LNL-FPC that describe the categorical structure of the substructural operations of Intuitionistic Linear Logic at all non-linear types, including the recursive ones. In order to do so, we describe a new technique for solving recursive domain equations within cartesian categories by constructing the solutions over pre-embeddings. The type system also enjoys implicit weakening and contraction rules that we are able to model by identifying the canonical comonoid structure of all non-linear types. We also show that the requirements of our abstract model are reasonable by constructing a large class of concrete models that have found applications not only in classical functional programming, but also in emerging programming paradigms that incorporate linear types, such as quantum programming and circuit description programming languages.

TI Test of local realism via entangled Λ(Λ)over-bar system
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The non-locality of quantum correlations is a fundamental feature of quantum theory. The Bell inequality serves as a benchmark for distinguishing between predictions made by quantum theory and local hidden variable theory (LHVT). Recent advancements in photon-entanglement experiments have addressed potential loopholes and have observed significant violations of variants of Bell inequality. However, examples of Bell inequalities violation in high energy physics are scarce. In this study, we utilize (10.087 +/- 0.044) x 10(9) J/psi events collected with the BES-III detector at the BEPCII collider, performing non-local correlation tests using the entangled hyperon pairs. The massive-entangled Lambda(Lambda) over bar systems are formed and decay through strong and weak interactions, respectively. Through measurements of the angular distribution of p (p) over bar in J/psi -> gamma eta(c) and subsequent eta(c)->Lambda(p pi(-))(Lambda) over bar((p) over bar pi(+)) cascade decays, a significant violation of LHVT predictions is observed. The exclusion of LHVT is found to be statistically significant at a level exceeding 5.2 sigma in the testing of three Bell-like inequalities.

TI Localization and 'classical entanglement' in the discrete non-linear
   Schrödinger equation
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB We perform a detailed numerical study of the very peculiar thermodynamic properties of the localized high-energy phase of the discrete non-linear Schr & ouml;dinger equation (DNLSE). A numerical sampling of the microcanonical ensemble done by means of Hamiltonian dynamics reveals a new and subtle relation between the presence of the localized phase and a property of the system that we have called classical entanglement. Our main finding is that a quantity defined for our classical system in perfect analogy with the entanglement entropy of quantum ones, and that we have therefore called Sent, grows with the system size N in the localized phase as Sent(N)similar to log(N), therefore revealing the presence of subtle non-local correlations between any finite portion of the system and the rest of it. This manifestation of classical entanglement beautifully captures the lack of system separability in the DNLSE localized phase, revealing how statistical correlations specific to the microcanonical ensemble and non-reproducible in the canonical one, may concur to determine a property totally analogous to the one produced by non-local quantum correlations.

TI Continuous Sensing and Parameter Estimation with the Boundary Time
   Crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A boundary time crystal is a quantum many-body system whose dynamics is governed by the competition between coherent driving and collective dissipation. It is composed of N two-level systems and features a transition between a stationary phase and an oscillatory one. The fact that the system is open allows one to continuously monitor its quantum trajectories and to analyze their dependence on parameter changes. This enables the realization of a sensing device whose performance we investigate as a function of the monitoring time T and of the system size N. We find that the best achievable sensitivity is proportional to pN, i.e., it follows the standard quantum limit in time and Heisenberg scaling in the particle number. This theoretical scaling can be achieved in the oscillatory time-crystal phase and it is rooted in emergent quantum correlations. The main challenge is, however, to tap this capability in a measurement protocol that is experimentally feasible. We demonstrate that the standard quantum limit can be surpassed by cascading two time crystals, where the quantum trajectories of one time crystal are used as input for the other one.

TI Quantum phase diagrams of matter-field Hamiltonians I: Fidelity, Bures
   distance, and entanglement
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A general procedure is established to calculate the quantum phase diagrams for finite matter-field Hamiltonian models. The minimum energy surface associated to the different symmetries of the model is calculated as a function of the matter-field coupling strengths. By means of the ground state wave functions, one looks for minimal fidelity or maximal Bures distance surfaces in terms of the parameters, and from them the critical regions of those surfaces characterize the finite quantum phase transitions. Following this procedure for N-a = 1 and N-a = 4 particles, the quantum phase diagrams are calculated for the generalised Tavis-Cummings and Dicke models of 3-level systems interacting dipolarly with 2 modes of electromagnetic field. For N-a = 1, the reduced density matrix of the matter allows us to determine the phase regions in a 2-simplex (associated to a general three dimensional density matrix), on the different 3-level atomic configurations, together with a measurement of the quantum correlations between the matter and field sectors. As the occupation probabilities can be measured experimentally, the existence of a quantum phase diagram for a finite system can be established.

TI Microscopic contributions to the entropy production at all times: from
   nonequilibrium steady states to global thermalization
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Based on exact integration of the Schrodinger equation, we numerically study microscopic contributions to the entropy production for the single electron transistor, a paradigmatic model describing a single Fermi level tunnel coupled to two baths of free fermions. To this end, we decompose the entropy production into a sum of information theoretic terms and study them across all relevant time scales, including the nonequilibrium steady state regime and the final stage of global thermalization. We find that the entropy production is dominated for most times by microscopic deviations from thermality in the baths and the correlation between (but not inside) the baths. Despite these microscopic deviations from thermality, the temperatures and chemical potentials of the baths thermalize as expected, even though our model is integrable. Importantly, this observation is confirmed for both initially mixed and pure states. We further observe that the bath-bath correlations are quite insensitive to the system-bath coupling strength contrary to intuition. Finally, the system-bath correlation, small in an absolute sense, dominates in a relative sense and displays pure quantum correlations for all studied parameter regimes.

TI Entanglement and Bell nonlocality with bottom-quark pairs at hadron
   colliders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB It has been shown that entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which are key concepts in quantum mechanics, can be probed in high-energy colliders via processes of fundamental particle scattering. In fact, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have measured entanglement using top-quark pairs produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Recently, it was shown that spin correlations can be measured in pairs of bottom quarks at the LHC, despite the fact that bottom quarks, unlike top quarks, hadronize before decaying. Here, we demonstrate that quantum correlations can also be studied using bottom-quark pairs, and analyze the feasibility of the observation of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in several collider experiments. Given the low mass of the bottom quark relative to typical energies accessible at the LHC, many of the bottom-quark pairs are in the ultrarelativistic regime, where they can exhibit strong spin entanglement. We find that entanglement of bottom-quark pairs may be measurable even with the LHC Run 2 data, especially with the CMS B parking dataset, while observation of Bell nonlocality may become feasible at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.

TI Bounds on the detection of Bell correlations with entangled ultracold
   atoms in optical lattices under occupation defects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bell nonlocality stems from quantum correlations effectively identified using inequalities. Spin chains, simulated with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, Rydberg atoms in tweezer arrays, trapped ions, or molecules allow single-spin control and measurement. Therefore, they are suitable for studying fundamental aspects of these correlations and nonlocality. Occupation defects, such as vacancies or multiple atoms occupying a single site due to imperfect system preparation, limit the detection of Bell correlations. We study their effects with the help of a simplified toy model parametrized by the probability p of having a single occupation for a given site. Within this model, and for entangled systems obtained by one-axis twisting evolution from an initial factorized state, we derive two Bell inequalities, one based on many-site correlations and the other on two-site correlations, and identify the smallest probability p that allows the Bell inequalities violation to be detected. We then consider two physical realizations using entangled ultracold atoms in optical lattices where the parameter p is related to a nonunitary filling factor and nonzero temperature. We test the predictions of the toy model against exact numerical results.

TI Benchmarking discrete truncated Wigner approximation and neural network
   quantum states with the exact dynamics in a Rydberg atomic chain
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We benchmark the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) and Neural quantum states (NQS) based on restricted Boltzmann-like machines with the exact excitation and correlation dynamics in a chain of ten Rydberg atoms. The initial state is where all atoms are in their electronic ground state. We characterize the excitation dynamics using the maximum and time-averaged number of Rydberg excitations. DTWA results are different from the exact dynamics for large Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. In contrast, by increasing the number of hidden spins, the NQS can be improved but still limited to short-time dynamics. Interestingly, irrespective of interaction strengths, the time-averaged number of excitations obtained using NQS is in excellent agreement with the exact results. Concerning the calculation of quantum correlations, for instance, second-order bipartite and average two-site R & eacute;nyi entropies, NQS looks more promising. Finally, we discuss the existence of a power law scaling for the initial growth of average two-site R & eacute;nyi entropy.

TI Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical
   point
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB By setting the inverse temperature 9 loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function Z, if approaching the real 9 axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the nonunitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between Z and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out Z can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.

TI Schwinger-Keldysh Path Integral Formalism for a Quenched Quantum
   Inverted Oscillator
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this work, we study the time-dependent behavior of quantum correlations of a system of an inverted oscillator governed by out-of-equilibrium dynamics using the well-known Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in the presence of quantum mechanical quench. Considering a generalized structure of a time-dependent Hamiltonian for an inverted oscillator system, we use the invariant operator method to obtain its eigenstate and continuous energy eigenvalues. Using the expression for the eigenstate, we further derive the most general expression for the generating function as well as the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) for the given system using this formalism. Further, considering the time-dependent coupling and frequency of the quantum inverted oscillator characterized by quench parameters, we comment on the dynamical behavior, specifically the early, intermediate and late time-dependent features of the OTOC for the quenched quantum inverted oscillator. Next, we study a specific case, where the system of an inverted oscillator exhibits chaotic behavior by computing the quantum Lyapunov exponent from the time-dependent behavior of OTOCs in the presence of the given quench profile.

TI All real projective measurements can be self-tested
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Entangled quantum systems feature non-local correlations that are stronger than could be realized classically. This property makes it possible to perform self-testing, the strongest form of quantum functionality verification, which allows a classical user to deduce the quantum state and measurements used to produce a given set of measurement statistics. While self-testing of quantum states is well understood, self-testing of measurements, especially in high dimensions, remains relatively unexplored. Here we prove that every real projective measurement can be self-tested. Our approach employs the idea that existing self-tests can be extended to verify additional untrusted measurements, known as post-hoc self-testing. We formalize the method of post-hoc self-testing and establish the condition under which it can be applied. Using this condition, we construct self-tests for all real projective measurements. We build on this result to develop an iterative self-testing technique that provides a clear methodology for constructing new self-tests from pre-existing ones.
   Quantum correlations are strong enough that classical users can verify that a device produces quantum entangled states using only the outcomes of local measurements. This self-testing approach has now been extended to verifying quantum measurements.

TI Detection loophole in quantum causality and its countermeasures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum causality violates classical intuitions of cause and effect and is a unique quantum feature different from other quantum phenomena such as entanglement and quantum nonlocality. In order to avoid the detection loophole in quantum causality, we initiate the study of the detection efficiency requirement for observing quantum causality. We first show that previous classical causal inequalities require detection efficiency at least 95.97% (89.44%) to show violation with quantum (nonsignaling) correlations. Next we derive a classical causal inequality I-222 and show that it requires lower detection efficiency to be violated, 92.39% for quantum correlations and 81.65% for nonsignaling correlations, hence substantially reducing the requirement on detection. Then we extend this causal inequality to the case of multiple measurement settings and analyze the corresponding detection efficiency. After that, we show that previous quantum causal inequalities require detection efficiency at least 94.29% to violate with nonsignaling correlations. We subsequently derive a quantum causal bound J(222) that has a lower detection efficiency requirement of 91.02% for violation with nonsignaling correlations. Our work paves the way towards an experimental demonstration of quantum causality and shows that causal inequalities significantly differ from Bell inequalities in terms of the detection efficiency requirement.

TI Substitutional doping of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides for device
   applications: Current status, challenges and prospects
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING R-REPORTS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a class of materials with exceptional electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, making them highly tunable for diverse applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. This review focuses on substitutional doping of TMDs, a key strategy to tailor their properties and enhance device performance, with a focus on its applications over the past five years (2019-2024). We delve into both theoretical and experimental doping approaches, including established methods like chemical vapor transport (CVT) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) alongside liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) and post-synthesis treatments. Advanced growth techniques are also explored. Challenges like dopant uniformity, concentration control, and stability are addressed. The influence of various dopants on the electronic band structure, carrier concentration, and defect engineering is analyzed in detail. We further explore recent advancements in utilizing doped TMDs for field-effect transistors (FETs), photodetectors, sensors, photovoltaics, optoelectronic devices, energy storage and conversion, and even quantum computers. By examining both the potential and limitations of substitutional doping, this review aims to propel future research and technological advancements in this exciting field.

TI Retardation of the C-Steel Destruction in Hydrochloric Acid Media
   Utilizing an Effective Schiff Base Inhibitor: Experimental and

SO ACS OMEGA
AB The corrosion inhibition of ((NE)-E-1)-N-1,N-2-bis(4-(dimethylamino)benzylidene)-ethane-1,2-diamine, DMAB, against the destruction of C-steel in dilute HCl media (1.0 M) was examined. The techniques of gravimetry, gasometry, potentiodynamic, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are utilized. The rate of corrosion is found to decrease with more additions of the DMAB compound. The inhibition efficacy increases with concentrations to reach 97.7% at 5.0 mM and 298 K. The protection of metal destruction is controlled by the adsorption of the DMAB molecules on the metallic surface obeying Langmuir's pattern. The computed Delta G degrees(ads) values are characterized by negative sign, explaining the spontaneity of the adsorption process. These values vary between -38.70 and -35.13 kJ mol(-1) depending on the temperature, which proves the physio- and chemisorption mechanisms. The reduction in K-ads values with T can be attributed to the desorption of some DMAB molecules from the electrode surface. Theoretical quantum computation confirms the adsorption of the DMAB compound in concurrence with the data obtained by practical techniques.

TI A von-Neumann-like photonic processor and its application in studying
   quantum signature of chaos
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Photonic quantum computation plays an important role and offers unique advantages. Two decades after the milestone work of Knill-Laflamme-Milburn, various architectures of photonic processors have been proposed, and quantum advantage over classical computers has also been demonstrated. It is now the opportune time to apply this technology to real-world applications. However, at current technology level, this aim is restricted by either programmability in bulk optics or loss in integrated optics for the existing architectures of processors, for which the resource cost is also a problem. Here we present a von-Neumann-like architecture based on temporal-mode encoding and looped structure on table, which is capable of multimode-universal programmability, resource-efficiency, phase-stability and software-scalability. In order to illustrate these merits, we execute two different programs with varying resource requirements on the same processor, to investigate quantum signature of chaos from two aspects: the signature behaviors exhibited in phase space (13 modes), and the Fermi golden rule which has not been experimentally studied in quantitative way before (26 modes). The maximal program contains an optical interferometer network with 1694 freely-adjustable phases. Considering current state-of-the-art, our architecture stands as the most promising candidate for real-world applications.

TI Perspective on functional metal-oxide plasmonic metastructures
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Plasmonic nanostructures and metasurfaces are appealing hosts for investigation of novel optical devices and exploration of new frontiers in physical/optical processes and materials research. Recent studies have shown that these structures hold the promise of greater control over the optical and electronic properties of quantum emitters, offering a unique horizon for ultra-fast spin-controlled optical devices, quantum computation, laser systems, and sensitive photodetectors. In this Perspective, we discuss how heterostructures consisting of metal oxides, metallic nanoantennas, and dielectrics can offer a material platform wherein one can use the decay of plasmons and their near fields to passivate the defect sites of semiconductor quantum dots while enhancing their radiative decay rates. Such a platform, called functional metal-oxide plasmonic metasubstrates (FMOPs), relies on formation of two junctions at very close vicinity of each other. These include an Au/Si Schottky junction and an Si/Al oxide charge barrier. Such a double junction allows one to use hot electrons to generate a field-passivation effect, preventing migration of photo-excited electrons from quantum dots to the defect sites. Prospects of FMOP, including impact of enhancement exciton-plasmon coupling, collective transport of excitation energy, and suppression of quantum dot fluorescence blinking, are discussed.

TI Universal Platform for Scalable Semiconductor-Superconductor Nanowire
   Networks
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Semiconductor-superconductor hybrids are commonly used in research on topological quantum computation. Traditionally, top-down approaches involving dry or wet etching are used to define the device geometry. These often aggressive processes risk causing damage to material surfaces, giving rise to scattering sites particularly problematic for quantum applications. Here, a method that maintains the flexibility and scalability of selective area grown nanowire networks while omitting the necessity of etching to create hybrid segments is proposed. Instead, it takes advantage of directional growth methods and uses bottom-up grown indium phosphide (InP) structures as shadowing objects to obtain selective metal deposition. The ability to lithographically define the position and area of these objects and to grow a predefined height ensures precise control of the shadowed region. The approach by growing indium antimonide nanowire networks with well-defined aluminium and lead (Pb) islands is demonstrated. Cross-section cuts of the nanowires reveal a sharp, oxide-free interface between semiconductor and superconductor. By growing InP structures on both sides of in-plane nanowires, a combination of platinum and Pb can independently be shadow deposited, enabling a scalable and reproducible in situ device fabrication. The semiconductor-superconductor nanostructures resulting from this approach are at the forefront of material development for Majorana based experiments.

TI Noise-resilient phase transitions and limit-cycles in coupled Kerr
   oscillators
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In recent years, there has been considerable focus on exploring driven-dissipative quantum systems, as they exhibit distinctive dissipation-stabilized phases. Among them dissipative time crystal is a unique phase emerging as a shift from disorder or stationary states to periodic behaviors. However, understanding the resilience of these non-equilibrium phases against quantum fluctuations remains unclear. This study addresses this query within a canonical parametric quantum optical system, specifically, a multi-mode cavity with self- and cross-Kerr non-linearity. Using mean-field (MF) theory we obtain the phase diagram and delimit the parameter ranges that stabilize a non-stationary limit-cycle phase. Leveraging the Keldysh formalism, we study the unique spectral features of each phase. Further, we extend our analyses beyond the MF theory by explicitly accounting for higher-order correlations through cumulant expansions. Our findings unveil insights into the modifications of the open quantum systems phases, underscoring the significance of quantum correlations in non-equilibrium steady states. Importantly, our results conclusively demonstrate the resilience of the non-stationary phase against quantum fluctuations, rendering it a dissipation-induced genuine quantum synchronous phase.

TI Dynamics of atom-field interaction inside a nonlinear Kerr-like medium
   filled optical cavity
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS
AB In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of two two-level atoms interacting with a two-mode field inside an optical cavity, in presence of a nonlinear Kerr-like medium as well as the Stark shift. We derive the exact analytical solution of the time-dependent Schr & ouml;dinger equation that provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the system's quantum properties. To characterize the nonclassical features of the radiation field, we examine photon number distribution, second-order correlation function $ g<^>2(0) $ g2(0), squeezing properties, and Mandel's $ Q_M $ QM parameter. These properties reveal significant insights into the quantum statistical behaviour of the field and its deviation from classicality under different interaction regimes. In addition, we quantify the atom-atom entanglement using linear entropy which captures the mixedness of the atomic subsystem and elucidates the interplay between atom-atom interactions. The results highlight the crucial role of nonlinear interactions and the Stark shift in shaping the quantum correlations and nonclassical phenomena of the system.

TI Global Synthesis of CNOT Circuits with Holes
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 20th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 17-21, 2023
CL Paris, FRANCE
AB A common approach to quantum circuit transformation is to use the properties of a specific gate set to create an efficient representation of a given circuit's unitary, such as a parity matrix or stabiliser tableau, and then resynthesise an improved circuit, e.g. with fewer gates or respecting connectivity constraints. Since these methods rely on a restricted gate set, generalisation to arbitrary circuits usually involves slicing the circuit into pieces that can be resynthesised and working with these separately. The choices made about what gates should go into each slice can have a major effect on the performance of the resynthesis. In this paper we propose an alternative approach to generalising these resynthesis algorithms to general quantum circuits. Instead of cutting the circuit into slices, we "cut out" the gates we can't resynthesise leaving holes in our quantum circuit. The result is a second order process called a quantum comb, which can be resynthesised directly. We apply this idea to the RowCol algorithm, which resynthesises CNOT circuits for topologically constrained hardware, explaining how we were able to extend it to work for quantum combs. We then compare the generalisation of RowCol using our method to the naive "slice and build" method empirically on a variety of circuit sizes and hardware topologies. Finally, we outline how quantum combs could be used to help generalise other resynthesis algorithms.

TI Shortcuts to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm intending to find the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. Theoretically, QAOA can obtain the approximate solution if the quantum circuit is deep enough. Actually, the performance of QAOA decreases practically if the quantum circuit is deep since near-term devices are not noise free, and the errors caused by noise accumulate as the quantum circuit increases. In order to reduce the depth of quantum circuits, we propose an ansatz dubbed as "Shortcuts to QAOA" (S-QAOA), S-QAOA provides shortcuts to the ground state of the target Hamiltonian by including more two-body interactions and releasing the parameter freedoms. To be specific, besides the existing ZZ interaction in the QAOA ansatz, other two-body interactions are introduced in the S-QAOA ansatz such that the approximate solutions could be obtained with smaller circuit depth. Considering the Max-Cut problem and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, numerically computation shows the YY interaction has the best performance. The reason for this might arise from the counterdiabatic effect generated by YY interaction. On top of this, we release the freedom of parameters of two-body interactions, which a priori do not necessarily have to be fully identical, and numerical results show that it is worth paying the extra cost of having more parameter freedom since one has a greater improvement on success rate.

TI Different types of coherence: Young-type interference versus Dicke
   superradiance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Dicke superradiance, i.e., the enhanced spontaneous emission of coherent radiation, is often attributed to radiation emitted by synchronized dipoles coherently oscillating in phase. At the same time, Dicke derived superradiance assuming atoms in entangled Dicke states which do not display any dipole moment. To shed light on this apparent paradox, we study the intensity distribution arising from two identical two-level atoms prepared either in an entangled Dicke state or in a separable atomic state with a nonvanishing dipole moment. We find that the two configurations produce similar far-field intensity patterns, although they stem from fundamentally distinct types of coherence: while in the second case the atoms display coherence among the individual particles, leading to Young-type interference like that known from classical dipoles, atoms in Dicke states possess collective quantum coherence stemming from entanglement and quantum correlations of the state, leading to an interference pattern resulting from enhanced spontaneous emission. This demonstrates that the radiation generated by synchronized dipoles and Dicke superradiance-even if they do produce the same interference pattern-are fundamentally distinct phenomena and have to be interpreted in different ways.

TI Fröhlich versus Bose-Einstein condensation in pumped bosonic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Magnon condensation, which emerges in pumped bosonic systems at room temperature, continues to garner great interest for its long-lived coherence. While traditionally formulated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensation, which typically occurs at ultralow temperatures, it could potentially also be explained by Fr & ouml;hlich condensation, a hypothesis of Bose-Einstein-like condensation in living systems at ambient temperatures. This prompts general questions relating to fundamental differences between coherence phenomena in open and isolated quantum systems. To that end, we introduce a simple model of bosonic condensation in an open quantum system (OQS) formulation, wherein bosons dissipatively interact with an oscillator (phonon) bath. Our derived equations of motion for expected boson occupations turn out to be similar in form to the rate equations governing Fr & ouml;hlich condensation. Provided that specific system parameters result in correlations that amplify or diminish the condensation effects, we thereby posit that our treatment offers a better description of high-temperature condensation compared to traditional formulations obtained using equilibrium thermodynamics. By comparing our OQS derivation with the original uncorrelated and previous semiclassical rate equations, we furthermore highlight how both classical anticorrelations and quantum correlations alter the bosonic occupation distribution.

TI Perspective on Many-Body Methods for Molecular Polaritonic Systems
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Recent advances in strong light-matter interactions have revealed a wealth of new physical phenomena in molecules embedded in optical cavities, including modified chemical reactivity, altered excitation spectra, and novel quantum correlations. To describe these effects from first-principles, the field of ab initio quantum electrodynamics (QED) has emerged as a compelling extension of quantum chemistry that treats electronic and photonic degrees of freedom on equal footing. In this Perspective, we review the growing landscape of many-body QED methods, including Hartree-Fock, density functional theory (QEDFT), time-dependent DFT (QED-TDDFT), configuration interaction (QED-CI), complete active space (QED-CASSCF), coupled cluster (QED-CC), quantum Monte Carlo (QED-QMC), and density matrix renormalization group (QED-DMRG), highlighting recent developments and implementations. We further explore real-time methods, gradient and Hessian formalisms, and the integration of nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics. Applications range from benchmark simulations of polaritonic chemistry to quantum simulations on emerging quantum hardware. We conclude by outlining future directions for theory development and interdisciplinary efforts at the interface of quantum chemistry, condensed matter, and quantum optics.

TI Entropy production and the role of correlations in quantum Brownian
   motion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We perform a study on quantum entropy production, different kinds of correlations, and their interplay in the driven Caldeira-Leggett model of quantum Brownian motion. The model, taken with a large but finite number of bath modes, is exactly solvable, and the assumption of a Gaussian initial state leads to an efficient numerical simulation of all desired observables in a wide range of model parameters. Our paper is composed of three main parts. We first compare two popular definitions of entropy production, namely, the standard weak-coupling formulation originally proposed by Spohn [J. Math. Phys. 19, 1227 (1978)] and later on extended to the driven case by Deffner and Lutz [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 140404 (2011)], and the always-positive expression introduced by Esposito, Lindenberg and van den Broeck [New J. Phys. 12, 013013 (2010)], which relies on the knowledge of the evolution of the bath. As a second study, we explore the decomposition of the Esposito et al. entropy production into system-environment and intraenvironment correlations for different ranges of couplings and temperatures. Lastly, we examine the evolution of quantum correlations between the system and the environment, measuring entanglement through logarithmic negativity.

TI On the condition of Setting Independence
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB Quantum mechanics predicts non-local correlations in spatially extended entangled quantum systems, and these correlations are empirically very well confirmed. This raises philosophical questions of how nature could be that way, prompting the study of purported completions of quantum mechanics by hidden variables. Bell-type theorems connect assumptions about hidden variables with empirical predictions for the outcome of quantum correlation experiments. From among these assumptions, the Setting Independence assumption has received the least formal attention. Its violation is, however, central in the recent discussion about super-deterministic models for quantum correlation experiments. In this paper, we focus on the non-local modal correlations in the GHZ experiment. We model the introduction of hidden variables in the form of instruction sets via structure extensions in the framework of Branching Space-Times. This framework allows us to show in formal detail how the introduction of non-contextual instruction sets results in a specific violation of Setting Independence; a similar result is derived for contextual instruction sets. Our discussion provides additional reasons for foregoing the introduction of local hidden variables, and for accepting non-local quantum correlations as a resource provided by nature.

TI Evaluating the performance of classical, quantum, and hybrid quantum
   neural networks in solving differential equations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the performance of classical, quantum, and hybrid quantum neural networks in solving partial differential equations through both supervised and unsupervised learning. The performance of each type of network is evaluated in solving the damped harmonic oscillator, the Einstein field equations, and the time-independent Schr & ouml;dinger equation. We employed physics-informed supervised neural networks to solve the damped harmonic oscillator and the Einstein field equations, and developed an unsupervised neural network algorithm based on the shooting method for the time-independent Schr & ouml;dinger equation. For the quantum neural networks, we introduced three variational parameterized quantum feature maps and two quantum circuits for the hybrid quantum neural networks. Each network was examined in three different configurations and evaluated across multiple random seeds. Under favorable parameter initializations, the hybrid quantum neural networks achieve higher accuracy than the classical neural networks in most cases across all tested problems. In contrast, the quantum neural networks attain the best accuracy for the damped harmonic oscillator and also perform well in the Schr & ouml;dinger equation problem. Both the quantum and the hybrid quantum neural networks require fewer parameters than the classical neural networks and converge faster during optimization. All three models exhibit sensitivity to parameter initialization, with the quantum neural networks displaying the highest variability across different problems.

TI Spin-Mixing Enhanced Proximity Effect in Aluminum-Based
   Superconductor-Semiconductor Hybrids
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB In superconducting quantum circuits, aluminum is one of the most widely used materials. It is currently also the superconductor of choice for the development of topological qubits. However, aluminum-based devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. Herein, this limitation is resolved by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g., platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a factor of two. Using tunnel junctions, it is shown that the increased field resilience originates from spin-orbit scattering introduced by Pt. This property is exploited in the context of the superconducting proximity effect in semiconductor-superconductor hybrids, where it is shown that InSb nanowires strongly coupled to Al/Pt films can maintain superconductivity up to 7 T. The two-electron charging effect is shown to be robust against the presence of heavy adatoms. Additionally, non-local spectroscopy is used in a three-terminal geometry to probe the bulk of hybrid devices, showing that it remains free of sub-gap states. Finally, it is demonstrated that proximitized semiconductor states maintain their ability to Zeeman-split in an applied magnetic field. Combined with the chemical stability and well-known fabrication routes of aluminum, Al/Pt emerges as the natural successor to Al-based systems and is a compelling alternative to other superconductors, whenever high-field resilience is required.

TI Tensor-Train Thermo-Field Memory Kernels for Generalized Quantum Master
   Equations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The generalized quantum master equation (GQME) approach provides a rigorous framework for deriving the exact equation of motion for any subset of electronic reduced density matrix elements (e.g., the diagonal elements). In the context of electronic dynamics, the memory kernel and inhomogeneous term of the GQME introduce the implicit coupling to nuclear motion and dynamics of electronic density matrix elements that are projected out (e.g., the off-diagonal elements), allowing for efficient quantum dynamics simulations. Here, we focus on benchmark quantum simulations of electronic dynamics in a spin-boson model system described by various types of GQMEs. Exact memory kernels and inhomogeneous terms are obtained from short-time quantum-mechanically exact tensor-train thermofield dynamics (TT-TFD) simulations and are compared with those obtained from an approximate linearized semiclassical method, allowing for assessment of the accuracy of these approximate memory kernels and inhomogeneous terms. Moreover, we have analyzed the computational cost of the full and reduced-dimensionality GQMEs. The scaling of the computational cost is dependent on several factors, sometimes with opposite scaling trends. The TT-TFD memory kernels can provide insights on the main sources of inaccuracies of GQME approaches when combined with approximate input methods and pave the road for the development of quantum circuits that implement GQMEs on digital quantum computers.

TI Activation of post-quantum steering
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.

TI Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and
   multiple-charge scenario
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved quantities-dubbed charges-other than energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of nonenergy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.

TI Computation of Green's function by local variational quantum compilation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Computation of the Green's function is crucial to study the properties of quantum many-body systems such as strongly correlated systems. Although the high-precision calculation of the Green's function is a notoriously challenging task on classical computers, the development of quantum computers may enable us to compute the Green's function with high accuracy even for classically-intractable large-scale systems. Here, we propose an efficient method to compute the real-time Green's function based on the local variational quantum compilation (LVQC) algorithm, which simulates the time evolution of a large-scale quantum system using a low-depth quantum circuit constructed through optimization on a smaller-size subsystem. Our method requires shallow quantum circuits to calculate the Green's function and can be utilized on both near-term noisy intermediate-scale and long-term fault-tolerant quantum computers depending on the computational resources we have. We perform a numerical simulation of the Green's function for the one-and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model up to 4 x 4 sites lattice (32 qubits) and demonstrate the validity of our protocol compared to a standard method based on the Trotter decomposition. We finally present a detailed estimation of the gate count for the large-scale Fermi-Hubbard model, which also illustrates the advantage of our method over the Trotter decomposition.

TI Single-electron charge transfer into putative Majorana and trivial modes
   in individual vortices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Majorana bound states are an elusive but promising platform for future topological quantum computation. Here, the authors use local shot noise spectroscopy to determine the nature of charge transfer into zero-energy bound states in superconducting vortices and rule out the presence of impurity states.
   Majorana bound states are putative collective excitations in solids that exhibit the self-conjugate property of Majorana fermions-they are their own antiparticles. In iron-based superconductors, zero-energy states in vortices have been reported as potential Majorana bound states, but the evidence remains controversial. Here, we use scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy to study the tunneling process into vortex bound states in the conventional superconductor NbSe2, and in the putative Majorana platform FeTe0.55Se0.45. We find that tunneling into vortex bound states in both cases exhibits charge transfer of a single electron charge. Our data for the zero-energy bound states in FeTe0.55Se0.45 exclude the possibility of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and are consistent with both Majorana bound states and trivial vortex bound states. Our results open an avenue for investigating the exotic states in vortex cores and for future Majorana devices, although further theoretical investigations involving charge dynamics and superconducting tips are necessary.

TI Solvothermal Synthesis of Rare Earth Bisphthalocyanines
SO MOLECULES
AB Rare earth bisphthalocyanines (MPc2) are of particular interest because of their behavior as single-molecular magnets, which makes them suitable for applications in molecular spintronics, high-density data storage and quantum computation. Nevertheless, MPc2 are not commercially available, and the synthesis routes are mainly focused on obtaining substituted phthalocyanines. Two preparation routes depend on the precursor: synthesis from phthalonitrile (PN) and the metalation of free or dilithium phthalocyanine (H2Pc and Li2Pc). In both options, byproducts such as free-base phthalocyanine and in the first route additional PN oligomers are generated, which influence the MPc2 yield. There are three preparation methods for these routes: heating, microwave radiation and reflux. In this research, solvothermal synthesis was applied as a new approach to prepare yttrium, lanthanum, gadolinium and terbium unsubstituted bisphthalocyanines using Li2Pc and the rare earth(III) acetylacetonates. Purification by sublimation gave high product yields compared to those reported, namely 68% for YPc2, 43% for LaPc2, 63% for GdPc2 and 62% for TbPc2, without any detectable presence of H2Pc. Characterization by infrared, Raman, ultraviolet-visible and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis revealed the main featuresof the four bisphthalocyanines, indicating the success of the synthesis of the complexes.

TI Taking a look accurately at the alteration of interfacial asphaltene
   film exposed to the ionic surfactants as demulsifiers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The water droplets surrounded by a rigid interfacial asphaltene (ASP) film is one of the major setbacks in the petroleum industry. In this study, the properties of the interfacial ASP films around water droplets exposed to ionic surfactants as demulsifier were investigated. According to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the anionic surfactants are more effective than the cationic surfactant in the demulsification process since the anionic surfactants have the exact desire to localize not only near the ASP molecules but also near the water molecules. It has been found that it is likely to cause film changes and ruptures. Also, the MD simulation results for the desired surfactant, anionic surfactant, demonstrated that an increase in the surfactant concentration had an adverse effect on the system by hindering the change in the interfacial film. The increase in the temperature along with the enhancement in the adsorption rate of the surfactant results in the better performance of the demulsifier. Taking the MD and quantum results into account, the film deformation is a decisive factor in demulsification. The quantum computation has indicated that the electrostatic interactions play a significant role in selecting the attraction position and adsorption energy of the surfactant molecules.

TI Pressure-induced superconductivity in Bi4(I1-x
   Br x )4 crystals grown by chemical
   vapor transport and flux methods
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Achieving superconductivity in topological materials is thought as a promising route for realizing topological superconductivity, which may provide potential applications to quantum computation. Previously, rich superconducting phases have been reported in the pressurized Bi4I4 and Bi4Br4 crystals which belong to an interesting quasi-one-dimensional topological system. In this work, we have performed a high-pressure study on some Bi-4(I1-x Br (x) )(4) crystals grown by two different methods. Remarkably, crystals grown by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method and the self-flux method show clearly different pressure effects. In the CVT-grown crystals, only one superconducting transition is observed, while three superconducting transitions can be detected in crystals grown by the flux method. Through comparisons of the pressure-dependent phase diagrams and the upper critical field behaviors in the two kinds of crystals, the higher superconducting transition (>6 K) in the flux-grown crystals is suggested to come from the residual Bi. High-pressure Raman spectroscopy measurements on both kinds of crystals have confirmed the occurrence of a similar structural transition around 10 GPa in Br-doped samples. Overall, our data could be helpful for identifying the intrinsic pressure-induced superconductivity in various Bi-based materials.

TI Carbon Nanodots Memristor: An Emerging Candidate toward Artificial
   Biosynapse and Human Sensory Perception System
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB In the era of big data and artificial intelligence (AI), advanced data storage and processing technologies are in urgent demand. The innovative neuromorphic algorithm and hardware based on memristor devices hold a promise to break the von Neumann bottleneck. In recent years, carbon nanodots (CDs) have emerged as a new class of nano-carbon materials, which have attracted widespread attention in the applications of chemical sensors, bioimaging, and memristors. The focus of this review is to summarize the main advances of CDs-based memristors, and their state-of-the-art applications in artificial synapses, neuromorphic computing, and human sensory perception systems. The first step is to systematically introduce the synthetic methods of CDs and their derivatives, providing instructive guidance to prepare high-quality CDs with desired properties. Then, the structure-property relationship and resistive switching mechanism of CDs-based memristors are discussed in depth. The current challenges and prospects of memristor-based artificial synapses and neuromorphic computing are also presented. Moreover, this review outlines some promising application scenarios of CDs-based memristors, including neuromorphic sensors and vision, low-energy quantum computation, and human-machine collaboration.

TI Robust topological state against magnetic impurities observed in the
   superconductor PbTaSe2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Magnetic impurities deposited on topological superconductor candidate PbTaSe2 can introduce a nonsplitting zero-energy state inside the superconducting gap, which has been proposed as a field-free platform for topological zero modes. However, it is still unclear how robust the topological state in PbTaSe2 is against magnetic impurities, which is related to the topological nature of the zero-energy state as well as its potential for quantum computation. In this paper, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to study the topological surface state in the normal state of PbTaSe2 under the perturbation of magnetic impurities. We visualize the quasiparticle interference (QPI) arising from the topological surface state. We then deposit Fe impurities on the surface to form atomic Fe adatoms. We find that each Fe adatom sits at a unique interstitial position on the surface and features a local state at high energies, both of which are consistent with our first-principles calculation that further reveals its large magnetic moment. Our systematic Fe deposition and subsequent measurements show that the arclike QPI pattern at the Fermi energy is robust with up to 3% Fe coverage where the atomic nature of Fe adatoms still holds. Our results provide evidence that the topological surface state at the Fermi energy in PbTaSe2 is robust against dilute magnetic impurities.
