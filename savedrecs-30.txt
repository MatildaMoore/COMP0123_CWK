TI Experimental analysis of condensation-pump dilution refrigerators
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Subkelvin refrigeration is necessary for many frontier research fields such as condensed-matter physics, astronomical observation, and quantum computing. Dilution refrigeration utilizes the entropy increase of 3He atoms when they flow from the concentrated phase to dilute phase to provide cooling, and has the advantages of continuous operation, large cooling power and no electromagnetic interference. It is the most widely used method among subkelvin refrigeration at present. For research scenarios requiring small cooling powers, the condensation-pump dilution refrigerator utilizes a condensation pump to achieve cold cycle of 3He, with no need of complex ambient pump systems or gas circuits, and has become a new research topic because of its compact structure, convenient operation and low cost. A condensation-pump dilution refrigerator is built and investigated in this work. The refrigerator consists of a mixing chamber, a continuous tube-in-tube heat exchanger, a still, and a condensation pump, and it is precooled by a GM-type pulse tube cryocooler below 4 K and an adsorption refrigerator below 400 mK. The 3He evaporates from the still, condenses in the condensation pump and provides cooling in the mixing chamber after being precooled in the heat exchanger. By means of the multi-temperature measuring system, the cold cycle of the dilution refrigerator can be summarized as three stages: precooling by the adsorption refrigerator, cycle start-up, and continuous dilution cooling. The operating characteristics of the system are analyzed. The experiments showed that the lowest noload temperature reached 108 mK when the condenser temperature was 378 mK. Meanwhile, the temperature oscillation appeared, and the possible reasons are analyzed. In the future, the system performance will be improved by 1) adjusting the spiral mode and position of the continuous tube-in-tube heat exchanger and 2) increasing the heat transfer area between the cold plate and the fluid in the mixing chamber to reduce the fluid-solid temperature difference. The refrigerator introduced in this work can easily expand many existing cryogenic platforms working at higher temperatures, and effectively support developments of high-end equipment.

TI Real-Time Evolution for Ultracompact Hamiltonian Eigenstates on
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this work we present a detailed analysis of variational quantum phase estimation (VQPE), a method based on real-time evolution for ground- and excited-state estimation on near-term hardware. We derive the theoretical ground on which the approach stands, and demonstrate that it provides one of the most compact variational expansions to date for solving strongly correlated Hamiltonians, when starting from an appropriate reference state. At the center of VQPE lies a set of equations, with a simple geometrical interpretation, which provides conditions for the time evolution grid in order to decouple eigenstates out of the set of time-evolved expansion states, and connects the method to the classical filter-diagonalization algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce what we call the unitary formulation of VQPE, in which the number of matrix elements that need to be measured scales linearly with the number of expansion states, and we provide an analysis of the effects of noise that substantially improves previous considerations. The unitary formulation allows for a direct comparison to iterative phase estimation. Our results mark VQPE as both a natural and highly efficient quantum algorithm for ground- and excited-state calculations of general manybody systems. We demonstrate a hardware implementation of VQPE for the transverse field Ising model. Furthermore, we illustrate its power on a paradigmatic example of strong correlation (Cr-2 in the def2-SVP basis set), and show that it is possible to reach chemical accuracy with as few as approximately 50 time steps.

TI A high-capacity 1-K cryogenic system pre-cooled by pulse tube cryocooler
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB A 1-K cryogenic system can provide a stable and necessary low-temperature environment for some fields such as quantum computing, condensed matter physics research, and cryogenic scientific instruments. Specifically, in the field of basic research, 1 K is an ideal condition for studying quantum phenomena in low-temperature physics, such as quantum Hall effect and topological phase transition; in the field of technical applications, 1 K is a necessary condition for some quantum devices, such as superconducting quantum interferometers and single-photon detectors, to achieve high-sensitivity operation; in the field of ultra-low temperature technology, 1 K is the pre-cooling stage of refrigeration technologies, such as dilution refrigerators, and is also the basis for further achieving mK temperature ranges and lower temperatures. At present, in most of domestic 1-K systems, GM (Gifford-McMahon) cryocoolers are used for pre-cooling. These systems encounter some difficulties in achieving lower vibration control, lower electrical noise interference, lower pre-cooling temperature, and higher liquefaction efficiency. The 1-K systems based on pulse tube cryocoolers pre-cooling have inherent advantages in solving these problems. In this work, a 4-K GM-type pulse tube cryocooler is first developed by using a domestic helium compressor and a developed rotary valve, and the cold-end heat exchanger and the room-temperature phase shifters are redesigned in order to achieve a minimum cooling temperature of 2.14 K, and provide 1.5 W at 4.2 K and 45 W at 45 K cooling capacity simultaneously. With the home-made pulse tube cryocooler as the pre-cooling stage, a 1-K cryogenic system is further constructed. By designing key components such as JT flow resistance, combined thermal switch, and anti-superflow structure, a minimum cooling temperature of 1.1 K is achieved, with a cooling capacity of 100 mW at 1.6 K. This study lays an important foundation for subsequently developing dilution refrigerators with larger cooling capacity.

AB Cryptographic random number generation is critical for any quantum-safe encryption. Based on the natural uncertainty of some quantum processes, a variety of quantum random number generators, or QRNGs, have been created with physical quantum processes. These typically generate random numbers with good unpredictable randomness. Of course, physical QRNGs are costic and require physical integrations with computing systems. This paper proposes a pseudo quantum random number generator with a quantum algorithm called a quantum permutation pad, or QPP, leveraging the high entropy of quantum permutation space for its bijective transformation. Unlike Boolean algebra, where the size of information space is 2(n) for an n-bit system, an n-bit quantum permutation space consists of 2(n)! quantum permutation matrices, representing all quantum permutation gates over an n-bit computational basis. This permutation space holds an equivalent Shannon information entropy of log(2)(2(n)!). A QPP can be used to create a pseudo-QRNG or pQRNG capable of integration with any classical computing system, or directly with any application, for good-quality deterministic random number generation. Using a QPP pad with 64 8-bit permuation matrices, a pQRNG holds 107,776 bits of entropy for pseudo-random number generation, compared with 4,096 bits of entropy in Linux/dev/random. It can be used as a deterministic PRNG or as an entropy booster for other PRNGs. It can also be used as a whitening algorithm for any hardware random number generator, including QRNGs, without discarding physical bias bits.

TI Composite Qdrift-product formulas for quantum and classical simulations
   in real and imaginary time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent study has shown that it can be advantageous to implement a composite channel that partitions the Hamiltonian H for a given simulation problem into subsets A and B such that H = A + B, where the terms in A are simulated with a Trotter-Suzuki channel and the B terms are randomly sampled via the Qdrift algorithm. Here we extend Qdrift and composite product formulas to imaginary time, formulating candidate classical algorithms for quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We upper bound the induced Schatten-1 -> 1 norm on both imaginarytime Qdrift and composite channels. Another recent result demonstrated that simulations of lattice Hamiltonians containing geometrically local interactions can be improved using a Lieb-Robinson argument to decompose H into subsets that contain only terms supported on that subset of the lattice. Here, we provide a quantum algorithm by unifying this result with the composite approach into "local composite channels" and we upper bound the diamond distance. We provide exact numerical simulations of algorithmic cost by counting the number of gates of the form e(-iHjt) and e(-Hj beta) to meet a certain error tolerance epsilon. In doing so, we optimize the partitioning into sets A and B using gradient boosted tree models from machine learning. These numerical studies are important given that product formulas have been historically known to outperform analytic upper bounds. We show constant factor advantages for a variety of interesting Hamiltonians, the maximum of which is a approximate to 20-fold speedup that occurs in the simulation of Jellium.

TI Research progress of ultracold ion source
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Nanobeam is an advanced technology for preparing charged ion beams with spot diameters on a nanometer scale, and mainly used for high-resolution and high-precision ion beam analysis, ion beam fabrication and ion beam material modification research. The nanobeam devices play an important role in realizing material analysis, micro/nano fabrication, microelectronic device manufacturing and quantum computing. The high-quality ion source is one of the key components of nanobeam device, the performance of which directly affects the resolution and precision of the nanobeam system. However, the traditional ion source used in this system is limited to available ionic species, large energy spread and complex structure. These issues hinder their ability to meet emerging application scenarios that require multi-ion types and high resolution. This emphasizes the importance of creating newion sources as soon as possible.
   With the development of laser cooling technology, ultracold ions with temperatures in the range of mK or even mu K can be obtained based on photoionization of cold atoms and laser cooling of ions. The typical characteristics of low temperature and easy operation greatly promote the emergence of ultracold ion sources. The ultracold ions exhibit extremely small transverse velocity divergence, which can significantly enhance the brightness and emittance quality parameters of the ion source, bringing great opportunities for innovating nano-ion beam technology. Therefore, the research on ultracold ion sources is of great significance for achieving high-quality ion sources with higher brightness, smaller size, lower energy dispersion, more diverse ion species, and simplified structure. Here, we introduce the important achievements in basic research and application technology development of magneto-optical trap ion sources, cold atomic beam ion sources, and ultracold single ion sources from the aspects of preparation principles, generation methods, and typical applications, and review the recent research progress of ultracold ion sources. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future development and application prospects of ultracold ion sources.

TI Novel Quantum-Integrated CNN Model for Improved Human Activity
   Recognition in Smart Surveillance
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB Human activity recognition (HAR) is crucial in fields like robotics, surveillance, and healthcare, enabling systems to understand and respond to human actions. Current models often struggle with complex datasets, making accurate recognition challenging. This study proposes a quantum-integrated Convolutional Neural Network (QI-CNN) to enhance HAR performance. The traditional models demonstrate weak performance in transferring learned knowledge between diverse complex data collections, including D3D-HOI and Sysu 3D HOI. HAR requires better extraction models and techniques that must address current challenges to achieve improved accuracy and scalability. The model aims to enhance HAR task performance by combining quantum computing components with classical CNN approaches. The framework begins with bilateral filter (BF) enhancement of images and then implements multi-object tracking (MOT) in conjunction with felzenszwalb superpixel segmentation for object detection and segmentation. The watershed algorithm refines the united superpixels to create more accurate object boundary definitions. The model combination of histogram of oriented gradients (HoG) and Global Image Semantic Texture (GIST) descriptors alongside a new approach to extract 23-joint keypoints by employing relative joint angles and joint proximity measures. A fuzzy optimization process optimizes features that originated from the extraction phase. Our approach achieves 93.02% accuracy on the D3D-HOI dataset and 97.38% on the Sysu 3D HOI dataset Our approach achieves 93.02% accuracy on the D3D-HOI dataset and 97.38% on the Sysu 3D HOI dataset. Averaging across all classes, the proposed model yields 93.3% precision, 92.6% recall, 92.3% F1-score, 89.1% specificity, an False Positive Rate (FPR) of 10.9% and a mean log-loss of 0.134 on the D3D-HOI dataset, while on the Sysu 3D HOI dataset the corresponding values are 98.4% precision, 98.6% recall, 98.4% F1-score, 99.0% specificity, 1.0% FPR and a log-loss of 0.058. These results demonstrate that the quantum integrated CNN significantly improves feature extraction and model optimisation.

TI A Note on the Reality of Incomputable Real Numbers and Its Systemic
   Significance
SO SYSTEMS
AB We discuss mathematical and physical arguments contrasting continuous and discrete, limitless discretization as arbitrary granularity. In this regard, we focus on Incomputable (lacking an algorithm that computes in finite time) Real Numbers (IRNs). We consider how, for measurements, the usual approach to dealing with IRNs is to approximate to avoid the need for more detailed, unrealistic surveys. In this regard, we contrast effective computation and emergent computation. Furthermore, we consider the alternative option of taking into account the properties of the decimal part of IRNs, such as the occurrence, distribution, combinations, quasi-periodicities, and other contextual properties, e.g., topological. For instance, in correspondence with chaotic behaviors, quasi-periodic solutions, quasi-systems, uniqueness, and singularities, non-computability represents and corresponds to theoretically incomplete properties of the processes of complexity, such as emergence and quantum-like properties. We elaborate upon cases of equivalences and symmetries, characterizing complexity and infiniteness as corresponding to the usage of multiple non-equivalent models that are constructively and theoretically incomplete due to the non-exhaustive nature of the multiplicity of complexity. Finally, we detail alternative computational approaches, such as hypercomputation, natural computing, quantum computing, and analog and hybrid computing. The reality of IRNs is considered to represent the theoretical incompleteness of complex phenomena taking place through collapse from equivalences and symmetries. A world of precise finite values, even if approximated, is assumed to have dynamics that are zippable in analytical formulae and to be computable and symbolically representable in the way it functions. A world of arbitrary precise infinite values with dynamics that are non-zippable in analytical formulae, non-computable, and, for instance, sub-symbolically representable, is assumed to be almost compatible with the coherence of emergence. The real world is assumed to be a continuous combination of the two-functioning and emergent-where the second dominates and is the norm, and the first is the locus of primarily epistemic extracts. Research on IRNs should focus on properties representing and corresponding to those that are detectable in real, even if extreme, phenomena, such as emergence and quantum phenomena.

TI High-throughput theoretical exploration of multifunctional planar
   MBenes: Magnetism, topology, superconductivity, and anode applications
SO ADVANCED POWDER MATERIALS
AB Pursuing new two-dimensional (2D) materials has been a hot topic in materials science, driven by their potential for diverse applications. Recent research has unveiled stable planar hypercoordinate motifs with unconventional geometric arrangements and bonding patterns that facilitate the synthesis of new 2D materials with diverse applications. Among these, yet the design of 2D transition metal systems featuring planar pentacoordinate boron (ppB) is particularly intriguing. Here we address this gap by proposing a novel family of transition metal boride monolayers (MBenes) composed of ppB and heptacoordinate M motifs. The novelty of our MBenes stems from their distinct atomic arrangements and bonding configurations, setting them apart from traditional 2D materials. High-throughput calculations identified 10 stable MBenes (with the stoichiometry of MB, M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Pd, Ag, Pt, Au) with exceptional thermodynamic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stabilities attributed to strong B-B covalent bonds and M-B ionic interactions. Notably, five of these MBenes (M = Ni, Pd, Pt, Ag, Au) hold high promise as topological superconducting materials with superconducting transition temperatures of 2.4-5.2 K. This discovery not only enriches the family of topological superconducting materials but also opens new avenues for quantum device development. Meanwhile, FeB monolayer exhibits robust ferromagnetic properties with a high Curie temperature of similar to 750 K, which is particularly significant for spintronics applications. In addition, NiB and CuB MBenes demonstrate extremely low sodium diffusion barriers (about 30 and 90 meV) and high sodium storage capacities (788 and 734 mAh g(-1), respectively), making them promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). This study expands the selection of electrode materials for SIBs and mitigates some existing limitations in battery technology. Overall, these findings underscore the multifunctional potential of MBenes, positioning them as transformative materials for quantum computing, spintronics, and energy storage applications.

TI ZnO quantum dot-molecule conjugates: Chemical interactions, charge
   dynamics, and spin polarization
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Conjugates between molecules and quantum dots (QDs) have been explored for a range of potential applications from photocatalysis and photovoltaics to quantum information science technologies. A particularly ubiquitous material in many of these applications are ZnO QDs since they can accept and transport electrons and can also act as hosts for unique spin states. Conjugates between molecular light absorbers and ZnO QDs have been explored for decades as components in dye-sensitized solar cells. Recently, these materials have also attracted interest for their ability to produce spin-polarized states upon photoexcitation. The current paper employs a series of light absorbing perylene molecules with different ZnO QD sizes to explore key features of these QD-molecule conjugates: (1) chemical interactions, (2) charge dynamics, and (3) spin polarization. The chemical interactions between the molecules and QDs are determined with binding equilibria and reveal dramatic impact of ligand size. The charge transfer dynamics from photoexcited perylenes to ZnO QDs were found to depend exponentially on the linker length. Finally, time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance experiments reveal that these conjugates generate spin-polarized states in the form of radical pairs and triplets. These spin states hold promise as potential qubits and also offer an avenue to efficiently sensitize molecular triplets.

TI Second quantization of many-body dispersion interactions for chemical
   and biological systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The many-body dispersion (MBD) framework is a successful approach for modeling the long-range electronic correlation energy and optical response of systems with thousands of atoms. Inspired by field theory, here we develop a second-quantized MBD formalism (SQ-MBD) that recasts a system of atomic quantum Drude oscillators in a Fock-space representation. SQ-MBD provides: (i) tools for projecting observables (interaction energy, transition multipoles, polarizability tensors) on coarse-grained representations of the atomistic system ranging from single atoms to large structural motifs, (ii) a quantum-information framework to analyze correlations and (non)separability among fragments in a given molecular complex, and (iii) a path toward the applicability of the MBD framework to molecular complexes with even larger number of atoms. The SQ-MBD approach offers conceptual insights into quantum fluctuations in molecular systems and enables direct coupling of collective plasmon-like MBD degrees of freedom with arbitrary environments, providing a tractable computational framework to treat dispersion interactions and polarization response in intricate systems.

TI Single-Photon Counting with Semiconductor Resonant Tunneling Devices
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Optical quantum information science and technologies require the capability to generate, control, and detect single or multiple quanta of light. The need to detect individual photons has motivated the development of a variety of novel and refined single-photon detectors (SPDs) with enhanced detector performance. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are the top-performer in this field, but alternative promising and innovative devices are emerging. In this review article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of one such alternative device capable of single-photon counting: the resonant tunneling diode (RTD) single-photon detector. Due to their peculiar photodetection mechanism and current-voltage characteristic with a region of negative differential conductance, RTD single-photon detectors provide, theoretically, several advantages over conventional SPDs, such as an inherently deadtime-free photon-number resolution at elevated temperatures, while offering low dark counts, a low timing jitter, and multiple photon detection modes. This review article brings together our previous studies and current experimental results. We focus on the current limitations of RTD-SPDs and provide detailed design and parameter variations to be potentially employed in next-generation RTD-SPD to improve the figure of merits of these alternative single-photon counting devices. The single-photon detection capability of RTDs without quantum dots is shown.

TI Uncovering intramolecular singlet fission at the root of the dual
   fluorescence of 1,4-bis(p-nitro-β-styryl)benzene in solution
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The exploration of singlet fission (SF) promises a pathway to many leaps forward including more efficient solar energy extraction and, more recently, organic-based quantum computing. Our study, through a joint experimental and computational approach, revolves around 1,4-bis(p-nitro-beta-styryl)benzene (1) as the smallest molecule where the intramolecular transformation of the initially allowed 11Bu singlet state to the 21Ag excited state stops being ordinary internal conversion and becomes the first half of the SF process. Herein, we experimentally observe explicit breaking of the Kasha rule. Using femtosecond broadband fluorescence upconversion, we measure a dual fluorescence of 1 in solution from its two lowest singlet excited states of different symmetry. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) and fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy of 1 in toluene reveal ultrafast (17 +/- 5 ps), almost quantitative interconversion between 11B and 21A states. A sensitization bracketing experiment with ns-TA is used to analyze the T1 state of 1. Employing high-level ab initio extended multi-configuration quasi-degenerate 2nd-order perturbation theory (XMCQDPT2) calculations, we accurately model ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces. 11B states are predominantly described by ordinary HOMO-LUMO excitation. 21A states can be projected in localized frontier molecular orbitals as an intramolecular strongly coupled triplet biexciton [1(T1T1)] with the inclusion of intramolecular charge-transfer states. Moreover, the experimental resemblance of 21A and T1 absorption is elucidated. The fluorescence temperature-dependence experiment further corroborates the XMCQDPT2 model accurate prediction of the 11B and 21A low barrier of crossing (ca. 600 cm-1). The concentration-dependent experiment shows a dramatic increase in triplet yield: up to 200% yield is obtained by ns-TA quantitative measurements. All the obtained results suggest the occurrence of an SF mechanism for the triplet production: intramolecular 1(T1T1) formation followed by intermolecular triplet separation aided by entropy and spatial separation.

TI B-Doped δ-Layers and Nanowires from Area-Selective Deposition of
   BCl3 on Si(100)
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Atomically precise, delta-doped structures forming electronic devices in Si have been routinely fabricated in recent years by using depassivation lithography in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). While H-based precursor/monatomic resist chemistries for incorporation of donor atoms have dominated these efforts, the use of halogen-based chemistries offers a promising path toward atomic-scale manufacturing of acceptor-based devices. Here, B-doped delta-layers were fabricated in Si(100) by using BCl3 as an acceptor dopant precursor in ultrahigh vacuum. Additionally, we demonstrate compatibility of BCl3 with both H and Cl monatomic resists to achieve area-selective deposition on Si. In comparison to bare Si, BCl3 adsorption selectivity ratios for H- and Cl-passivated Si were determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling (SIMS) to be 310(10):1 and 1529(5):1, respectively. STM imaging revealed that BCl3 adsorbed readily on bare Si at room temperature, with SIMS measurements indicating a peak B concentration greater than 1.2(1) x 10(21) cm(-3) with a total areal dose of 1.85(1) x 10(14) cm(-2) resulting from a 30 langmuir BCl3 dose at 150 degrees C. In addition, SIMS showed a delta-layer thickness of similar to 0.5 nm. Hall bar measurements of a similar sample were performed at 3.0 K, revealing a sheet resistance of rho(rectangle) = 1.9099(4) k Omega rectangle(-1), a hole carrier concentration of p = 1.90(2) x 10(14) cm(-2), and a hole mobility of mu = 38.0(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) without performing an incorporation anneal. Finally, 15 nm wide B d-doped nanowires were fabricated from BCl3 and were found to exhibit ohmic conduction. This validates the use of BCl3 as a dopant precursor for atomic-precision fabrication of acceptor-doped devices in Si and enables development of simultaneous n- and p-type doped bipolar devices.

TI Energy spectrum and adapting the transmission coefficient of excitons in
   core-shell GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs spherical and cubic quantum dots
SO APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING
AB This study investigates the quantum size effect on the energy spectrum of the exciton as a charge carriers confined in a core-shell of spherical and cubic GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs quantum dots with finite potential barrier specified as a function of the doping material. The calculations indicated the inverse relationship between the confinement energy values of the first three energy levels and the dot volumes. In comparing the energy levels of the two shapes, results indicated that the energy values for the first two levels of the spherical dot are lower than those for the cubic one, however for the third level the energy of the spherical dot is larger than that for the cubic dot. Tunneling effects are studied by calculating the transmission coefficient related to each energy level. The results exhibited that larger values correspond to the excitons in the second excited state and small dot volumes. Additionally, increasing the doping values enhanced decreases in the transmission coefficient values. Finally, calculation to the wavelength of the emitted light from the ground state energy level illustrated that the emitted wavelengths more precisely affected by the dot compositions. The emitted light wavelength from the ground state energy level is also examined. For x = 0.2, the emitted wavelengths range from 658.7 to 721.8 nm for spherical Quantum dots and 649.5 to 720.3 nm for cubic Quantum dots across all volumes. For x = 0.4, the emitted wavelengths fall within the yellow light range (571-586.6 nm) for small Quantum dots (125-216 nm3), the orange light range (597.9-624.8 nm) for medium-sized Quantum dots (343-1728 nm3), and the red-light range (627.4-631.2 nm) for larger Quantum dots (2197-3375 nm3). These findings contribute to the development of more efficient optoelectronic devices and quantum computing components by providing insight into quantum confinement and light emission properties in nanostructured materials.

TI Excited states of a phosphorus pair in silicon: Combining valley-orbital
   interaction and electron-electron interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Excitations of impurity complexes in semiconductors cannot only provide a route to fill the terahertz gap in optical technologies but can also play a role in connecting local quantum bits efficiently to scale up solid-state quantum-computing devices. However, taking into account both the interactions among electrons/holes bound at the impurities and the host band structures is challenging. Here we combine first-principles band-structure calculations with quantum-chemistry methodology to evaluate the ground and excited states of a pair of phosphorous (shallow donors) impurities in silicon within a single framework. We account for the electron-electron interaction within a broken-symmetry Hartree-Fock approach, followed by a time-dependent Hartree-Fock method to compute the excited states. We adopt a Hamiltonian for each conduction-band valley including an anisotropic kinetic energy term, which splits the 2p(0) and 2p(+/-) transitions of isolated donors by similar to 4 meV, in good agreement with experiments. Our single-valley calculations show the optical response is a strong function of the optical polarization and suggest the use of valley polarization to control optics and reduce oscillations in exchange interactions. When taking into account all valleys, we have included valley-orbital interactions that split the energy levels further. We find a gap opens between the 1s -> 2p transition and the low-energy charge-transfer states within is manifolds (which become optically allowed because of interdonor interactions). In contrast to the single-valley case, we also find charge-transfer excited states in the triplet sector, thanks to the extra valley degrees of freedom. Our computed charge-transfer excited states have a qualitatively correct energy as compared with previous experimental findings; additionally, we predict a set of excitations below 20 meV. Calculations based on a statistical average of nearest-neighbor pairs at different separations suggest that THz radiation could be used to excite the donor pairs spin-selectively. Our approach can readily be extended to other types of donors such as arsenic, and more widely to other semiconducting host materials such as germanium, zinc oxides, and gallium nitride, etc.

TI Opening the Black Box inside Grover's Algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Grover's algorithm is one of the primary algorithms offered as evidence that quantum computers can provide an advantage over classical computers. It involves an "oracle" (external quantum subroutine), which must be specified for a given application and whose internal structure is not part of the formal scaling of the quadratic quantum speedup guaranteed by the algorithm. Grover 's algorithm also requires exponentially p ffiffiffiffi many calls to the quantum oracle (approximately 2n calls where n is the number of qubits) to succeed, raising the question of its implementation on both noisy and error-corrected quantum computers. In this work, we construct a quantum-inspired algorithm executable on a classical computer that performs Grover's task in a linear number of calls to (simulations of) the oracle-an exponentially smaller number than Grover's algorithm-and demonstrate this algorithm explicitly for Boolean satisfiability problems. The complexity of our algorithm depends on the cost to simulate the oracle once, which may or may not be exponential, depending on its internal structure. Indeed, Grover's algorithm does not have an a priori quantum speedup as soon as one is given access to the "source code" of the oracle, which may reveal an internal structure of the problem. Our findings illustrate this point explicitly, as our algorithm exploits the structure of the quantum circuit used to program the quantum computer to speed up the search. There are still problems where Grover's algorithm would provide an asymptotic speedup if it could be run accurately for large enough sizes. Our quantum-inspired algorithm provides lower bounds, in terms of the quantum-circuit complexity, for the quantum hardware to beat classical approaches for these problems. These estimates, combined with the unfavorable scaling of the success probability of Grover's algorithm, which in the presence of noise decays as the exponential of the exponential of the number of qubits, makes a practical speedup unrealistic even under extremely optimistic assumptions of the evolution of both hardware quality and availability.

TI General framework for cyclic and fine-tuned causal models and their
   compatibility with space-time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Causal modeling is a tool for generating causal explanations of observed correlations and has led to a deeper understanding of correlations in quantum networks. Existing frameworks for quantum causality tend to focus on acyclic causal structures that are not fine-tuned i.e., where causal connections between variables necessarily create correlations between them. However, fine-tuned causal models (which permit causation without correlation) play a crucial role in cryptography, and cyclic causal models can be used to model physical processes involving feedback and may also be relevant in exotic solutions of general relativity. Here we develop a causal modeling framework capable of dealing with these general scenarios. The key feature of our framework is that it allows operational and relativistic notions of causality to be independently defined and for connections between them to be established in a theory-independent manner. The framework first gives an operational way to study causation that allows for cyclic, fine-tuned, and nonclassical causal influences. We then consider how a causal model can be embedded in a space-time structure (modeled as a partial order) and propose a compatibility condition for ensuring that the embedded causal model does not allow signaling outside the space-time future. We identify several distinct classes of causal loops that can arise in our framework, showing that compatibility with a space-time can rule out only some of them. We discuss conditions for preventing superluminal signaling within arbitrary (and possibly cyclic) causal structures and consider models of causation in postquantum theories admitting so-called jamming correlations. Finally, this work introduces the concept of a higher-order affects relation, which is useful for causal discovery in fined-tuned causal models.

TI Noise impact of classical headers on the quantum payload in quantum
   wrapper networking
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB The fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem, make management and control of quantum networks challenging. Quantum wrapper networking (QWN) offers a solution to this problem by wrapping quantum payloads with classical bits (as headers and/or tails) that can be used to assist with networking, performance monitoring, and probing the properties of the fiber interconnection. Since the classical header and quantum payload travel in the same fiber, one should carefully design the system to mitigate potentially deleterious effects such as noise and cross-talk. In this paper, we identify and characterize the noise induced by the classical headers by in-fiber scattering processes. We study the noise by using a tunable continuous-wave laser to emulate O-band (similar to 1310 nm) classical headers, which are time-and wavelength-multiplexed with O-band quantum signals. The noise is characterized as a function of the headers' power, classical-quantum wavelength detuning, and optical fiber length. We demonstrate that the dominant noise contribution originates from spontaneous Raman scattering for wavelength detunings that are larger than 3 nm. We also observe that some noise photons can bleed into the quantum payload due to Rayleigh scattering of backward Raman scattered photons. We further investigate system level impacts of the noise created by classical headers that are produced by employing a small form-factor pluggable transceiver. We demonstrate that the associated noise level has negligible impact on quantum payloads for a 47.8 km deployed fiber link, the longest length used in QWN experiments to date, achieving a coincidences-to-accidentals ratio of 56 and a two-photon interference visibility of 88.8%.

TI Black-hole laser to Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau crossover: From
   nonlinear to linear quantum amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The black-hole laser (BHL) effect is the self-amplification of Hawking radiation in the presence of a pair of horizons which act as a resonant cavity. In a flowing atomic condensate, the BHL effect arises in a finite supersonic region, where Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau (BCL) radiation is coherently excited by any static perturbation. Thus, experimental attempts to produce a black-hole laser unavoidably deal with the presence of a strong BCL background, making the observation of the BHL effect still a major challenge in the analog gravity field. Here, we perform a theoretical study of the BHL-BCL crossover using an idealized model where both phenomena can be unambiguously isolated. By drawing an analogy with an unstable pendulum, we distinguish three main regimes according to the interplay between quantum fluctuations and classical stimulation: quantum BHL, classical BHL, and BCL. Based on quite general scaling arguments, the nonlinear amplification of the initial amplitude of the quantum fluctuations up to saturation is identified as the most robust trait of a quantum BHL. A classical BHL behaves instead as a linear quantum amplifier, where the output is proportional to the input. The BCL regime also acts as a linear quantum amplifier, but its gain is exponentially smaller as compared to a classical BHL. In addition, we find that the decrease in the amplification for increasing BCL amplitude or the nonmonotonic dependence of the growth rate with respect to the background parameters are complementary signatures of black-hole lasing. We also identify interesting analog phenomena such as Hawking-stimulated white-hole radiation or quantum BCL-stimulated Hawking radiation. The results of this work not only are of interest for analog gravity, where they help to distinguish each phenomenon and to design experimental setups leading to a clear observation of the BHL effect, but they also open the prospect of finding applications of analog concepts in quantum technologies.

TI Positional Accuracy of 3D Printed Quantum Emitter Fiber Couplers
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Precise positioning of optical elements plays a key role in the performance of optical systems. While additive manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing enable the creation of entire complex micro-objectives in one step, thus rendering lens alignment unnecessary, certain applications require precise positional alignment of the printing process with respect to the substrate. For example, in order to efficiently couple quantum emitters to single-mode fibers, which is a crucial step in the development of real world quantum networks, precise alignment between the emitter, the coupling optics, and the single-mode fiber is of utmost importance. In this work, the positioning accuracy of a Photonics Professional GT (Nanoscribe GmbH) 3D printing machine is evaluated by using the integrated piezo stage to align to gold markers that is manufactured via e-beam lithography. By running a statistical analysis of 38 printing cycles, a mean positional error of only 80 nm is determined. Additionally, an entire system is 3D printed that can couple quantum emitters to optical single-mode fibers. Examining the focal spot of the 3D printed micro-optics, a positional accuracy of approximate to 1 mu m in all three dimensions is found, as well as excellent quality of the focal spot.

TI Differentiation of correlated fluctuations in site energy on excitation
   energy transfer in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB One of the promising approaches to revealing the photosynthetic efficiency of close to one unit is to investigate the quantum regime of excitation energy transfer (EET). The majority of studies, however, have concluded that different pigment molecules contribute equally to EET, rather than differently. We investigate the roles of different site-energies in EET by evaluating the correlated fluctuations of site-energies in two adjacent pigment molecules (namely Site 1 and Site 2), and we attempt to demonstrate different site roles in EET with the j-V characteristics and power via a photosynthetic quantum heat engine (QHE) model rather than an actual photosynthetic protein. The results show that fluctuations at Site 1 (the pigment molecule absorbing solar photons) provide ascending and then descending EET. At Site 2, the EET is reduced through the use of correlated fluctuation increments (the pigment molecule acting as the charge-transfer excited state). Furthermore, when investigating the correlated fluctuations at Site 2, the different gap differences of the output terminal play a positive role in EET, but a sharply decreasing EET process is also achieved with less correlated fluctuations at Site 2 compared to those at Site 1. The findings show that different pigment molecules contribute differently to EET. The significance of this work is that it not only clarifies the roles of different pigment molecules in EET, but it also deepens our understanding of the fundamental physics of EET as it transports through the molecular chain in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. Furthermore, the results are appropriate to the EET in organic semiconductors, photovoltaic devices, and quantum networks, when these systems couple to the environment of photons via the vibrational motion of sites in the molecular chain.

TI Post-Quantum Biometric Authentication Based on Homomorphic Encryption
   and Classic McEliece
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Homomorphic encryption is a powerful mechanism that allows sensitive data, such as biometric data, to be compared in a protected way, revealing only the comparison result when the private key is known. This is very useful for non-device-centric authentication architectures with clients that provide protected data and external servers that authenticate them. While many reported solutions do not follow standards and are not resistant to quantum computer attacks, this work proposes a secure biometric authentication scheme that applies homomorphic encryption based on the Classic McEliece public-key encryption algorithm, which is a round 4 candidate of the NIST post-quantum standardization process. The scheme applies specific steps to transform the features extracted from biometric samples. Its use is proposed in a non-device-centric biometric authentication architecture that ensures user privacy. Irreversibility, revocability and unlinkability are satisfied and the scheme is robust to stolen-device, False-Acceptance Rate (FAR) and similarity-based attacks as well as to honest-but-curious servers. In addition to the security achieved by the McEliece system, which remains stable over 40 years of attacks, the proposal allows for very reduced storage and communication overheads as well as low computational cost. A practical implementation of a non-device-centric facial authentication system is illustrated based on the generation and comparison of protected FaceNet embeddings. Experimental results with public databases show that the proposed scheme improves the accuracy and the False-Acceptance Rate of the unprotected scheme, maintaining the False-Rejection Rate, allows real-time execution in clients and servers for Classic McEliece security parameter sets of 128 and 256 bits (mceliece348864 and mceliece6688128, respectively), and reduces storage requirements in more than 90.5% compared to the most reduced-size homomorphic encryption-based schemes with post-quantum security reported in the literature.

TI Affordances and challenges of incorporating a remote, cloud-accessible
   quantum experiment into undergraduate courses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB As quantum technologies transition from the research laboratory into commercial development, the opportunities for students to begin their careers in this new quantum industry are increasing. With these new career pathways, more and more people are considering the best ways to educate students about quantum concepts and relevant skills. In particular, the quantum industry is looking for new employees with experimental skills, but the instructional labs, capstone projects, research experiences, and internships that provide experiences where students can learn these skills are often resource intensive and not available at all institutions. The quantum company, Infleqtion, recently made its online quantum matter machine, Oqtant, publicly available, so people around the world could send commands to create and manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates and receive back real experimental data. Making a complex quantum experiment accessible to anyone has the potential to extend the opportunity to work with quantum experiments to students at less-resourced institutions. As a first step in understanding the potential benefits of using such a platform in educational settings, we collected data from instructors and students who were interested in using, or had used, Oqtant. In this study, we investigate instructors' views about reasons they would like to use Oqtant and the challenges they would face in doing so. We also provide a concrete example of how Oqtant was used in an upper-division undergraduate quantum mechanics course and the instructor's perception of its benefits. We complement this with the student perspective, discussing student experiences interacting with Oqtant in their course or through think-aloud interviews outside of a course. This allows us to investigate the reasons students perceive Oqtant to be a real experiment even though they never physically interact with it, how Oqtant compares to their other experimental experiences, and what they enjoy about working with it. These results will help the community consider the potential value of creating more opportunities for students to access remote quantum experiments.

TI Computational physics applied to photonic devices
SO RIVISTA DEL NUOVO CIMENTO
AB We all know that the first laser device was realized by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Labs in 1960. Less known is that the very first computer simulations of the relaxation oscillations displayed by Maiman's laser were also performed in 1960 on a digital IBM 704 computer. The reason is that lasers and almost all photonic devices are described by nonlinear equations that are more often than not impossible to be solved analytically, i.e., on a piece of paper. Since then the development and applications of lasers and photonic devices have progressed hand in hand with computer simulations and numerical programming. In this review, we introduce and numerically solve the model equations for a variety of devices, lasers, lasers with modulated parameters, lasers with injection, Kerr resonators, saturable absorbers, and optical parametric oscillators. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate stability and instability of nonlinear solutions in these photonic devices via pitchfork, saddle-node, Hopf and Turing bifurcations; bistability, nonlinear oscillations, deterministic chaos, Turing patterns, conservative solitons; bright, dark and grey cavity solitons; frequency combs, spatial disorder, spatio-temporal chaos, defect-mediated turbulence and even rogue waves. There has been a one-to-one correspondence between computer simulations of all these nonlinear features and laboratory experiments with applications in ultrafast optical communications, optical memories, neural networks, frequency standards, optical clocks, future GPS, astronomy, and quantum technologies. All of this has been made possible by 'novel insights into spatio-temporal dynamics of lasers, nonlinear and quantum optical systems, achieved through the development and application of powerful techniques for small-scale computing' (2011 Occhialini Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics and Societa' Italiana di Fisica).

AB We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of c-coloring chi-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms, for a wide range of models of distributed computing. In particular, we show that these problems do not admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that:
   (1) We give a new distributed algorithm that finds a 2 -coloring in j -chromatic graphs in (O) over tilde (n(1/alpha)) rounds, with a = left perpendicularc-1/chi-1right perpendicular.
   (2) We prove that any distributed algorithm for this problem requires Omega(n(1/alpha)) rounds.
   Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the near-matching lower bound holds in the non-signaling model. This model, introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL, even with a pre-shared quantum state.
   We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g., 3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or 2-coloring trees remain hard problems even for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs.

TI Green Tensor Analysis of Lattice Resonances in Periodic Arrays of
   Nanoparticles
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB When arranged in a periodic geometry, arrays of metallic nanostructures are capable of supporting collective modes known as lattice resonances. These modes, which originate from the coherent multiple scattering between the elements of the array, give rise to very strong and spectrally narrow optical responses. Here, we show that, thanks to their collective nature, the lattice resonances of a periodic array of metallic nanoparticles can mediate an efficient long-range coupling between dipole emitters placed near the array. Specifically, using a coupled dipole approach, we calculate the Green tensor of the array connecting two points and analyze its spectral and spatial characteristics. This quantity represents the electromagnetic field produced by the array at a given position when excited by a unit dipole emitter located at another one. We find that, when a lattice resonance is excited, the Green tensor is significantly larger and decays more slowly with distance than the Green tensor of vacuum. Therefore, in addition to advancing the fundamental understanding of lattice resonances, our results show that periodic arrays of nanostructures are capable of enhancing the long-range coupling between collections of dipole emitters, which makes them a promising platform for applications such as nanoscale energy transfer and quantum information processing.

TI High Mobility and Electrostatics in GeSn Quantum Wells With SiGeSn
   Barriers
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB GeSn is an emerging material with potential applications in next-generation integrated optoelectronics and quantum information processing. While GeSn/SiGeSn quantum wells exhibit promising optical properties, their electrical transport characteristics and governing electrostatics in gated structures remain unexplored. Heterostructure field-effect transistors are fabricated using GeSn/SiGeSn quantum wells and electronic transport properties of 2D holes are characterized. At 2 K, heterostructure field-effect transistors with well/barrier compositions of Ge0.945Sn0.055/Si0.03Ge0.93Sn0.04 and Ge0.9Sn0.1/Si0.017Ge0.927Sn0.056, show peak mobilities of 9000 and 19 000 cm(2)/Vs, respectively, the latter setting a record for the highest mobility reported for GeSn quantum wells with a Sn concentration around 6 % or greater. Remarkably, at low carrier densities, devices with a SiGeSn barrier exhibit mobilities several times higher than previously reported for GeSn quantum wells with a Ge barrier. This higher mobility contrasts with the expectation that alloy scattering from the barrier would reduce carrier mobility. Two mechanisms based on atom probe tomography data analyses are proposed: i) unintentionally improved SiGeSn/GeSn interface and/or ii) reduced alloy scattering from short-range order. Significant current-voltage hysteresis is observed, with the effective threshold gate voltage shifting by more than 5 V, attributed to non-equilibrium trapped charge at various interfaces within the SiGeSn heterostructure.

TI On-chip optical vector analysis based on thin-film lithium niobate
   single-sideband modulators
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Optical vector analysis (OVA) is an enabling technology for comprehensively characterizing both amplitude and phase responses of optical devices or systems. Conventional OVA technologies are mostly based on discrete optoelectronic components, leading to unsatisfactory system sizes, complexity, and stability. They also encounter challenges in revealing the on-chip characteristics of integrated photonic devices, which are often overwhelmed by the substantial coupling loss and extra spectral response at chip facets. In this work, we demonstrate a miniaturized OVA system based on broadband single-sideband (SSB) modulators on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. The OVA could provide a direct probe of both amplitude and phase responses of photonic devices with kilohertz-level resolution and tens of terahertz of measurement bandwidth. We perform in situ characterizations of single and coupled microring resonators fabricated on the same chip as the OVA, unfolding their intrinsic loss and coupling states unambiguously. Furthermore, we achieve the direct measurement of collective phase dynamics and density of states of the Bloch modes in a synthetic frequency crystal by in situ OVA of a dynamically modulated microring resonator. Our OVA system provides a compact, high-precision, and broadband solution for characterizing future integrated photonic devices and circuits, with potential applications ranging from optical communications, biosensing, and neuromorphic computing, to quantum information processing.

TI The key exchange protocol based on non-commutative elements of Clifford
   algebra
SO IZVESTIYA OF SARATOV UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICS MECHANICS INFORMATICS
AB Many of the asymmetric cryptography protocols are based on operations performed on commutative algebraic structures, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. The development of algorithms in non-commutative structures makes it possible to strengthen these protocols. Cryptography is a branch of mathematics that solves the problem of transmitting information through unsafe channels. For this, information is encrypted, so it cannot be used without first decrypting it. In encrypted communication, subtasks are distinguished: secure key exchange, and then encryption/decryption of the message. Public key cryptography uses the Diffie - Hellman key exchange protocol. Since the beginning of this century, interest has increased in the development of alternative asymmetric cryptosystems that are resistant to attacks by quantum computer algorithms. Most of these schemes are non-commutative cryptography algorithms, such as a scheme of matrix polynomial ring. One of the tasks for the development of crypto-graphic schemes - the task of conjugacy search, can be formulated over finite non-commutative groups. The security of information transmission can be built based on the undecidability of the conjugacy search problem, which is defined over finite non-commutative groups. The aim of this work is to develop a model of the Diffie - Hellman protocol using the algebraic structure of the Clifford algebra (which includes the quaternions) and the structures of the polynomial ring. Safety ensuring of the algorithm using Clifford algebras is based on the non-commutative structure of these algebras and the ability to work in a space of any dimension n > 1. Clifford algebra groups are non-commutative structures, as are matrix polynomials and braid groups. However, Clifford algebra groups are more compact and show shorter execution times in many comparable operations. The use of elements of Clifford algebras and exponents of integers as coefficients allows us to reduce the requirement for processor registers (do not use floating-point processors) and significantly increase the performance of forming the Diffie - Hellman protocol.

TI Anti-Arrhenius behavior of electron transfer reactions in molecular
   dimers
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Rates of chemical reactions typically accelerate as the temperature rises, following the Arrhenius law. However, electron transfer reactions may exhibit weak temperature dependence or counterintuitive behavior, known as anti-Arrhenius behavior, wherein reaction rates decrease as temperature increases. Solvent reorganization energy and torsion-induced changes in electronic couplings could contribute to this unusual behavior, but how each contributes to the overall temperature dependence is unclear. One can decelerate the charge recombination process in photogenerated radical pairs or charge-separated states by harnessing this often-overlooked phenomenon. This means that we could achieve long-lived radical pairs without relying on conventional cooling. Using a series of homo molecular dimers, we showed that the degree of torsional hindrance dictates temperature-dependent torsion-induced changes in electronic coupling and, therefore, charge recombination rates. The overall temperature dependence is controlled by how changes in electronic coupling and the temperature-dependent solvent reorganization energy contribute to the rates of charge recombination. Our findings pave the way for rationally designing molecules that exhibit anti-Arrhenius behavior to slow down charge recombination, opening possibilities for applications in energy-related and quantum information technologies.
   The degree of torsional hindrance can significantly contribute to anti-Arrhenius behavior of charge recombination, wherein recombination rates decrease as temperature increases.

TI Review of Orbital Magnetism in Graphene-Based Moiré Materials
SO MAGNETISM
AB Recent years have seen the emergence of moir & eacute; materials as an attractive platform for observing a host of novel correlated and topological phenomena. Moir & eacute; heterostructures are generated when layers of van der Waals materials are stacked such that consecutive layers are slightly mismatched in their lattice orientation or unit cell size. This slight lattice mismatch gives rise to a long-wavelength moir & eacute; pattern that modulates the electronic structure and leads to novel physics. The moir & eacute; superlattice results in flat superlattice bands, electron-electron interactions and non-trivial topology that have led to the observation of superconductivity, the quantum anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization, among other interesting properties. This review focuses on the experimental observation and theoretical analysis of orbital magnetism in moir & eacute; materials. These systems are novel in their ability to host magnetism that is dominated by the orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. This orbital magnetic moment is easily tunable using external electric fields and carrier concentration since it originates in the quantum anomalous Hall effect. As a result, the orbital magnetism found in moir & eacute; superlattices can be highly attractive for a wide array of applications including spintronics, ultra-low-power magnetic memories, spin-based neuromorphic computing and quantum information technology.

TI Broadband single-cell-driven multifunctional metalensing
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Metasurfaces are artificially engineered ultrathin photonic components that can be freely designed to exhibit unprecedented capabilities of highly-efficient electromagnetic wave manipulation. The ever-growing demand for miniaturized photonic devices for emerging applications, like imaging, spectroscopy, biosensing, and quantum information processing, consistently requires broadband multifunctional and highly-efficient meta-devices. Recent years have witnessed tremendous advancements in metasurfaces; however, investigating the novel platform to realize broadband metasurfaces that integrate multiple functionalities in a single -layered structure would be an obvious technological extension. Here, we present a broadband single-cell-driven multifunctional metasurface platform capable of manipulating electromagnetic waves over a wide range of visible wavelengths (475-650 nm). A lossless zinc sulfide material exhibiting a sufficiently large refractive index and negligible extension coefficient across the visible spectrum is exploited to demonstrate the state-of-the-art meta-devices. Furthermore, a well-known spin-decoupling technique is implemented to multiplex different optical phenomena into a single-cell-driven structure. For proof of the concept, we demonstrate two meta-devices that provide transverse and longitudinal splitting of different optical phenomena for the visible wavelengths. The presented zinc sulfide material and unique design philosophy to achieve broadband multifunctional meta-devices may find potential applications in polarization and dispersion analyzers, sensing, optical communication, and many more.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Rydberg ions in coherent motional states: a new method for determining
   the polarizability of Rydberg ions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a method for measuring the polarizability of Rydberg ions confined in the harmonic potential of a Paul trap. For a highly excited electronic state, the coupling between the electronic wave function and the trapping field modifies the excitation spectra depending on the motional state of the ion. This interaction strongly depends on the polarizability of the excited state and manifests itself in the state-dependent secular frequencies of the ion. We initialize a single trapped Ca-40(+) ion from the motional ground state into coherent states with |a| up to 12 using electric voltages on the trap segments. The internal state, firstly initialised in the long-lived 3D(5/2) state, is excited to a Rydberg S-1/2-state via the 5P(3/2) state in a two-photon process. We probe the depletion of the 3D(5/2) state owing to the Rydberg excitation followed by a decay into the internal ground 4S(1/2 )state. By analysing the obtained spectra we extract the polarizability of Rydberg states which agree with numerical calculations. The method is applicable to different Rydberg states regardless of their principal or angular quantum numbers. An accurate value of the state polarizability is needed for quantum gate operations with Rydberg ion crystals.

TI Testing the upper bound on the speed of scrambling with an analogue of
   Hawking radiation using trapped ions
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The Lyapunov exponent of a quantum system has been predicted to be bounded by lambda(L) <= 2 pi T/h, where T is its temperature, as established by Maldacena, Shenker, and Stanford (MSS). This bound plays an important role in studying very diverse topics of physics, ranging from the dynamics of interacting many-body systems to the black hole information problem, and it is saturated when the system under consideration is the exact holographic dual of a black hole. Based on the fact that an inverted harmonic oscillator (IHO) may exhibit the behavior of thermal energy emission, in close analogy to the Hawking radiation emitted by black holes, we propose using a trapped ion as an implementation of the IHO to verify, in a concrete analogue-gravity system, whether the MSS bound can be identically saturated. To this end, we provide prescriptions for experimentally observing the scattering process at the IHO potential, which yields an analogue of Hawking radiation, as well as for how to measure the corresponding out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC), diagnosing quantum chaos, in this thermally excited semiclassical system. We theoretically show, for an experimentally realizable analogue-gravity setup, that the effective Hawking temperature of the trapped-ion-IHO indeed matches the upper MSS bound for the speed of scrambling.

TI Physical Implementability of Linear Maps and Its Application in Error
   Mitigation
SO QUANTUM
AB Completely positive and trace-preserving maps characterize physically implementable quantum operations. On the other hand, general linear maps, such as positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically implemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in theoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well one can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by physically implementable operations. in this work, we introduce a systematic framework to resolve this task using the quasi probability decomposition technique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of physically implementable operations and introduce the physical implementability measure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must pertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using physically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is efficiently computable by semideflnite programs and prove several properties of this measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests. Furthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the quantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the sampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique. in particular, for parallel quantum noises, we show that global error mitigation has no advantage over local error mitigation.

TI Quantum Behavior of a Nonextensive Oscillatory Dissipative System in the
   Coherent State
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We investigate the nonextensivity of a generalized dissipative oscillatory system in the Glauber coherent state. We introduce a parameter q as a measure of the nonextensivity of the system. Considering the characteristic of nonextensivity, the system is described by a deformed Caldirola-Kanai oscillator, which is represented in terms of q. We manage the system by describing the associated Hamiltonian in terms of the harmonic oscillator ladder operators. The time evolutions of the canonical variables, the Hamiltonian expectation value, the quantum energy, and the symmetry-breaking in the evolution of the system, are analyzed in detail regarding their dependence on q, damping factor, and the external driving force. The amplitude of the oscillator is slightly quenched as q becomes large, whereas the amplitude of the canonical momentum is enhanced in response to the growth in q. As q increases, the dissipation of the quantum energy becomes a little faster as a manifestation of the nonextensivity of the system. Our results are compared to the classical results, as well as to those in the previous research performed on the basis of the SU(1,1) coherent states. The coherent states, including the Glauber coherent states, can be convenient resources for carrying information, which is crucial in quantum information processing.

TI Adding colour to the Zernike wavefront sensor: Advantages of including
   multi-wavelength measurements for wavefront reconstruction
SO ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
AB Context. To directly image Earth-like planets, contrast levels of 10(-8)-10(-10) are required. The next generation of instruments will need wavefront control below the nanometer level to achieve these goals. The Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) is a promising candidate thanks to its sensitivity, which reaches the fundamental quantum information limits. However, its highly non-linear response restricts its practical use case. Aims. We aim to demonstrate the improvement in robustness of the ZWFS by reconstructing the wavefront based on multi-wavelength measurements facilitated by technologies such as the microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). Methods. We performed numerical simulations using an accelerated multi-wavelength gradient descent reconstruction algorithm. Three aspects are considered: dynamic range, photon noise sensitivity, and phase unwrapping. We examined both the scalar and vector ZWFS. Results. Firstly, we find that using multiple wavelengths improves the dynamic range of the scalar ZWFS. However, for the vector ZWFS, its already extended range was not further increased. In addition, a multi-wavelength reconstruction allowed us to take advantage of a broader bandpass, which increases the number of available photons, making the reconstruction more robust to photon noise. Finally, multi-wavelength phase unwrapping enabled the measurement of large discontinuities such as petal errors with a trade-off in noise performance.

TI Removal of high-voltage-induced surface charges by ultraviolet light
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB A plethora of studies ranging from precision physics to quantum information employ ions, highly excited neutral atoms, or polar molecules as tools. Motivated by the need for miniaturization, scalability, and controllability, the particles are often trapped close to electrodes imprinted on dielectric surfaces. However, such geometry makes the particles susceptible to undesired surface charges. To understand how high voltage applied to the electrodes mediates the buildup of charges, we use a scanning Kelvin probe in an ultrahigh vacuum to investigate the electric potential landscape of an electrostatic molecule trap with a microstructured electrode array. We find that the surface becomes positively charged after applying voltages to the electrodes, leading to offset and patch electric potentials across the surface. Removal of these charges is demonstrated using ultraviolet light. The dynamics of this process, including the dependence on light intensity, wavelength, and sample type, are investigated in detail. We find the charge removal to be faster for shorter ultraviolet wavelengths, with an additional polymer coating providing further enhancement. Our findings may be useful in a wide spectrum of experiments with electric-field-sensitive particles. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Exciton funneling in 2D artificial potential landscapes decorated by
   reassembled micro-bubbles
SO MATERIALS FUTURES
AB Devices operating with excitons exhibit promising prospects for overcoming the dilemma of response time and integration in electron or/and photon based system. Strain engineering has emerged as an effective approach to modulate exciton transport and dynamics, with bubbles induced biaxial strain attracting particular attention for nanoscopic manipulation of exciton flux. However, the unintentionally produced bubbles are completely stochastic in dimensions and morphology, thereby the active and controllable bubbles formation still remain challenge, which is imperative for modulating excitonic and opt-electric performance on demand. Here, we propose the annealing-driven reassembly of micro-bubbles to create the controllable artificial potential landscapes in atomically thin semiconductor, facilitating the active manipulation of exciton flux at room temperature. Correlating micro PL mappings with strain maps calculated from AFM topography and strain modeling, demonstrates the efficient localized exciton emission and exciton funneling in spectral. The imaging of exciton transport and emission provide more intuitive evidence in spatial that excitons flow towards bubble center from excitation location driven by the conventional diffusion and strain gradient induced drift effect, supported by drift-diffusion model. These findings demonstrate the great potential to control exciton dynamics on-demand through annealing driven reassembled micro-bubbles, and lay the foundation for promising applications in high-performance sensing, energy harvesting, and quantum information processing.

TI Metasurface-generated Spin-multiplexed & Grafted Perfect Vector Vortex
   Beams for High-dimensional Optical Information Encryption
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Increasing the number of optical information encryption (OIE) layers can exponentially enhance its security, which requires introducing additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) for light. However, traditional OIE systems encounter challenges due to exponential increases in volume and mass with the expansion of modulation DoFs, thereby retarding the development of integrated high-security OIE. Here, a high-dimensional dual-layer OIE (DLOIE) strategy is proposed and experimentally established by utilizing a novel metasurface-generated beam, termed spin-multiplexed and grafted perfect vector vortex beam (MGPVVB). MGPVVB is generated by superposing grafted perfect vortex beams with programmable combinations of topological charges (CTCs) across two orthogonally circularly polarized states. As a key factor for DLOIE, MGPVVB introduces a new DoF called CTCs which can be customized within the same polarization order (PO). The metasurface is well-suited for generating MGPVVBs over a wide bandwidth (450-1064 nm). MGPVVBs of all polarization states on the Poincar & eacute; sphere are generated. More importantly, DLOIE is achieved through an MGPVVB array. For DLOIE, information (true and false) encoding is based on PO and ellipticity, while verification of authenticity is governed by distinctive CTCs. This advancement enhances the security of OIE, and shows great value for applications in optical storage, optical communications, and quantum information processing.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
AB In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-relativistic quantum particles immersed in a cosmic string space-time background. Our study involves the examination of these particles as they interact with a range of influences, including potential, magnetic, and quantum flux fields. We employ analytical methods to solve the associated wave equation, leading to the derivation of eigenvalue solutions for this quantum system. Subsequently, we leverage these eigenvalue solutions to scrutinize several potential models. For each model, we present and engage in a thorough discussion of the corresponding eigenvalue solutions. In an extension of our investigation, we explore the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the quantum system when it is exposed to non-zero temperature conditions, denoted by T not equal 0. Our analysis encompasses the calculation of essential parameters such as the partition function for the system and other pertinent functions. Following these calculations, we meticulously examine and interpret the outcomes, shedding light on the system's behavior and characteristics in the presence of temperature variations. Furthermore, we calculate entropic information to investigate the location of particles in the system.

TI Generating free-space structured light with programmable integrated
   photonics
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Structured light is a key component of many modern applications, ranging from super-resolution microscopy to imaging, sensing and quantum information processing. As the utilization of these powerful tools continues to spread, the demand for technologies that enable the spatial manipulation of fundamental properties of light, such as amplitude, phase and polarization grows further. The rapidly advancing field of reconfigurable integrated photonics allows entirely new routes towards beam shaping that not only outperform existing devices in terms of speed but also have substantial potential with respect to their footprints, robustness and conversion efficiencies. In this study, we demonstrate how a multipurpose programmable integrated photonic processor can generate and control a wide range of higher-order free-space structured light beams, all starting from only a single injection waveguide. Our method controls the distribution of light's amplitude and phase within sub-milliseconds, and it is fully reconfigurable and has no moving parts. These advancements broaden the spectrum of potential methods, applications and devices that utilize spatially tailored light by providing a pathway to combine the strengths and versatility of integrated photonics and free-space structured light.
   Using programmable integrated photonics to generate a higher-order free-space structured light beam promises lossless and reconfigurable control of the spatial distribution of light's amplitude and phase with very short switching times.

TI A Theoretical Study of Interband Absorption Spectra of Spherical Sector
   Quantum Dots under the Effect of a Powerful Resonant Laser
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB We explore the variation of interband absorption spectra of GaAs spherical sector quantum dots (QDs) in response to a strong resonant laser, using the renormalized wave function method. Even though a spherical sector QD appears identical to a section cut from a spherical QD, it contains a controllable additional spatial parameter, the apical angle, which results in radically different wave functions and energy levels of particles, and is anticipated to exhibit novel optical properties. The obtained findings reveal that the apical angle of the dot has a considerable effect on the interband absorption spectrum. With the increase in the dot apical angle, a significant redshift of the interband absorption peaks has been identified. Increasing the pump laser detuning and dot radius yields similar results. Especially when a powerful resonant laser with tiny detuning is utilized, a dynamical coupling between electron levels arises, resulting in the formation of new interband absorption peaks. These new peaks and the former ones were similarly influenced by the aforementioned parameters. Furthermore, it is thought that the new peaks, when stimulated by a suitable laser, will produce the entangled states necessary for quantum information.

TI Magneto-Structural Correlations in a Mixed
   Porphyrin(Cu2+)/Trityl Spin System: Magnitude, Sign, and
   Distribution of the Exchange Coupling Constant
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals (TAM or trityl) are receiving increasing attention in various fields of magnetic resonance such as imaging, dynamic nuclear polarization, spin labeling, and, more recently, molecular magnetism and quantum information technology. Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi-frequency continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin-spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of -2.3 GHz (-0.077 cm(-1), +J(sic)(1)(sic)(2) convention) and a distribution width of 1.2 GHz (0.040 cm(-1)). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para-substituted phenyl-bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers. This study exemplifies the importance of molecular dynamics for the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the magnetic properties of trityl-based systems.

TI Interlayer magnetophononic coupling in MnBi2Te4
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The emergence of magnetism in quantum materials creates a platform to realize spin-based applications in spintronics, magnetic memory, and quantum information science. A key to unlocking new functionalities in these materials is the discovery of tunable coupling between spins and other microscopic degrees of freedom. We present evidence for interlayer magnetophononic coupling in the layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4. Employing magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we observe anomalies in phonon scattering intensities across magnetic field-driven phase transitions, despite the absence of discernible static structural changes. This behavior is a consequence of a magnetophononic wave-mixing process that allows for the excitation of zone-boundary phonons that are otherwise 'forbidden' by momentum conservation. Our microscopic model based on density functional theory calculations reveals that this phenomenon can be attributed to phonons modulating the interlayer exchange coupling. Moreover, signatures of magnetophononic coupling are also observed in the time domain through the ultrafast excitation and detection of coherent phonons across magnetic transitions. In light of the intimate connection between magnetism and topology in MnBi2Te4, the magnetophononic coupling represents an important step towards coherent on-demand manipulation of magnetic topological phases.
   Tunable coupling between magnetism and the lattice is important for on-demand manipulation of magnetic phases. Here, the authors demonstrate that lattice vibrations can coherently modulate the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling in the magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4.

TI A quantum reversible color-to-grayscale conversion scheme via image
   encryption based on true random numbers and two-dimensional quantum
   walks
SO SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Reversible Color-to-Grayscale Conversion (RCGC) is a method for converting color images to grayscale while retaining sufficient information to reconstruct the original color image when needed. This study proposes a Quantum RCGC (QRCGC) scheme that integrates quantum encryption techniques. The scheme first uses a finite number of true random numbers as seeds, which are then extended using a two-dimensional quantum walks system to generate sufficiently large random matrices for performing bitwise XOR operations with the original image. Subsequently, a quantum confusion technique is proposed, combining quantum block Arnold scrambling, cyclic shifts, and subsequence exchanges, which enhances the complexity of the relationship between the keys and the ciphertext in parallel. Additionally, a quantum diffusion technique is designed, efficiently generating hash values via a two-dimensional quantum walks system to verify image integrity. These hash values are used as content-based key inputs in a chaotic system to generate quantum secure matrices for diffusing the image information. Finally, a quantum bidirectional conversion operation is designed to achieve lossless reversible conversion between color and grayscale images. Experimental results show that the QRCGC scheme demonstrates significant advantages in terms of security, efficiency, and information retention.

TI Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect for accelerated two-level single and
   entangled atomic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the transition rates of uniformly accelerated two-level single and entangled atomic systems in empty space as well as inside a cavity. We take into account the interaction between the systems and a massless scalar field from the viewpoint of an instantaneously inertial observer and a coaccelerated observer, respectively. The upward transition occurs only due to the acceleration of the atom. For the two-atom system, we consider that the system is initially prepared in a generic pure entangled state. In the presence of a cavity, we observe that for both the single and the two-atom cases, the upward and downward transitions are occurred due to the acceleration of the atomic systems. The transition rate manifests subtle features depending upon the cavity and system parameters, as well as the initial entanglement. It is shown that no transition occurs for a maximally entangled superradiant initial state, signifying that such entanglement in the accelerated two-atom system can be preserved for quantum information processing applications. Our analysis comprehensively validates the equivalence between the effect of uniform acceleration for an inertial observer and the effect of a thermal bath for a coaccelerated observer, in free space as well as inside a cavity, if the temperature of the thermal bath is equal to the Unruh temperature.

AB In the framework of Impagliazzo's five worlds, a distinction is often made between two worlds, one where public-key encryption exists (Cryptomania), and one in which only one-way functions exist (MiniCrypt). However, the boundaries between these worlds can change when quantum information is taken into account. Recent work has shown that quantum variants of oblivious transfer and multi-party computation, both primitives that are classically in Cryptomania, can be constructed from one-way functions, placing them in the realm of quantumMiniCrypt (the so-called MiniQCrypt). This naturally raises the following question: Is it possible to construct a quantum variant of public-key encryption, which is at the heart of Cryptomania, from one-way functions or potentially weaker assumptions?
   In this work, we initiate the formal study of the notion of quantum public-key encryption (qPKE), i.e., public-key encryption where keys are allowed to be quantum states. We propose new definitions of security and several constructions of qPKE based on the existence of one-way functions (OWF), or even weaker assumptions, such as pseudorandom function-like states (PRFS) and pseudorandom function-like states with proof of destruction (PRFSPD). Finally, to give a tight characterization of this primitive, we show that computational assumptions are necessary to build quantum public-key encryption. That is, we give a self-contained proof that no quantum public-key encryption scheme can provide information-theoretic security.

TI Pattern Design of Diffractive Optical Sensor Elements for Multiplex
   Interferometry
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB In interferometric optical sensors, phase information is extracted from the modulated light intensity. In the case of free-standing interferometers, operating through the far-field interferogram, multiplex phase detection is not trivial. Multipinhole or multimicrodisk interferometry are examples of common-path interferometers that allow multiplex interferometric phase detection. Thereby an unambiguous interference pattern is required, with no overlap of multiple spatial frequencies. A common pattern in multipinhole interferometry is a circular arrangement. To increase the element density of the pattern, Golomb rulers are an interesting concept. Golomb rulers and rectangles are known from sonar and radar applications. Recently, they were applied for encoding in quantum information systems. In this publication, we investigate different pattern designs of circular diffractors that produce unique spatial frequencies. We introduce design algorithms. The optimization criteria are the uniqueness of the spatial frequencies, which show no overlap with any other frequency, and the density of the microdisk pattern. Golomb patterns increase the element density by about 30% compared to the circular pattern. Depending on the pattern area, the density of the circular Archimedes spiral surpasses by up to 13% the density of a square Golomb pattern, referenced to a circular area. To validate the theoretically designed patterns, examples are fabricated on the basis of photonic crystal microdisk elements and are characterized optically.

TI Photoelectric Detection of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers Magnetic Resonances
   in Diamond: Role of Charge Exchanges with Other Optoelectrically Active
   Defects
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The photoelectric detection of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetic resonance (PDMR) in diamond, used for spin state detection and based on reading the photocurrent resulting from NV ionization, offers physical and technical advantages for the development of miniaturized and scalable quantum sensors, as well as solid-state quantum information devices integrated with electronics. Charge exchanges between NV centers and other optoelectrically active defects in diamond are an essential part of the PDMR scheme, impacting the spin-state control and the performances of the photoelectric readout. Through experimental characterization and modeling, processes governing the spin-state contrast, in particular the hole carrier contribution to the photocurrent and the role of acceptor-type defects are discussed. Such acceptor defects can act as traps for free electrons resulting from NV photoionization. Consequently, the hole current can increase at resonance, ultimately leading to an inversion of the sign of PDMR resonances, i.e. to a positive spin contrast. Based on these findings, a method to improve PDMR performances in terms of spin contrast and photoelectric detection rate by selectively ionizing low-energy acceptor defects using a bias red illumination is proposed. This method is shown to lead to a significant improvement of the photoelectric spin detection sensitivity, important for future practical devices.

TI Topological classification of time-asymmetry in unitary quantum
   processes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Understanding which physical processes are symmetric with respect to time inversion is a ubiquitous problem in physics. In quantum physics, effective gauge fields allow emulation of matter under strong magnetic fields, realizing the Harper-Hofstadter, the Haldane models, demonstrating one-way waveguides and topologically protected edge states. Central to these discoveries is the chirality induced by time-symmetry breaking. In quantum walk algorithms, recent work has discovered implications time-reversal symmetry breaking has on the transport of quantum states which has enabled a host of new experimental implementations. We provide a full topological classification of Hamiltonian operators that do not exhibit symmetry under time-reversal with respect to the induced transition probabilities between elements in a preferred site-basis, i.e. the nodes of the graph on which the walk takes place. We prove that a quantum process is necessarily time-symmetric for any choice of time-independent Hamiltonian precisely when the underlying support graph is bipartite or no Aharonov-Bohm phases are present in the gauge field. We further prove that certain bipartite graphs exhibit transition probability suppression, but not broken time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, our development of a general framework characterizes gauge potentials on combinatorial graphs. These results and techniques fill an important missing gap in understanding the role this omnipresent effect has in quantum information and computation.

TI Information Acquisition, Scrambling, and Sensitivity to Errors in
   Quantum Chaos
SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE
AB Quantum chaos is the study of footprints of classical chaos in the quantum world. The quantum signatures of chaos can be understood by studying quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic. However, the concepts of integrability, non-integrability and chaos extend to systems without a classical analogue. Here, we first review the classical route from order into chaos. Since nature is fundamentally quantum, we discuss how chaos manifests in the quantum domain. We briefly describe semi-classical methods, and discuss the consequences of chaos in quantum information processing. We review the quantum version of Lyapunov exponents, as quantified by the out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOC), Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy and sensitivity to errors. We then review the study of signatures of quantum chaos using quantum tomography. Classically, if we know the dynamics exactly, as we maintain a constant coarse-grained tracking of the trajectory, we gain exponentially fine-grained information about the initial condition. In the quantum setting, as we track the measurement record with fixed signal-to-noise, we gain increasing information about the initial condition. In the process, we have given a new quantification of operator spreading in Krylov subspaces with quantum state reconstruction. The study of these signatures is not only of theoretical interest but also of practical importance.

TI Generating squeezing and enhancing entanglement in an
   opto-magnomechanical system via pump modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose schemes for generating quantum squeezing and enhancing entanglement in an opto-magnomechanical configuration by periodically modulating the driving field. The system consists of an optical cavity and a ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet micro-bridge supporting a magnon mode and a mechanical vibration mode, in which the mechanical mode couples to the optical mode and the magnon mode via radiation pressure and magnetostrictive interaction, respectively. The optical mode and the magnon mode are driven by classical fields, and the amplitude of the laser field driving the optical cavity is periodically modulated. We find that when the classical fields are red-detuned and their anti-Stokes sidebands scattered by the mechanical motion resonate with the corresponding driven modes, all the modes in the system will be squeezed simultaneously, and the mechanical squeezing can exceed the 3-dB limit. Furthermore, when the driving laser field is red-detuned and the microwave field is blue-detuned, both the bipartite and tripartite entanglements will be generated, and compared to the case without periodical modulation, the entanglements are significantly enhanced. We also show that the schemes have strong robustness against the system dissipations and environmental temperature. Our schemes may provide efficient quantum resources for quantum precision measurement and quantum information processing.

TI Metalorganic Vapor-Phase Epitaxy of plus c/-c GaN Polarity
   Inverted Bilayer for Transverse Quasi-Phase-Matched Wavelength
   Conversion Device
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Photon-pair generation based on optical parametric down-conversion has attracted for the application as a light source for quantum information. Highly efficient wavelength-conversion devices require a polarity-inversion structure when using nitride semiconductors. A transverse quasi-phase-matching (QPM) polarity-inverted GaN bilayer channel waveguide device is suitable for efficient wavelength conversion. This study designed a cross-section device to satisfy the modal dispersion phase-matching condition between the TM02 mode pump light and the TM00 mode signal/idler light. Moreover, an AlN oxidation interlayer fabricates the Ga-polar/N-polar (+c/-c) GaN layers via metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). A 145 nm thick film layer with a macro-step-free surface is grown by optimizing the -c-GaN growth conditions and reducing the substrate off-angle to 0.2 degrees. Next, the AlN layer is oxidized in an electric furnace and MOVPE is used to regrow a 1500 nm thick +c-GaN layer. A macrosteps-free surface can be achieved by reducing the off-angle to 0.2 degrees and optimizing the -c-GaN growth conditions to avoid hillock formation. These results pave the way for improving the efficiency of GaN transverse QPM wavelength-conversion devices.

TI Lattice distortion inducing exciton splitting and coherent quantum
   beating in CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Anisotropic exchange splitting in semiconductor quantum dots results in bright-exciton fine-structure splitting important for quantum information processing. Direct measurement of fine-structure splitting usually requires single/few quantum dots at liquid-helium temperature because of its sensitivity to quantum dot size and shape, whereas measuring and controlling fine-structure splitting at an ensemble level seem to be impossible unless all the dots are made to be nearly identical. Here we report strong bright-exciton fine-structure splitting up to 1.6 meV in solution-processed CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots, manifested as quantum beats in ensemble-level transient absorption at liquid-nitrogen to room temperature. The splitting is robust to quantum dot size and shape heterogeneity, and increases with decreasing temperature, pointing towards a mechanism associated with orthorhombic distortion of the perovskite lattice. Effective-mass-approximation calculations reveal an intrinsic 'fine-structure gap' that agrees well with the observed fine-structure splitting. This gap stems from an avoided crossing of bright excitons confined in orthorhombically distorted quantum dots that are bounded by the pseudocubic {100} family of planes.
   Halide perovskites feature highly dynamic lattices, but their impact on exciton fine structure remains unexplored. Here, the authors show that these lattices lead to a bright-exciton fine structure gap, enabling observation of quantum beats in a non-uniform ensemble.

TI Effect of Reactive Ion Etching on the Luminescence of GeV Color Centers
   in CVD Diamond Nanocrystals
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The negatively charged germanium-vacancy GeV- color centers in diamond nanocrystals are solid-state photon emitters suited for quantum information technologies, bio-sensing, and labeling applications. Due to the small Huang-Rhys factor, the GeV--center zero-phonon line emission is expected to be very intensive and spectrally narrow. However, structural defects and the inhomogeneous distribution of local strains in the nanodiamonds result in the essential broadening of the ZPL. Therefore, clarification and elimination of the reasons for the broadening of the GeV- center ZPL is an important problem. We report on the effect of reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma on the structure and luminescence properties of nanodiamonds grown by hot filament chemical vapor deposition. Emission of GeV- color centers ensembles at about 602 nm in as-grown and etched nanodiamonds is probed using micro-photoluminescence and micro-Raman spectroscopy at room and liquid nitrogen temperature. We show that the etching removes the nanodiamond surface sp(2)-induced defects resulting in a reduction in the broad luminescence background and a narrowing of the diamond Raman band. The zero-phonon luminescence band of the ensemble of the GeV- centers is a superposition of narrow lines originated most likely from the GeV- center sub-ensembles under different uniaxial local strain conditions.

TI The rule for the number of fundamental Peregrine solitons involving
   multiple rogue wave states in the vector Chen-Lee-Liu nonlinear
   Schrödinger equation
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB This study investigates the physical distribution patterns of Peregrine solitons within multi-order rogue wave states and their potential applications in optical systems under the vector Chen-Lee-Liu nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equation framework. Through non-recursive Darboux transformation, we systematically analyze the nonlinear dynamics of vector optical fields during second-harmonic generation, revealing an arithmetic progression in Peregrine soliton evolution across rogue wave orders. For n th-order solutions, the fundamental Peregrine soliton count follows an arithmetic sequence with first term n ( n - 1 ) , last term n ( n + 1 ) , and common difference n , where each rogue wave state comprises fully decoupled Peregrine solitons (e.g., 1/2 for 1st-order, 2/4/6 for 2nd-order, and 6/9/12 for 3rd-order configurations). It is noteworthy that the emergence of nonet rogue wave states (nine Peregrine solitons) in third-order solutions breaks through the conventional even-mode constraint in second-order solutions, opening new avenues for investigating many-body nonlinear interactions in multi-channel photonic devices. These findings provide significant insights into the spatiotemporal localization characteristics of rogue waves in multi-component nonlinear media and their applications in optical sensing and quantum information processing.

TI Quantum state processing through controllable synthetic temporal
   photonic lattices
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Quantum walks on photonic platforms represent a physics-rich framework for quantum measurements, simulations and universal computing. Dynamic reconfigurability of photonic circuitry is key to controlling the walk and retrieving its full operation potential. Universal quantum processing schemes based on time-bin encoding in gated fibre loops have been proposed but not demonstrated yet, mainly due to gate inefficiencies. Here we present a scalable quantum processor based on the discrete-time quantum walk of time-bin-entangled photon pairs on synthetic temporal photonic lattices implemented on a coupled fibre-loop system. We utilize this scheme to path-optimize quantum state operations, including the generation of two- and four-level time-bin entanglement and the respective two-photon interference. The design of the programmable temporal photonic lattice enabled us to control the dynamic of the walk, leading to an increase in the coincidence counts and quantum interference measurements without recurring to post-selection. Our results show how temporal synthetic dimensions can pave the way towards efficient quantum information processing, including quantum phase estimation, Boson sampling and the realization of topological phases of matter for high-dimensional quantum systems in a cost-effective, scalable and robust fibre-based setup.
   A scalable quantum processor based on the discrete-time quantum walk of time-bin-entangled photon pairs on synthetic temporal photonic lattices is realized on a fibre-coupled loop system. Key fundamental quantum operations are demonstrated.

TI Generation of entangled-photons by a quantum dot cascade source in
   polarized cavities: Using cavity resonances to boost signals and
   preserve the entanglements
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Motivated by recent advances in the development of single photon emitters for quantum information sciences, here we design and formulate a quantum cascade model that describes cascade emission by a quantum dot (QD) in a cavity structure while preserving entanglement that stores information needed for single photon emission. The theoretical approach is based on a photonic structure that consists of two orthogonal cavities in which resonance with either the first or second of the two emitted photons is possible, leading to amplification and rerouting of the entangled light. The cavity-QD scheme uses a four-level cascade emitter that involves three levels for each polarization, leading to two spatially entangled photons for each polarization. By solving the Schrodinger equation, we identify the characteristic properties of the system, which can be used in conjunction with optimization techniques to achieve the "best" design relative to a set of prioritized criteria or constraints in our optical system. The theoretical investigations include an analysis of emission spectra in addition to the joint spectral density profile, and the results demonstrate the ability of the cavities to act as frequency filters for the photons that make up the entanglements and to modify entanglement properties. The results provide new opportunities for the experimental design and engineering of on-demand single photon sources.

TI Application of Nano-Crystalline Diamond in Tribology
SO MATERIALS
AB Nano-crystalline diamond has been extensively researched and applied in the fields of tribology, optics, quantum information and biomedicine. In virtue of its hardness, the highest in natural materials, diamond outperforms the other materials in terms of wear resistance. Compared to traditional single-crystalline and poly-crystalline diamonds, nano-crystalline diamond consists of disordered grains and thus possesses good toughness and self-sharpening. These merits render nano-crystalline diamonds to have great potential in tribology. Moreover, the re-nucleation of nano-crystalline diamond during preparation is beneficial to decreasing surface roughness due to its ultrafine grain size. Nano-crystalline diamond coatings can have a friction coefficient as low as single-crystal diamonds. This article briefly introduces the approaches to preparing nano-crystalline diamond materials and summarizes their applications in the field of tribology. Firstly, nano-crystalline diamond powders can be used as additives in both oil- and water-based lubricants to significantly enhance their anti-wear property. Nano-crystalline diamond coatings can also act as self-lubricating films when they are deposited on different substrates, exhibiting excellent performance in friction reduction and wear resistance. In addition, the research works related to the tribological applications of nano-crystalline diamond composites have also been reviewed in this paper.

TI Molecular dynamics simulations of cyanine dimers attached to DNA
   Holliday junctions
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Dye aggregates and their excitonic properties are of interest for their applications to organic photovoltaics, non-linear optics, and quantum information systems. DNA scaffolding has been shown to be effective at promoting the aggregation of dyes in a controllable manner. Specifically, isolated DNA Holliday junctions have been used to achieve strongly coupled cyanine dye dimers. However, the structural properties of the dimers and the DNA, as well as the role of Holliday junction isomerization are not fully understood. To study the dynamics of cyanine dimers in DNA, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for adjacent and transverse dimers attached to Holliday junctions in two different isomers. It was found that dyes attached to adjacent strands in the junction exhibit stronger dye-DNA interactions and larger inter-dye separations compared to transversely attached dimers, as well as end-to-end arrangements. Transverse dimers exhibit lower inter-dye separations and more stacked configurations. Furthermore, differences in Holliday junction isomer are analyzed and compared to dye orientations. For transverse dyes exhibiting the smaller inter-dye separations, excitonic couplings were calculated and shown to be in agreement with experiment. Our results suggested that dye attachment locations on DNA Holliday junctions affect dye-DNA interactions, dye dynamics, and resultant dye orientations which can guide the design of DNA-templated cyanine dimers with desired properties.

TI Engineering Periodic Dinuclear Lanthanide-Directed Networks Featuring
   Tunable Energy Level Alignment and Magnetic Anisotropy by Metal Exchange
SO SMALL
AB The design of lanthanide multinuclear networks is an emerging field of research due to the potential of such materials for nanomagnetism, spintronics, and quantum information. Therefore, controlling their electronic and magnetic properties is of paramount importance to tailor the envisioned functionalities. In this work, a multidisciplinary study is presented combining scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray linear dichroism, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, density functional theory, and multiplet calculations, about the supramolecular assembly, electronic and magnetic properties of periodic dinuclear 2D networks based on lanthanide-pyridyl interactions on Au(111). Er- and Dy-directed assemblies feature identical structural architectures stabilized by metal-organic coordination. Notably, despite exhibiting the same +3 oxidation state, there is a shift of the energy level alignment of the unoccupied molecular orbitals between Er- and Dy-directed networks. In addition, there is a reorientation of the easy axis of magnetization and an increment of the magnetic anisotropy when the metallic center is changed from Er to Dy. Thus, the results show that it is feasible to tune the energy level alignment and magnetic anisotropy of a lanthanide-based metal-organic architecture by metal exchange, while preserving the network design.

TI On the Error Exponents of Binary State Discrimination With Composite
   Hypotheses
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The trade-off between the two types of error probabilities in binary state discrimination may be quantified in the asymptotics by various error exponents. In the composite case, where the hypotheses consist of sets of states, any such exponent is upper bounded by the infimum of the corresponding pairwise exponents of discriminating individual members of the two sets. Attainability of this upper bound may depend on the type of exponents considered; whether the problem is classical or quantum; the cardinality and the geometric properties of the sets representing the hypotheses; and also on the dimensionality of the underlying Hilbert space. Our main contribution is clarifying this landscape considerably. We show that in the quantum case unattainability is the general behaviour for all the exponents, already in finite dimension, for a simple null-hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis consisting of only two states. Moreover, the upper bound may be strict even in the infinite-dimensional classical case if the alternative hypothesis contains at least countably infinitely many states. We also prove general attainability results, e.g., for classical adversarial and arbitrarily varying hypothesis testing, and for the quantum case where all states are pure, or the states commute with every state in the opposite hypothesis.

TI Preparation of many-body ground states by time evolution with
   variational microscopic magnetic fields and incomplete interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB State preparation is of fundamental importance in quantum physics, which can be realized by constructing the quantum circuit as a unitary that transforms the initial state to the target, or implementing a quantum control protocol to evolve to the target state with a designed Hamiltonian. In this article, we study the latter on quantum many-body systems by time evolution with fixed couplings and variational magnetic fields. Specifically, we consider preparing the ground states of the Hamiltonians containing certain interactions that are missing in the Hamiltonians for the time evolution. An optimization method is proposed to optimize the magnetic fields by "fine graining" the discretization of time, in order to gain high precision and stability. The automatic differentiation technique is utilized to obtain the gradients of the fields against the logarithmic fidelity. Our method is tested on preparing the ground state of the Heisenberg chain with the time evolution by the XY and Ising interactions, and its performance surpasses two baseline methods that use local and global optimization strategies, respectively. Our work can be applied and generalized to other quantum models such as those defined on higher-dimensional lattices. It enlightens to reduce the complexity of the required interactions for implementing quantum control or other tasks in quantum information and computation by means of optimizing the magnetic fields.

TI Experimental observation of repulsively bound magnons
SO NATURE
AB Stable composite objects, such as hadrons, nuclei, atoms, molecules and superconducting pairs, formed by attractive forces are ubiquitous in nature. By contrast, composite objects stabilized by means of repulsive forces were long thought to be theoretical constructions owing to their fragility in naturally occurring systems. Surprisingly, the formation of bound atom pairs by strong repulsive interactions has been demonstrated experimentally in optical lattices1. Despite this success, repulsively bound particle pairs were believed to have no analogue in condensed matter owing to strong decay channels. Here we present spectroscopic signatures of repulsively bound three-magnon states and bound magnon pairs in the Ising-like chain antiferromagnet BaCo2V2O8. In large transverse fields, below the quantum critical point, we identify repulsively bound magnon states by comparing terahertz spectroscopy measurements to theoretical results for the Heisenberg-Ising chain antiferromagnet, a paradigmatic quantum many-body model2-5. Our experimental results show that these high-energy, repulsively bound magnon states are well separated from continua, exhibit notable dynamical responses and, despite dissipation, are sufficiently long-lived to be identified. As the transport properties in spin chains can be altered by magnon bound states, we envision that such states could serve as resources for magnonics-based quantum information processing technologies6-8.
   Comparison of terahertz spectroscopy measurements with theoretical results for the Heisenberg-Ising chain antiferromagnet demonstrates the existence of repulsively bound magnons in large transverse fields below the quantum critical point.

TI Absorption and scattering limits of silicon nitride integrated photonics
   in the visible spectrum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Visible-light photonic integrated circuits (PICs) promise scalability for technologies such as quantum information, biosensing, and scanning displays, yet extending large-scale silicon photonics to shorter wavelengths has been challenging due to the higher losses. Silicon nitride (SiN) has stood out as the leading platform for visible photonics, but the propagation losses strongly depend on the film's deposition and fabrication processes. Current loss measurement techniques cannot accurately distinguish between absorption and surface scattering, making it difficult to identify the dominant loss source and reach the platform's fundamental limit. Here we demonstrate an ultra-low loss, high-confinement SiN platform that approaches the limits of absorption and scattering across the visible spectrum. Leveraging the sensitivity of microresonators to loss, we probe and discriminate each loss contribution with unparalleled sensitivity, and derive their fundamental limits and scaling laws as a function of wavelength, film properties and waveguide parameters. Through the design of the waveguide cross-section, we show how to approach the absorption limit of the platform, and demonstrate the lowest propagation losses in high-confinement SiN to date across the visible spectrum. We envision that our techniques for loss characterization and minimization will contribute to the development of large-scale, dense PICs that redefine the loss limits of integrated platforms across the electromagnetic spectrum.

TI Saturability of the Quantum Cramér–Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum
   Estimation at the Single-Copy Level
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB The quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This letter establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.

TI Advancing broadband light structuring through single-size nanostructured
   all-dielectric meta-devices
SO MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Traditional optical components and most artificially engineered structures (metamaterials) used for light manipulation are usually designed for narrow bandwidth and limited functionalities. Furthermore, bulkiness and inefficiency limit their application for integrated devices. Metasurfaces, the ultracompact counterpart of bulky metamaterials, exhibit an unprecedented ability to manipulate incident electromagnetic waves at a micron scale. Metasurfaces have emerged as promising candidates for light structuring and its potential applications, ranging from high-capacity data communication to particle manipulation. Despite significant advancement in metasurfaces, realizing high-performance metadevices exhibiting a broadband light manipulation capability is still challenging due to the material's intrinsic nature and lack of a more straightforward design methodology. Here, we demonstrated a broadband single-cell driven all-dielectric metadevice platform to realize high-performance phase modulation for light structuring over the broad visible spectrum (475 - 650nm). The building block consists of an intelligently optimized nanoantenna made of unique zinc sulfide material that employs the PB phase to realize single-layered broadband metadevices for structured light generation, ensuring a decent average transmission efficiency & eta;avg = 79.9% over the intended band. To prove the concept, we designed numerous metadevices for structured light generation and numerically investigated each under the illumination of selected visible wavelengths. We envisioned that the presented work could accelerate real-life applications such as highresolution color imaging, optical communication and sensing, quantum information processing, and micromanipulation.

TI Meta-Structured Silicon Nanophotonic Polarization Beam Splitter with an
   Optical Bandwidth of 415 nm
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The polarization beam splitter (PBS) is a pivotal element in the polarization management of free-space optical instruments and systems. Photonic integrated circuits for sensing, imaging, communications, and quantum-information processing also have needs for monolithically integrated PBSs with an ultra-broad optical bandwidth. In this paper, a novel silicon nanophotonic PBS inspired by the crystalline Glan-Thompson prism but implemented with silicon subwavelength-grating (SWG) metamaterials is presented. Due to the tailored artificial anisotropy of SWGs, the meta-prism functions like a thin-film reflector or a waveguide crossing for different polarizations. Thus, the incident light can be steered with strong polarization selectivity and negligible wavelength dependence. Unlike conventional PBS designs, the routing of polarized light is enabled by the wavelengthindependent total internal reflection in anisotropy-engineered effective media, thereby breaking the bandwidth limit. The device footprint is as small as approximate to 15 x 7 mu m(2). Low insertion losses of 0.6-1.7 dB and high extinction ratios of 20-30 dB are experimentally achieved spanning a record broad bandwidth of over 415 nm, ranging from 1.26 to 1.675 mu m wavelength. These results represent, to the best of their knowledge, the most broadband integrated PBS ever demonstrated to date.

TI Spontaneous and stimulated electron-photon interactions in nanoscale
   plasmonic near fields
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The interplay between free electrons, light, and matter offers unique prospects for space, time, and energy resolved optical material characterization, structured light generation, and quantum information processing. Here, we study the nanoscale features of spontaneous and stimulated electron-photon interactions mediated by localized surface plasmon resonances at the tips of a gold nanostar using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (CL), and photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). Supported by numerical electromagnetic boundary-element method (BEM) calculations, we show that the different coupling mechanisms probed by EELS, CL, and PINEM feature the same spatial dependence on the electric field distribution of the tip modes. However, the electron-photon interaction strength is found to vary with the incident electron velocity, as determined by the spatial Fourier transform of the electric near-field component parallel to the electron trajectory. For the tightly confined plasmonic tip resonances, our calculations suggest an optimum coupling velocity at electron energies as low as a few keV. Our results are discussed in the context of more complex geometries supporting multiple modes with spatial and spectral overlap. We provide fundamental insights into spontaneous and stimulated electron-light-matter interactions with key implications for research on (quantum) coherent optical phenomena at the nanoscale.

TI Single-Molecule Detection Technologies: Advances in Devices,
   Transduction Mechanisms, and Functional Materials for Real-World
   Biomedical and Environmental Applications
SO BIOSENSORS-BASEL
AB Single-molecule detection (SMD) has reformed analytical science by enabling the direct observation of individual molecular events, thus overcoming the limitations of ensemble-averaged measurements. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the principles, devices, and emerging materials that have shaped the current landscape of SMD. We explore a wide range of sensing mechanisms, including surface plasmon resonance, mechanochemical transduction, transistor-based sensing, optical microfiber platforms, fluorescence-based techniques, Raman scattering, and recognition tunneling, which offer distinct advantages in terms of label-free operation, ultrasensitivity, and real-time responsiveness. Each technique is critically examined through representative case studies, revealing how innovations in device architecture and signal amplification strategies have collectively pushed the detection limits into the femtomolar to attomolar range. Beyond the sensing principles, this review highlights the transformative role of advanced nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, MnO2 nanosheets, upconversion nanocrystals, and magnetic nanoparticles. These materials enable new transduction pathways and augment the signal strength, specificity, and integration into compact and wearable biosensing platforms. We also detail the multifaceted applications of SMD across biomedical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, food safety, neuroscience, materials science, and quantum technologies, underscoring its relevance to global health, safety, and sustainability. Despite significant progress, the field faces several critical challenges, including signal reproducibility, biocompatibility, fabrication scalability, and data interpretation complexity. To address these barriers, we propose future research directions involving multimodal transduction, AI-assisted signal analytics, surface passivation techniques, and modular system design for field-deployable diagnostics. By providing a cross-disciplinary synthesis of device physics, materials science, and real-world applications, this review offers a comprehensive roadmap for the next generation of SMD technologies, poised to impact both fundamental research and translational healthcare.

TI Metastable dynamics of Rydberg atomic system under electromagnetically
   induced transparency
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Open quantum system, coupled with an external bath is a key research field of quantum physics. Steady state is the state in which any initial state converges after a long time and is usually of the most interest. However, relatively speaking, the nonequilibrium dynamical processes of quantum many-body systems have been rarely studied. This is mainly due to the fact that quantum many-body systems generally have interactions, and the Hilbert space required for a complete description of their dynamical processes will grow exponentially with the number of particles increasing, and the computational difficulty will increase dramatically as well. Hence, it is a difficult problem to completely describe their dynamical processes completely. With the development of quantum technologies, the interest in the nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is aroused. A common phenomenon is the metastable state, where the system initially relaxes into a long-lived state and then converges to the final stationary state for a longer time. In this paper, we establish a low-dimensional approximation to describe the metastability dynamics in Markovian open quantum system, based on the spectra of the Liouvillian super-operator. The separation of time scales implies a splitting in the spectrum, and this spectral division allows us to eliminate the fast decay modes by using the perturbation method, and then we establish the effective description in the low-lying eigenmodes subspace. Furthermore, we study the dynamics process of the Rydberg atomic system under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions and find that the system can handle metastable dynamics if the atomic interactions are considered. We compare the effective dynamics in the subspace with the actual dynamics in the full space, and the results show that the effective dynamics works well on condition that the perturbation approximation holds. Our work provides a feasible idea and method for establishing an effective and simplified description of the dynamical process of open quantum many-body systems.

TI Monolithic VECSEL for stable kHz linewidth
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting semiconductor lasers (VECSELs) are of increasing interest for applications requiring ultra-coherence and/or low noise at novel wavelengths; performance that is currently achieved via high-Q, air-spaced resonators to achieve long intracavity photon lifetimes (for the so-called class-A low noise regime), power scaling and high beam quality. Here, we report on the development of a compact, electronically tunable, monolithic cavity, class-A VECSEL (monolithic VECSEL) for ultra-narrow free-running linewidths. A multi-quantum-well, resonant periodic gain structure with integrated distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) was optically-bonded to an air-gap-free laser resonator created inside a right-angle fused silica prism to suppress the influence of environmental noise on the external laser oscillation, thus achieving high stability. Mode-hop-free wavelength tuning is performed via the stabilized temperature; or electronically, and with low latency, via a shear piezo-electric transducer mounted on the top of the prism. The free-running linewidth, estimated via the frequency power spectral density (PSD), is sub-kHz over ms timescales and <1.9 kHz for time sampling as long as 1s, demonstrating at least two orders-of-magnitude improvement in noise performance compared to previously reported single frequency VECSELs. The stable, total internal reflection resonator concept is akin to the prevalent monolithic non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO), however the monolithic VECSEL has several important advantages: tailored emission wavelength (via semiconductor bandgap engineering), no relaxation oscillations, no applied magnetic field, and low requirements on the pump beam quality. This approach is power-scalable in principle and could be applied to VECSELs at any of the wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared at which they are already available, to create a range of robust, ultra-coherent laser systems with reduced bulkiness and complexity. This is of particular interest for remote metrology and the translation of quantum technologies, such as optical clocks, from research laboratories into real world applications.

TI MetaSeeker: sketching an open invisible space with self-play
   reinforcement learning
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Controlling electromagnetic (EM) waves at will is fundamentally important for diverse applications, ranging from optical microcavities, super-resolution imaging, to quantum information processing. Decades ago, the forays into metamaterials and transformation optics have ignited unprecedented interest to create an invisibility cloak-a closed space with any object inside invisible. However, all features of the scattering waves become stochastic and uncontrollable when EM waves interact with an open and disordered environment, making an open invisible space almost impossible. Counterintuitively, here we for the first time present an open, cluttered, and dynamic but invisible space, wherein any freely-moving object maintains invisible. To adapt to the disordered environment, we randomly organize a swarm of reconfigurable metasurfaces, and master them by MetaSeeker, a population-based reinforcement learning (RL). MetaSeeker constructs a narcissistic internal world to mirror the stochastic physical world, capable of autonomous preferment, evolution, and adaptation. In the perception-decision-execution experiment, multiple RL agents automatically interact with the ever-changing environments and integrate a post-hoc explainability to visualize the decision-making process. The hidden objects, such as vehicle cluster and experimenter, can freely scale, race, and track in the invisible space, with the environmental similarity of 99.5%. Our results constitute a monumental stride to reshape the evolutionary landscape of metasurfaces from individual to swarm intelligence and usher in the remote management of entire EM space.

TI Holographic foliations: Self-similar quasicrystals from hyperbolic
   honeycombs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of (d & thorn; 1)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a d-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar "quasicrystalline" properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a "holographic foliation": a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local, invertible way. In the {3, 5, 3} tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.

TI Spin-Bounded Correlations: Rotation Boxes Within and Beyond Quantum
   Theory
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB How can detector click probabilities respond to spatial rotations around a fixed axis, in any possible physical theory? Here, we give a thorough mathematical analysis of this question in terms of "rotation boxes", which are analogous to the well-known notion of non-local boxes. We prove that quantum theory admits the most general rotational correlations for spins 0, 1/2, and 1, but we describe a metrological game where beyond-quantum resources of spin 3/2 outperform all quantum resources of the same spin. We prove a multitude of fundamental results about these correlations, including an exact convex characterization of the spin-1 correlations, a Tsirelson-type inequality for spins 3/2 and higher, and a proof that the general spin-J correlations provide an efficient outer SDP approximation to the quantum set. Furthermore, we review and consolidate earlier results that hint at a wealth of applications of this formalism: a theory-agnostic semi-device-independent randomness generator, an exact characterization of the quantum (2, 2, 2)-Bell correlations in terms of local symmetries, and the derivation of multipartite Bell witnesses. Our results illuminate the foundational question of how space constrains the structure of quantum theory, they build a bridge between semi-device-independent quantum information and spacetime physics, and they demonstrate interesting relations to topics such as entanglement witnesses, spectrahedra, and orbitopes.

TI Quasi-one-dimensional Pb5Re3O15: A
   5d realization of the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic compounds connect the exact solutions of low-dimensional magnetic geometries, which promise quantum spin liquid behavior and exotic quasiparticles, with real-world materials, in which competing magnetic interactions affect their implementation in quantum information science. Here, the structural determination and quasi-1D magnetic behavior of a previously unreported compound, Pb5Re3O15, is presented. Like the anisotropic triangular A(3)ReO(5)Cl(2) (A = Ba, Sr, Ca) materials, Pb5Re3O15 contains [ReO5] square pyramids inserted into anion-centered quasi-two-dimensional layers and hosts spin-1/2 moments on the Re6+ ions. Pb5Re3O15, however, has a more ideal quasi-1D geometry than the A(3)ReO(5)Cl(2) materials, with larger interchain distances and interlayer spacing. Quasi-1D magnetic behavior in Pb5Re3O15 is confirmed by fitting the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility with the Bonner-Fisher model for a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetically coupled chain, yielding an intrachain coupling constant of |J|/k(B) = 54.5 K. Pb5Re3O15 is highly insulating at room temperature, and heat capacity data below 10 K reveal a linear-T contribution that suggests the presence of low-temperature spinon excitations. With a lack of three-dimensional ordering down to at least 0.6 K, Pb5Re3O15 is proposed as a model system for studying the quantum magnetism of quasi-1D Heisenberg chains in a real-world 5d(1) antiferromagnetic material.

TI Advances in light transverse momenta and optical lateral forces
SO ADVANCES IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
AB Harnessing linear and angular momenta of light is one of the cornerstones in modern optics and has found tremendous applications in optical circuits, particle manipulation, metrology, quantum information processing, etc. Emerging theoretical protocols and experimental explorations have created a surge of interest in light lateral momenta and forces, which are perpendicular to the light wave propagation direction. However, there is yet a lack of a comprehensive and holistic overview of transverse momenta (both linear and angular) as well as of optical lateral forces (OLFs). In this article, we first review the most recent transverse momenta including the transverse spin angular momentum, optical skyrmions, as well as lateral momenta from directional side scattering, spin-orbit interaction, and surface plasmon polaritons. Since optical forces result from the momentum exchange between light and matter, the transverse momentum consequently gives rise to intriguing OLFs, which is the second topic of this article. Additional non-trivial lateral forces that combine optics with other effects from thermodynamics, electricity, and microfluidics, are also discussed. It should be emphasized that these momenta and forces ubiquitously exist in a broad range of optical phenomena and have often been neglected due to their unpredicted underlying physics and shortage of experimental means, especially prior to the last decade.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Symmetry-enforced topological nodal planes at the Fermi surface of a
   chiral magnet
SO NATURE
AB Despite recent efforts to advance spintronics devices and quantum information technology using materials with non-trivial topological properties, three key challenges are still unresolved(1-9). First, the identification of topological band degeneracies that are generically rather than accidentally located at the Fermi level. Second, the ability to easily control such topological degeneracies. And third, the identification of generic topological degeneracies in large, multisheeted Fermi surfaces. By combining de Haas-van Alphen spectroscopy with density functional theory and band-topology calculations, here we show that the non-symmorphic symmetries(10-17) in chiral, ferromagnetic manganese silicide (MnSi) generate nodal planes (NPs)(11,12), which enforce topological protectorates (TPs) with substantial Berry curvatures at the intersection of the NPs with the Fermi surface (FS) regardless of the complexity of the FS. We predict that these TPs will be accompanied by sizeable Fermi arcs subject to the direction of the magnetization. Deriving the symmetry conditions underlying topological NPs, we show that the 1,651 magnetic space groups comprise 7 grey groups and 26 black-and-white groups with topological NPs, including the space group of ferromagnetic MnSi. Thus, the identification of symmetry-enforced TPs, which can be controlled with a magnetic field, on the FS of MnSi suggests the existence of similar properties-amenable for technological exploitation-in a large number of materials.

TI Large-Mode-Field Low-Loss Trident Edge Coupler Based on Thin-Film
   Lithium Niobate Platform
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has rapidly emerged as a highly competitive integrated photonic platform in fields such as data communication, microwave photonics, and quantum information processing. However, as a critical interface for chip-fiber links, the TFLN edge coupler is limited by its mode field diameter, exhibiting extremely low assembly tolerance when coupling with a standard single-mode fiber (SSMF), which severely restricts its application. Here, we propose a TFLN edge coupler based on a silicon nitride trident structure. By converting the small mode field of the lithium niobate waveguide into the large mode field of the Si3N4 trident structure, a high-efficiency, high-tolerance, and process-compatible edge coupler is constructed. Three-dimensional simulation results show that the device exhibits a mode field diameter greater than 8 mu m, with TE mode coupling loss less than 0.71 dB, TM mode coupling loss less than 0.91 dB in the C+L band, and polarization-dependent loss below 0.41 dB. This device provides a promising solution to the challenge of high-performance, high-tolerance interconnection between TFLN chips and SSMFs.

TI Transmission electron microscopy with in-situ ion irradiation:
   Facilities and community
SO VACUUM
AB Whilst there is a clear scientific and technological need for the technical capabilities of transmission electron microscopes with in-situ ion irradiation, it also requires a collaborative community of international researchers to support such facilities in successfully meeting this demand. Instruments of this type serve to provide fundamental understanding of the mechanisms which drive changes in materials important to nuclear fission and fusion energy, the semiconductor industry, quantum information systems, space travel, astronomy, geology and many more applications. As these areas continue to evolve and the instrumentation possibilities expand, the capacity of in-situ ion irradiation facilities must also develop hand-in-hand with the user community to deliver an ever-greater diversity of high-fidelity extreme-environment experimentation. Future directions for the field, such as miniaturization from MEMS/microfluidic devices and advanced controls with ML-based analysis, continuously emerge to advance both the hardware and software which support the coupling of TEMs with ion beams. This review sets out to provide up-to-date insights into the community and advancement of current, and development of future, facilities which have the potential to further unlock access to the nanoscale exploration of coupled extreme environments crucial to many of the important science and engineering challenges we face today.

TI Ultrafast quantum control of atomic excited states via interferometric
   two-photon Rabi oscillations
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum-state manipulation through coherent interaction with a radiation field is a fundamental process with broad implications in quantum optics and quantum information processing. However, current quantum control methods are limited by their operation at Rabi frequencies below the gigahertz range, which restricts their applicability to systems with long coherence times. To overcome this limitation, alternative approaches utilizing ultrafast driving lasers have garnered great interest. In this work, we demonstrate two-photon Rabi oscillations in the excited states of argon operating at terahertz frequencies driven by ultrafast laser pulses. Leveraging quantum-path interferometry, we are able to measure and manipulate both the amplitudes and phases of the transition dipoles by exploiting the intensity and polarization state of the driving laser. This precise control enables femtosecond population transfer and coherent accumulation of geometric phase. Our findings provide valuable insights into the all-optical manipulation of extreme-ultraviolet radiations and demonstrate the possibility of ultrafast quantum control through interferometric multiphoton transitions.
   Quantum control with coherent radiation fields typically operate at Rabi frequencies below the GHz, limiting the applicability of this scheme to systems with long coherence times. Via quantum path intereferometry, the authors overcome this limitation and control two-photon Rabi oscillations between excited states driven by femtosecond laser pulses.

TI Unlocking phonon properties of a large and diverse set of cubic crystals
   by indirect bottom-up machine learning approach
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Although first principles based anharmonic lattice dynamics is one of the most common methods to obtain phonon properties, such method is impractical for high-throughput search of target thermal materials. We develop an elemental spatial density neural network force field as a bottom-up approach to accurately predict atomic forces of similar to 80,000 cubic crystals spanning 63 elements. The primary advantage of our indirect machine learning model is the accessibility of phonon transport physics at the same level as first principles, allowing simultaneous prediction of comprehensive phonon properties from a single model. Training on 3182 first principles data and screening 77,091 unexplored structures, we identify 13,461 dynamically stable cubic structures with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity below 1Wm(-1)K(-1), among which 36 structures are validated by first principles calculations. We propose mean square displacement and bonding-antibonding as two low-cost descriptors to ease the demand of expensive first principles calculations for fast screening ultralow thermal conductivity. Our model also quantitatively reveals the correlation between off-diagonal coherence and diagonal populations and identifies the distinct crossover from particle-like to wave-like heat conduction. Our algorithm is promising for accelerating discovery of novel phononic crystals for emerging applications, such as thermoelectrics, superconductivity, and topological phonons for quantum information technology.

TI Guard-Ring-Free InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diode Based on a
   Novel One-Step Zn-Diffusion Technique
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB This work presents a novel InGaAs/InP SPAD structure fabricated using a selective area growth (SAG) method. The surface topography of the selectively grown film deposited within the 70 mu m diffusion apertures is used to engineer the Zn diffusion profile to suppress premature edge breakdown. The device achieves a highly uniform active area without the need for shallow diffused guard ring (GR) regions that are inherent in standard InGaAs/InP SPADs. We have obtained 33% and 43% photon detection probability (PDP) at 1550 nm, with 5 V and 7 V excess bias, respectively. These measurements were performed at 300 K and 225 K. The dark count rate (DCR) per unit area at room temperature and at 5 V excess bias is 430 cps/mu m(2) and it decreases to 5 cps/mu m(2) at 225 K. Timing jitter is measured with passive quenching at 1550nm as 149 ps at full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), (300 K, 5 V excess bias). The proposed technology is suitable for a number of applications, including optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR), quantum information, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR).

TI Engineering Chemisorption of Fe4 Single-Molecule Magnets on
   Gold
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Gaining control over the grafting geometry is critically important for any application of surface-supported single-molecule magnets (SMMs) in data storage, spintronics, and quantum information science. Here, tetrairon(III) SMMs with a propeller-like structure are functionalized with thioacetyl-terminated alkyl chains to promote chemisorption on gold surfaces from solution and to evaluate differences in adsorption geometry and magnetic properties as a function of chain length. The prepared monolayers are investigated using X-ray absorption techniques with linearly and circularly polarized light to extract geometrical and magnetic information, respectively. All derivatives remain intact and form partially oriented monolayers on the gold surface. A ligand-field analysis of the observed X-ray natural linear dichroism shows that the threefold molecular axis is invariably biased toward the surface normal, in agreement with ab initio calculations. This preferential orientation is most pronounced in monolayers of the shortest-chain derivative, which are further studied with an ultralow temperature X-ray magnetic circular dichroism setup operating down to 350 mK. The isothermal field sweeps with the magnetic field at normal incidence show an open hysteresis loop below 1 K, while measurements at different incidence angles prove the magnetic anisotropy of the monolayers.

TI Ultra-small millimeter-wave filter chips based on high-K single-crystal
   lithium niobate
SO MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING
AB Next-generation communication systems require the mass deployment of ultra-small, high-performance filters that integrate multi-physical domains. However, achieving an optimal balance between miniaturization, low insertion loss, high selectivity, and low cost of millimeter-wave filters remains a challenge for existing technologies. Herein, we propose and demonstrate ultra-small millimeter-wave filters based on the multifunctional lithium niobate (LN) with outstanding nonlinear optical, electro-optic, piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and thermoelectric characteristics. As a high-K material with low dielectric loss and straightforward fabrication, LN provides an ideal platform for integrating photonic, acoustic, and electromagnetic functionalities. Notably, while LN is already proven for acoustic and optical signal processing, its potential for electromagnetic signal processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce second-order and fourth-order LN-based millimeter-wave bandpass filters (BPFs) tailored for narrowband and wideband millimeter-wave applications, respectively. Through careful optimization of the LN thickness, we elevate the cutoff frequencies of high-order modes, enhancing frequency selectivity while maintaining compactness. The LN-based BPFs exhibit record-breaking performance metrics, including minimal insertion loss, high selectivity, and compatibility with microfabrication processes. The LN-based BPFs fulfill the critical demands of millimeter-wave wireless communications, sensing, imaging, and emerging quantum information systems, paving the way for scalable, multi-physical integrated circuits.

TI Achievement of pure transverse spin angular momentum at the focal plane
   by tightly focused generalized hybrid polarized vector beams
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The transverse spin angular momentum (SAM) observed in evanescent waves, interference fields, and tightly focused vector beams is directly related to both academic research and technical applications. In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally generate the generalized hybrid polarized vector beam (GHPVB), which superimposes the orthogonal electric field vector components of the two cylindrical vector beams with topological charges m1 and m2, with an initial phase difference of between them. First, we investigate the longitudinal SAM separation in weakly focused GHPVBs. It is shown that the superposition effect of the initial phase difference and the Gouy phase difference psi during the focusing process of GHPVBs determines their polarization state transition and SAM evolution. Secondly, we study the three-dimensional SAM distribution in tightly focused GHPVBs. It is found that, unlike the incident field and weakly focused field which can only have longitudinal SAM, under the condition of im1 = im2 ei psi, tightly focused GHPVBs exhibit the pure transverse SAM distribution at the focal plane. The presented work enriches the generation approaches of pure transverse SAM and deepens the understanding and manipulation of the angular momentum properties of light fields. This pure transverse SAM has broad application prospects in regimes such as optical micromanipulation, spin-dependent directional coupling, quantum information processing, and integrated spin-selective devices.

TI Breaking the Cut-Off Wavelength Limit of GaTe through Self-Driven Oxygen
   Intercalation in Air
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Low symmetric two dimensional (2D) semiconductors are of great significance for their potential applications in polarization-sensitive photodetection and quantum information devices. However, their real applications are limited by their photo-detecting wavelength ranges, which are restricted by their fundamental optical bandgaps. Recently, intercalation has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy to modulate the optical bandgaps of 2D semiconductors. Here, the authors report the self-driven oxygen (O-2) intercalation induced bandgap reduction from 1.75 to 1.19 eV in gallium telluride (GaTe) in air. This bandgap shrinkage provides the long-wavelength detection threshold above approximate to 1100 nm for O-2 intercalated GaTe (referred to as GaTe-O-2), well beyond the cut-off wavelength at approximate to 708 nm for pristine GaTe. The GaTe-O-2 photodetectors have a high photoresponsivity, and highly anisotropic photodetection behavior to even sub-waveband radiation. The dichroic ratio (I-max/I-min) of photocurrent is about 1.39 and 2.9 for 600 nm and 1100 nm, respectively. This findings demonstrates a broadband photodetector utilizing GaTe after breaking through its bandgap limitation by self-driven O-2 intercalation in air and further reveal its photoconductivity anisotropic nature. This provides design strategies of 2D materials-based high-performance broadband photodetectors for the exploration of polarized state information.

TI Polarization-independent quadri-channel vortex beam generator based on
   transmissive coding metasurface
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB In the 1990s, it was recognized that light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have benefited applications ranging from optical manipulation to quantum information processing. In recent years, attention has been directed towards the opportunities for communication systems due to the inspiring application potential in both the optical and microwave fields. In this paper, a polarization-independent quadri-channel vortex beam generator based on transmissive metasurface is proposed that can achieve selectivity of polarization, 2-bit OAM modes and spatial distribution in the quadri-channel simultaneously. The transmissive metasurface consists of four metallic layers and three dielectric layers and is designed, fabricated, and experimentally demonstrated to generate multi-mode and dual-polarization OAM vortex beams at 10.0 GHz. Orthogonal polarization and 2-bit information are carried by OAM modes +1, -1 + 2 and -2 and a different phase gradient is superimposed at each channel to realize beam steering, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the information. The simulation and experimental results verify that the vortex beams with different OAM modes in dual polarizations can be flexibly generated by using transmissive metasurfaces. The proposed method and metasurface pave a way to add extra channels to create an additional set of data carriers for space-division multiplexing (SDM).

TI Cryogenic Controller for Electrostatically Controlled Quantum Dots in
   22-nm Quantum SoC
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS SOCIETY
AB We present a fully integrated cryogenic controller for electrostatically controlled quantum dots (QDs) implemented in a commercial 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS process and operating in a quantum regime. The QDs are realized in local well areas of transistors separated by tunnel barriers controlled by voltages applied to gate terminals. The QD arrays (QDA) are co-located with the control circuitry inside each quantum experiment cell, with a total of 28 of such cells comprising this system-on-chip (SoC). The QDA structure is controlled by small capacitive digital-to-analog converters (CDACs) and its quantum state is measured by a single-electron detector. The SoC operates at a cryogenic temperature of 3.4 K. The occupied area of each QDA is 0.7 x 0.4 mu m(2), while each QD occupies only 20 x 80 nm(2). The low power and miniaturized area of these circuits are an important step on the way for integration of a large quantum core with millions of QDs, required for practical quantum computers. The performance and functionality of the CDAC are validated in a loop-back mode with the detector sensing the CDAC-compelled electron tunneling from the quantum point contact (QPC) node into the quantum structure. The position of the injected charge inside the QDA is intended to be controlled through the CDAC codes and programmable pulse width. Quantum effects are shown by an experimental characterization of charge injection and quantization into the QDA consisting of three coupled QDs. The charge can be transferred to a QD and sensed at the QPC, and this process is controlled by the relevant voltages and CDACs.

TI Quantum coherence in neutrino spin-flavor oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Coherence, which represents the superposition of orthogonal states, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and can also be precisely defined within quantum resource theory. Thus exploring quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations can not only help in examining the intrinsic quantum nature but can also explore their potential applications in quantum information technologies. Previous studies on quantum coherence have focused on neutrino flavor oscillations (FO). However, FO imply that neutrinos have mass, and this can lead to the generation of a tiny but finite magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos through quantum loop diagrams at higher orders of perturbative expansion of the interaction. This electromagnetic property of neutrinos can induce spin flavor oscillations (SFO) in the presence of an external magnetic field and hence is expected to enrich the study of coherence. In this work, we investigate quantum coherence in neutrino SFO with three flavor mixing within the interstellar as well as intergalactic magnetic fields, quantified by the l1 norm and the relative entropy of coherence, and express these measures in terms of neutrino SFO probabilities. For FO, coherence measures can sustain higher values (say, within 50% of the maximum) over distances of several kilometers, which are relevant for terrestrial experiments like reactor and accelerator neutrinos. However, for SFO, we find that the coherence scale can extend to astrophysical distances, spanning from kiloparsecs to gigaparsecs.

TI Single-Mode Lasing by Selective Mode Structure Breaking
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Single-mode lasers are highly desirable for applications in optical communication, quantum information, and photonic computing, but their realization is challenging due to the competition of multiple closely spaced resonant modes in microcavities. This paper proposes a novel approach, termed mode structure breaking, to achieve high-performance single-mode lasing in an individual laser cavity. By introducing selective spatial structure defects, the mode structure of competing modes can be broken, enabling single-mode selection without huge losses. As proof of concept, femtosecond (fs)-laser ablation is experimentally employed to introduce external angle defects on a microdisk cavity, effectively eliminating mismatched competing modes and thus achieving single-mode lasing output. The lasing characteristics are further optimized by incorporating a punched hole to suppress remaining high-order lasing modes. Notably, the fabricated perovskite laser sources, which are called mode-structure-breaking lasers, demonstrate excellent single-mode lasing properties, including stability, an ultralow threshold (approximate to 2.31 mu J cm-2), and a narrow linewidth (approximate to 0.15 nm). Conclusively, this comprehensive study of manipulating lasing mode by breaking mode structure may provide a promising approach to realizing single-mode lasing in a single structure, which is significant for producing on-chip laser source arrays for use in photonic integrated circuits.

TI Sculpting ultrastrong light-matter coupling through spatial matter
   structuring
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The central theme of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the coupling of a single optical mode with a single matter excitation, leading to a doublet of cavity polaritons which govern the optical properties of the coupled structure. Especially in the ultrastrong coupling regime, where the ratio of the vacuum Rabi frequency and the quasi-resonant carrier frequency of light, Omega(R)/omega(c), approaches unity, the polariton doublet bridges a large spectral bandwidth 2 Omega(R), and further interactions with off-resonant light and matter modes may occur. The resulting multi-mode coupling has recently attracted attention owing to the additional degrees of freedom for designing light-matter coupled resonances, despite added complexity. Here, we experimentally implement a novel strategy to sculpt ultrastrong multi-mode coupling by tailoring the spatial overlap of multiple modes of planar metallic THz resonators and the cyclotron resonances of Landau-quantized two-dimensional electrons, on subwavelength scales. We show that similarly to the selection rules of classical optics, this allows us to suppress or enhance certain coupling pathways and to control the number of light-matter coupled modes, their octave-spanning frequency spectra, and their response to magnetic tuning. This offers novel pathways for controlling dissipation, tailoring quantum light sources, nonlinearities, correlations as well as entanglement in quantum information processing.

TI Realization of a fractional quantum Hall state with ultracold atoms
SO NATURE
AB Strongly interacting topological matter(1) exhibits fundamentally new phenomena with potential applications in quantum information technology(2,3). Emblematic instances are fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states(4), in which the interplay of a magnetic field and strong interactions gives rise to fractionally charged quasi-particles, long-ranged entanglement and anyonic exchange statistics. Progress in engineering synthetic magnetic fields(5-21) has raised the hope to create these exotic states in controlled quantum systems. However, except for a recent Laughlin state of light(22), preparing FQH states in engineered systems remains elusive. Here we realize a FQH state with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. The state is a lattice version of a bosonic ? = 1/2 Laughlin state(4,23) with two particles on 16 sites. This minimal system already captures many hallmark features of Laughlin-type FQH states(24-28): we observe a suppression of two-body interactions, we find a distinctive vortex structure in the density correlations and we measure a fractional Hall conductivity of s(H)/s(0) = 0.6(2) by means of the bulk response to a magnetic perturbation. Furthermore, by tuning the magnetic field, we map out the transition point between the normal and the FQH regime through a spectroscopic investigation of the many-body gap. Our work provides a starting point for exploring highly entangled topological matter with ultracold atoms(29-33).

TI High-efficiency non-ideal quarter-wavelength Bragg reflection waveguide
   for photon-pair generation
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum light source is a promising resource for quantum-enhanced technologies and tests of quantum mechanics. In the race towards scalable quantum information processing, integrated photonics has recently emerged as a powerful platform. Semiconductor AlGaAs is arising as an outstanding platform due to its strong second-order nonlinearities, direct bandgap, manufacturability and reconfigurability. Here, we conduct an analytical investigation of semiconductor Bragg reflection waveguide (BRW), in which the core layer is surrounded by periodic claddings. A general solution to the mode dispersion equation is deduced independently of whether each cladding layer has an ideal quarter-wavelength thickness or not, and used for the analysis of AlGaAs/GaAs material. Different than before, we propose a novel structure with the core layer having high-index and achieve high modal overlap after full parameter optimization in a BRW slab structure, which can provide a practical way for designing high efficiency devices. The influence of thickness variation on overlap factor and system dispersion as well as biphoton spectral properties generated from type-II spontaneous parametric down conversion are also shown. Our approach can serve as a quick guideline for the design of polarization-entangled sources and contribute to large scale processing devices for practical applications by leveraging the structure's versatile architecture.

TI How to realize compact and noncompact localized states in disorder-free
   hypercube networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a method for realizing various zero-energy localized states on disorder-free hypercube graphs. Previous works have already indicated that disorder is not essential for observing localization phenomena in noninteracting systems, with some prominent examples including the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr & eacute; model, characterized solely by incommensurate potentials, or two-dimensional incommensurate moir & eacute; lattices, which exhibit localization due to the flat-band spectrum. Moreover, flat-band systems with translational invariance can also possess so-called compact localized states, characterized by exactly zero amplitude outside a finite region of the lattice. Here, we demonstrate that both compact and noncompact (i.e., Anderson-like) localized states naturally emerge in disorder-free hypercubes, which can be systematically constructed using Cartan products. This construction ensures the robustness of these localized states against perturbations. Furthermore, we show that the hypercubes can be associated with the Fock space of interacting spin systems exhibiting localization. Viewing localization from the hypercube perspective, with its inherently simple eigenspace structure, offers a clearer and more intuitive understanding of the underlying Fock-space many-body localization phenomena. Our findings can be readily tested on existing experimental platforms, where hypercube graphs can be emulated, e.g., by photonic networks of coupled optical cavities or waveguides. The results can pave the way for the development of quantum information protocols and enable effective simulation of quantum many-body localization phenomena.

TI Dynamically Tunable High-Q Plasmonic Fabry-Pérot Cavity Built by
   Particle Mirror
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Plasmonic nanostructures with high quality (Q) factors or real-time tunability have significant advantages in functional applications ranging from sensing to optical integration and quantum information processing. However, achieving both high Q factors and real-time tunability in a single plasmonic system remains a significant challenge because of the trade-off between structural robustness, mode coupling, and tunability. Here, a dynamically tunable high-Q plasmonic platform based on a Fabry-P & eacute;rot (FP) cavity consisting of plasmonic particle mirrors (PPMs) embedded in a stretchable substrate are presented. High Q factors are achieved via the far-field coupling of the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of the PPMs. Meanwhile, the PPMs ensure the structural stability and resonance strength of the plasmonic FP cavity during real-time mechanical tuning. Angle modulation further enhances the wavelength tunability. Additionally, the used scalable fabrication process is favorable for industrial manufacturing and real-world applications. Based on the PPM FP platform, an active device with modulated and tunable photoluminescence (PL) peak wavelengths is demonstrated, with a strain-controlled spectral shift of over 90 nm in the visible region. This work innovated the design of plasmonic nanostructures and provides a pathway for scalable, high-performance plasmonic systems for functional applications.

TI Strong-field quantum control in the extreme ultraviolet domain using
   pulse shaping
SO NATURE
AB Tailored light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency(1,2), with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry(3, 4, 5, 6-7). Although strong light-matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation(8), comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states(9,10). However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.

TI Quantifying the influence of 3d-4s mixing on linearly coordinated
   metal-ions by L2,3-edge XAS and XMCD
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The mixing valence d and s orbitals are predicted to strongly influence the electronic structure of linearly coordinated molecules, including transition metals, lanthanides and actinides. In specific cases, novel magnetic properties, such as single-ion magnetic coercivity or long spin decoherence times, ensue. Inspired by how the local coordination symmetry can engender such novel phenomena, in this study, we focus our attention on dopants (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) in lithium nitride to accept innovation from molecular magnetism in a high symmetry P6/mmm solid-state crystal. The linear coordination environment results in strong 3d-4s mixing, proving to be an ideal series to investigate the role of d-s mixing and bonding on electronic structure and magnetism. It is shown that L-2,L-3-edge XAS can be applied to experimentally identify the presence of 3d-4s mixing and the influence this has on the ligand-field splitting. XMCD specifies how spin-orbit coupling is affected. The combined spectroscopies are analysed to determine the effect of 4s mixing with support from ab initio calculations. The results provide new insight of relevance to future applications, including quantum information processing and the sustainable replacement of rare earths in magnets.

TI Non-volatile materials for programmable photonics
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Programmable photonics play a crucial role in many emerging applications, from optical accelerators for machine learning to quantum information technologies. Conventionally, photonic systems are tuned by mechanisms such as the thermo-optic effect, free carrier dispersion, the electro-optic effect, or micro-mechanical movement. Although these physical effects allow either fast (>100 GHz) or large contrast (>60 dB) switching, their high static power consumption is not optimal for programmability, which requires only infrequent switching and has a long static time. Non-volatile materials, such as phase-change materials, ferroelectrics, vanadium dioxide, and memristive metal oxide materials, can offer an ideal solution thanks to their reversible switching and non-volatile behavior, enabling a truly "set-and-forget" programmable unit with no static power consumption. In recent years, we have indeed witnessed the fast adoption of non-volatile materials in programmable photonic systems, including photonic integrated circuits and free-space meta-optics. Here, we review the recent progress in the field of programmable photonics, based on non-volatile materials. We first discuss the material's properties, operating mechanisms, and then their potential applications in programmable photonics. Finally, we provide an outlook for future research directions. The review serves as a reference for choosing the ideal material system to realize non-volatile operation for various photonic applications.

TI Orbital-angular-momentum fluorescence emission based on photon-electron
   interaction in a vortex field of an active optical fiber
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB We develop a model of interaction between photons and electrons in an active vortex field, which can generate a fluorescence spectrum with the characteristics of orbital angular momentum (OAM). In an active optical fiber, our findings generalize the notion of photon-electron interaction and point to a new kind of OAM-mode broad-spectrum light source, which could be interpreted in two processes: one microscopically is the excitation of OAM-carrying photons based on the photon-electron interaction; the other macroscopically is the emission and transmission of a donut-shaped fluorescence in a vortex field with a spiral phase wavefront in a ring-core active fiber. Here we present a straightforward experimental method that the emission of broad-spectrum fluorescence with an OAM feature is actualized and validated in a ring-core erbium-doped fiber. The spectrum has a broad spectral width up to 50 nm. Furthermore, four wavelengths are extracted from the fluorescence spectrum and superimposed with their corresponding Gaussian beams, from which the spiral-shaped interferograms of OAM modes in a broad spectrum are identified with high purity. The application of the OAM-based fluorescence light source may range from classical to quantum information technologies, and enable high-capacity communication, high-sensitivity sensing, high-resolution fluorescence imaging, etc.

TI Bounding the separable rank via polynomial optimization
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We investigate questions related to the set SEPd consisting of the linear maps rho acting on Cd circle times Cd that can be written as a convex combination of rank one matrices of the form xx*circle times yy*. Such maps are known in quantum information theory as the separable bipartite states, while nonseparable states are called entangled. In particular we introduce bounds for the separable rank ranksep(rho), defined as the smallest number of rank one states xx* circle times yy* entering the decomposition of a separable state rho. Our approach relies on the moment method and yields a hierarchy of semidefinite-based lower bounds, that converges to a parameter tau sep(rho), a natural convexification of the combinatorial parameter ranksep(rho). A distinguishing feature is exploiting the positivity constraint rho - xx* circle times yy* 0 to impose positivity of a polynomial matrix localizing map, the dual notion of the notion of sum-of-squares polynomial matrices. Our approach extends naturally to the multipartite setting and to the real separable rank, and it permits strengthening some known bounds for the completely positive rank. In addition, we indicate how the moment approach also applies to define hierarchies of semidefinite relaxations for the set SEPd and permits to give new proofs,

TI Challenges and transformative opportunities in superconductor vortex
   physics
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB In superconductors, the motion of vortices introduces unwanted dissipation that is disruptive to applications. Fortunately, material defects can immobilize vortices, acting as vortex pinning centers, which engenders dramatic improvements in superconductor material properties and device operation. This has motivated decades of research into developing methods of tailoring the disorder landscape in superconductors to increase the strength of vortex pinning. Yet, efficacious materials engineering still eludes us. The electromagnetic properties of real (disordered) superconducting materials cannot yet be reliably predicted, such that designing superconductors for applications remains a largely inefficient process of trial and error. This is ultimately due to large gaps in our knowledge of vortex dynamics: the field is challenged by the extremely complex interplay between vortex elasticity, vortex-vortex interactions, and material disorder. In this Perspective, we review obstacles and recent successes in understanding and controlling vortex dynamics in superconducting materials and devices. We further identify major open questions and discuss opportunities for transformative research in the field. This includes improving our understanding of vortex creep, determining and reaching the ceiling for the critical current, advanced microscopy to garner accurate structure-property relationships, frontiers in predictive simulations and the benefits of artificial intelligence, as well as controlling and exploiting vortices in quantum information applications.

TI Two-dimensional optical gap solitons and vortices in a coherent atomic
   ensemble loaded on optical lattices
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION
AB Coherent atomic systems, e.g., resonantly cold atomic gases within which electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) operates, have recently received great attention, because of their remarkable scientific properties and pivotal implications. Light behavior in such systems governed by various potentials is a new and interesting research focus, but missing literally report on two-dimensional (2D) localized gap modes in coherent atomic systems loaded on optical lattices. We survey such issue in a coherent atomic gas inside where the EIT turns on, trapped by 2D optical lattices-constituted by counter-propagating far-detuned Stark laser fields, in the framework of nonlinear Schrodinger equation derived from Maxwell-Bloch equations. Using the linear stability analysis and direct perturbed evolution we address the formation, property, and stability of 2D localized gap modes of two types, gap solitons and gap vortices, in forbidden band gaps of the underlying linear Blochwave spectrum. The former mode is fundamental gap solitons, and the latter belongs to higher-order gap solitons with embedded topological charge. Our results are helpful not only for in-depth understanding of soliton dynamics in coherent atomic ensemble loaded on periodic potentials, but also for laying the groundwork for forthcoming applications in optical communications and quantum information processing.

In the recent years, realizing the importance of the potential of the diaspora to contribute to national development and Science, Technology, and Innovation ecosystem, countries have used Science Diplomacy also to engage with the scientific diaspora. Science Diplomacy is hailed as an enabler and facilitator and is often seen in the context of international S&T collaboration or big science projects. But the use of Science Diplomacy for diaspora engagement calls for specific strategies and meaningful initiatives. India is one of the major developing countries that has given a major thrust to engaging with the scientific diaspora. India is also a leading player in the global Science Diplomacy arena. This article critically examines India's initiatives and strategies for engagement with the scientific diaspora. It points out that the Science Diplomacy dimension is missing in this. Using examples from other countries, recent thinking, and developments in Science Diplomacy, this study outlines an approach with some examples of strategies and initiatives for harnessing Science Diplomacy to enhance engagement with the scientific diaspora and create a win-win milieu for India and the diaspora. The approach takes into account the proposed and ongoing initiatives in emerging technologies in India, including quantum technologies and Artificial Intelligence. Such a framework will create a synergy among various programs and initiatives by using Science Diplomacy as a facilitator and catalyst. Under this framework, Diaspora is involved not only as experts and contributors to scientific advancements but also as stakeholders. This dual role of the STI Diaspora can bring a paradigm shift in traditional understanding and use of science diplomacy, particularly to engage and harness the potential of the STI Diaspora for Sustainable Development.

TI Quantum Coherence and Purity in Dissipative Hydrogen Atoms: Insights
   from the Lindblad Master Equation
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we investigate the quantum coherence and purity in hydrogen atoms under dissipative dynamics, with a focus on the hyperfine structure states arising from the electron-proton spin interaction. Using the Lindblad master equation, we model the time evolution of the density matrix of the system, incorporating both the unitary dynamics driven by the hyperfine Hamiltonian and the dissipative effects due to environmental interactions. Quantum coherence is quantified using the L1 norm and relative entropy measures, while purity is assessed via von Neumann entropy, for initial states, including a maximally entangled Bell state and a separable state. Our results reveal distinct dynamics: for the Bell states, both coherence and purity decay exponentially with a rate proportional to the dissipation parameter, whereas for a kind of separable state, coherence exhibits oscillatory behavior modulated via the hyperfine coupling constant, superimposed on an exponential decay, and accompanied by a steady increase in entropy. Higher dissipation rates accelerate the loss of coherence and the growth of von Neumann entropy, underscoring the environment's role in suppressing quantum superposition and driving the system towards mixed states. These findings enhance our understanding of coherence and purity preservation in atomic systems and offer insights for quantum information applications where robustness against dissipation is critical.

TI Transferability of Ligand Field Parameters in a Family of 3d-4f
   M2Ln2 Butterfly Single-Molecule Magnets
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Lanthanide-based single-molecule magnets are attractive candidates for applications in quantum information processing or data storage. The low symmetry ligand field environment often encountered in these complexes, combined with a sparsity of information in the common magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data recorded on powder samples, leads to massive overparametrization. This limits the application of ligand field models, such as the point charge or angular overlap models, for describing the data. In this work, the radical approach is taken to consider these models as black boxes, whereby they suspend their chemical or physical significance. Instead, the transferability of parameters across a series of structurally related compounds is enforced to achieve a reduced parametrization. This methodology is applied to four members of the isostructural series of [M2 IIILn2 III(mu 3-OH)2(pmide)2(p-Me-PhCO2)6]<middle dot>2MeCN (pmideH2 = N-(2-pyridylmethyl)-iminodiethanol) butterfly complexes, with M = Al, Fe, and Ln = Er, Dy. It is shown that the powder magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data can be described simultaneously with remarkable accuracy using only two parameters for characterizing the lanthanide ligand fields in all four compounds. Interestingly, the resulting parametrization and its values lie within the range of chemical intuition despite the black box procedure used to obtain them. Implications of this approach are discussed.

TI Accurate hyperfine tensors for solid state quantum applications: case of
   the NV center in diamond
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The decoherence of point defect qubits is often governed by the electron spin-nuclear spin hyperfine interaction that can be parameterized by using ab inito calculations in principle. So far most of the theoretical works have focused on the hyperfine interaction of the closest nuclear spins, while the accuracy of the predictions for distinct nuclear spins is barely discussed. Here we demonstrate for the case of the NV center in diamond that the absolute relative error of the computed hyperfine parameters can exceed 100% using an industry standards first-principles code. To overcome this issue, we implement an alternative method and report on significantly improved hyperfine values with O \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{{{{\mathcal{O}}}}}}}}$$\end{document} (1%) relative mean error at all distances. The provided accurate hyperfine data for the NV center enables high-precision simulation of NV quantum nodes for quantum information processing and positioning of nuclear spins by comparing experimental and theoretical hyperfine data.
   Hyperfine interaction is the key term for utilizing individual nuclear spins in solids. This work introduces a method that yields high-accuracy hyperfine values for nuclear spins at arbitrary distances from addressable electron spins, such as the NV center in diamond.

TI Relativistic massive particle with spin-1/2: A vector bundle point of
   view
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Recently, in the context of Relativistic Quantum Information Theory (RQI) of massive spin-1/2 particles, it has been suggested that it is impossible to perform a momentum-independent spin measurement, showing the inadequacy of the spin reduced density matrix as a legitimate information resource. This is because there is an unavoidable ambiguity in the definition of the spin of a moving particle. In this paper, by introducing a vector bundle theoretic way to view the single-particle state space, we try to rule out this ambiguity. The discrete degree of freedom of the resulting representation space contains information about the Pauli-Lubanski four-vector of the particle instead of the ambiguous spin. Comparing this representation with the standard one used in the RQI literature, we show that the discrete degree of freedom of the standard representation space attains the meaning of the Newton-Wigner spin. In addition, using this viewpoint, we give a mathematical proof of why the spin reduced density matrix is meaningless, which is stronger than the previous claims in that it asserts that the matrix is void of any meaning at all, not just in terms of the impossibility of measurement or Lorentz non-covariance. We give a way (which turns out to be the only way) to modify it to obtain the Pauli-Lubanski reduced density matrix, which is covariant under Lorentz transformations.

TI Evidence for strong correlations at finite temperatures in the dimerized
   magnet Na2Cu2TeO6
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Dimerized magnets forming alternating Heisenberg chains exhibit quantum coherence and entanglement and thus can find potential applications in quantum information and computation. However, magnetic systems typically undergo thermal decoherence at finite temperatures. Here, we show inelastic neutron scattering results on an alternating antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic chain compound Na2Cu2TeO6 that the excited quasiparticles can counter thermal decoherence and maintain strong correlations at elevated temperatures. At low temperatures, we observe clear dispersive singlet-triplet excitations arising from the dimers formed along the crystalline b axis. The excitation gap is of similar to 18 meV and the bandwidth is about half of the gap. The band top energy has a weak modulation along the [100] direction, indicative of a small interchain coupling. The gap increases while the bandwidth decreases with increasing temperature, leading to a strong reduction in the available phase space for the triplons. As a result, the Lorentzian-type energy broadening becomes highly asymmetric as the temperature is raised. These results are associated with a strongly correlated state resulting from hard-core constraint and quasiparticle interactions. We consider these results to be not only evidence for strong correlations at finite temperatures in Na2Cu2TeO6, but also for the universality of the strongly correlated state in a broad range of quantum magnetic systems.

TI Assessing the effect of the coupling parameter of dimer parity-time
   symmetric laser on the stability of polaron in semiconductors quantum
   dot
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB This manuscript theoretically investigates the stability of polaron in semiconductor quantum dot (SCQD) under the influence of the coupling coefficient of dimer parity-time (PT) symmetric. We have analytically solved the problem of two coupled lasers to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of different lasers and the intensities of the radiations emitted by each of them. Using the Lee-Low-Pines-Huybrecht (LLPH) method, we derive the ground and first excited state energies of polaron in different SCQD of our choice including Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Cadmium Selenide (CdSe), Titanium Chloride (TiCl) and potassium bromide (KBr). Doing so, we chose to perform our study within three principal regimes of lasers: i.e. the PT symmetric domains (gamma = 1), close to the transition zone (gamma = 1.8) and above the transition zone (gamma = 3). The superposition of these two energy states forms a two levels system (TLS) which is considered as a quantum bit, allowing us to evaluate the probability density. Our results indicate that under threshold value (gamma thr = 2 Omega), the system is PT symmetry and both KBr and GaAs are more relevant SCQD materials. Nearest the threshold, TiCl is especially relevant. Finally, beyond the critical point of coefficient gain-loss, CdSe is quite indicated when investigating the interaction of a PT symmetry coupled lasers. In addition to the above observation, we found coherent population transfer from the first excited state to the ground state and scattering phenomenon, showing that the polaron state can be controlled with PT symmetry coupled laser. These findings indicate that the coupling coefficient of dimer PT symmetric provides a means to manipulate the dynamics of polarons under laser radiation, offering potential applications in optoelectronics and quantum technologies.

TI Detecting nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen centers on the nanoscale using
   nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB In diamond, nitrogen defects like the substitutional nitrogen defect (Ns) or the nitrogen -vacancy -hydrogen complex (NVH) outnumber the nitrogen -vacancy (NV) defect by at least one order of magnitude creating a dense spin bath. While neutral Ns has an impact on the coherence of the NV spin state, the atomic structure of NVH reminds of a NV center decorated with a hydrogen atom. As a consequence, the formation of NVH centers could compete with that of NV centers possibly lowering the N -to -NV conversion efficiency in diamond grown with hydrogen -plasma -assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Therefore, monitoring and controlling the spin bath is essential to produce and understand engineered diamond material with high NV concentrations for quantum applications. While the incorporation of Ns in diamond has been investigated on the nano- and mesoscale for years, studies concerning the influence of CVD parameters and the crystal orientation on the NVH formation have been restricted to bulk N -doped diamond providing high -enough spin numbers for electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectroscopy techniques. Here, we investigate submicron-thick (100) -diamond layers with nitrogen contents of (13.8 +/- 1.6) ppm and (16.7 +/- 3.6) ppm, and exploiting the NV centers in the layers as local nanosensors, we demonstrate the detection of NVH- centers using double electronelectron resonance (DEER). To determine the NVH- densities, we quantitatively fit the hyperfine structure of NVH- and confirm the results with the DEER method usually used for determining Ns0 densities. With our experiments, we access the spin bath composition on the nanoscale and enable a fast feedback loop in CVD recipe optimization with thin diamond layers instead of resource- and time -intensive bulk crystals. Furthermore, the quantification of NVH- plays a very important role for understanding the dynamics of vacancies and the incorporation of hydrogen into CVD diamond optimized for quantum technologies.

TI Tailoring the statistics of light emitted from two interacting quantum
   emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The interaction between quantum emitters leads to the formation of superradiant and subradiant states with possible applications in quantum technologies. To improve the characterization of light emission from these systems, we present here a systematic theoretical analysis of the intensity correlation from two strongly interacting quantum emitters at cryogenic temperatures as a function of the frequency and intensity of the excitation laser. This analysis effectively accounts for the effect of vibrational modes of the emitters and of phonons of the environment through the combined Debye-Waller/Franck-Condon factor. First, we analyze the color-blind intensity correlation and show that it can be tailored from strong antibunching to strong bunching by tuning the laser from the two-photon resonance to the transition frequency of the superradiant state. We also find a particularly complex behavior of the intensity correlation when the laser frequency is tuned to that of the transition of the subradiant state, giving raise to the possibility of emitting bunched and antibunched light depending on the laser intensity and the detuning between the two emitters. The numerical results are supported by analytical equations that can be used for the experimental characterization of the interacting emitters. Additionally, by selecting photons of particular frequencies, we analyze the rich landscape of frequency-resolved intensity correlations, which also depend on the laser detuning and intensity. The analysis of the frequency-resolved correlations provides further information about the different relaxation processes underlying the photon emission, unveiling one-photon and two-photon emission processes that cannot be resolved neither in the emission spectrum nor in the color-blind intensity correlation. These results show that two interacting emitters are a versatile and practical source of quantum light and highlight the usefulness of the intensity correlation to unveil complex dynamics in this system.

TI The first-formed hydrogen and nitrogen defects in natural diamond
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H) defects in diamond provide crucial information about diamond growth. The electromagnetic properties that N/H-defects impart on synthetic diamond are exploited in novel technological applications including quantum information storage and sensing. Access to the Gemological Institute of America database of infrared spectra recorded from rare Type Ib + IaA natural diamonds has allowed identification of the first-formed N/H-defects, NH0 and N2H0, assigned to IR peaks at 3394 and 3343 cm-1, respectively. Density functional perturbation theory and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations of NH0 and N2H0, including the first machine-learning molecular dynamics simulation performed for N/H-defects in diamond, show excellent agreement between observed and calculated C-H stretching frequencies (18 to 66 cm- 1 difference). New aggregation sequences are proposed for VN3H0, the commonly observed end-state of N/H-aggregation, that differ from the currently accepted sequence. This suggests that NH0 and N2H0 form during, or shortly after, diamond formation inhibiting diffusive loss of H during mantle residence and thus the H (isotopic) composition of diamond may reflect parental fluids from primordial and/or recycled mantle H2O reservoirs. These findings also have important technological implications for N/V-defects, such as NV-, with useful electromagnetic properties that may be passivated by H.

TI Recent Advances in Tunable External Cavity Diode Lasers
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application Tunable ultra-narrow linewidth external cavity diode lasers can be applied in the field of laser radar, coherent communication, atomic physics.Abstract A narrow linewidth tunable laser source is a critical component in various fields, including laser radar, quantum information, coherent communication, and precise measurement. Tunable external cavity diode lasers (ECDLs) demonstrate excellent performance, such as narrow linewidth, wide tunable range, and low threshold current, making them increasingly versatile and widely applicable. This article provides an overview of the fundamental structures and recent advancements in external cavity semiconductor lasers. In particular, we discuss external cavity semiconductor lasers based on quantum well and quantum dot gain chips. The structure of the gain chip significantly influences laser's performance. External cavity quantum well laser has a narrower linewidth, higher power, and better mode stability. Conversely, external cavity quantum dot laser provides a wider tunable range and a remarkably lower threshold current. Furthermore, dual-wavelength external cavity tunable diode lasers are gaining importance in applications such as optical switching and terahertz radiation generation. With the continuous optimization of chips and external cavity structures, external cavity diode lasers are increasingly recognized as promising light sources with narrow linewidth and wide tunability, opening up broader application prospects.

TI Coexistence of Chiral and Antichiral Edge States in Photonic Crystals
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB This study reports a modified Haldane model that supports transitions between valley and Chern topological phases in photonic crystals. Berry curvatures of this system can be flexibly diffused, converged, or flipped by endowing different model parameters, thus exhibiting exotic topological interface/edge behaviors, such as topological bound states with ideally zero dispersion. Importantly, the coexistence of chiral and antichiral edge states preserved simultaneously by valley and Chern topological phases is achieved by splicing together two kinds of topological structures as an entirety. It further employs a honeycomb lattice comprising gyromagnetic and ceramic cylinders at microwave frequencies, where inversion and time-reversal symmetries can be flexibly manipulated. Topological interface transport is demonstrated, including two opposite signs of group velocities jointly protected by topologically distinct regimes. These results bridge the gap between valley and Chern topological physics and shed light on developing reconfigurable integrated device applications for classical (quantum) information processing and photonic computing.

TI Orbital angular momentum based intra- and interparticle entangled states
   generated via a quantum dot source
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Engineering single-photon states endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a powerful tool for quantum information photonic implementations. Indeed, due to its unbounded nature, OAM is suitable for encoding qudits, allowing a single carrier to transport a large amount of information. Most of the experimental platforms employ spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes to generate single photons, even if this approach is intrinsically probabilistic, leading to scalability issues for an increasing number of qudits. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been used to get over these limitations by producing on-demand pure and indistinguishable single-photon states, although only recently they have been exploited to create OAM modes. Our work employs a bright QD single-photon source to generate a complete set of quantum states for information processing with OAM-endowed photons. We first study hybrid intraparticle entanglement between OAM and polarization degrees of freedom of a single photon whose preparation was certified by means of Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility. Then, we investigate hybrid interparticle OAM-based entanglement by exploiting a probabilistic entangling gate. The performance of our approach is assessed by performing quantum state tomography and violating Bell inequalities. Our results pave the way for the use of deterministic sources for the on-demand generation of photonic high-dimensional quantum states.

TI Extract the Degradation Information in Squeezed States with Machine
   Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In order to leverage the full power of quantum noise squeezing with unavoidable decoherence, a complete understanding of the degradation in the purity of squeezed light is demanded. By implementing machine-learning architecture with a convolutional neural network, we illustrate a fast, robust, and precise quantum state tomography for continuous variables, through the experimentally measured data generated from the balanced homodyne detectors. Compared with the maximum likelihood estimation method, which suffers from time-consuming and overfitting problems, a well-trained machine fed with squeezed vacuum and squeezed thermal states can complete the task of reconstruction of the density matrix in less than one second. Moreover, the resulting fidelity remains as high as 0.99 even when the antisqueezing level is higher than 20 dB. Compared with the phase noise and loss mechanisms coupled from the environment and surrounding vacuum, experimentally, the degradation information is unveiled with machine learning for low and high noisy scenarios, i.e., with the antisqueezing levels at 12 dB and 18 dB, respectively. Our neural network enhanced quantum state tomography provides the metrics to give physical descriptions of every feature observed in the quantum state with a single scan measurement just by varying the local oscillator phase from 0 to 2 pi and paves a way of exploring large-scale quantum systems in real time.

TI Observing non-ergodicity due to kinetic constraints in tilted
   Fermi-Hubbard chains
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems is deeply related to fundamental questions of quantum information theory. While integrable or many-body localized systems display non-ergodic behavior due to extensively many conserved quantities, recent theoretical studies have identified a rich variety of more exotic phenomena in between these two extreme limits. The tilted one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, which is readily accessible in experiments with ultracold atoms, emerged as an intriguing playground to study non-ergodic behavior in a clean disorder-free system. While non-ergodic behavior was established theoretically in certain limiting cases, there is no complete understanding of the complex thermalization properties of this model. In this work, we experimentally study the relaxation of an initial charge-density wave and find a remarkably long-lived initial-state memory over a wide range of parameters. Our observations are well reproduced by numerical simulations of a clean system. Using analytical calculations we further provide a detailed microscopic understanding of this behavior, which can be attributed to emergent kinetic constraints. It was predicted that complex thermalizing behaviour can arise in many-body systems in the absence of disorder. Here, the authors observe non-ergodic dynamics in a tilted optical lattice that is distinct from previously studied regimes, and propose a microscopic mechanism that is due to emergent kinetic constrains.

TI High performance mode (de)multiplexer assisted with a microring
   resonator on the lithium niobate-on-insulator platform
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The high extinction ratio mode (de)multiplexer is a pivotal component in high capacity mode-division multiplexing data communication and nascent on-chip intermodal acousto-optic modulators. Up to now, high performance on-chip mode (de)multiplexers are still lacking for integrated AOMs on the lithium niobate-on-insulator platform. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an innovative scheme to achieve high extinction ratio signal routing for acousto-optic modulation, by leveraging a two-mode (de)multiplexer in conjunction with a high-Q racetrack microring resonator. The integrated devices are fabricated with one-step electron beam lithography and dry etching processes. The demonstrated two-mode (de)multiplexer boasts the excellent intermodal crosstalk below -20 dB and the on-chip insertion loss of less than 1.92 dB within the wavelength range of 1,514-1,580 nm. With the reinforcement of the microring resonator filter, the carrier signal can be suppressed thoroughly and the measured extinction ratio attains over 30 dB. Our proof-of-principle investigations have provided a feasible and compact solution to implement practical intermodal AOMs in LNOI for photonic and quantum information process, microwave photonics, and LiDAR.

TI Conformal geometry from entanglement
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities (ctot, eta) that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many- body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity ctot is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) ctot is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) eta is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement. We show that stationarity of ctot is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving eta, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.

TI Information Theoretical Analysis of Quantum Mixedness in a Finite Model
   of Interacting Fermions
SO ENTROPY
AB In this study, we utilize information theory tools to investigate notable features of the quantum degree of mixedness (Cf) in a finite model of N interacting fermions. This model serves as a simplified proxy for an atomic nucleus, capturing its essential features in a more manageable form compared to a realistic nuclear model, which would require the diagonalization of matrices with millions of elements, making the extraction of qualitative features a significant challenge. Specifically, we aim to correlate Cf with particle number fluctuations and temperature, using the paradigmatic Lipkin model. Our analysis reveals intriguing dependencies of Cf on the total fermion number, showcasing distinct behaviors at different temperatures. Notably, we find that the degree of quantum mixedness exhibits a strong dependence on the total fermion number, with varying trends across different temperature regimes. Remarkably, this dependence remains unaffected by the strength of the fermion-fermion interaction (as long as it is non-zero), underscoring the robustness of the observed phenomena. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, we provide illustrative graphs depicting these dependencies, offering valuable insights into the fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body fermion systems. Our findings illuminate the intricate dynamics of the degree of mixedness, a crucial quantum property, with potential implications for diverse fields ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum information science.

TI Programmable nanowrinkle-induced room-temperature exciton localization
   in monolayer WSe2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Localized states in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been the subject of intense study, driven by potential applications in quantum information science. Despite the rapidly growing knowledge surrounding these emitters, their microscopic nature is still not fully understood, limiting their production and application. Motivated by this challenge, and by recent theoretical and experimental evidence showing that nanowrinkles generate strain-localized room-temperature emitters, we demonstrate a method to intentionally induce wrinkles with collections of stressors, showing that long-range wrinkle direction and position are controllable with patterned array design. Nano-photoluminescence (nano-PL) imaging combined with detailed strain modeling based on measured wrinkle topography establishes a correlation between wrinkle properties, particularly shear strain, and localized exciton emission. Beyond the array-induced wrinkles, nano-PL spatial maps further reveal that the strain environment around individual stressors is heterogeneous due to the presence of fine wrinkles that are less deterministic. At cryogenic temperatures, antibunched emission is observed, confirming that the nanocone-induced strain is sufficiently large for the formation of quantum emitters. At 300 K, detailed nanoscale hyperspectral images uncover a wide range of low-energy emission peaks originating from the fine wrinkles, and show that the states can be tightly confined to regions <10 nm, even in ambient conditions. These results establish a promising potential route towards realizing room temperature quantum emission in 2D TMDC systems.

TI Hot entanglement? - Parametrically coupled quantum oscillators in two
   heat baths: instability, squeezing and driving
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Entanglement being a foundational cornerstone of quantum sciences and the primary resource in quantum information processing, understanding its dynamical evolution in realistic conditions is essential. Unfortunately, numerous model studies show that degradation of entanglement from a quantum system's environment, especially thermal noise, is almost unavoidable. Thus the appellation 'hot entanglement' appears like a contradiction, until Galve et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 180501 (2010)] announced that entanglement can be kept at high temperatures if one considers a quantum system with time-dependent coupling between the two parties, each interacting with its individual bath. With the goal of understanding the sustenance of entanglement at high temperatures, working with the same model and set up as Galve et al, namely, parametrically-driven coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with their own Markovian baths, this work probes into the feasibility of 'hot entanglement' from three aspects listed in the subtitle. Our findings show that 1) hot entanglement functions only in the unstable regimes, 2) instability is a necessary but not sufficient condition, and 3) the power intake required by the drive operating in the unstable regime to sustain entanglement increases exponentially. The last factor indicates that hot entanglement under this modeling is theoretically untenable and its actual implementation likely unattainable.

TI Non-Abelian effects in dissipative photonic topological lattices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this work, the authors show that photonic topological lattices with dissipative couplings could exhibit non-Abelian dynamics and geometric phases that are in sharp contrast to those arising in typical energy-conserving systems.
   Topology is central to phenomena that arise in a variety of fields, ranging from quantum field theory to quantum information science to condensed matter physics. Recently, the study of topology has been extended to open systems, leading to a plethora of intriguing effects such as topological lasing, exceptional surfaces, as well as non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we show that Bloch eigenstates associated with lattices with dissipatively coupled elements exhibit geometric properties that cannot be described via scalar Berry phases, in sharp contrast to conservative Hamiltonians with non-degenerate energy levels. This unusual behavior can be attributed to the significant population exchanges among the corresponding dissipation bands of such lattices. Using a one-dimensional example, we show both theoretically and experimentally that such population exchanges can manifest themselves via matrix-valued operators in the corresponding Bloch dynamics. In two-dimensional lattices, such matrix-valued operators can form non-commuting pairs and lead to non-Abelian dynamics, as confirmed by our numerical simulations. Our results point to new ways in which the combined effect of topology and engineered dissipation can lead to non-Abelian topological phenomena.

TI Magnesium-Vacancy Optical Centers in Diamond
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We provide the first systematic characterization of the structural and photoluminescence properties of optically active centers fabricated upon implantation of 30-100 keV Mg+ ions in synthetic diamond. The structural configurations of Mg-related defects were studied by the electron emission channeling technique for short-lived, radioactive Mg-27 implantations at the CERN-ISOLDE facility, performed both at room temperature and 800 degrees C, which allowed the identification of a major fraction of Mg atoms (similar to 30 to 42%) in sites which are compatible with the split-vacancy structure of the MgV complex. A smaller fraction of Mg atoms (similar to 13 to 17%) was found on substitutional sites. The photoluminescence emission was investigated both at the ensemble and individual defect level in the 5-300 K temperature range, offering a detailed picture of the MgV-related emission properties and revealing the occurrence of previously unreported spectral features. The optical excitability of the MgV center was also studied as a function of the optical excitation wavelength to identify the optimal conditions for photostable and intense emission. The results are discussed in the context of the preliminary experimental data and the theoretical models available in the literature, with appealing perspectives for the utilization of the tunable properties of the MgV center for quantum information processing applications.

TI On the questions of asymptotic recoverability of information and
   subsystems in quantum gravity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A longstanding question in quantum gravity regards the localization of quantum information; one way to formulate this question is to ask how subsystems can be defined in quantum-gravitational systems. The gauge symmetry and necessity of solving the gravitational constraints appear to imply that the answers to this question here are different than in finite quantum systems, or in local quantum field theory. Specifically, the constraints can be solved by providing a "gravitational dressing" for the underlying field-theory operators, but this modifies their locality properties. It has been argued that holography itself may be explained through this role of the gauge symmetry and constraints, at the nonperturbative level, but there are also subtleties in constructing a holographic map in this approach. There are also claims that holography is implied even by perturbative solution of the constraints. This short note provides further examination of these questions, and in particular investigates to what extent perturbative or nonperturbative solution of the constraints implies that information naively thought to be localized can be recovered by asymptotic measurements, and the relevance of this in defining subsystems. In the leading perturbative case, the relevant effects are seen to be exponentially suppressed and asymptotically vanishing, for massive fields. These questions are, for example, important in sharply characterizing the unitarity problem for black holes.

TI Steering nonclassicality of Gaussian states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonclassicality according to the singularity or negativity of the Glauber P-function is a powerful resource in quantum information, with relevant implications in quantum optics. In a Gaussian setting, and for a system of two modes, we explore how P-nonclassicality may be conditionally generated or influenced on one mode by Gaussian measurements on the other mode. Starting from the class of two-mode squeezed thermal states (TMST), we introduce the notion of nonclassical steering (NS) and the graphical tool of Gaussian triangoloids. In particular, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a TMST to be nonclassically steerable and show that entanglement is necessary. We also apply our criterion to noisy propagation of a twin-beam state and evaluate the time after which NS is no longer achievable. We then generalize the notion of NS to the full set of Gaussian states of two modes and recognize that it may occur in a weak form, which does not imply entanglement, and in a strong form, which implies EPR steerability and, a fortiori, also entanglement. These two types of NS coincide exactly for TMSTs, and they merge with the previously known notion of EPR steering. By the same token, we recognize another operational interpretation of P-nonclassicality: It is the distinctive property that allows one-party entanglement verification on TMSTs.

TI Electronic Wigner-molecule polymeric chains in elongated silicon quantum
   dots and finite-length quantum wires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The spectral properties of electrons confined in a wirelike quasi-one-dimensional (1D) elongated quantum dot coupler between silicon qubits are investigated with a valley-augmented unrestricted Hartree-Fock (VAUHF) method, generalized to include the valley degree of freedom treated as an isospin, allowing calculations for a large number of electrons. The lower-energy symmetry-broken solutions of the selfconsistent generalized Pople-Nesbet equations exhibit, for a confinement that has been modeled after an experimentally fabricated one in silicon, the formation of Wigner-molecule polymeric (longitudinal) chains, which are initiated through charge accumulation at the edges of the finite-length quasi-1D wire. An increasing number of parallel zigzag chains form as the number of electrons loaded into the confinement is increased, with the formation of newly added chains determined by the strength of the transverse harmonic confinement. The broken-symmetry VAUHF solutions, subsequently augmented by the quantum mechanically required parity restoration, go beyond the VAUHF single-determinant solution, predicting the formation of entangled Wigner-molecule chains, the charge distributions of which obliterate the zigzag organization of the broken-symmetry solutions. The symmetry-restored VAUHF methodology enables systematic investigations of multielectron-complex nanoscale confined structures that could be targeted for future imaging-microscopy experiments in silicon and other materials (e.g., 1D domain walls in transition-metal dichalcogenide materials) and quantum information utilization.

TI Angular momentum transfer to charged particles by interaction with
   Laguerre-Gauss pulses
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Orbital angular momentum of light and the associated Laguerre-Gauss modes have garnered increasing interest due to the many applications they promise in the fields of telecommunications and quantum information, as well as charged particle acceleration. Here, we use the numerical simulation of the dynamics of a large number of identical, charged, relativistic, but classical particles, forming a statistical ensemble and seen as test-particles in a time-dependent external electromagnetic field, to get insight into the process of a head-on collision with a pulsed Laguerre-Gauss mode. We have identified two steady-states regimes (low a0 and large a0), where the distribution of the final angular momentum gained by the particles as a function of their initial coordinates is well-behaved and does not change its structure with variations of the reduced amplitude. For small reduced amplitudes a0 of the incoming electromagnetic field, we have also found an analytic approximation of the expression for the angular momentum transferred to the particles after the pulse has left their region. Using both numerical integration and the analytic approximation, we have investigated the effects of the field's gradient, initial phase of the field, polarization type, and azimuthal order m.

TI Effect of environmental screening and strain on optoelectronic
   properties of two-dimensional quantum defects
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates as single-photon emitters (SPEs) in nanophotonics and quantum information applications. The precise control of SPEs requires in-depth understanding of their optoelectronic properties. However, how the surrounding environment of host materials, including the number of layers, substrates, and strain, influences SPEs has not been fully understood. In this work, we study the dielectric screening effect due to the number of layers and substrates, and the strain effect on the optical properties of carbon dimer and nitrogen vacancy defects in hBN from first-principles many-body perturbation theory. We report that environmental screening causes a lowering of the quasiparticle gap and exciton binding energy, leading to nearly constant optical excitation energy and exciton radiative lifetime. We explain the results with an analytical model starting from the Bethe-Salpeter equation Hamiltonian with Wannier basis. We also show that optical properties of quantum defects are largely tunable by strain with highly anisotropic response, in good agreement with experimental measurements. Our work clarifies the effect of environmental screening and strain on optoelectronic properties of quantum defects in two-dimensional insulators, facilitating future applications of SPEs and spin qubits in low-dimensional systems.

TI Rapid Dynamic Separation of Radial and Azimuthal Polarization Components
   in Circular Airy Vortex Beams via Linear Electro-Optic Effect in
   Uniaxial Crystals
SO PHOTONICS
AB This paper presents a rapid approach for the dynamic separation of radial polarization (R-pol) and azimuthal polarization (A-pol) components in circular Airy vortex beams (CAVBs) by utilizing the linear electro-optic (EO) effect in uniaxial crystals. By applying an external electric field along the z-axis of a strontium barium niobate (SBN) crystal, tunable spatial separation of the R-pol and A-pol components is achieved. Under positive electric fields, the crystal maintains negative uniaxial properties with increased birefringence, extending the focal separation distance. Conversely, negative electric fields initially reduce the birefringence of the crystal; further increases in negative field strength will transition the crystal to a positive uniaxial state, subsequently enhancing birefringence and restoring focal separation. Experimental simulations demonstrate a focal separation of 1.4 mm at +/- 15 kV/mm, with R-pol focusing first at +15 kV/mm and A-pol preceding at -15 kV/mm. The polarization distributions at the foci confirm the successful separation of the two components. This approach overcomes the static limitation of conventional polarization splitters in separating R-pol and A-pol components, showing significant potential for optical manipulation, high-resolution imaging, and quantum information processing.

TI Expanding the reach of quantum optimization with fermionic embeddings
SO QUANTUM
AB Quadratic programming orthogonal encompasses optimization problems that do not have an efficient quantum representation. Such problems are instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a generalization of binary quadratic programs to continuous, noncommutative variables. In this work, we establish a natural embedding for this class of LNCG problems onto a fermionic Hamiltonian, thereby enabling the study of this classical problem with the tools of quantum information. This embedding is accomplished by a new representation of orthogonal matrices as fermionic quantum states, which we achieve through the well-known double covering of the orthogonal group. Correspondingly, the embedded LNCG Hamiltonian is a two-body fermion model. Determining extremal states of this Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, a quantum analogue to classical semidefinite relaxations. In particular, when optimizing over the special orthogonal group our quantum relaxation obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation matrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential in matrix dimension, whereas our quantum representation requires only a linear number of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution back into the feasible space, we propose rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from appropriate measurements of the quantum state. Through numerical experiments we provide evidence that this rounded quantum relaxation can produce high-quality approximations.

TI Single site-controlled inverted pyramidal InGaAs QD-nanocavity operating
   at the onset of the strong coupling regime
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Precise positioning of single site-controlled inverted pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) at the antinode of a GaAs photonic crystal cavity with nanometer-scale accuracy holds unique advantages compared to self-assembled QDs and offers great promise for practical on-chip photonic quantum information processing. However, the strong coupling regime in this geometry has not yet been achieved due to the low cavity Q-factor based on the (111)B-oriented membrane structures. Here, we reveal the onset of phonon-mediated coherent exciton-photon interaction on our tailored single site-controlled InGaAs QD-photonic crystal cavity. Our results present the Rabi-like oscillation of luminescence intensity between excitonic and photonic components correlated with their energy splitting pronounced at small detuning. Such Rabi-like oscillation is well reproduced by modeling the coherent exchange of the exciton-photon population. The modeling further reveals an oscillatory two-time covariance at QD-cavity resonance, which indicates that the system operates at the onset of the strong coupling regime. Moreover, by using the cavity mode as a probe of the virtual state of the QD induced by phonon scattering, it reveals an increase in phonon scattering rates near the QD-cavity resonance and asymmetric phonon emission and absorption rate of even around 50K.

TI Deep-Subwavelength Resonant Meta-Optics Enabled by Ultra-High Index
   Topological Insulators
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB In nanophotonics, small mode volumes, high-quality factor resonances, and large field enhancements without metals fundamentally scale with the refractive index and are key for many implementations involving light-matter interactions. Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of insulating materials that host topologically protected surface states, some of which exhibit extraordinarily high permittivity values. Here, the optical properties of TI bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) single crystals are studied. It is found that both the bulk and surface states contribute to the extremely large optical constants, with the real part of the refractive index peaking at n & AP; 11. Utilizing these ultra-high index values, it is demonstrated that Bi2Te3 metasurfaces are capable of squeezing light in deep-subwavelength structures, with the fundamental magnetic dipole (MD) resonance confined in unit cell sizes smaller than & lambda;/10. It is further shown that dense ultrathin metasurface arrays can simultaneously provide large magnetic and electric field enhancements arising from the high index of the bulk and the surface metallic states. These findings demonstrate the potential of chalcogenide TIs as a platform leveraging the unique combination of ultra-high-index dielectric response with surface metallic states for metamaterial design and nanophotonic applications in sensing, non-linear generation, and quantum information.

TI Substrate engineering of plasmonic nanocavity antenna modes
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Plasmonic nanocavities have emerged as a promising platform for next-generation spectroscopy, sensing and photonic quantum information processing technologies, benefiting from a unique confluence of nanoscale compactness and integrability, ultrafast functionality and room-temperature viability. Harnessing their unprecedented optical field confinement and enhancement properties for such diverse application domains, however, demands continued innovation in cavity design and robust strategies for engineering their plasmonic mode characteristics, with the aim of optimizing spatial and spectral matching conditions for strong light-matter interaction involving embedded quantum emitters. Adopting the canonical gold bowtie nanoantenna, we show that the complex refractive index, n + ik, of the substrate material provides additional design flexibility in tailoring the properties of plasmonic nanocavity modes, including their resonance wavelengths, hotspot locations, intracavity field polarization and radiative decay rates. In particular, we predict that highly refractive (n >= 4) or highly absorptive (k >= 4) substrates provide two complementary approaches to engineering nanocavity modes that are especially desirable for coupling two-dimensional quantum materials, featuring namely an elevated hotspot with a dominantly in-plane polarized near-field, as well as a strongly radiative character. Our study elucidates the benefits and intricacies of a largely unexplored facet of nanocavity mode manipulation, beyond the widely practiced synthetic control over the cavity topology or physical dimensions, and paves the way for plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics with two-dimensional excitonic matter.

CL Sacramento, CA
AB Analogies are known to be powerful tools for making sense of unfamiliar ideas in terms of already understood concepts. Science students regularly encounter unfamiliar ideas, such as microscopic objects that are invisible to our everyday experience and behaviors dictated by quantum mechanics. An understanding of basic concepts of quantum mechanics is useful in many disciplines, especially with the growing field of quantum information sciences and technologies. Physics researchers often use analogies in their own research and science communicators use them to make quantum ideas accessible to K-12 students and across STEM disciplines, but analogy use in upper-division teaching has been less researched. Our research goal is to understand how analogies are used to teach quantum mechanics, and specifically, what prior knowledge is used as a basis for analogies within two widely used quantum mechanics textbooks. This textbook analysis shows the most common bases for analogies include: mathematical structures from linear algebra, which are applied to model quantum systems; everyday life examples, which are used to make quantum systems more familiar and understandable; and macroscopic classical phenomena, which are used to highlight differences between classical and quantum mechanics. We also find authors use different conventions, based on the various cue words that authors use to indicate analogy-based reasoning. In the STEM classroom, this research has implications for enhancing student learning about abstract topics in science.

TI Nanoheating and Nanoconduction with Near-Field Plasmonics: Prospects for
   Harnessing the Moire and Seebeck Effects in Ultrathin Films
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Near-field plasmonics is a burgeoning field that has unlocked several opportunities related to quantum information processing, single-molecule spectroscopy, and cavity quantum electrodynamics. All of which require the adept control of light, heat, and charges on the nanoscale. In particular, nanoresonators and near-field transducers (NFTs) have the ability to subdiffract light well below the classical diffraction limit by coupling a photon mode to a plasmonic mode. Herein, advantage is taken of a nanoscale plasmonic light source produced by an NFT and the subsequent "hot spot" created by its relatively high intensity. It is theoretically demonstrated how the light, heat, and current produced can be manipulated when incident on layers of black phosphorous (BP), a highly abundant material with electric and thermal conductivity values comparable to graphene. Moire physics of two films rotated relative to one another, along with the Seebeck effect for which temperature gradients show the possibility to induce electrical voltages (milli-Volts) without a metallic contact, is specifically investigated. It is found that these methods can effectively regulate the temperature distribution and its values by roughly 10(1)-10(2) K, crucial to the functionality of many nanodevices, and furthermore manipulate the directional flow of current; advantageous for electrical switching and output steering of energy.

TI Bright Quantum Dot Single-Photon Emitters at Telecom Bands
   Heterogeneously Integrated on Si
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Whereas the Si photonic platform is highly attractive for scalable optical quantum information processing, it lacks practical solutions for efficient photon generation. Self-assembled semi-conductor quantum dots (QDs) efficiently emit photons in the telecom bands (1460-1625 nm) and allow for heterogeneous integration with Si. In this work, we report on a novel, robust, and industry-compatible approach for achieving single-photon emission from InAs/InP QDs heterogeneously integrated with a Si substrate. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a simple vertical emitting device, employing a metallic mirror beneath the QD emitter, and experimentally obtained photon extraction efficiencies of similar to 10%. Nevertheless, the figures of merit of our structures are comparable with values previously only achieved for QDs emitting at shorter wavelength or by applying technically demanding fabrication processes. Our architecture and the simple fabrication procedure allows for the demonstration of high-purity single-photon generation with a second-order correlation function at zero time delay, g((2))(tau = 0) < 0.02, without any corrections at continuous wave excitation at the liquid helium temperature and preserved up to 50 K. For pulsed excitation, we achieve the as-measured g((2))(0) down to 0.205 +/- 0.020 (0.114 +/- 0.020 with background coincidences subtracted).

TI Unidirectional Gaussian One-Way Steering
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Steering is a type of quantum nonlocality that exhibits an inherent asymmetry between two observers. In a nondegenerate three-level laser coupled to a two-mode squeezed vacuum reservoir, under realistic experimental conditions, the Gaussian steering of two laser modes, A$\mathcal {A}$ and B$\mathcal {B}$, generated within the cascade transitions, respectively are examined. It is found that the A -> B$\mathcal {A}\rightarrow \mathcal {B}$ steerability is always higher than that from B -> A$\mathcal {B}\rightarrow \mathcal {A}$; in addition, the steering asymmetry cannot exceed ln 2, which implies that the state rho AB$\hat{\varrho }_{\mathcal {AB}}$ never diverges to an extremal asymmetry state. It is shown how squeezed noise can play a constructive role in realizing one-way steering. As the main result, it is demonstrated that the state rho AB$\hat{\varrho }_{\mathcal {AB}}$ can exhibit one-way steering solely from A -> B$\mathcal {A}\rightarrow \mathcal {B}$, which is shown to emerge as a consequence of the fact that the intensity difference of the modes A$\mathcal {A}$ and B$\mathcal {B}$ is verified to remain always positive, irrespective of the physical and environmental parameters of rho AB$\hat{\varrho }_{\mathcal {AB}}$. The generated unidirectional one-way steering may provide a useful resource for the distribution of the trust in future asymmetric quantum information tasks.

TI Coherent spectroscopy with a single antiproton spin
SO NATURE
AB Coherent quantum transition spectroscopy is a powerful tool in metrology1, quantum information processing2, magnetometry3 and precision tests of the standard model4. It was applied with great success in proton and deuteron magnetic moment measurements5, which culminated in maser spectroscopy with sub-parts-per-trillion resolution6 and many other experiments at the forefront of physics7. All of these experiments were performed on macroscopic ensembles of particles, whereas the coherent spectroscopy of a 'free' single nuclear spin has, to our knowledge, never been reported before. Here we demonstrate coherent quantum transition spectroscopy of the spin of a single antiproton stored in a cryogenic Penning-trap system. We apply a multi-trap technique8, detect the antiproton spin state using the continuous Stern-Gerlach effect9 and transport the particle to the homogeneous magnetic field of a precision trap (PT). Here we induce the coherent dynamics and analyse the result by quantum-projection measurements in the analysis trap (AT)10. We observe, for the first time, Rabi oscillations of an antiproton spin and achieve in time-series measurements spin-inversion probabilities greater than 80% at spin coherence times of about 50 s. Scans of single-particle spin resonances show inversions greater than 70%, at transition linewidths 16 times narrower than in previous measurements8, limited by cyclotron frequency measurement decoherence. This achievement marks a notable step towards at least tenfold improved tests of matter/antimatter symmetry using proton and antiproton magnetic moments.

TI Near-complete chiral selection in rotational quantum states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Controlling the internal quantum states of chiral molecules for a selected enantiomer has a wide range of fundamental applications from collision and reaction studies, quantum information to precision spectroscopy. Achieving full enantiomer-specific state transfer is a key requirement for such applications. Using tailored microwave fields, a chosen rotational state can be enriched for a selected enantiomer, even starting from a racemic mixture. This enables rapid switching between samples of different enantiomers in a given state, holding great promise, for instance, for measuring parity violation in chiral molecules. Although perfect state-specific enantiomeric enrichment is theoretically feasible, achieving the required experimental conditions seemed unrealistic. Here, we realize near-ideal conditions, overcoming both the limitations of thermal population and spatial degeneracy in rotational states. We achieve over 92% enantiomer-specific state transfer efficiency using enantiopure samples. This indicates that 96% state-specific enantiomeric purity can be obtained from a racemic mixture, in an approach that is universally applicable to all chiral molecules of C1 symmetry. Our work integrates the control over internal quantum states with molecular chirality, thus expanding the field of state-selective molecular beams studies to include chiral research.
   A potential origin of homochirality in living organisms is the parity-violating energy difference between enantiomers. Here, the authors realize a technique to control rotational states of chiral molecules using microwave and ultraviolet radiation.

TI Excitonic response in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures
   from first principles: Impact of stacking, twisting, and interlayer
   distance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides provide a unique platform to engineer optoelectronic devices tuning their optical properties via stacking, twisting, or straining. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory, we predict the electronic and optical (absorption and photoluminescence spectra) properties of MoS2/WS2 and MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers with different stacking and twisting. We analyze the valley splitting and optical transitions, and we explain the enhancement or quenching of the interand intralayer exciton states. We fully include transitions within the entire Brillouin Zone, contrary to predictions based on continuum models which only consider energies near the K point. As a result, we predict an interlayer exciton with significant electron density in both layers and a mixed intralayer exciton distributed over both MoSe2 and WSe2 in a twisted Se-based heterostructure. We propose that it should be possible to produce an inverted order of the excitonic states in some MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures, where the energy of the intralayer WSe2 exciton is lower than that in MoSe2. We predict the variability across different stacking of the exciton peak positions (-100 meV) and the exciton radiative lifetimes, from pico- to nanoseconds, and even microseconds in twisted bilayers. The control of exciton energies and lifetimes paves the way toward applications in quantum information technologies and optical sensing.

TI Two types of neural network representations of quantum mixed states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum information and artificial intelligence are the two most cutting-edge research fields in recent years, which have made a lot of progress in changing the traditional science. It has become a hot topic of research to realize the cross fusion of the two fields. Scholars have made many explorations in this field. For example, they have simulated the steady state and the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems. However, little attention has been paid to the problem of accurate representation of neural networks. In this paper, we focus on neural network representations of quantum mixed states. We first propose neural network quantum mixed virtual states (NNQMVS) and neural network quantum mixed states (NNQMS) with general input observables by using two neural network architectures, respectively. Then we explore their properties and obtain the related conclusions of NNQMVS and NNQMS under tensor product operation and local unitary operation. To quantify the approximation degree of normalized NNQMVS and NNQMS for a given mixed state, we define the best approximation degree by using normalized NNQMVS and NNQMS, and obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the representability of a general mixed state by using normalized NNQMVS and NNQMS. Moreover, we explore the types of mixed states that can be represented by these two neural network architectures and show their accurate neural network representations.

TI Anomalous quantized plateaus in two-dimensional electron gas with gate
   confinement
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum information can be coded by the topologically protected edges of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. Investigation on FQH edges in the hope of searching and utilizing non-Abelian statistics has been a focused challenge for years. Manipulating the edges, e.g. to bring edges close to each other or to separate edges spatially, is a common and essential step for such studies. The FQH edge structures in a confined region are typically presupposed to be the same as that in the open region in analysis of experimental results, but whether they remain unchanged with extra confinement is obscure. In this work, we present a series of unexpected plateaus in a confined single-layer two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), which are quantized at anomalous fractions such as 9/4, 17/11, 16/13 and the reported 3/2. We explain all the plateaus by assuming surprisingly larger filling factors in the confined region. Our findings enrich the understanding of edge states in the confined region and in the applications of gate manipulation, which is crucial for the experiments with quantum point contact and interferometer.
   A quantized plateau is typically considered to be the feature of a fractional quantum Hall state. Yan et al. report a series of plateaus quantized at unusual fractions in a confined two-dimensional electron gas, which is attributed to enhanced density in the confined region.

TI Geometric origin of intrinsic spin hall effect in an inhomogeneous
   electric field
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The spin Hall effect is a transport phenomenon with significant importance for spintronics since it can be used to design ways of generating and detecting spin currents. Here, the authors investigate the intrinsic spin Hall effect induced by an inhomogeneous electric field and show that it can be engineered by tuning the Fermi energy in both Rashba and Dresselhaus systems.
   In recent years, the spin Hall effect has received great attention because of its potential application in spintronics and quantum information processing and storage. However, this effect is usually studied under the external homogeneous electric field. Understanding how the inhomogeneous electric field affects the spin Hall effect is still lacking. Here, we investigate a two-dimensional two-band time-reversal symmetric system and give an expression for the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity in the presence of the inhomogeneous electric field, which is shown to be expressed through the geometric quantities: quantum metric and interband Berry connection. We show that for Rashba and Dresselhaus systems, the inhomogeneous intrinsic spin Hall conductivity can be tuned with the Fermi energy. On the other hand, when people get physical intuition on transport phenomena from the wave packet, one issue appears. It is shown that the conductivity obtained from the conventional wave packet approach cannot be fully consistent with the one predicted by the Kubo-Greenwood formula. Here, we attempt to solve this problem.

TI Variance of Relative Surprisal as Single-Shot Quantifier
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The variance of (relative) surprisal, also known as varentropy, so far mostly plays a role in information theory as quantifying the leading-order corrections to asymptotic independent and identically distributed (IID) limits. Here, we comprehensively study the use of it to derive single-shot results in (quantum) information theory. We show that it gives genuine sufficient and necessary conditions for approximate state transitions between pairs of quantum states in the single-shot setting, without the need for further optimization. We also clarify its relation to smoothed min and max entropies, and construct a monotone for resource theories using only the standard (relative) entropy and variance of (relative) surprisal. This immediately gives rise to enhanced lower bounds for entropy production in random processes. We establish certain properties of the variance of relative surprisal, which will be useful for further investigations, such as uniform continuity and upper bounds on the violation of subadditivity. Motivated by our results, we further derive a simple and physically appealing axiomatic single-shot characterization of (relative) entropy, which we believe to be of independent interest. We illustrate our results with several applications, ranging from interconvertibility of ergodic states, over Landauer erasure to a bound on the necessary dimension of the catalyst for catalytic state transitions and Boltzmann's H theorem.

TI How to create giant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions? Analytical
   derivation and ab initio calculations on model dicopper(II)
   complexes
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB This paper is a theoretical "proof of concept" on how the on-site first-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can generate giant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in binuclear transition metal complexes. This effective interaction plays a key role in strongly correlated materials, skyrmions, multiferroics, and molecular magnets of promising use in quantum information science and computing. Despite this, its determination from both theory and experiment is still in its infancy and existing systems usually exhibit very tiny magnitudes. We derive analytical formulas that perfectly reproduce both the nature and the magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction calculated using state-of-the-art ab initio calculations performed on model bicopper(II) complexes. We also study which geometrical structures/ligand-field forces would enable one to control the magnitude and the orientation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector in order to guide future synthesis of molecules or materials. This article provides an understanding of its microscopic origin and proposes recipes to increase its magnitude. We show that (i) the on-site mixings of 3d orbitals rule the orientation and magnitude of this interaction, (ii) increased values can be obtained by choosing more covalent complexes, and (iii) huge values (similar to 1000 cm(-1)) and controlled orientations could be reached by approaching structures exhibiting on-site first-order SOC, i.e., displaying an "unquenched orbital momentum."

TI Light structuring via nonlinear total angular momentum addition with
   flat optics
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Shaping the structure of light with flat optical devices has driven significant advancements in our fundamental understanding of light and light-matter interactions, and enabled a broad range of applications, from image processing and microscopy to optical communication, quantum information processing, and the manipulation of microparticles. Yet, pushing the boundaries of structured light beyond the linear optical regime remains an open challenge. Nonlinear optical interactions, such as wave mixing in nonlinear flat optics, offer a powerful platform to unlock new degrees of freedom and functionalities for generating and detecting structured light. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the non-trivial structuring of third-harmonic light enabled by the addition of total angular momentum projection in a nonlinear, isotropic flat optics element-a single thin film of amorphous silicon. We identify the total angular momentum projection and helicity as the most critical properties for analyzing the experimental results. The theoretical approach we propose, supported by numerical simulations, offers quantitative predictions for light structuring through nonlinear wave mixing under various pumping conditions, including vectorial and non-paraxial pump light. Notably, we reveal that the shape of third-harmonic light is highly sensitive to the polarization state of the pump. Our findings demonstrate that harnessing the addition of total angular momentum projection in nonlinear wave mixing can be a powerful strategy for generating and detecting precisely controlled structured light.

TI Quantum behavior of multiple monomeric arrays of spin 12
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin arrays provide a framework for studying cooperative spin phenomena and correlated states. Advances in high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (HFEPR) above 90 GHz offer new opportunities to investigate these systems, determine the effect of weak spin-spin interactions, and evaluate their magnitudes. Here, we investigate the cupric coordination compound Cu(L-met)2, where anisotropic S = 12 spins occupy two rotated structural sites, forming weakly coupled spin arrays via supramolecular interactions. Previous EPR studies at 9.7 GHz and 33.6 GHz identified pseudo-one-dimensional magnetic behavior with a single, orientation-independent spectral peak, allowing estimates of exchange couplings. In this work, HFEPR spectra up to 450 GHz and magnetic fields (B0) up to 16 T display a more complex spectral landscape: the number of resonances switches between one and two as a function of the orientation of B0, revealing different dynamical regimes. This behavior indicates a crossover between a collective quantum-correlated phase and a regime where spins behave independently, allowing us to construct quantum dynamical phase diagrams across frequency and field space. These findings reinforce molecular compounds as promising platforms for exploring tunable spin dynamics, with implications for quantum information science. The observation of spin-spin interactions persisting at room temperature highlights their potential for robust quantum coherence in molecular systems.

TI From Micro-Optical to Quantum-Enhanced Gyroscopes: A Comprehensive
   Review
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB With the rapid development of micro-nano fabrication technology, micro-optical gyroscope technology has shown tremendous potential in integration, miniaturization, and sensitivity. The micro-optical gyroscope is closely related to the performance of the gyroscopic system, which is realized by the light-matter interaction and resonance enhancement. Currently, the detection range of micro-optical gyroscopes extends from millimeter-scale physical mechanical motion to molecular vibrations at the nanometer scale; however, their precision is challenging to surpass the standard quantum limit. The primary research objective of quantum precision measurement is to utilize quantum resources to conduct quantum-enhanced measurements on physical system quantities, thereby surpassing the quantum limit and improving parameter measurement accuracy. In recent years, due to the rapid development in the field of quantum precision measurement, quantum gyroscope has made great progress in practical and engineering. In the future, by replacing traditional accelerometers and gyroscopes, it may be possible to develop highly integrated, low-power, and low-drift quantum inertial navigation systems. Based on the information disclosed by journals, conferences, and related research institutions, this paper briefly outlines the development status, basic principles, and corresponding challenges of the micro-optical gyroscope. Additionally, this paper introduces the current theoretical and experimental progress of quantum-enhanced gyroscopes.

TI Nonreciprocal dynamics of exceptional points in pseudo-Hermitian systems
   under artificial gauge field
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The exploration of nonreciprocal dynamics carries substantial significance in both the field of quantum information processing and the domain of topological photonics. Here, we propose a quadruple-well system for generating nonreciprocity through the utilization of laser-assisted tunneling, wherein the generic principles governing the process can induce both purely real and complex asymmetric coupling mechanisms between adjacent wells. The complex asymmetric tunneling amplitudes induce an artificial gauge field that is equivalent to the Aharonov-Bohm phase experienced by charged particles in a magnetic field. The inclusion of purely real asymmetric tunneling amplitudes introduces pseudo-Hermiticity into the system. We explicitly delineate the conditions for the phase transitions of the system, transitioning from the parity-time ( PT)-symmetric phase to the spontaneously broken PT-symmetric phase, along with the corresponding exceptional points (EPs). We then conduct a comprehensive investigation of the intriguing nonreciprocal dynamics both near and at the EPs, yielding notably distinct analytical results across all parametric regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of nonreciprocal transport by manipulating the pseudo-Hermiticity and artificial gauge field, thereby enabling the reversal of the nonreciprocal directionality. Our study exhaustively elucidates the profound mechanisms underlying the interplay between pseudo-Hermiticity and artificial gauge fields on nonreciprocal dynamics, with potential implications for the design of innovative quantum nonreciprocal devices.

TI Continuous and precise modulation of vortex beams based on terahertz
   full-space coding metasurfaces
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) exhibit excellent potential for applications in fields such as sixth-generation communication, quantum information processing, and imaging technologies. However, the realization of multi-mode and full-space continuous precision modulation of vortex beams still faces significant challenges. In this study, a terahertz full-space coding metasurface based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) is proposed, combined with a more accurate generalized coding strategy, convolution, and generalized superposition methods to achieve continuous and precise modulation of vortex beams. First, the phase state of VO2 is dynamically adjusted by temperature changes, enabling the coding metasurface to switch between transmission and reflection operating modes. Second, a precise generalized coding strategy is developed to support the generation of coding sequences for arbitrary Ni values by logically discretizing the size Ni of the super-subunit. Meanwhile, by convolving different coding sequences, continuous and precise modulation of different modes of vortex beams in the range of 0 to 360 degrees is realized. Finally, the deflection vortex beams carrying different OAM are effectively superimposed using the generalized superposition method. This innovative coding strategy significantly improves the ability of continuous and precise modulation of the vortex beam wavefront, laying a solid foundation for future breakthroughs in intelligent communication and high-resolution imaging technologies.

TI Modal phase-matching in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides for
   efficient generation of entangled photon pairs
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguides have emerged as a pivotal platform for on-chip spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), serving as a crucible for the generation of entangled photon pairs. The periodic poling of TFLN, while capable of generating high-efficiency SPDC, demands intricate fabrication processes that can be onerous in terms of scalability and manufacturability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to the generation of entangled photon pairs via SPDC within TFLN waveguides, harnessing the principles of modal phase-matching (MPM). To address the challenge of efficiently exciting pump light typically in a higher-order mode, we have engineered a mode converter that couples two asymmetrically dimensioned waveguides. This converter adeptly transforms the fundamental mode into a higher-order mode, demonstrating a conversion loss of 1.55 dB at 785 nm with a 3 dB bandwidth exceeding 30 nm. Subsequently, we have showcased the device's capabilities by characterizing the pair generation rate (PGR), coincidences-to-accidentals ratio (CAR), and spectral profile of the entangled photon source. Our findings present a simplified and versatile method for the on-chip generation of entangled photon sources, which may pave the way for the application in the realms of quantum information processing and communication technologies.

TI High-performance designs for fiber-pigtailed quantum-light sources based
   on quantum dots in electrically-controlled circular Bragg gratings
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a numerical investigation of directly fiber-coupled hybrid circular Bragg gratings (CBGs) featuring electrical control for operation in the application relevant wavelength regimes around 930 nm as well as the telecom O-and C-band. We use a surrogate model combined with a Bayesian optimization approach to perform numerical optimization of the device performance which takes into account robustness with respect to fabrication tolerances. The proposed high-performance designs combine hybrid CBGs with a dielectric planarization and a transparent contact material, enabling > 86% direct fiber coupling efficiency (> 93% efficiency into NA 0.8) while exhibiting Purcell factors > 20. Especially the proposed designs for the telecom range prove robust and can sustain expected fiber efficiencies of more than (82.2 +/- 4.1)+2.2 -5.5% and expected average Purcell factors of up to (23.2 +/- 2.3)+3.2 -3.0 assuming conservative fabrication accuracies. The wavelength of maximum Purcell enhancement proves to be the most affected performance parameter by the deviations. Finally, we show that electrical field strengths suitable for Stark-tuning of an embedded quantum dot can be reached in the identified designs. Our work provides blueprints for high-performance quantum light sources based on fiber-pigtailed and electrically-controlled quantum dot CBG devices for quantum information applications.

TI Giant spin-selective bandgap renormalization in CsPbBr3 colloidal
   nanocrystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The spin-dependence of the strongly correlated phenomena and many-body interactions play an important role in quantum information science. In particular, it is quite interesting but unclear how the spin degree of freedom ramifies the bandgap renormalization, one of the fundamental many-body phenomena. We report the first room-temperature observation of giant spin-selective bandgap renormalization (SS-BGR) in CsPbBr3 colloidal nanocrystals using time-resolved circularly polarized femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. The SS-BGR results from many-body interactions among carriers with the same spin that renormalize their joint density of states by 57?? 1 meV, visualized here as photoinduced absorption (PIA) below band-edge transition energy when the pump and probe are co-polarized. The hallmark result of spectrally resolved SS-BGR is in stark contrast to the usually submerged signal in II-VI and III-V semiconductors and is 3 orders of magnitude larger than that observed in Ge/SiGe quantum wells, highlighting the unique and beneficial band structure of the metal-halide semiconductors. We propose that the PIA, due to SS-BGR, can be used to describe the spinpolarization and spin-relaxation dynamics. The experimental and theoretical findings open up new possibilities for optical manipulation of spin degrees of freedom and their many-body interactions in metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals for potential room-temperature applications.

TI Dual-mode microresonators as straightforward access to octave-spanning
   dissipative Kerr solitons
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The Kerr soliton frequency comb is a revolutionary compact ruler of coherent light that allows applications from precision metrology to quantum information technology. The universal, reliable, and low-cost soliton microcomb source is key to these applications. As a development and extension of the direct creation of a soliton microcomb with the dual-mode scheme in an aluminum nitride microresonator, this paper thoroughly presents the design strategy to reliably attain such dual-modes in the silicon nitride (Si3N4) platform, separated by & SIM;10 GHz, which stabilizes soliton formation without using additional auxiliary laser or RF components. We demonstrate the deterministic generation of the refined single-solitons that span 1.5-octaves, i.e., near 200 THz, via adiabatic pump wavelength tuning. The ultra-wide soliton existence range up to 17 GHz not only suggests the robustness of the system but will also extend the applications of soliton combs. Moreover, the proposed scheme is found to easily give rise to multi-solitons as well as the soliton crystals featuring enhanced repetition rate (2 and 3 THz) and conversion efficiency greater than 10%. We also show the effective thermal tuning of mode separation to increase the possibility to access the single-soliton state. Our results are crucial for the chip-scale self-referenced frequency combs with a simplified configuration. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI High-efficiency coupling of single quantum emitters into hole-tailored
   nanofibers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to enhance the coupling efficiency of photons from a single quantum emitter into a hole-tailored nanofiber. The single quantum emitter is positioned inside a circular hole etched along the radial axis of the nanofiber. The coupling efficiency can be effectively enhanced and is twice as high as the case in which only an intact nanofiber without the hole is used. The effective enhancement independent of a cavity can avoid the selection of a single emitter for the specific wavelength, which means a broad operating wavelength range. Numerical simulations are performed to optimize the coupling efficiency by setting appropriate diameters of the nanofiber and the hole. The simulation results show that the coupling efficiency can reach 62.8% when the single quantum emitter with azimuthal polarization (x direction) is at a position 200 nm from the middle of the hole along the hole-axial direction. The diameters of the nanofiber and the hole are 800 nm and 400 nm, respectively, while the wavelength of the single quantum emitter is 852 nm. Hole-tailored nanofibers have a simple configuration and are easy to fabricate and integrate with other micro/nanophotonic structures; this fiber structure has wide application prospects in quantum information processing and quantum precision measurement.

TI All van der Waals Integrated Nanophotonics with Bulk Transition Metal
   Dichalcogenides
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Integrated optics is at the heart of a wide range of systems from remote sensing and communications to computing and quantum information processing. Demand for smaller and more energy efficient structures stimulates a search for more advanced material platforms. Here, we propose a concept of an all van der Waals photonics, where we show that electronically bulk transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors are well fitted for the design of key optical components for nanoscale and integrated photonics. Specifically, we demonstrate theoretically that, owing to their unique properties, components made of bulk TMDCs may potentially outperform counterparts made of conventional 3D semiconductors, such as Si and III-Vs. We discuss several key quantum and classical optical components and show that bulk TMDCs may pave the way to smaller footprint devices, more energy efficient electro-optic modulators, and a stronger quantum light-materials interaction. In our study, to account for anisotropic properties of bulk TMDC materials and enhanced light-materials interaction, we develop a theoretical formalism that allows exploring complex structures made of such materials. Enhanced optical performance, ease of integration, and a wide range of materials selection suggest that bulk TMDCs may complement existing integrated photonics systems.

TI A Guiding Principle for Quantum State Discrimination in the
   Real-Spectrum Phase of P-Pseudo-Hermitian Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum state discrimination (QSD) is a fundamental task in quantum information processing, improving the computation efficiency and communication security. Non-Hermitian (NH) PT-symmetric systems were found to be able to discriminate two quantum states better than the Hermitian strategy. In this work, we propose a QSD approach based on P-pseudo-Hermitian systems with real spectra. We theoretically prove the feasibility of realizing QSD in the real-spectrum phase of a P-pseudo-Hermitian system, i.e., two arbitrary non-orthogonal quantum states can be discriminated by a suitable P-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In detail, we decide the minimal angular separation between two non-orthogonal quantum states for a fixed P-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and we find the orthogonal evolution time is able to approach zero under suitable conditions, while both the trace distance and the quantum relative entropy are employed to judge their orthogonality. We give a criterion to choose the parameters of a P-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian that evolves the two initial orthogonal states faster than a fixed arbitrary PT-symmetric one with an identical energy difference. Our work expands the NH family for QSD, and can be used to explore real quantum systems in the future.

TI Parity symmetry breaking of spin-j coherent state superpositions
   in Gaussian noise channel
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The Wigner function and Wigner-Yanase skew information are connected through quantum coherence. States with high skew information often exhibit more pronounced negative regions in their Wigner functions, indicative of quantum interference and non-classical behavior. Thus, the relationship between these two concepts is that states with high quantum coherence tend to display more non-classical features in their Wigner functions. By exploiting this relationship, which manifests as parity symmetry and asymmetry, we analyze parity symmetry and asymmetry in the superposition of two spin coherent states for a spin-1/2, as well as for a general spin-j. This analysis shows that the preservation of the parity asymmetry, or the violation of the parity symmetry, correlates with an increase in the value of spin j. Additionally, we investigate the behavior of parity symmetry and asymmetry of these states subjected to a Gaussian noise channel. Specifically, we examine how this parity symmetry and asymmetry change and identify the points at which parity symmetry is violated in the spin-1/2 cat state. Notably, the violation of parity symmetry becomes more pronounced at higher values of the decoherence parameter s. Our study shows how the spin value j affects the breaking of parity symmetry in general spin-j cat states that are hit by Gaussian noise.

TI Deep-learning-assisted inverse design of dual-spin/frequency metasurface
   for quad-channel off-axis vortices multiplexing
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Recently, the metasurfaces for independently controlling the wavefront and amplitude of two orthogonal circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves have been demonstrated to open a way toward spin-multiplexing compact metadevices. However, these metasurfaces are mostly restricted to a single operation frequency band. The main challenge to achieving multiple frequency manipulations stems from the complicated and time-consuming design caused by multifrequency cross talk. To solve this problem, we propose a deep-learning-assisted inverse design method for designing a dual-spin/frequency metasurface with flexible multiplexing of off-axis vortices. By analyzing the cross talk between different spin/frequency channels based on the deep-learning method, we established the internal mapping relationship between the physical parameters of a meta-atom and its phase responses in multichannels, realizing the rapid inverse design of the spin/frequency multiplexing EM device. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated in the microwave region a dual-frequency arbitrary spin-to-orbit angular momentum converter, a dual-frequency off-axis vector vortex multiplexer, and a large-capacity (16-channel) vortex beam generator. The proposed method may provide a compact and efficient platform for the multiplexing of vortices, which may further stimulate their applications in wireless communication and quantum information science.

TI Neumann's principle based eigenvector approach for deriving
   non-vanishing tensor elements for nonlinear optics
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Physical properties are commonly represented by tensors, such as optical susceptibilities. The conventional approach of deriving non-vanishing tensor elements of symmetric systems relies on the intuitive consideration of positive/negative sign flipping after symmetry operations, which could be tedious and prone to miscalculation. Here, we present a matrix-based approach that gives a physical picture centered on Neumann's principle. The principle states that symmetries in geometric systems are adopted by their physical properties. We mathematically apply the principle to the tensor expressions and show a procedure with clear physical intuition to derive non-vanishing tensor elements based on eigensystems. The validity of the approach is demonstrated by examples of commonly known second and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities of chiral/achiral surfaces, together with complicated scenarios involving symmetries such as D-6 and O-h symmetries. We then further applied this method to higher-rank tensors that are useful for 2D and high-order spectroscopy. We also extended our approach to derive nonlinear tensor elements with magnetization, which is critical for measuring spin polarization on surfaces for quantum information technologies. A Mathematica code based on this generalized approach is included that can be applied to any symmetry and higher order nonlinear processes.

TI The Transcription Machinery and the Driving Force of the Transcriptional
   Molecular Condensate: The Role of Phosphates
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The dynamic phosphorylation of the human RNA Pol II CTD establishes a code applicable to all eukaryotic transcription processes. However, the ability of these specific post-translational modifications to convey molecular signals through structural changes remains unclear. We previously explained that each gene can be modeled as a combination of n circuits connected in parallel. RNA Pol II accesses these circuits and, through a series of pulses, matches the resonance frequency of the DNA qubits, enabling it to extract genetic information and quantum teleport it. Negatively charged phosphates react under RNA Pol II catalysis, which increases the electron density on the deoxyribose acceptor carbon (2'C in the DNA sugar backbone). The phosphorylation effect on the stability of a carbon radical connects tyrosine to the nitrogenous base, while the subsequent pulses link the protein to molecular water through hydrogen bonds. The selective activation of inert C(sp3)-H bonds begins by reading the quantum information stored in the nitrogenous bases. The coupling of hydrogen proton transfer with electron transfer in water generates a supercurrent, which is explained by the correlation of pairs of the same type of fermions exchanging a boson. All these changes lead to the formation of a molecular protein-DNA-water transcriptional condensate.

TI Silicon-On-Silicon Carbide Platform for Integrated Photonics
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Silicon carbide (SiC)'s nonlinear optical properties and applications to quantum information have recently brought attention to its potential as an integrated photonics platform. However, despite its many excellent material properties, such as large thermal conductivity, wide transparency window, and strong optical nonlinearities, it is generally a difficult material for microfabrication. Here, it is shown that directly bonded silicon-on-silicon carbide can be a high-performing hybrid photonics platform that does not require the need to form SiC membranes or directly pattern in SiC. The optimized bonding method yields defect-free, uniform films with minimal oxide at the silicon-silicon-carbide interface. Ring resonators are patterned into the silicon layer with standard, complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible (Si) fabrication and measure room-temperature, near-infrared quality factors exceeding 105. The corresponding propagation loss is 5.7 dB cm-1. The process offers a wafer-scalable pathway to the integration of SiC photonics into CMOS devices.
   This study demonstrates heterogeneous silicon-on-silicon carbide (SiSiC) as a high-performance, scalable photonic platform that overcomes several challenges associated with silicon carbide microfabrication. Ring resonators patterned into the silicon device layer support quality factors exceeding 105 corresponding to propagation loss of 5.7 dB cm-1, and numerical simulations show SiSiC's potential for nonlinear and quantum applications. image

TI Spin polarized current in chiral organic radical monolayers
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is the capability of chiral molecules to act as spin filters, i.e. to selectively sort flowing electrons based on their spin states. The application of this captivating phenomenon holds great promise in the realm of molecular spintronics, where the primary focus lies in advancing technologies based on chiral molecules to regulate the injection and coherence of spin-polarized currents. In this context, we conducted a study to explore the spin filtering capabilities of a monolayer of the thia-bridged triarylamine hetero[4]helicene radical cation chemisorbed on a metallic surface. Magnetic-conductive atomic force microscopy revealed efficient electron spin filtering at exceptionally low potentials. Furthermore, we constructed a spintronic device by incorporating a monolayer of these molecules in between two electrodes, obtaining an asymmetric magnetoresistance trend with signal inversion in accordance with the handedness of the enantiomer involved, indicative of the presence of the CISS effect. Our findings underscore the significance of thia[4]azahelicene organic radicals as promising candidates for the development of quantum information operations based on the CISS effect as a tool to control the molecular spin states.
   An enantiopure organic radical monolayer on gold exhibits efficient spin selectivity properties in electron transport. This result makes thia[4]azahelicenes promising candidates for the development of chiral spintronic molecular-based devices.

However, the unattainability of fundamental precision bounds for incompatible observables greatly diminishes the applicability of estimation theory in many practical implementations. The Holevo Cramer-Rao bound (HCRB) provides the most fundamental, simultaneously attainable bound for multiparameter estimation problems. A general closed form for the HCRB is not known given that it requires a complex optimization over multiple variables. In this work, we develop an analytic approach to solving the HCRB for two parameters. Our analysis reveals the role of the HCRB and its interplay with alternative bounds in estimation theory. For more parameters, we generate a lower bound to the HCRB. Our work greatly reduces the complexity of determining the HCRB to solving a set of linear equations that even numerically permits a quadratic speedup over previous state-of-the-art approaches. We apply our results to compare the performance of different probe states in magnetic field sensing and characterize the performance of state tomography on the code space of noisy bosonic error-correcting codes. The sensitivity of state tomography on noisy binomial code states can be improved by tuning two coding parameters that relate to the number of correctable phase and amplitude damping errors. Our work provides fundamental insights and makes significant progress toward the estimation of multiple incompatible observables.

TI Observing Ghost Entanglement Beyond Scattering Amplitudes in Quantum
   Electrodynamics
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A fully local quantum account of the interactions experienced between charges requires us to use all four modes of the electromagnetic vector potential in the Lorenz gauge. However, it is frequently stated that only the two transverse modes of the vector potential are "real" in that they contain photons that can actually be detected. The photons present in the other two modes, the scalar and the longitudinal, are considered unobservable and are referred to as "virtual particles" or "ghosts". Here we argue that this view, which is rooted in standard quantum electrodynamics, is a consequence of assuming that charges are always dressed in such modes and that naked charges do not have an independent existence. In particular, we present a thought experiment where, assuming that naked charges can be independently manipulated, one can then measure the entanglement generated between a charge and the scalar modes. This entanglement is a direct function of the number of photons present in the scalar field. Our conclusion, therefore, is that the scalar quantum variables, under this assumption, would be as "real" as the transverse ones, where reality is defined by their ability to affect the charge. A striking consequence of this is that there is a critical value of charge beyond which we cannot detect its spatial superposition by local means.

TI Xenon plasma-focused ion beam milling for fabrication of high-purity,
   bright single-photon sources operating in the C-band
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Electron beam lithography is a standard method for fabricating photonic micro and nanostructures around semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which are crucial for efficient single and indistinguishable photon sources in quantum information processing. However, this technique is difficult for direct 3D control of the structure shape, complicating the design and enlarging the 2D footprint to suppress in-plane photon leakage while directing photons into the collecting lens aperture. Here, we present an alternative approach to employ xenon plasma-focused ion beam (Xe-PFIB) technology as a reliable method for the 3D shaping of photonic structures containing low-density self-assembled InAs/InP quantum dots emitting in the C-band range of the 3rd telecommunication window. The method is optimized to minimize the possible ion-beam-induced material degradation, which allows exploration of both non-deterministic and deterministic fabrication approaches, resulting in photonic structures naturally shaped as truncated cones. As a demonstration, we fabricate mesas using a heterogeneously integrated structure with a QD membrane atop an aluminum mirror and silicon substrate. Finite-difference time-domain simulations show that the angled sidewalls significantly increase the emission collection efficiency to approx. 0.9 for NA = 0.65. We demonstrate experimentally a high purity of pulsed single-photon emission (similar to 99%) and a superior extraction efficiency value reported in the C-band of eta = 24 +/- 4%.

TI Purity in the QTMS radar
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this paper, we analyze the purity and decoherence effects in quantum two-mode squeezed (QTMS) radar as a function of the squeezing parameter and temperature, using quantum information processing tools. The squeezing parameter is an important key to improving the performance of the QTMS radar. We investigate the response to the squeezing parameter controlling to system state of the QTMS radar. In this work, we deal with the QTMS radar with two cases of the transmitted signal, the presence or the absence of the target. The squeezing parameter controls the power of the generated signal and idler, the correlation between signal and idler, as well as the coherence and state of the system. We show that the decoherence effects are low at low temperatures, low squeezing parameters, and low power. In addition, we demonstrate that the purity and, consequently, the coherence of the QTMS radar are better when the target is absent than when it is present. However, the coherence and purity are maintained at high temperatures in both cases. In addition, by calculating the entropy of formation as a tool to investigate the qualitative behavior of entanglement in QTMS radar, we show that the behaviors of purity and entropy are similar. Finally, we show that the proportion of received photons in the QTMS radar is an important factor in improving the radar performance.

TI On-Chip Tightly Confined Guiding and Splitting of Surface Acoustic Waves
   Using Line Defects in Phononic Crystals
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Phononic crystals (PnCs) exhibit acoustic properties that are not usually found in natural materials, which leads to the possibility of new devices for the complex manipulation of acoustic waves. In this article, a micron-scale phononic waveguide constructed by line defects in PnCs to achieve on-chip, tightly confined guiding, bending, and splitting of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is reported. The PnC is made of a square lattice of periodic nickel pillars on a piezoelectric substrate. The PnC lattice constant, pillar diameter, and pillar height are set to 10, 7.5, and 3.2 mu m, respectively, leading to a complete bandgap centered at 195 MHz. Interdigitated transducers are monolithically integrated on the same substrate for SAW excitation. The guiding, bending, and splitting of SAWs in the phononic waveguide are experimentally observed through measurement of the out-of-plane displacement fields using a scanning optical interferometer. The combination of destructive interference due to the Bragg bandgap and the interaction of the propagating wave with the pillars around the channel results in a tight confinement of the displacement field. The proposed phononic waveguides demonstrate the feasibility of precise local manipulation of SAW that is essential for emerging frontier applications, notably for phonon-based classical and quantum information processing.

TI Piezoelectric-Metal Phononic Crystal Enabling GHz Tunable Ultrahigh Q
   Quasi-BIC Mode
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The integration of GHz-frequency, high-quality factor (Q), and electrically tunable acoustic resonators holds significant potential for advancing applications in quantum information technologies, microwave photonics, and reconfigurable RF systems. However, simultaneously achieving these three characteristics within a single, scalable platform remains a fundamental challenge. Here, the experimental demonstration of a GHz quasi-BIC resonator in a piezoelectric thin-film shear horizontal (SH) wave system, achieved through a structurally simple piezoelectric-metal phononic crystal (PnC) architecture on a LiNbO3 thin film, is reported. This approach enables leaky Fabry-Perot coupling mode and localized trapping quasi-BIC mode. Without the need for deep etching or intricate patterning, a high room-temperature quality factor of approximate to 6.5 x 104 at approximate to 1 GHz in ambient air is achieved, corresponding to an f x Q product of approximate to 6.4 x 1013 Hz at quasi-BIC mode. Furthermore, efficient electrical tunability is demonstrated via low-voltage (0.6 V) electrothermal modulation of the PnC structure, enabling a reversible transition between trapped and transmission states and yielding a high-contrast amplitude modulation of 47.75 dB. This work opens new directions for scalable on-chip phononic circuits in quantum acoustics, reconfigurable RF systems, and signal processing applications.

TI Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasi-particles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless "electric" field and a "magnetic" vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial "flux-attachment" relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton-vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.

TI Embracing disorder in quantum materials design
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Many of the most exciting materials discoveries in fundamental condensed matter physics are made in systems hosting some degree of intrinsic disorder. While disorder has historically been regarded as something to be avoided in materials design, it is often of central importance to correlated and quantum materials. This is largely driven by the conceptual and theoretical ease to handle, predict, and understand highly uniform systems that exhibit complex interactions, symmetries, and band structures. In this Perspective, we highlight how flipping this paradigm has enabled exciting possibilities in the emerging field of high entropy materials, focusing primarily on high entropy oxide and chalcogenide quantum materials. These materials host high levels of cation or anion compositional disorder while maintaining unexpectedly uniform single crystal lattices. The diversity of atomic scale interactions of spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom are found to emerge into coherent properties on much larger length scales. Thus, altering the variance and magnitudes of the atomic scale properties through elemental selection can open new routes to tune global correlated phases, such as magnetism, metal-insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and even emergent topological responses. The strategy of embracing disorder in this way provides a much broader pallet from which functional states can be designed for next-generation microelectronic and quantum information systems.

TI A universal and stable metasurface for photonic quasi bound state in
   continuum coupled with two dimensional semiconductors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The strong coupling of excitons to optical cavity modes is of immense importance when understanding the fundamental physics of quantum electrodynamics at the nanoscale as well as for practical applications in quantum information technologies. There have been several attempts at achieving strong coupling between excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (BICs). We identify two gaps in the platforms for achieving strong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic quasi-BICs: firstly, in the studies so far, different cavity architectures have been employed for coupling to different TMDCs. This would mean that typically, the fabrication process flow for the cavities will need to be modified as one moves from one TMDC to the other, which can limit the technological progress in the field. Secondly, there has been no discussion of the impact of fabrication imperfections in the studies on the strong coupling of these subsystems so far. In this work, we address these two questions by optimizing a cavity with the same architecture, which can couple to the four typical TMDCs (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2) and perform a detailed investigation on the fabrication tolerance of the associated photonic quasi-BICs and their impact on strong coupling.

TI Effect of Thermal Tuning and Mode Coupling on Soliton Microcombs in ALN
   Microresonators
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Optical resonator-based Kerr frequency combs allow an ultra-precise time and frequency measurements for a wide range of applications including ranging, biosensing, high-capacity communications, and quantum information technology. Kerr solitons are coherent frequency combs that are crucial for frequency synthesizer and chronometric instruments. The behavior of the soliton is determined by multiple factors while the key challenge for stable operation is to maintain thermal equilibrium in the resonator. In this work, owing to the stabilizing thermal effect caused by a neighboring auxiliary mode (TE10), we demonstrate the generation of octave-spanning (1100-2380 nm) single-soliton within a wide laser detuning range (up to 16 GHz) by pumping the TE00 mode. The influence of temperature on the microcombs behavior is also explored. Firstly, diverse two-solitons are achieved by adjusting the temperature. Secondly, the soliton access possibility is reduced when further increasing the temperature due to the avoided mode crossing between the pump mode (TE00) and another adjacent fundamental transverse-magnetic mode. At the same time, the spectral bandwidth of the microcomb that originates from TM00 modes is significantly enhanced. Finally, we show that the carrier offset frequency, which is evaluated to be & SIM;30-40 GHz, increases as the temperature is increased.

TI Three-dimensional nano-coherent diffraction imaging technology based on
   high order harmonic X-ray sources
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) using ultra-short wavelength light source has become an three-dimensional(3D) nanoimaging technique. In CDI, a target sample is first illuminated by a coherent EUV and soft X-ray light, then the diffraction pattern is recorded by using a charge coupled device (CCD), and finally the image of the sample is obtained based on the pattern by using a phase retrieval algorithm. Of the many currently available coherent EUV and soft X-ray light sources, the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) is the simplest in structure, the lowest in cost, and most compact in size. Therefore, it has become the most promising light source for CDI. Through years of development, HHG based CDI technique(HHG-CDI) has become an outstanding 3D nano-imaging technique with the advantages of no aberration, no damage, and no contact either, and it also possesses the extra-capabilities of probing the dynamics, chemical composition and quantum information in various semiconductor and quantum devices. We believe that the HHG-CDI will soon become a generic nano-imaging tool that can complement or even replace the matured nanoimaging techniques, such as atomic force, near field, X-ray, electron, or scanning tunneling microscopes.

TI Quantum-like modeling in biology with open quantum systems and
   instruments
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB We present the novel approach to mathematical modeling of information processes in biosystems. It explores the mathematical formalism and methodology of quantum theory, especially quantum measurement theory. This approach is known as quantum-like and it should be distinguished from study of genuine quantum physical processes in biosystems (quantum biophysics, quantum cognition). It is based on quantum information representation of biosystem's state and modeling its dynamics in the framework of theory of open quantum systems. This paper starts with the non-physicist friendly presentation of quantum measurement theory, from the original von Neumann formulation to modern theory of quantum instruments. Then, latter is applied to model combinations of cognitive effects and gene regulation of glucose/lactose metabolism in Escherichia coli bacterium. The most general construction of quantum instruments is based on the scheme of indirect measurement, in that measurement apparatus plays the role of the environment for a biosystem. The biological essence of this scheme is illustrated by quantum formalization of Helmholtz sensation-perception theory. Then we move to open systems dynamics and consider quantum master equation, with concentrating on quantum Markov processes. In this framework, we model functioning of biological functions such as psychological functions and epigenetic mutation.

TI Exciton Kinetics Within Two Interacting Quantum Dots Featuring the
   A-Type Blinking-Kinetic Monte Carlo Approach for Coupled QDs Simulations
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Since the first reports of quantum dot (QD) based quasi-molecules formed by near-field-coupled QDs, how to design and apply such systems in the field of quantum information processing are still in learning process. Experimentally, single-particle spectroscopy is the method of choice for studying kinetic processes in such structures. However, current efforts focus on detecting all the photons emitted by the quasi-molecule, making it difficult to understand the precise changes occurring in each of the coupled QDs. In this study, a different approach is implemented by adapting the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms to gain comprehensive insights into the temporal evolution of each coupled QD. This encompasses not only photon emission events, but also the full range of kinetic processes, including exciton transfer between the QDs. It is, therefore, important to gain insight into the adaptation pathways caused by exciton exchange between near-field coupled QDs. The attention is strict to a system of two interacting QDs in different coupling regimes. The results point to new mechanisms of sequential/cascade excitonic relaxation, which are not typical for a QD in an isolated state. For this reason, the methodology presented here seems to be significant and complementary to the experimental approach.

TI Generation of spatial combs digitized by orbital angular momentum
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Shaping the transverse spatial domain of light has been experiencing recent growth in attention for its applications in optical tweezing, microscopy, communications, and quantum information sciences. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is a transverse physical property that functions as a viable basis for many of such applications. While fields containing a single OAM mode order have extensively been used, fields containing a broad, discrete, and equally spaced OAM spectrum-an OAM comb-has largely been unexplored due to a lack of viable creation methods. Much like how frequency combs enabled myriad applications, it is conceivable that OAM combs would likewise enable further opportunities or expand upon single-OAM applications. For instance, an OAM comb may pave the way for more sophisticated particle manipulation, object detection, and pump shaping for high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement. Here, we create four OAM combs with rectangular, sinusoidal, sinc, and Gaussian OAM spectral distributions using multiplane light conversion, which only involves phase modulations (hence is inherently lossless) and allows for improved tailoring of the spatial shape. The verification of such combs is done qualitatively by analyzing their propagation evolutions and quantitatively by employing a mode sorting technique-both exhibiting good agreement with user specifications and simulations. The scattering losses of all four combs were measured to be minimal, ranging from 0.66 to 1.04 dB.(c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Dynamical Modulation of Transverse Orbital Angular Momentum in Highly
   Confined Spatiotemporal Optical Vortex
SO PHOTONICS
AB Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) have attracted numerous attention from researchers in recent years due to their intriguing characteristics with transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the spatiotemporal domain. In this work, we numerically analyze the tightly focusing characteristics of higher-order STOVs and present a method to dynamically modulate the transverse OAM in highly confined STOVs. Richards-Wolf vectorial diffraction theory was employed to simulate the three-dimensional spatiotemporal distribution of the focused STOV corresponding to the incident wave packet of topological charge of -2. The simulation results show that the higher-order spatiotemporal vortices in the transversely polarized components of the focused wave packets split into two first-order vortices with topological charge of -1 when the waist radius of the incident wave packet was larger than 40% of the pupil radius of the focusing lens, and the spacing of the two split vortices could be tailored by adjusting the waist radius of the incident wave packet. Meanwhile, the incident spatial waist radius also affected the tilt angle of the phase singularity trace in the z-polarized component of the focused field. The presented method provides a flexible way to dynamically engineer the spatiotemporal vortices in the tightly focused wave packet and may find potential applications in nanophotonics, light-matter interaction, quantum information processing, etc.

TI Attosecond clocking of correlations between Bloch electrons
SO NATURE
AB Delocalized Bloch electrons and the low-energy correlations between them determine key optical(1), electronic(2) and entanglement(3) functionalities of solids, all the way through to phase transitions(4,5). To directly capture how many-body correlations affect the actual motion of Bloch electrons, subfemtosecond (1 fs = 10(-15) s) temporal precision(6-15) is desirable. Yet, probing with attosecond (1 as = 10(-18) s) high-energy photons has not been energy-selective enough to resolve the relevant millielectronvolt-scale interactions of electrons(1-5,16,17) near the Fermi energy. Here, we use multi-terahertz light fields to force electron-hole pairs in crystalline semiconductors onto closed trajectories, and clock the delay between separation and recollision with 300 as precision, corresponding to 0.7% of the driving field's oscillation period. We detect that strong Coulomb correlations emergent in atomically thin WSe2 shift the optimal timing of recollisions by up to 1.2 +/- 0.3 fs compared to the bulk material. A quantitative analysis with quantum-dynamic many-body computations in a Wigner-function representation yields a direct and intuitive view on how the Coulomb interaction, non-classical aspects, the strength of the driving field and the valley polarization influence the dynamics. The resulting attosecond chronoscopy of delocalized electrons could revolutionize the understanding of unexpected phase transitions and emergent quantum-dynamic phenomena for future electronic, optoelectronic and quantum-information technologies.

TI Fast frequency relocking for synchronization enhanced resonant
   accelerometer
SO MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING
AB Synchronization, as a unique phenomenon, has been extensively studied in biology, chaotic systems, nonlinear dynamics, quantum information, and other fields. Benefiting from the characteristics of frequency amplification, noise suppression, and stability improvement, synchronization has been gradually applied in sensing, communication, time keeping, and other applications. In the sensing field, synchronization provides a new strategy to improve the performance of sensors. However, the performance improvement is only effective within the synchronization range, and the narrow synchronization range has become a great challenge for the wide application of synchronization-enhanced sensing mechanism. Here, we propose a frequency automatic tracking system (FATS) to widen the synchronization range and track the periodic acceleration signals by adjusting the frequency of the readout oscillator in real time. In addition, a high-precision frequency measurement system and fast response control system based on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) are built, and the tracking performance of the FATS for static and dynamic external signals is analyzed to obtain the optimal control parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed automatic tracking system is capable of static acceleration measurement, the synchronization range can be expanded to 975 Hz, and the relocking time is shortened to 93.4 ms at best. By selecting the optimal PID parameters, we achieve a faster relocking time to meet the requirements of low-frequency vibration measurements, such as seismic detection and tidal monitoring.

TI A free energy principle for generic quantum systems
SO PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that under suitable conditions of weak coupling, random dynamical systems with sufficient degrees of freedom will behave so as to minimize an upper bound, formalized as a variational free energy, on surprisal (a.k.a., self-information). This upper bound can be read as a Bayesian prediction error. Equivalently, its negative is a lower bound on Bayesian model evidence (a.k.a., marginal likelihood). In short, certain random dynamical systems evince a kind of self-evidencing. Here, we reformulate the FEP in the formal setting of spacetime-background free, scale-free quantum information theory. We show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as observers, which with the standard freedom of choice assumption become agents capable of assigning semantics to observational outcomes. We show how such agents minimize Bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by uncertainty, insufficient learning, and quantum con-textuality. We show that in its quantum-theoretic formulation, the FEP is asymptotically equivalent to the Principle of Unitarity. Based on these results, we suggest that biological systems employ quantum coherence as a computational resource and - implicitly - as a communication resource. We summarize a number of problems for future research, particularly involving the resources required for classical communication and for detecting and responding to quantum context switches.

TI Recent progress in metasurface-enabled optical waveplates
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The polarization of light is crucial for numerous optical applications ranging from quantum information processing to biomedical sensing due to the fundamental role of polarization as another intrinsic characteristic of optical waves, which is uncorrelated with the amplitude, phase, and frequency. However, conventional optical waveplates that enable polarization control are based on the accumulated retardation between two orthogonally polarized electric fields when light propagates a distance much larger than its wavelength in birefringent materials, resulting in bulky configurations and limited functionalities. Optical metasurfaces, ultrathin arrays of engineered meta-atoms, have attracted increasing attention owing to their unprecedented capabilities of manipulating light with surface-confined configurations and subwavelength spatial resolutions, thereby opening up new possibilities for revolutionizing bulky optical waveplates with ultrathin planar elements that feature compactness, integration compatibility, broadband operation bandwidths, and multiple functionalities. Herein, we review the recent progress in metasurface-enabled optical waveplates, which covers both basic principles and emerging applications. We provide an overview of metasurface-based conventional half- and quarter-waveplates as well as their use in wavefront shaping applications, followed by a discussion of advanced waveplates, including multifunctional waveplates and all-polarization generators. We also discuss dynamic waveplates based on active metasurfaces. Finally, we conclude by providing our outlook in this emerging and fast-growing research field.

TI Multiplexing-oriented plasmon-MoS2 hybrid metasurfaces driven by
   nonlinear quasi bound states in the continuum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Rapid progress in nonlinear plasmonic metasurfaces enabled many novel optical characteristics for metasurfaces, with potential applications in frequency metrology [Zimmermann et al. Opt. Lett. 29:310 (2004)], timing characterization [Singh et al. Laser Photonics Rev. 14:1 (2020)] and quantum information [Kues et al. Nature. 546:622 (2017)]. However, the spectrum of nonlinear optical response was typically determined from the linear optical resonance. In this work, a wavelength-multiplexed nonlinear plasmon-MoS2 hybrid metasurface with suppression phenomenon was proposed, where multiple nonlinear signals could to be simultaneously processed and optionally tuned. A clear physical picture to depict the nonlinear plasmonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) was presented, from the perspective of both classical and quantum approaches. Particularly, beyond the ordinary plasmon-polariton effect, we numerically demonstrated a giant BIC-inspired second-order nonlinear susceptibility 10(-5) m/V of MoS2 in the infrared band. The novelty in our study lies in the presence of a quantum oscillator that can be adopted to both suppress and enhance the nonlinear quasi BICs. This selectable nonlinear BIC-based suppression and enhancement effect can optionally block undesired modes, resulting in narrower linewidth as well as smaller quantum decay rates, which is also promising in slow-light-associated technologies.

TI Structural, electronic, and optical properties of topological semimetal
   ZrSn3: A DFT study for optoelectronic and quantum device
   applications
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Cubic alpha-BiF3-type topological semimetal zirconium tin (ZrSn3) is a promising candidate for next-generation quantum and optoelectronic applications due to its unique electronic topology and strong light-matter interactions. In this study, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of ZrSn3 using density functional theory (DFT). The optimized lattice parameter (a = 5.23 & Aring;) and elastic constants satisfy the Born-Huang criteria, confirming mechanical stability. Mechanical analysis reveals a semi-brittle nature (Pugh's ratio G/B = 0.64), moderate hardness (similar to 7.7 GPa), and good machinability (B/C-44 = 1.48), indicating resilience for device fabrication and structural integrity under stress. Electronic band structure analysis reveals Dirac-like crossings near the Fermi level, a compensated Fermi surface with both electron- and hole-like pockets, and strong hybridization between Zr-4d and Sn-5p orbitals. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) calculations confirm the robustness of these features, introducing minor band splitting without gap opening, thereby preserving the topological character. The optical response is equally notable: ZrSn3 exhibits high infrared reflectivity (>50 %), a large static refractive index, and broad absorption extending into the ultraviolet region. Most importantly, the energy-loss function identifies a dominant bulk plasmon resonance at similar to 8.7 eV, consistent with collective electron oscillations. A secondary feature near 15.2 eV is interpreted as a weaker satellite peak or higher-lying interband transition, refining previous interpretations of the material's dielectric behavior. These multifunctional properties collectively highlight ZrSn3's potential for quantum electronics, infrared optoelectronics, UV photodetectors, plasmonic devices, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) optical components. Overall, this study confirms the intrinsic stability, topological robustness, and tunable optical characteristics of ZrSn3, positioning it as a versatile platform for future quantum and optoelectronic technologies.

TI High-Temperature Single-Photon Emission From Covalently Functionalized
   van der Waals Heterostructures
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as tungsten diselenide (WSe2) are attractive nanomaterials for quantum information applications due to single-photon emission (SPE) from intrinsic atomic defects. Defect and strain engineering techniques have been developed to produce high purity, deterministically placed SPE in WSe2. However, a major challenge in the application of these techniques is the low temperature required to observe defect-bound TMD exciton emission, typically limiting SPE to T < 30 K. SPE at higher temperatures either loses purity or requires integration into complex devices such as optical cavities. Here, 2D heterostructure engineering and molecular functionalization are combined to achieve high purity (>90%) SPE in strained WSe2 persisting to over T = 90 K. Covalent diazonium functionalization of graphite in layered WSe2/graphite heterostructures maintains high purity up to T = 90 K and single-photon source integrity up to T = 115 K. This method preserves the best qualities of SPE from WSe2 while increasing working temperature to more than three times the typical range. This work demonstrates the versatility of surface functionalization and heterostructure design to synergistically improve the properties of quantum emission and offers new insights into the phenomenon of SPE from 2D materials.

TI Dominant andreev reflection through nonlinear radio-frequency transport
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB It is found that Andreev reflection provides a deterministic teleportation process at an ideal normal-superconductor interface, making it behave like an information mirror. However, it is challenging to control the Andreev reflection in a spatially-separated junction due to the mode mixing at the interface. We theoretically propose the laser-induced Andreev reflection between two-component Fermi superfluid and normal states without mode mixing via spatially-uniform Rabi couplings. By analyzing the tunneling current up to the fourth order, we find that the Andreev current exhibits unconventional non-Ohmic transport at zero temperature. The Andreev current gives the only contribution in the synthetic junction system at zero detunings regardless of the ratio of the chemical potential bias to the superfluid gap, which is in sharp contrast to that in conventional junctions. Our result may give a potential impact on theoretical and experimental study of quantum many-body phenomena, and also pave a way for understanding the black hole information paradox through the Andreev reflection as a quantum-information mirror.
   The Andreev reflection provides a deterministic teleportation process at an ideal normal-superconductor interface, making it behave like an information mirror.

TI Advances in Metaphotonics Empowered Single Photon Emission
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Spontaneous photon emission can be drastically modified by placing quantum emitters (QEs) in nanostructured environment, resulting in dramatically enhanced emission rates due to the Purcell effect along with generation of collimated single-photon beams propagating in design directions and featuring well-defined polarization states. Recent advances in single-photon generation engineering demonstrate fascinating possibilities for the directional emission of photons with designed spin and orbital angular momenta, a development that is crucial for exploiting the full potential of QEs within quantum information technologies. Although many different nanostructured configurations are considered for hosting QEs to mold single-photon beams, collimating of the latter requires relatively large interaction areas to be involved, thus making the use of metasurfaces preferential. Furthermore, optical metasurfaces consisting of planar arrays of resonant nanoscale elements offer complete control over optical fields and thereby design freedom in shaping single-photon emission. Here, recent advances in exploiting quantum optical metasurfaces for achieving enhanced and directional emission of single photons with specified polarization properties are overviewed. Special attention is paid to hybrid plasmon-QE coupled metasurfaces based on efficient QE coupling to surface plasmon modes that are subsequently outcoupled by designed dielectric nanoarrays into free propagating photon emission. Perspectives for future developments of metasurface empowered QEs are also discussed.

TI Quantum Advantage in a Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal
   Fluctuation Energy
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous is proposed. The spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co center of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron-spin-selecting Fe/C-60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C-60 interface are measured. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built-in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic-based information technology chain, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

TI Generation and Superposition of Perfect Vortex Beams in Terahertz Region
   via Single-Layer All-Dielectric Metasurface
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Terahertz (THz) orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology provides promising applications in future wireless communication with large bandwidth and high capacity. However, the ring radius of the conventional THz vortex beam is related to the topological charge, limiting the co-propagation of multiple OAM modes in the THz communication systems. Although the perfect vortex beam (PVB) based on traditional methods can solve this problem, they are usually bulky and unstable. Here, we demonstrate two PVB generators based on a single all-dielectric metasurface to obtain polarization-independent PVB and spin multiplexed PVB, respectively. The former regulates the propagation phase by using isotropic unit cells; the latter simultaneously manipulates the propagation and geometric phase to achieve the spin-decoupled phase control by arranging anisotropic unit cells. In addition, we also demonstrate the stable generation of a perfect Poincare beam with arbitrary polarization and phase distribution on a hybrid-order Poincare Sphere via a spin-decoupled metasurface, which is achieved by the linear superposition of two PVBs with orthogonal circular polarizations. The proposed scheme provides a compact and efficient platform for the generation and superposition of PVBs in THz region, and will speed up the progress of THz communication systems, complex light field generation, and quantum information sciences.

TI Active ballistic orbital transport in Ni/Pt heterostructure
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Orbital current, defined as the orbital character of Bloch states in solids, can travel with larger coherence length through a broader range of materials than its spin counterpart, facilitating a robust, higher density and energy efficient information transmission. Hence, active control of orbital transport plays a pivotal role in the progress of the evolving field of quantum information technology. Unlike spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum couples to phonon angular momentum efficiently via orbital-crystal momentum (L-k) coupling, allowing us to control orbital transport through crystal field potential mediated angular momentum transfer. Here, leveraging the orbital dependant efficient L-k coupling, we have experimentally demonstrated the active control of orbital current velocity in Ni/Pt heterostructure. We observe terahertz emission from Ni/Pt heterostructure via long-range ballistic orbital transport, as evidenced by the delay, and chirping in the emitted THz pulse correlating with increased Pt thickness. Additionally, we also have identified a critical energy density required to overcome collisions in orbital transport, enabling a swifter flow of orbital current. Femtosecond light driven active control of the ballistic orbital transport lays the foundation for the development of dynamic optorbitronics for transmitting information over extended distance.
   The authors observe THz emission from Ni/Pt heterostructure due to long-range ballistic orbital transport. The velocity of orbital current can be optically tuned by laser fluence, opening the avenue for future optorbitronic devices.

TI Noise-independent route toward the genesis of a COMPACT ansatz for
   molecular energetics: A dynamic approach
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Recent advances in quantum information and quantum science have inspired the development of various compact, dynamically structured ansatze that are expected to be realizable in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, such ansatze construction strategies hitherto developed involve considerable measurements, and thus, they deviate significantly in the NISQ platform from their ideal structures. Therefore, it is imperative that the usage of quantum resources be minimized while retaining the expressivity and dynamical structure of the ansatz that can adapt itself depending on the degree of correlation. We propose a novel ansatz construction strategy based on the ab initio many-body perturbation theory that requires no pre-circuit measurement and, thus, remains structurally unaffected by any hardware noise. The accuracy and quantum complexity associated with the ansatz are solely dictated by a pre-defined perturbative order, as desired, and, hence, are tunable. Furthermore, the underlying perturbative structure of the ansatz construction pipeline enables us to decompose any high-rank excitation that appears in higher perturbative orders into the product of various low-rank operators, and it thus keeps the execution gate-depth to its minimum. With a number of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we demonstrate that our ansatz performs significantly better, both in terms of accuracy, parameter count, and circuit depth, in comparison to the allied unitary coupled cluster based ansatze.

TI Entanglement degradation as a tool to detect signatures of modified
   gravity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate entanglement degradation in the vicinity of a quantum corrected black hole. We consider a biprtite system (Alice -Rob) with Alice freely falling (radially) into the event horizon of a quantum corrected black hole and Rob being in the vicinity of the event horizon of the black hole. We consider a maximally entangled state (in the Fock basis) and start with the basic assumption that Rob is an uniformly accelerated observer. We then give a pedagogical analysis of the relation involving the Minkowski vaccum state and Rindler number states. Following the analogy given in Martin -Martinez et al. [Phys. Rev. D 82, 064006 (2010)], we establish the relation between the Hartle -Hawking vacuum state and Boulware and anti-Bouware number states from the Minkowski-Rindler relation. We then write down the quantum corrected black hole metric by making use of the near horizon approximation in an appropriate form. Next, we obtain the analytical forms of logarithmic negativity and mutual information and plot as a function of Rob's distance from the r 1/4 0 point. We observe that the entanglement degradation slows down because of the structural change in the lapse function of the metric via the incorporation of quantum gravity corrections in the Schwarzschild black hole. It is crucial to understand that any modified gravity theories that changes the metric structure results in a different rate of degradation of the entanglement. At the horizon radius, the entanglement degradation is always complete irrespective of the underlying theory. This observation may lead to the identification of the signature of modified gravity theories in a future generation of advanced observational scenarios. Such a modification can come from higher curvature corrections, higher dimensional gravity theories, quantum gravity corrections, etc. We can also interpret this effect as a noisy quantum channel with an operator sum representation of a completely positive and trace preserving map. We then finally obtain the entanglement fidelity using this operator sum representation.

TI Experimental demonstration of strong unitary uncertainty relations
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Uncertainty relations are one of the most important foundations of quantum physics. In the textbook literatures, uncertainty relations usually refer to the preparation uncertainty. Its original formulation based on variances of two observables limits on the ability to prepare an ensemble of quantum systems for which non-commuting observables will have arbitrary uncertainty. The preparation uncertainty relation has been widely investigated. On the other hand, a unitary operator is a fundamental tenet of quantum theory. Every evolution of a closed quantum system is governed by acting unitary operators on the state of the system and the evolution of an open system can be represented by acting unitary operators on an enlarged system consisting of the quantum system as a subsystem. Therefore, naturally, to understand and quantitatively capture the essence of uncertainty relations for unitary operators is important and timely. Here we report an experimental investigation of a set of uncertainty relations for two unitary operators, which are theoretically derived by using a sequence of fine-grained inequalities. We test these uncertainty relations with single photons and interferometric networks. The unitary uncertainty relation is saturated by any pure qubit state. For higher-dimensional states, it is stronger than the best known bound introduced in the previous literatures. The lower bounds of the unitary uncertainty relations can be even further strengthened by the symmetry of permutation. The experimental findings agree with the predictions of quantum theory and respect the new uncertainty relations.

TI Quantum control of a nanoparticle optically levitated in cryogenic free
   space
SO NATURE
AB Quantum control of an optically levitated nanoparticle with a mass of just one femtogram is demonstrated in a cryogenic environment by feedback-cooling the motion of the particle to the quantum ground state.
   Tests of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale require extreme control over mechanical motion and its decoherence(1-3). Quantum control of mechanical motion has been achieved by engineering the radiation-pressure coupling between a micromechanical oscillator and the electromagnetic field in a resonator(4-7). Furthermore, measurement-based feedback control relying on cavity-enhanced detection schemes has been used to cool micromechanical oscillators to their quantum ground states(8). In contrast to mechanically tethered systems, optically levitated nanoparticles are particularly promising candidates for matter-wave experiments with massive objects(9,10), since their trapping potential is fully controllable. Here we optically levitate a femtogram (10(-15) grams) dielectric particle in cryogenic free space, which suppresses thermal effects sufficiently to make the measurement backaction the dominant decoherence mechanism. With an efficient quantum measurement, we exert quantum control over the dynamics of the particle. We cool its centre-of-mass motion by measurement-based feedback to an average occupancy of 0.65 motional quanta, corresponding to a state purity of 0.43. The absence of an optical resonator and its bandwidth limitations holds promise to transfer the full quantum control available for electromagnetic fields to a mechanical system. Together with the fact that the optical trapping potential is highly controllable, our experimental platform offers a route to investigating quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales(11).

TI Nonlinear generalized master equations: quantum case
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB A system of N >> 1 interacting spinless quantum particles, described by a statistical operator F(t), is considered. A time-dependent projection operator formalism for a family of projectors, which select a statistical operator F-S(t) for a group of S < N relevant particles by integration of the variables of the irrelevant N - S 'environment' particles, is presented. This formalism results in a nonlinear version of the inhomogeneous Nakajima-Zwanzig generalized master equation (GME) for the relevant part of the statistical operator F(t), which contains an undesirable initial condition term related to the irrelevant part of the statistical operator depending on N variables. By introducing an additional operator identity, the obtained nonlinear inhomogeneous Nakajima-Zwanzig equation is exactly converted into a homogeneous nonlinear equation, accounting for initial correlations in the kernel governing its evolution. Both of these equations are equivalent to the corresponding evolution equations for F-S(t) and take into account the dynamics of the environment particles. The equations for F-S(t) are specialized in the linear approximation for the particle density n and analyzed for a one-particle statistical operator F-1(t) . It turns out that, in addition to the correlations caused by interparticle interaction, the irrelevant initial condition term in the inhomogeneous equation for F-1(t) , defined by the two-particle correlations, also contains quantum correlations conditioned by the quantum particle statistics. The latter do not vanish with time and cannot be disregarded in the conventional way by applying e.g. Bogoliubov's principle of weakening of initial correlations. In order to take initial quantum and other correlations (commonly discarded in an unconvincing way) into consideration, the obtained nonlinear homogeneous GME has been applied. Exact in the first approximation in n, we obtain a new homogeneous equation for F-1(t) , which accounts for correlations and is valid for any time moment t. It is shown how this reversible-in-time equation changes at different timescales and converts into the irreversible quantum Boltzmann equation on the macroscopic timescale without the use of the conventional approximations.

TI Entanglement and seniority
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Background: In quantum mechanics, entanglement is the most striking phenomenon which has no counterpart in classical systems. Although different approaches have already been developed to study correlations in the case of indistinguishable particles, the exploration of the so-called mode entanglement is still in its initial stage in nuclear physics.
   Purpose: We aim to study mode entanglement in the seniority model, derive analytic formulas for the one-body reduced density matrix of states with seniority nu = 0, 1, 2, and 3, and also determine the particle number dependence of the one-body reduced density matrix for arbitrary seniority. In addition, we compare the predictions of the seniority model with the results of the shell model to gain insight into the structure and correlations of the ground and lowest yrast states.
   Methods: In the seniority model the analytic results are calculated using the quasispin formalism. The numerical shell model calculations are carried out in the standard shell model framework using an inert core. The applied realistic effective interactions are derived earlier using the G-matrix formalism. The density matrix renormalization group method is also applied in order to directly calculate the mode entropies.
   Results: In the seniority model simple analytical expressions are given for the mode entropies. The peculiar behavior of the half-filled shells and the seniority-zero states is revealed. Numerical results are presented for the lightest stable calcium isotopes and for Ru-94 nucleus.
   Conclusions: For Ru-94, the seniority model accounts for the 0g(9/2) mode entropies, but seniority mixing is important for certain yrast states. Interaction induced quantum fluctuations decrease the occupation of the 0f(5/2), 1p(3/2), and 1p(1/2) shells, and result in non-negligible mode entropies on these shells, too, clearly outside the scope of the simple (0g(9/2))(4) seniority model. The 0f(7/2) shell based seniority model is more accurate for the Ca isotopes, but seniority mixing is substantial for some Ca-44 yrast states, too. Mode and one-body entanglement entropies are useful tools to investigate the structure of quantum correlations in nuclei.

TI Room temperature colossal superparamagnetic order in
   aminoferrocene-graphene molecular magnets
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Intensive studies are published for graphene-based molecular magnets due to their remarkable electric, thermal, and mechanical properties. However, to date, most of all produced molecular magnets are ligand based and subject to challenges regarding the stability of the ligand(s). The lack of long-range coupling limits high operating temperature and leads to a short-range magnetic order. Herein, we introduce an aminoferrocene-based graphene system with room temperature superparamagnetic behavior in the long-range magnetic order that exhibits colossal magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 8 x 10(5) and 3 x 10(7) J/m(3) in aminoferrocene and graphene-based aminoferrocene, respectively. These values are comparable to and even two orders of magnitude larger than pure iron metal. Aminoferrocene [C10H11FeN](+) is synthesized by an electrophilic substitution reaction. It was then reacted with graphene oxide that was prepared by the modified Hammers method. The phase structure and functionalization of surface groups were characterized and confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy. To model the behavior of the aminoferrocene between two sheets of hydroxylated graphene, we have used density functional theory by placing the aminoferrocene molecule between two highly ordered hydroxylated sheets and allowing the structure to relax. The strong bowing of the isolated graphene sheets suggests that the charge transfer and resulting magnetization could be strongly influenced by pressure effects. In contrast to strategies based on ligands surface attachment, our present work that uses interlayer intercalated aminoferrocene opens routes for future molecular magnets as well as the design of qubit arrays and quantum systems.

TI Programmable 200 GOPS Hopfield-inspired photonic Ising machine
SO NATURE
AB Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems(1), but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, such as D-Wave's cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs(2). Here we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks(3), our architecture solves fully connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings) and >41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system makes use of cascaded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential >200 giga operations per second (GOPS) for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for max-cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning(4) and lattice protein folding(5)-benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system uses inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP-traditionally used in optical communications-within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing and analogue artificial intelligence.

AB Introduction Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) estimation offers a non-invasive method to potentially diagnose, monitor, and prognosticate patients with malignancy. This prospective study aimed to assess plasma cfDNA levels in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) to determine its role in predicting disease status in the post-operative setting.Materials and methods This was a single-center prospective observational study conducted at a public medical research university and hospital in New Delhi, India. 254 patients with DTC in the post-operative setting were included: 95 in Group 1 (active structural disease) and 159 in Group 2 (disease-free). Blood samples were collected for plasma separation and cfDNA extraction. The cfDNA concentrations were quantified and compared across various disease states.Results Median values of plasma cfDNA (ng/mu L) in groups 1 and 2 were found to be 0.272 (IQR: 0.137-0.442) and 0.222 (IQR: 0.123-0.398), respectively with no significant difference (p=0.122). cfDNA levels were significantly higher in patients in the age group >= 55 years (p=0.016). However, the cfDNA levels were not significantly associated with any of the other known prognostic markers of DTC.Discussion Based on the results of this study, plasma cfDNA levels did not significantly predict disease status in patients with DTC in the post-operative setting.

TI A Quantum-Inspired Direct Learning Strategy for Positive and Unlabeled
   Data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
AB Learning from only positive and unlabeled (PU) data has broad applications in fields such as web data mining, product recommendations and medical diagnosis, which aims to train a binary classifier in the absence of negative labeled data. However, due to the lack of negative label information, prevailing PU learning methods usually rely on prior knowledge of unknown class distributions heavily. In fact, without additional constraints imposed by the prior knowledge, a direct learning strategy to coordinate the underlying clustering information in unlabeled data with the label information from positive training data is often considered challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a direct PU learning strategy using quantum formalization. By employing neural networks as backends, the samples are mapped into two-qubit composite systems, which should be understood here as mathematical entities encapsulating various classical distributions of two classical bits. Subsequently, the two qubits within the systems are trained to be as independent as possible from each other, capturing patterns of different classes. At the same time, their measurement results serving as the model outputs are encouraged to be maximally dissimilar. These characteristics enable effective training of classifiers on PU data. After formulating an appropriate discriminant rule, we introduce a quantum-inspired PU method named qPU using the direct learning strategy. This method not only has the potential to alleviate parameter sensitivity issues caused by prior estimation in other methods but is also straightforward to implement. Finally, experiments conducted on 13 classical datasets validate the effectiveness of qPU.

TI The Implementation of Laboratory Information Management System in
   Multi-Site Genetics Study in Africa: The Challenges and Up-Scaling
   Opportunities
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
AB This study describes the roles of laboratory information management systems (LIMS) in multi-site genetics studies in Africa. We used the HiGeneS Africa project as a case study. The study participants were recruited in six African countries between 2019 to 2021. The Baobab LIMS, a server-client-based system (an African-led innovation) was used for the coordination of the biospecimen. The development phase of the LIMS showcased the team formation, data collection, biospecimen collection, and shipment strategies. The implementation phase showcased the biospecimen registration, processing, and quality control (QC) analytics. The sample QC was done using Nanodrop, Qubit, and PicoGreen/gDNATapestation assays. The results showed that a total of 3144 study participants were recruited from Cameroon, Ghana, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa. The biospecimen registration provided a comprehensive registry that included patient demographics, genetic information, and clinical and blood/saliva samples from the proband and family relatives. The QC analyzes identified 30 samples that failed QC, linked to overdue storage in the freezer before DNA extraction. The LIMS components implemented in this project formed a structure that can be upscaled to artificial intelligence-based LIMS. In conclusion, this study represents the largest and the most diverse collection of biospecimens for the genetic study of hearing impairment in Africa to date. A well-characterized LIMS should be recommended for multi-site molecular studies, particularly in Africa, to enhance African participation in global genomic medicine.

TI Design and Simulation of Optical Field in Quasi-Two-Dimensional
   Isotropic Laser Cooling
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Isotropic laser cooling is regarded as one of the crucial laser cooling techniques because of its distinctive benefits including simplicity, compactness, and robustness. It has been extensively applied in areas including atomic microwave clocks, quantum simulation, and quantum sensing. As a distinct distribution type of cold atoms in isotropic laser cooling, cold atoms with quasi-two-dimensional distributions have significant applications and usefulness in fields of study, including atomic cooling and quantum precision measurement. Isotropic laser cooling does not restrict atoms, different from techniques like magneto-optical traps. The distributions of the optical field and the cold atoms inside the cavity are significantly influenced by the laser injection methodology and cavity design. To obtain cold atoms with a quasi-two- dimensional distribution, one must effectively establish a uniformly distributed quasi-two-dimensional optical field in a flat cavity. In order to get a uniform optical field, we explore the impact of various incident optical field parameters on the optical field distribution using optical simulations to study how to produce a quasi-two-dimensional optical field distribution.
   Methods The main method for creating a nearly two-dimensional optical field in a flat cavity is the subject of this study. We propose a flat diffusion cavity-based cavity structure for the first time. It models the effects of two alternative injection techniques, namely free-space injection and optical fiber injection, on the optical field distribution using optical simulation software. Using the optical fiber injection technique as a foundation, we explore how changing the angle of injection affects the way the light field is distributed inside the cavity. We also investigate the distribution of the optical field inside the cavity as a function of important optical fiber characteristics, particularly the numerical aperture and core diameter. Finally, we investigate the relationship between differences in the optical field distribution inside the cavity and variations in cavity diameters, and this demonstrates that by adjusting these factors, we may significantly improve the optical field's homogeneity.
   Results and Discussions The simulation results show that the optical fiber injection method is superior to the free-space optical injection strategy in producing a homogeneous optical field within the flat diffuse-reflectance cavity (Fig. 4). Furthermore, by modifying particular parameters, the optical field may be optimized. The homogeneity of the optical field is improved to some extent when the angle of incidence of the optical fiber rotates within reasonable bounds. To keep a uniform optical field distribution, it is crucial to prevent large angle variations (Fig. 5). While changes in core diameter have relatively little influence on the optical field distribution, variations in numerical aperture have a large impact on the uniformity of the optical field (Fig. 6). As a result, choosing an optical fiber with the right specifications is essential for improving the homogeneity of the optical field. Due to structural modifications, increasing the cavity height while keeping the proper height enhances the optical field dispersion. Sometimes, it even improves the optical power density at particular locations. The optical power density distribution within the cavity, however, shows a declining tendency with an overall rise in height (Fig. 7). With a rising side length scaling factor, the optical power density inside the cavity displays a negative power-law relationship decrease pattern. The power consumption for the incident cooling light therefore grows dramatically as the cavity volume expands, even with the same optical power density requirements (Fig. 8).
   Conclusions Establishing a uniform optical power density distribution is a difficult point in studies designed to achieve a quasi-two-dimensional distribution of cold atoms within a flat diffuse-reflectance cavity. We simulate several cooling light injection strategies. When optical fiber injection is utilized instead of free-space optical injection, the optical field distribution is more uniform. The flatness of the optical field can be optimized within particular locations by adjusting the angle of incidence of the optical cable. The optical field's homogeneity is also strongly impacted by the optical fiber's numerical aperture. The initial beam diameter and divergence angle of the incident light are both determined by the numerical aperture and core diameter of the optical fiber. The flatness of the optical field can be improved within certain geographic areas by using optical fibers with the right characteristics. The optical power density inside the cavity shows a negative exponential drop trend as the cavity volume grows. These simulation findings offer helpful pointers for attaining a very homogeneous and quasi-two-dimensional optical field distribution. They also clarify the connection between variations in cavity size and the optical field distribution in the context of isotropic laser cooling.

TI Synergy of machine learning and density functional theory calculations
   for predicting experimental Lewis base affinity and Lewis polybase
   binding atoms
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY
AB Investigation of Lewis acid-base interactions has been conducted by ab initio calculations and machine learning (ML) models. This study aims to resolve two critical tasks that have not been quantitatively investigated. First, ML models developed from density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict experimental BF3 affinity with Pearson correlation coefficients around 0.9 and mean absolute errors around 10 kJ mol-1. The ML models are trained by DFT-calculated BF3 affinity of more than 3000 adducts, with input features readily obtained by rdkit. Second, the ML models have the capability of predicting the relative strength of Lewis base binding atoms in Lewis polybases, which is either an extremely challenging task to conduct experimentally or a computationally expensive task for ab initio methods. The study demonstrates and solidifies the potential of combining DFT calculations and ML models to predict experimental properties, especially those that are scarce and impractical to empirically acquire.
   The objective of this study is to resolve two critical tasks in the realm of Lewis acid-base interactions that have not been quantitatively investigated. First, machine learning developed from simulation is successful at predicting the experimental properties of Lewis adducts. Second, the models have the capability of identifying the binding atoms of Lewis polybases in 1:1 adducts, which is either improbable to obtain with experiments, or computationally expensive for quantum simulation. image

TI Nuclear Spin-Depleted, Isotopically Enriched
   70Ge/28Si70Ge Quantum Wells
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The p-symmetry of the hole wavefunction is associated with a weaker hyperfine interaction, which makes hole spin qubits attractive candidates to implement quantum processors. However, recent studies demonstrate that hole qubits are still very sensitive to nuclear spin bath, thus highlighting the need for nuclear spin-free germanium (Ge) qubits to suppress this decoherence channel. Herein, this work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of Ge-73- and Si-29-depleted, isotopically enriched Ge-70/silicon-germanium (SiGe) quantum wells. The growth is achieved by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition using isotopically purified monogermane (GeH4)-Ge-70 and monosilane (SiH4)-Si-28 with an isotopic purity higher than 99.9% and 99.99%, respectively. The quantum wells consist of a series of Ge-70/SiGe heterostructures grown on Si wafers. The isotopic purity is investigated using atom probe tomography (APT) following an analytical procedure addressing the discrepancies caused by the overlap of isotope peaks in mass spectra. The nuclear spin background is found to be sensitive to the growth conditions with the lowest concentration of Ge-73 and Si-29 is below 0.01% in the Ge well and SiGe barriers. The measured average distance between nuclear spins reaches 3-4 nm in Ge-70/(SiGe)-Si-28-Ge-70, which is an order of magnitude larger than in natural Ge/SiGe heterostructures. The spread of the hole wavefunction and the residual nuclear spin background in APT voluminals comparable to the size of realistic quantum dots are also discussed.

TI Work and Fluctuations: Coherent vs. Incoherent Ergotropy Extraction
SO QUANTUM
AB We consider a quasi-probability distribution of work for an isolated quantum system coupled to the energy-storage device given by the ideal weight. Specifically, we analyze a trade-off between changes in average energy and changes in weight's variance, where work is extracted from the coherent and incoherent ergotropy of the system. Primarily, we reveal that the extraction of positive coherent ergotropy can be accompanied by the reduction of work fluctuations (quantified by a variance loss) by utilizing the non-classical states of a work reservoir. On the other hand, we derive a fluctuation-decoherence relation for a quantum weight, defining a lower bound of its energy dispersion via a dumping function of the coherent contribution to the system's ergotropy. Specifically, it reveals that unlocking ergotropy from coherences results in high fluctuations, which diverge when the total coherent energy is unlocked. The proposed autonomous protocol of work extraction shows a significant difference between extracting coherent and incoherent ergotropy: The former can decrease the variance, but its absolute value diverges if more and more energy is extracted, whereas for the latter, the gain is always non-negative, but a total (incoherent) ergotropy can be extracted with finite work fluctuations. Furthermore, we present the framework in terms of the introduced quasi-probability distribution, which has a physical interpretation of its cumulants, is free from the invasive nature of measurements, and reduces to the two-point measurement scheme (TPM) for incoherent states. Finally, we analytically solve the work-variance trade-off for a qubit, explicitly revealing all the above quantum and classical regimes.

TI Self-consistent quantum tomography with regularization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum tomography is a class of characterization methods frequently used in current experiments, but its standard protocols suffer from unreliability originated from preknowledge assumptions. Self-consistent quantum tomography is an approach to avoid the problem, which treats every quantum operation in a characterization experiment as unknown objects to be characterized. As compensation for the beneficence, it leads to a problem that its characterization results cannot be determined uniquely only from experimental data due to the existence of experimentally undetectable gauge degrees of freedom, and we need to introduce a criterion to fix the gauge. Here, we propose to use a regularization technique to fix the gauge. First, we derive a sufficient condition on a characterization experiment to obtain all information of objects to be characterized except for the gauge. Second, we propose a self-consistent data-processing method with regularization and physicality constraints. A careless use of regularization can lead to non-negligible bias on the characterization result. As a solution for the concern, we propose a concrete way to tune the strength of the regularization, and mathematically prove that the method provides characterization results that converge to the gauge-equivalence class of the quantum operations of interest at the limit of data going to infinity. The asymptotic convergence guarantees the reliability of the method. We also derive the asymptotic convergence rate, which would be optimal. These theoretical results hold for any finite-dimensional quantum systems. Finally, as its first numerical implementation, we show numerical results on one-qubit system, which confirm the theoretical results and prove that the method proposed is practical.

TI Driven Gaussian quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum walks function as essential means to implement quantum simulators, allowing one to study complex and often directly inaccessible quantum processes in controllable systems. In this contribution, the notion of a driven Gaussian quantum walk is introduced. In contrast to typically considered quantum walks in optical settings, we describe the operation of the walk in terms of a nonlinear map rather than a unitary operation, e.g., by replacing a beam-splitter-type coin with a two-mode squeezer, being a process that is controlled and driven by a pump field. This opens previously unattainable possibilities for quantum walks that include nonlinear elements as core components of their operation, vastly extending their range of applications. A full framework for driven Gaussian quantum walks is developed, including methods to dynamically characterize nonlinear, quantum, and quantum-nonlinear effects. Moreover, driven Gaussian quantum walks are compared with their classically interfering and linear counterparts, which are based on classical coherence of light rather than quantum superpositions. In particular, the generation and boost of highly multimode entanglement, squeezing, and other quantum effects are studied over the duration of the nonlinear walk. Importantly, we prove the quantumness of the evolution itself, regardless of the input state. A scheme for an experimental realization is proposed. Furthermore, nonlinear properties of driven Gaussian quantum walks are explored, such as amplification that leads to an ever increasing number of correlated quantum particles, constituting a source of new walkers during the walk. Therefore, a concept for quantum walks is proposed that leads to???and even produces???directly accessible quantum phenomena, and that renders the quantum simulation of nonlinear processes possible.

TI Necessity of orthogonal basis vectors for the two-anyon problem in a
   one-dimensional lattice
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Few-body physics for anyons has been intensively studied within the anyon-Hubbard model, including the quantum walk and Bloch oscillations of two-anyon states. Recently, theoretical and experimental simulations of two-anyon states in a one-dimensional lattice have been carried out by expanding the wavefunction in terms of non-orthogonal basis vectors, resulting in non-physical degrees of freedom. In the present work, we deduce finite difference equations for the two-anyon state in a one-dimensional lattice by solving the Schr & ouml;dinger equation with orthogonal and complete basis vectors. Such an orthogonal scheme gives all the orthogonal physical eigenstates, while the conventional (non-orthogonal) method produces many non-physical redundant eigensolutions whose components violate the anyonic commutation relations. The dynamical property of the two-anyon states in a sufficiently large lattice is investigated and compared in both the orthogonal and conventional schemes. For initial states with two anyons at the same site or two (next-)neighboring sites, we observe the same dynamical behavior in both schemes, including the revival probability, probability density function and two-body correlation. For other initial states, the conventional scheme produces erroneous states that no longer obey the anyonic relations. The period of Bloch oscillations in the pseudo-fermionic limit has been found to be twice that in the bosonic limit, while these oscillations disappear at other statistical parameters. Our findings are vital for quantum simulations of few-body anyonic physics in lattice models.

TI Enhanced zero-phonon line emission from an ensemble of W centers in
   circular and bowtie Bragg grating cavities
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Color centers in silicon have recently gained considerable attention as single-photon sources and as spin qubit-photon interfaces. However, one of the major bottlenecks to the application of silicon color centers is their low overall brightness due to a relatively slow emission rate and poor light extraction from silicon. Here, we increase the photon collection efficiency from an ensemble of a particular kind of color center, known as W centers, by embedding them in circular Bragg grating cavities resonant with their zero-phonon-line emission. We observe a approximate to 5-fold enhancement in the photon collection efficiency (the fraction of photons extracted from the sample and coupled into a single-mode fiber), corresponding to an estimated approximate to 11-fold enhancement in the photon extraction efficiency (the fraction of photons collected by the first lens above the sample). For these cavities, we observe lifetime reduction by a factor of approximate to 1.3 ${\approx} 1.3$ . For W centers in resonant bowtie-shaped cavities, we observed a approximate to 3-fold enhancement in the photon collection efficiency, corresponding to a approximate to 6-fold enhancement in the photon extraction efficiency, and observed a lifetime reduction factor of approximate to 1.1 ${\approx} 1.1$ . The bowtie cavities thus preserve photon collection efficiency and Purcell enhancement comparable to circular cavities while providing the potential for utilizing in-plane excitation methods to develop a compact on-chip light source.

Circular Rydberg atoms open the way to simulations over very long time scales, using a combination of laser trapping of the atoms and spontaneous-emission inhibition, as shown in the proposal of an XXZ spin-array simulator based on chains of trapped circular atoms [Nguyen et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 011032 (2018)]. Such simulators could reach regimes (thermalization, glassy dynamics) that are out of the reach of those based on ordinary, low-angular-momentum short-lived Rydberg atoms. Over the promised long time scales, the unavoidable coupling of the spin dynamics with the atomic motion in the traps may play an important role. We study here the interplay between the spin exchange and motional dynamics in the simple case of two interacting circular Rydberg atoms confined in harmonic traps. The time evolution is solved exactly when the position dependence of the dipole-dipole interaction terms can be linearized over the extension of the atomic motion. We present numerical simulations in more complex cases, using the realistic parameters of the simulator proposal. We discuss three applications. First, we show that realistic experimental parameters lead to a regime in which atomic and spin dynamics become fully entangled, generating interesting nonclassical motional states. We also show that, in other parameter regions, the spin dynamics notably depends on the initial temperature of the atoms in the trap, providing a sensitive motional thermometry method. Last, and most importantly, we discuss the range of parameters in which the motion has negligible influence over the spin dynamics.

TI Pairing of holes by confining strings in antiferromagnets
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB In strongly correlated quantum materials, the behavior of charge carriers is dominated by strong electron-electron interactions. These can lead to insulating states with spin order, and upon doping to competing ordered states including unconventional super-conductivity. The underlying pairing mechanism remains poorly understood however, even in strongly simplified theoretical models. Recent advances in quantum simulation allow to study pairing in paradigmatic settings, e.g. in the t - J and t - Jz Hamiltoni-ans. Even there, the most basic properties of paired states of only two dopants, such as their dispersion relation and excitation spectra, remain poorly studied in many cases. Here we provide new analytical insights into a possible string-based pairing mechanism of mobile holes in an antiferromagnet. We analyze an effective model of partons con-nected by a confining string and calculate the spectral properties of bound states. Our model is equally relevant for understanding Hubbard-Mott excitons consisting of a bound doublon-hole pair or confined states of dynamical matter in lattice gauge theories, which motivates our study of different parton statistics. Although an accurate semi-analytic es-timation of binding energies is challenging, our theory provides a detailed understanding of the internal structure of pairs. For example, in a range of settings we predict heavy states of immobile pairs with flat-band dispersions - including for the lowest-energy d -wave pair of fermions. Our findings shed new light on the long-standing question about the origin of pairing and competing orders in high-temperature superconductors.

TI Loop-string-hadron approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory: Hilbert
   space of a trivalent vertex
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The construction of gauge-invariant states of SU(3) lattice gauge theories has garnered new interest in recent years, but implementing them is complicated by the need for SU(3) Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. In the loop-string-hadron (LSH) approach to lattice gauge theories, the elementary excitations are strictly gauge invariant, and constructing the basis requires no knowledge of ClebschGordon coefficients. Originally developed for SU(2), the LSH formulation was recently generalized to SU(3), but limited to one spatial dimension. In this work, we generalize the LSH approach to constructing the basis of SU(3) gauge-invariant states at a trivalent vertex-the essential building block to multidimensional space. A direct generalization from the SU(2) vertex yields a legitimate basis; however, in certain sectors of the Hilbert space, the naive LSH basis vectors so defined suffer from being nonorthogonal. The issues with orthogonality are directly related to the "missing label" or "outer multiplicity" problem associated with SU(3) tensor products and may also be phrased in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients or the need for a "seventh Casimir" operator. The states that are unaffected by the problem are orthonormalized in closed form. For the sectors that are afflicted, we discuss the nonorthogonal bases and their orthogonalization. A few candidates for seventh Casimir operators are readily constructed from the suite of LSH gauge-singlet operators. The diagonalization of a seventh Casimir represents one prescriptive solution toward obtaining a complete orthonormal basis, but a closed-form general solution remains to be found.

TI Quantum gas magnification of ultracold atoms in optical lattices
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a very promising quantum simulation platform, as they provide a very clean system (almost defect free) and allow control over many parameters such as tunneling coupling or interaction strength. Because the typical lattice spacing lies in the sub-micron range, it is technically demanding to resolve exactly the position of the atoms in the lattice using high-resolution optics such as quantum gas microscopy. Here we review the matter-wave protocol of quantum gas magnification that we developed for magnifying the atomic density distribution in the lattice (Asteria et al 2021 Nature 599 571). The atomic cloud, thus magnified by a factor of up to similar to 90, can then be imaged in a single-shot even with sub-lattice resolution with standard absorption imaging techniques. Furthermore, the protocol was demonstrated for 3D systems with high filling factors, which are typically impossible to measure with high-resolution imaging. In this tutorial, we will review how this technique can be used for high-resolution imaging of the density distribution and present the results obtained using it as a method to access new observables. We conclude with an outlook focusing on how this technique could be beneficial for a wide variety of physical systems which can be realized using cold atoms. This tutorial expands on the topic of my presentation for the SAMOP 2023 PhD Prize finalist symposium.

TI Evidence for the association of triatomic molecules in ultracold
   23Na40K + 40K mixtures
SO NATURE
AB Ultracold assembly of diatomic molecules has enabled great advances in controlled chemistry, ultracold chemical physics and quantum simulation with molecules(1-3). Extending the ultracold association totriatomic molecules will offer many new research opportunities and challenges in these fields. A possible approach is to form triatomic molecules in a mixture of ultracold atoms and diatomic molecules by using a Feshbach resonance between them(4,5). Although ultracold atom-diatomic-molecule Feshbach resonances have been observed recently(6,7), using these resonancesto form triatomic molecules remains challenging. Here we report on evidence ofthe association of triatomic molecules near the Feshbach resonance between (NaK)-Na-23-K-40 molecules in the rovibrational ground state and K-40 atoms. We apply a radio-frequency pulse to drive the free-bound transition in ultracold mixtures of (NaK)-Na-23-K-40 and K-40 and monitor the loss of (NaK)-Na-23-K-40 molecules. The association of triatomic molecules manifests itself as an additional loss feature in the radio-frequency spectra, which can be distinguished from the atomic loss feature. The observation that the distance between the association feature and the atomic transition changes with the magnetic field provides strong evidence for the formation of triatomic molecules. The binding energy of the triatomic molecules is estimated from the measurements. Our work contributes to the understanding of the complex ultracold atom-molecule Feshbach resonances and may open up an avenue towards the preparation and control of ultracold triatomic molecules.

TI Multiparameter simultaneous optimal estimation with an SU(2) coding
   unitary evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In a ubiquitous SU(2) dynamics, achieving the simultaneous optimal estimation of multiple parameters is significant but difficult. Using quantum control to optimize this SU(2) coding unitary evolution is one of solutions. We propose a method, characterized by the nested cross products of the coefficient vector X of SU(2) generators and its partial derivative partial derivative X-l, to investigate the control-enhanced quantum multiparameter estimation. Our work reveals that quantum control is not always functional in improving the estimation precision, which depends on the characterization of an SU(2) dynamics with respect to the objective parameter. This characterization is quantified by the angle alpha(l) between X and partial derivative X-l. For an SU(2) dynamics featured by alpha(l) = pi/2, the promotion of the estimation precision can get the most benefits from the controls. When alpha(l) gradually closes to 0 or pi, the precision promotion contributed to by quantum control correspondingly becomes inconspicuous. Until a dynamics with alpha(l) = 0 or pi, quantum control completely loses its advantage. In addition, we find a set of conditions restricting the simultaneous optimal estimation of all the parameters, but fortunately, which can be removed by using a maximally entangled two-qubit state as the probe state and adding an ancillary channel into the configuration. Lastly, a spin-1/2 system is taken as an example to verify the above-mentioned conclusions. Our proposal sufficiently exhibits the hallmark of control-enhancement in fulfilling the multiparameter estimation mission, and it is applicable to an arbitrary SU(2) parametrization process.

TI Quantum Period Finding is Compression Robust
SO IACR TRANSACTIONS ON SYMMETRIC CRYPTOLOGY
AB We study quantum period finding algorithms such as Simon and Shor (and its variant Ekera-Hastad). For a periodic function f these algorithms produce - via some quantum embedding of f - a quantum superposition Sigma(x) vertical bar x > vertical bar f (x)>, which requires a certain amount of output qubits that represent vertical bar f (x)>. We show that one can lower this amount to a single output qubit by hashing f down to a single bit in an oracle setting.
   Namely, we replace the embedding of f in quantum period finding circuits by oracle access to several embeddings of hashed versions of f. We show that on expectation this modification only doubles the required amount of quantum measurements, while significantly reducing the total number of qubits. For example, for Simon's algorithm that finds periods in f : F-2(n) -> F-2(n) our hashing technique reduces the required output qubits from n down to 1, and therefore the total amount of qubits from 2n to n + 1. We also show that Simon's algorithm admits real world applications with only n + 1 qubits by giving a concrete realization of a hashed version of the cryptographic Even-Mansour construction. Moreover, for a variant of Simon's algorithm on Even-Mansour that requires only classical queries to Even-Mansour we save a factor of (roughly) 4 in the qubits.
   Our oracle-based hashed version of the Ekera-Hastad algorithm for factoring n-bit RSA reduces the required qubits from (3/2 + o(1))n down to (21 + o(1))n.

TI WS2 Nanosheet-Based Ultrascaled Field-Effect Transistor for
   Hydrogen Gas Sensing: Addressing the Sensitivity-Downscaling Trade-Off
SO SENSORS
AB In this paper, we propose an ultrascaled WS(2 )field-effect transistor equipped with a Pd/Pt sensitive gate for high-performance and low-power hydrogen gas sensing applications. The proposed nanosensor is simulated by self-consistently solving a quantum transport equation with electrostatics at the ballistic limit. The gas sensing principle is based on the gas-induced change in the metal gate work function. The hydrogen gas nanosensor leverages the high sensitivity of two-dimensional WS2 to its sur-rounding electrostatic environment. The computational investigation encompasses the nanosensor's behavior in terms of potential profile, charge density, current spectrum, local density of states (LDOS), transfer characteristics, and sensitivity. Additionally, the downscaling-sensitivity trade-off is analyzed by considering the impact of drain-to-source voltage and the electrostatics parameters on subthreshold performance. The simulation results indicate that the downscaling-sensitivity trade-off can be optimized through enhancements in electrostatics, such as utilizing high-k dielectrics and reducing oxide thickness, as well as applying a low drain-to-source voltage, which also contributes to improved energy efficiency. The proposed nanodevice meets the prerequisites for cutting-edge gas nanosensors, offering high sensing performance, improved scaling capability, low power consumption, and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility, making it a compelling candidate for the next generation of ultrascaled FET-based gas nanosensors.

TI Scalable Multispecies Ion Transport in a Grid-Based Surface-Electrode
   Trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum processors based on linear arrays of trapped ions have achieved exceptional performance, but scaling to large qubit numbers requires realizing two-dimensional ion arrays as envisioned in the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Here, we present a scalable method for the control of ion crystals in a grid-based surface-electrode Paul trap and characterize it in the context of transport operations that sort and reorder multispecies crystals. By combining cowiring of control electrodes at translationally symmetric locations in each grid site with the sitewise ability to exchange the voltages applied to two special electrodes gated by a binary input, site-dependent operations can be achieved using only a fixed number of analog voltage signals and a single digital input per site. In two separate experimental systems containing nominally identical grid traps, one using 171Yb & thorn;-138Ba & thorn; crystals and the other 137Ba & thorn;-88Sr & thorn;, we demonstrate this method by characterizing the conditional intrasite crystal reorder and the conditional exchange of ions between adjacent sites on the grid. Averaged across a multisite region of interest, we measure subquanta motional excitation in the axial in-phase and out-of-phase modes of the crystals following these operations at exchange rates of 2.5 kHz. In this initial demonstration, the logic controlling the voltage exchange occurs in software, but the applied signals mimic a proposed hardware implementation using crossover switches. These techniques can be further extended to implement other conditional operations in the QCCD architecture such as gates, initialization, and measurement.

TI Gas exchange patterns for a small, stored-grain insect pest,
   Tribolium castaneum
SO BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB Insects breathe using one or a combination of three gas exchange patterns; continuous, cyclic and discontinuous, which vary in their rates of exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide and water. In general, there is a trade-off between lowering gas exchange using discontinuous exchange that limits water loss at the cost of lower metabolic rate. These patterns and hypotheses for the evolution of discontinuous exchange have been examined for relatively large insects (>20 mg) over relatively short periods (<4 h), but smaller insects and longer time periods have yet to be examined. We measured gas exchange patterns and metabolic rates for adults of a small insect pest of grain, the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), using flow-through respirometry in dry air for 48 h. All adults survived the desiccating measurement period; initially they used continuous gas exchange, then after 24 h switched to cyclic gas exchange with a 27% decrease in metabolic rate, and then after 48 h switched to discontinuous gas exchange with increased interburst duration and further decrease in metabolic rate. The successful use of the Qubit, a lower cost and so more common gas analyser, to measure respiration in the very small T. castaneum, may prompt more flow-through respirometry studies of small insects. Running such studies over long durations may help to better understand the evolution of respiration physiology and thus suggest new methods of pest management.

TI Perfect chirality constructed by position-dependent backscattering in a
   whispering gallery mode microresonator
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Unidirectional propagation of photons originated from perfect chirality meets the critical requirement for building a high-performance quantum network. However, it not only requires that the circular dipole emitter is precisely located at points of circularly polarized electric fields, which leads to non-reciprocal interactions for photons with opposite propagation directions, but also the light-emitter interaction strength should be strong enough to guarantee a pi phase shift. Unfortunately, these perfect chirality points are scarce and accessible points with elliptically polarized fields result in non-ideal photon-emitter chiral interactions and emitters radiating photons bidirectionally. Meanwhile, reflection properties, phase shifts, and non-reciprocal interactions are sensitive to frequency detunings and dissipations. Here, without engineering the dipole and optimizing the distribution of the field, a scatter such as a nanotip placed at the evanescent field of a whispering gallery mode resonator (WGMR) is adopted to control the transporting properties of single photons under non-ideal chiral interactions. By properly adjusting the relative position between the nanotip and the atom or the overlap between the nanotip and the mode volume of the WGMR, amplitudes of reflected photons in different pathways are changed. Consequently, complete destructive interference appears and thus no photons are reflected. The corresponding phase shifts of pi and non-reciprocal interactions are guaranteed simultaneously. Significantly, the perfect chirality reconstructed here is robust against frequency detunings and dissipations. Therefore, the atom-WGMR-nanotip structure can be regarded as a compound chiral atom with radiating photons in only one direction.

TI Guiding charged particles in vacuum via Lagrange points
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We propose a method for guiding charged particles such as electrons and protons, in vacuum, by employing the exotic properties of Lagrange points. This leap is made possible by the dynamics unfolding around these equilibrium points, which stably capture such particles, akin to the way Trojan asteroids are held in Jupiter's orbit. Unlike traditional methodologies that allow for either focusing or three-dimensional storage of charged particles, the proposed scheme can guide both non-relativistic and relativistic electrons and protons in small cross-sectional areas in an invariant fashion over long distances without any appreciable loss in energy - in a manner analogous to photon transport in optical fibers. Here, particle guiding is achieved by employing twisted electrostatic potentials that in turn induce stable Lagrange points in vacuum. In principle, guidance can be realized within the fundamental mode of the resulting waveguide, thereby presenting a prospect for manipulating these particles in the quantum domain. Our findings may be useful in a wide range of applications in both scientific and technological pursuits. These applications could encompass electron microscopies and lithographies, particle accelerators, quantum and classical communication/sensing systems, as well as methods for shuttling entangled qubits between nodes within a quantum network.
   Transporting charged particles in a guided manner, similar to how optical fibers carry light signals, has the potential to profoundly impact the scientific and technological landscape. Here, the authors propose a viable method to realize these waveguides by leveraging Lagrange points created by the electrostatic potential around a carefully designed twisted wire in a vacuum.

TI Coupling magnons to an opto-electronic parametric oscillator
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations have been a unique platform for long-haul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes-revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating the long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be found useful in constructing the future "distributed hybrid magnonic systems."

TI Symmetry resolved entanglement of excited states in quantum field
   theory. Part III. Bosonic and fermionic negativity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In two recent works, we studied the symmetry resolved Renyi entropies of quasi-particle excited states in quantum field theory. We found that the entropies display many model-independent features which we discussed and analytically characterised. In this paper we extend this line of investigation by providing analytical and numerical evidence that a similar universal behavior arises for the symmetry resolved negativity. In particular, we compute the ratio of charged moments of the partially transposed reduced density matrix as an expectation value of twist operators. These are "fused" versions of the more traditionally used branch point twist fields and were introduced in a previous work. The use of twist operators allows us to perform the computation in an arbitrary number of spacial dimensions. We show that, in the large-volume limit, only the commutation relations between the twist operators and local fields matter, and computations reduce to a purely combinatorial problem. We address some specific issues regarding fermionic excitations, whose treatment requires the notion of partial time-reversal transformation, and we discuss the differences and analogies with their bosonic counterpart. We find that although the operation of partial transposition requires a redefinition for fermionic theories, the ratio of the negativity moments between an excited state and the ground state is universal and identical for fermions and bosons as well as for a large variety of very different states, ranging from simple qubit states to the excited states of free quantum field theories. Our predictions are tested numerically on a 1D Fermi chain.

TI Non-Hermitian physics in magnetic systems
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians provide an alternative perspective on the dynamics of quantum and classical systems coupled non-conservatively to an environment. Once primarily an interest of mathematical physicists, the theory of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians has solidified and expanded to describe various physically observable phenomena in optical, photonic, and condensed matter systems. Self-consistent descriptions of quantum mechanics based on non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been developed and continue to be refined. In particular, non-Hermitian frameworks to describe magnonic and hybrid magnonic systems have gained popularity and utility in recent years with new insights into the magnon topology, transport properties, and phase transitions coming into view. Magnonic systems are in many ways a natural platform in which to realize non-Hermitian physics because they are always coupled to a surrounding environment and exhibit lossy dynamics. In this Perspective, we review recent progress in non-Hermitian frameworks to describe magnonic and hybrid magnonic systems, such as cavity magnonic systems and magnon-qubit coupling schemes. We discuss progress in understanding the dynamics of inherently lossy magnetic systems as well as systems with gain induced by externally applied spin currents. We enumerate phenomena observed in both purely magnonic and hybrid magnonic systems which can be understood through the lens of non-Hermitian physics, such as PT and anti- PT-symmetry breaking, dynamical magnetic phase transitions, non-Hermitian skin effect, and the realization of exceptional points and surfaces. Finally, we comment on some open problems in the field and discuss areas for further exploration.

TI Bi-directional semi-quantum secure direct communication protocol based
   on high-dimensional single-particle states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Semi-quantum secure direct communication allows the quantum party and the classical party to transmit secure messages directly, but does not need sharing a secret key in advance. To increase the information transmission efficiency and practicability of semi-quantum secure direct communication, a bidirectional semi-quantum secure direct communication protocol with high-dimensional single-particle states is designed. Theproposed protocol involves quantum party Alice and classical party Bob. Each participant can receive a secret message while sending a secret message. Unlike most of existing quantum secure direct communication protocols, it is not necessary for the classical party Bob in the proposed protocol to possess the capability of measuring quantum states, which greatly enhances the feasibility of the protocol. The protocol allows the classical party Bob to implement the unitary operations on particles and reorder the quantum sequence. Furthermore, the quantum party Alice and the classical party Bob can verify the correctness of the receivedsecret message with the Hash function. Security analysis indicates that without being discovered by thelegitimate participants, Eve cannot obtain the secret message with common attack, such as intercept-resend attack, measure-resend attack, tampering attack and entanglement-measure attack. Compared with the typical semi-quantum secure direct communication protocols, the proposed protocol has a high qubit efficiency of about 28.6%. In addition, the transmission efficiency of secret message is greatly enhanced, since the proposed protocol utilizes the high-dimensional single-particle states as the carrier of secret message.

TI On Quantum Optimal Transport
SO MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS ANALYSIS AND GEOMETRY
AB We analyze a quantum version of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem. The quantum transport cost related to a Hermitian cost matrix C is minimized over the set of all bipartite coupling states rho(AB) with fixed reduced density matrices rho(A) and rho(B) of size m and n. The minimum quantum optimal transport cost T-C(Q) (rho(A), rho(B)) can be efficiently computed using semidefinite programming. In the case m = n the cost T-C(Q) gives a semidistance if and only ifC is positive semidefinite and vanishes exactly on the subspace of symmetricmatrices. Furthermore, if C satisfies the above conditions, then root T-C(Q) induces a quantum analogue of theWasserstein-2 distance. Taking the quantum cost matrix CQ to be the projector on the antisymmetric subspace, we provide a semi-analytic expression for T-CQ(Q) for any pair of single-qubit states and show that its square root yields a transport distance on the Bloch ball. Numerical simulations suggest that this property holds also in higher dimensions. Assuming that the cost matrix suffers decoherence and that the density matrices become diagonal, we study the quantum-toclassical transition of the Monge-Kantorovich distance, propose a continuous family of interpolating distances, and demonstrate that the quantum transport is cheaper than the classical one. Furthermore, we introduce a related quantity-the SWAP-fidelity-and compare its properties with the standard Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. We also discuss the quantum optimal transport for general d-partite systems.

TI Shortcut-to-adiabaticity quantum tripartite Otto cycle
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB For an Otto cycle there always exists a trade-off between the cycle efficiency and the output power due to the requirement of cycle length. The shortcut to adiabatic (STA) technology provides an effective way to deal with the difficulty of zero-output power in conventional Otto cycle. In this paper, the Otto cycle of three-qubit system as the working substance with counterdiabatic driving has been investigated. It is demonstrated that the tripartite Otto cycle as a universal machine, in the suitable regimes of external control parameter, could work as a quantum heat engine (QHE), refrigerator or heat pump. And, the performances of QHE and refrigerator with and without STA, such as the power and efficiency of QHE and the coefficient of performance (COP) and figure of merit (FOM) of refrigerator, have been investigated. It shows the application of STA scheme can lead to an effective enhancement in the performances of Otto cycle, including achievements of a high QHE's/refrigerator's power associated with a moderate QHE's efficiency/COP of refrigerator. Especially, it is interesting that even in a short-time cycle the optimization of control parameters could arise a remarkable improvement in the efficiency (or COP) of STA QHE (refrigerator), approaching the ideal efficiency or COP of conventional Otto cycle with quasi-static process. Finally, with the aid of parameter optimization the trade-off regions between the efficiency and the power (the COP and the FOM) of STA Otto engine (refrigerator) have been advised.

TI Charging performance of quantum batteries based on
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Recently, quantum battery based on various physical models from quantum optics model to spin model and its enhancement of charging performance have attracted increasing interest. It has been demonstrated that quantum entanglement is beneficial to the speedup of work extraction. In this paper, by an exact diagonalization approach, we investigate the charging performance of the field intensity-dependent Dicke model (also called intensity-dependent Dicke model) quantum battery, which consists of N qubits collectively interacting with a single-mode cavity. The considered intensity-dependent Dicke model is a generalized Dicke model with a nonlinear-coupling fashion and different weights of energy conserved term and non-conserved term. Firstly, we consider the influences of energy non-conserved term (also called anti-rotating wave term) on the maximum stored energy and maximum charging power in quantum battery. It is shown that the maximum stored energy is not very sensitive to the increase of the weight of energy non-conserved term, but the maximum charging power undergoes a significant change with the increase of the weight of energy non -conserved term. We also show that the maximum charging power increases monotonically with the increase of coupling constant between qubits and cavity, but the maximum stored energy is not monotonically related to the increase of coupling constant. Then, we further examine in detail the characteristics of the maximum stored energy, charging time, energy quantum fluctuation and maximum charging power in the quantum battery under the same weight between energy conserved term and non-conserved term. By comparing the charging performances of quantum battery based on the single-photon-Dicke model with those based on the two-photon -Dicke model, we find that the performances, specifically, the charging time and maximum charging power of the intensity-dependent Dicke quantum battery are better than those of single-photon Dicke quantum battery, but weaker than those of two-photon Dicke quantum battery. Of particular interest is that the relationship of maximum charging power with large quantum cell number in intensity-dependent Dicke quantum battery has the same form as that in the two-photon Dicke quantum battery, i.e. their maximum values of charging power are both proportional to the large quantum cell number squared, specifically, PIDmax a N2 and P2ph max a N2 , which are consistent with the upper bound given by the paper (Gyhm J, Safranek D, Rosa D 2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 140501). It is worthwhile to mention that Dou et al. (Dou F Q, Zhou H, Sun J A 2022 Phys. Rev. A 106 032212) showed that using the quantum advantage of maximum charging power in the quantum battery based on cavity Heisenberg-spin-chain model Pmax a N2 can be obtained. Therefore, this study of the charging performance based on the intensity-dependent Dicke quantum battery may provide an alternative approach to the further research on quantum battery.

TI Multi-bit quantum random number generator from path-entangled single
   photons
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Measurement outcomes on quantum systems exhibit inherent randomness and are fundamentally nondeterministic. This has enabled quantum physics to set new standards for the generation of true randomness with significant applications in the fields of cryptography, statistical simulations, and modeling of the nondeterministic behavior in various other fields. In this work, we present a scheme for the generation of multi-bit random numbers using path-entangled single photons. For the experimental demonstration, we generate a path-entangled state using single photons from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and assign a multi-qubit state for them in path basis. One-bit and two-bit random numbers are then generated by measuring entangled states in the path basis. In addition to passing the NIST tests for randomness, we also demonstrate the certification of quantumness and self-certification of quantum random number generator (QRNG) using Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality violation. We also record the significantly low autocorrelation coefficient from the raw bits generated and this along with CHSH violation rules out multi-photon events and ensure the protection from photon splitting attack. Distribution of photons along multiple paths resulting in multiple bits from one photon extends the limit on bit generation rate imposed by the detection dead time of the individual detector. Thus, the path-entangled states can generate higher bitrates compared to scheme using entangled photon pair which are limited by the coincidence counts. We demonstrate this by generating a high rate of about 80 Mbps when the single photon detector saturates at around 28 Mcps and still show violation of CHSH inequality.

TI RNA preservation in human dental pulp for transcriptomic profiling: a
   comparative multi-parameter study
SO FRONTIERS IN DENTAL MEDICINE
AB Objectives: Dental pulp tissue presents unique challenges for RNA analysis due to its fibrous nature, elevated RNase expression, and susceptibility to degradation during extraction procedures. This study systematically evaluated three distinct preservation methodologies to determine optimal approaches for maintaining RNA integrity and quality in human dental pulp tissue. Methods: Dental pulp samples were obtained from thirty-six patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis requiring endodontic treatment. Tissues were preserved using three methods: snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, RNAiso Plus reagent preservation, and RNAlater solution storage. RNA quality was comprehensively assessed using multiple complementary approaches; Nanodrop spectrophotometry, Qubit fluorometry, and Bioanalyzer capillary electrophoresis. Parameters assessed were yield quantification, purity assessment and structural integrity. Results: RNAlater storage demonstrated statistically significant superior performance across all evaluated parameters. Yield analysis showed an 11.5-fold enhancement relative to snap freezing (4,425.92 +/- 2,299.78 vs. 384.25 +/- 160.82 ng/mu l, p < 0.001) and 1.8-fold improvement over RNAiso Plus extraction. Integrity assessment indicated significant advantages with RNAlater samples exhibiting mean RIN values of 6.0 +/- 2.07 compared to snap freezing at 3.34 +/- 2.87 (p = 0.028). Quality evaluation demonstrated RNAlater samples achieved optimal RNA quality in 75% of cases while snap freezing achieved this standard in only 33% of samples. Conclusion: RNAlater storage establishes as the optimal preservation approach for dental pulp RNA investigations, delivering enhanced yield, purity, and integrity parameters. The results furnish credible affirmation for establishing methodological standardisation in dental transcriptomics investigations and clinical implementations.

   calculations with the FMO scheme
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY
AB The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) scheme is one of the popular fragmentation-based methods and has the potential advantage of making the circuit shallow for quantum chemical calculations on quantum computers. In this study, we used a GPU-accelerated quantum simulator (cuQuantum) to perform the electron correlation part of the FMO calculation as unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for hydrogen-bonded (FH)3$$ {}_3 $$ and (FH)2$$ {}_2 $$-H2$$ {}_2 $$O systems with the STO-3G basis set. VQE-UCCSD calculations were performed using both canonical and localized MO sets, and the results were examined from the point of view of size-consistency and orbital-invariance affected by the Trotter error. It was found that the use of localized MO leads to better results, especially for (FH)2$$ {}_2 $$-H2$$ {}_2 $$O. The GPU acceleration was substantial for the simulations with larger numbers of qubits, and was about a factor of 6.7-7.7 for 18 qubit systems.

TI First quantization of braided Majorana fermions
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB A Z2-graded qubit represents an even (bosonic) "vacuum state" and an odd, excited, Majorana fermion state. The multiparticle sectors of N, braided, indistinguishable Majorana fermions are constructed via first quantization. The framework is that of a graded Hopf algebra endowed with a braided tensor product. The Hopf algebra is U(gl(1|1)), the Universal Enveloping Algebra of the gl(1|1) superalgebra. A 4 x 4 braiding matrix Bt defines the braided tensor product. Bt, which is related to the R-matrix of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, depends on the braiding parameter t belonging to the punctured plane (t is an element of C*); the ordinary antisymmetry property of fermions is recovered for t = 1. For each N, the graded dimension m|n of the graded multiparticle Hilbert space is computed. Besides the generic case, truncations occur when t coincides with certain roots of unity which appear as solutions of an ordered set of polynomial equations. The roots of unity are organized into levels which specify the maximal number of allowed braided Majorana fermions in a multiparticle sector. By taking into account that the even/odd sectors in a Z2-graded Hilbert space are superselected, a nontrivial braiding with t = 1 is essential to produce a nontrivial Hilbert space described by qubits, qutrits, etc., since at t = 1 the N-particle vacuum and the antisymmetrized excited state encode the same information carried by a classical 1-bit.

TI Circuit complexity near critical points
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider the Bose-Hubbard model in two and three spatial dimensions and numerically compute the quantum circuit complexity of the ground state in the Mott insulator and superfluid phases using a mean field approximation with additional quadratic fluctuations. After mapping to a qubit system, the result is given by the complexity associated with a Bogoliubov transformation applied to the reference state taken to be the mean field ground state. In particular, the complexity has peaks at the O(2) critical points where the system can be described by a relativistic quantum field theory. Given that we use a Gaussian approximation, near criticality the numerical results agree with a free field theory calculation. To go beyond the Gaussian approximation we use general scaling arguments that imply that, as we approach the critical point t -> t(c), there is a non-analytic behavior in the complexity c(2)(t) of the form vertical bar c(2)(t) - c(2)(t(c))vertical bar similar to vertical bar t - t(c)vertical bar(nu)d, up to possible logarithmic corrections. Here d is the number of spatial dimensions and nu is the usual critical exponent for the correlation length xi similar to vertical bar t - t(c)vertical bar(-nu) As a check, for d = 2 this agrees with the numerical computation if we use the Gaussian critical exponent nu = 1/2. Finally, using AdS/CFT methods, we study higher dimensional examples and confirm this scaling argument with non-Gaussian exponent nu for strongly interacting theories that have a gravity dual.

AB Lattice-based cryptography, the study of cryptographic primitives whose security is based on the hardness of so-called lattice problems, has taken center stage in cryptographic research in recent years. It potentially offers favorable security features, even against quantum algorithms. One of the main obstacles for wide adoption of this type of cryptography is its unsatisfactory efficiency. To address this point, efficient lattice-based cryptography usually relies on the intractability of problems on lattices with additional algebraic structure (such as so-called ideal-lattices or module-lattices).
   It is an important open question to evaluate the hardness of such lattice problems, and their relation to the hardness of problems on unstructured lattices. It is a known fact that an unstructured lattice, which is simply an additive discrete group in Euclidean space, can be cast as an ideal-lattice in some order of a number field (and thus, in a rather trivial sense, that ideals in orders are as general as unstructured lattices). However, it is not known whether this connection can be used to imply useful hardness results for structured lattices, or alternatively new algorithmic techniques for unstructured lattices.
   In this work we establish a gradient of hardness for the Order-LWE problem (a generalization of the well known Ring-LWE problem), as it varies over orders in a number field. Furthermore, we show that, in every number field, there are certain orders such that the corresponding Order-LWE problem is at least as hard as the (unstructured) LWE problem. So in general one should not hope to solve (any) Order-LWE more efficiently than LWE. However, we show that this connection holds in orders that are very "skewed" and hence, perhaps, irrelevant for improving efficiency in cryptographic applications. We further improve the hardness result for Order-LWE, to include all ideal lattices, closing a gap left in prior work. This establishes a direct connection between problems on unstructured lattices and the structured problem of Order-LWE.

TI A Mathematical Model for Controlling Exchanged Spinor Waves between
   Hemoglobin, Tumor and T-Cells
SO MATHEMATICS
AB To date, it is known that tumor cells respond to attacks of T-cells by producing some PD-1/PD-L1 and other connections. Unfortunately, medical methods for preventing these connections are expensive and sometimes non-effective. In this study, we suggest a new way for reducing these connections by producing some noise in the exchanged information between tumor cells, T-cells, hemoglobin, and controller cells such as those of the heart or brain. In this model, we assume that human cells use spinor waves for exchanging information because the velocity of exchanged information between two spinors, which are located a large distance apart, exceeds the velocity of light. In fact, two spinors could send and receive information from each other instantaneously. In this hypothesis, the DNAs within heart cells, brain cells or any controller are built from some spinors such as electrons, and by their motion, some waves are generated. These spinor waves are received by iron atoms and multi-gonal molecules within hemoglobin and other spinors within the blood vessels. The hemoglobin molecules are located on some blood cells, move along the blood vessels and pass on their information to cells, proteins and RNAs. The spins of the spinors within the hemoglobin and also the spins of the charges and ions within the blood vessels are entangled and could transmit any information between cells. Thus, when a tumor is formed, its spinor waves change, and are transmitted rapidly into the heart cells, brain cells and other controller cells. The heart, brain or other controller cells diagnose these quantum waves, and by using the entanglement between the spinors within the blood vessels and the hemoglobin, send some messages to the T-cells. These messages are received by tumor cells and they become ready to respond to attacks. To prevent the reception of information by tumor cells, we can make use of some extra cells or hemoglobin, which interact with spinors and hemoglobin around tumor cells and produce some noise. Science quantum spinor waves are minute and have minor power and intensity; we cannot detect them by our present electronic devices and for this reason, we suggest using biological cells. This is a hypothesis; however, if experiments show its validity, some types of cancers could be cured or controlled by this method. We formulate the model by considering quantum entanglement between spinors within biological systems. By changing any spin within this system, all spins change and consequently, information is transmitted immediately. Then, we add new spinors to this system mathematically, and show that this causes the correlations between the initial spinors to reduce. Thus, the spinors of the extra hemoglobin or cells could act like noise, and prevent reception of real information by tumor cells.

TI Rigorous maximum-likelihood estimation for quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for the recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a nonconvex but low-rank parametrization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive-semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method. Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based positive-operator-value measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just O(d log2 d) complexity per iteration to recover a d x d density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.

TI Device-independent self-testing of unsharp measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Semi-device-independent certification of an unsharp instrument has recently been demonstrated (2019 New J. Phys. 21 083034) based on the sequential sharing of quantum advantages in a prepare-measure communication game by assuming the system to be qubit. In this work, we provide device-independent (DI) self-testing of the unsharp instrument through the quantum violation of two Bell inequalities where the devices are uncharacterized and the dimension of the system remains unspecified. We introduce an elegant sum-of-squares approach to derive the dimension-independent optimal quantum violation of Bell inequalities which plays a crucial role. Note that the standard Bell test cannot self-test the post-measurement states and consequently cannot self-test unsharp instrument. The sequential Bell test possess the potential to self-test an unsharp instrument. We demonstrate that there exists a trade-off between the maximum sequential quantum violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, and they form an optimal pair that enables the DI self-testing of the entangled state, the observables, and the unsharpness parameter. Further, we extend our study to the case of elegant Bell inequality and we argue that it has two classical bounds-the local bound and the non-trivial preparation non-contextual bound, lower than the local bound. Based on the sharing of preparation contextuality by three independent sequential observers, we demonstrate the DI self-testing of two unsharpness parameters. Since an actual experimental scenario involves losses and imperfection, we demonstrate robustness of our certification to noise.

TI Analysing All-Optical Random Bit Sequences Using Gap-Based Approaches
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum mechanical phenomena are revolutionizing classical engineering fields such as signal processing or cryptography. When randomness plays an important role, like in cryptography where random bit sequences guarantee certain levels of security, quantum mechanical phenomena allow new ways of generating random bit sequences. Such sequences have a lot of applications in the communication sector, e.g., regarding data transmission, simulation, sensors or radars, and beyond. They can be generated deterministically (e.g., by using polynomials, resulting in pseudo-random sequences) or in a non-deterministic way (e.g., by using physical noise sources like external devices or sensors, resulting in random sequences). Important characteristics of such binary sequences can be modelled by gap processes in conjunction with the probability theory. Recently, all-optical approaches have attracted a lot of research interest. In this work, an adaptation of the quantum key distribution setup is utilized for generating randomised bit sequences. The simulation results show that all-optically generated sequences very well resemble the theoretically ideal probability density characteristic. Additionally, an experimental optical setup is developed that confirms the simulation results. Furthermore, m-sequences show very promising results as well as Gold sequences. Additionally, the level of burstiness, i.e., the distribution of ones and zeros throughout the sequence, is studied for the different sequences. The results enable the finding that generator polynomials with concentrated non-zero coefficients lead to more bursty bit sequences.

TI Quantitative Convergence of Trained Quantum Neural Networks to a
   Gaussian Process
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We study quantum neural networks where the generated function is the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables across all qubits. In (Girardi et al., CMP (2025), it is proven that the probability distributions of such generated functions converge in distribution to a Gaussian process in the limit of infinite width for both untrained networks with randomly initialized parameters and trained networks. In this paper, we provide a quantitative proof of this convergence in terms of the Wasserstein distance of order 1. First, we establish an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by any untrained network with finite width and the Gaussian process with the same covariance. This proof utilizes Stein's method to estimate the Wasserstein distance of order 1. Next, we analyze the training dynamics of the network via gradient flow, proving an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by the trained network and the corresponding Gaussian process. This proof is based on a quantitative upper bound on the maximum variation of a parameter during training. This bound implies that for sufficiently large widths, training occurs in the lazy regime, i.e., each parameter changes only by a small amount. While the convergence result of Girardi et al., CMP (2025) holds at a fixed training time, our upper bounds are uniform in time and hold even as t ->infinity\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$t \rightarrow \infty $$\end{document}.

AB Modern physics experiments often utilize field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based systems for real-time data acquisition (DAQ). Integrated analog electronics demand for complex calibration routines. Furthermore, versatile configuration and control of the whole system are key requirements. Besides a low-level register interface to the FPGA, also, access to (IC)-C-2 and SPI buses is often needed to configure the complete system. Calibration through an FPGA is inflexible and yields a complex hardware implementation. On the contrary, calibration through a remote system is possible but considerably slower due to repetitive network accesses. By using system-on-chip (SoC)-FPGA solutions with a microprocessor, more sophisticated configuration and calibration solutions, as well as standard remote access protocols, can be efficiently integrated into the software. Based on Xilinx Zynq US+ SoC-FPGAs, we implemented a versatile control framework. This software framework offers convenient access to the hardware and a flexible abstraction via remote-procedure calls (RPCs). Based on the open-source RPC library gRPC, functionality with low-latency control flow, complex algorithms, data conversions and processing, and configuration via external buses can be provided to a client via Ethernet. Furthermore, client interfaces for various programming languages can be generated automatically, which eases collaboration among different working groups and integration into existing software. This contribution presents the framework and benchmarks regarding latency and data throughput.

TI Quality and applicability of cadaveric donor eyes for molecular biology
   research: An Indian experience
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Purpose:Human ocular tissue banking plays an important part in the advancement of translational research for identifying the molecular processes involved in disease etiology and pathogenesis. Timely obtaining a good-quality ocular tissue from a cadaveric donor is exceedingly difficult, especially in remote areas, with a variable transportation time (within 12-24 h), raising concerns about RNA quality and its subsequent applications. Therefore, we assessed the utility of retinal tissues from cadaver donor and enucleated eyes based on the RNA quality and gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Settings and Design:Prospective study.Methods:Retina tissues were separated from the donor/enucleated eyes received in the eye bank within 24 h of death (n = 15) and within an hour from OR (n = 3), respectively, and stored immediately at -80 degree. RNA was isolated using trizol, and the quantity and quality were assessed using Qubit and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. QPCR was performed for measuring the expression of different retinal-specific genes. The cellular viability of the retina was assessed by establishing explant primary cell cultures.Statistical Analysis:The data were calculated as an average of normalised Ct values +/- standard error of the mean.Results:RNA obtained from cadaveric tissues despite being partially degraded showed a uniform strong gene expression of several retinal-specific genes such as PAX6, RHO, TUBB3, CRX, and ALDH1L1. The primary cultures established from cadaveric tissues showed viable cells.Conclusion:The cadaver donor tissues collected within 24 hours of death can be effectively utilized for gene expression profiling.

TI Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Neuroendocrine Lung Tumors: Preliminary
   Data from a Prospective Surgical Series
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (PULMONARY NETs) are heterogeneous tumors ranging from well-differentiated to highly aggressive neoplasms. The aim of this study is to prospectively test pre-operative circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in PULMONARY NET patients undergoing surgery and evaluate its relationship to clinicopathological features. From February to December 2024, 136 patients with suspected primary lung cancer underwent pre-operative blood sampling, of whom 21 were diagnosed with PULMONARY NETs. Total cell-free nucleic acid extraction was performed using the Genexus Purification System (Thermofisher). cfDNA was quantified using a fluorometric assay with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermofisher) and a capillary electrophoresis-based assay (cell-free DNA ScreenTape kit) on the Tape Station 4200 systems (Agilent). A cfDNA quality assessment was also obtained (cfDNA sizing and % cfDNA). Most patients had Stage I (18/21.85.7%) typical carcinoids (16/21.76.2%). Nodal involvement was detected in one patient (0.5%). Six months after surgery, all patients were alive without recurrence. Larger tumors presented higher levels of cfDNA. The mean tumor size in patients with cfDNA > 40 ng was 266 mm (+/- 16.7 mm), compared to 13.2 mm (+/- 7.3 mm) for cfDNA < 40 ng (p-value = 0.018). Higher levels of cfDNA were observed in patients with pStages greater than IA (p-value = 0.007). Although limited by a small sample group and biases of a surgical series, we observed that larger/advanced PULMONARY NETs presented higher cfDNA levels pre-operatively.

TI Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with
   large condition numbers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form A (x) over right arrow = (b) over right arrow on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number (kappa) scaling of the A matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the postselection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) framework that operates on a simple yet effective premise: subtracting mixed and wrong signals to extract correct signals while providing the benefit of optimal scaling in the condition number of A (denoted as kappa) for large kappa scenarios. This approach, which leads to minimal increase in circuit depth, has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. The term "signal" refers to a feature of |x). We design circuits for overlap and expectation value estimation in the Psi-HHL framework. We demonstrate performance of Psi-HHL via numerical simulations. We carry out two sets of computations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large-kappa matrices via (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size 64 x 64 and kappa values of up to approximate to 1 x 10(6), and (b) application to quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size 256 x 256 that reach kappa of about 393. The molecular systems that we consider are Li2, KH, RbH, and CsH.

AB Highlights What are the main findings? Threshold Reduction and Environmental Robustness Introduced a Faraday rotation mirror (FRM) to enable dual-pass SBS interaction, reducing the SBS power threshold by 2.7 dB compared to conventional systems. The FRM's polarization rotation inherently suppresses polarization-induced fluctuations and vibration noise, eliminating the need for active polarization control. Record-Breaking Performance Sensitivity: 1.0609 MHz/degrees C (R2 = 0.999) over a 67 degrees C range (30-97 degrees C). Stability: +/- 0.004 degrees C long-term precision, surpassing existing SBS-OEO schemes. Power Efficiency: Operates at 13.6 dBm pump power. What is the implication of the main finding? For threshold reduction and environmental robustness: The dual-pass SBS interaction enabled by FRM provides a feasible technical path to lower the energy consumption of SBS-based systems, while the inherent suppression of polarization fluctuations and vibration noise simplifies the system structure (avoiding complex active polarization control modules), reducing the difficulty of system integration and maintenance costs. For record-breaking performance: The high sensitivity (1.0609 MHz/degrees C, R2 = 0.999) over a 67 degrees C range allows the system to achieve high-precision temperature sensing in scenarios requiring wide-temperature-range monitoring (e.g., industrial equipment thermal management, environmental temperature tracking). The +/- 0.004 degrees C long-term precision surpasses existing SBS-OEO schemes, making it suitable for high-stability application scenarios such as precision instrument calibration and quantum sensing auxiliary temperature control.

The sensing mechanism relied on the temperature-dependent frequency shift in the SBS-induced notch filter. By embedding this filter in the OEO feedback loop, the oscillator's output frequency was locked to the difference between the optical carrier frequency and the SBS notch center frequency. The temperature variations were translated into microwave frequency shifts through OEO oscillation, which was quantified with heterodyne detection. To suppress environmental perturbations, a Faraday rotation mirror (FRM) was integrated at the fiber end, creating a dual-pass SBS interaction that simultaneously enhanced the vibration immunity and reduced the SBS power threshold by 2.7 dB. The experimental results demonstrated a sensitivity of 1.0609 MHz/degrees C (R2 = 0.999) and a long-term stability of +/- 0.004 degrees C. This innovative scheme demonstrated significant advantages over conventional SBS-OEO temperature sensing approaches, particularly in terms of threshold reduction and environmental stability enhancement.

TI Dispelling myths on superposition attacks: formal security model and
   attack analyses
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB With the emergence of quantum communication, it is of folkloric belief that the security of classical cryptographic protocols is automatically broken if the Adversary is allowed to perform superposition queries and the honest players forced to perform actions coherently on quantum states. Another widely held intuition is that enforcing measurements on the exchanged messages is enough to protect protocols from these attacks. However, the reality is much more complex. Security models dealing with superposition attacks only consider unconditional security. Conversely, security models considering computational security assume that all supposedly classical messages are measured, which forbids by construction the analysis of superposition attacks. To fill in the gap between those models, Boneh and Zhandry have started to study the quantum computational security for classical primitives in their seminal work at Crypto'13, but only in the single-party setting. To the best of our knowledge, an equivalent model in the multiparty setting is still missing. In this work, we propose the first computational security model considering superposition attacks for multiparty protocols. We show that our new security model is satisfiable by proving the security of the well-known One-Time-Pad protocol and give an attack on a variant of the equally reputable Yao Protocol for Secure Two-Party Computations. The post-mortem of this attack reveals the precise points of failure, yielding highly counter-intuitive results: Adding extra classical communication, which is harmless for classical security, can make the protocol become subject to superposition attacks. We use this newly imparted knowledge to construct the first concrete protocol for Secure Two-Party Computation that is resistant to superposition attacks. Our results show that there is no straightforward answer to provide for either the vulnerabilities of classical protocols to superposition attacks or the adapted countermeasures.

TI Integrated photonic molecule Brillouin laser with a high-power
   sub-100-mHz fundamental linewidth
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Photonic integrated lasers with an ultra-low fundamental linewidth and a high output power are important for precision atomic and quantum applications, high-capacity communications, and fiber sensing, yet wafer-scale solutions have remained elusive. Here we report an integrated stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL), based on a photonic molecule coupled resonator design, that achieves a sub-100-mHz fundamental linewidth with greater than 10-mW output power in the C band, fabricated on a 200-mm silicon nitride (Si3N4) CMOS-foundry compatible wafer-scale platform. The photonic molecule design is used to suppress the second-order Stokes (S2) emission, allowing the primary lasing mode to increase with the pump power without phase noise feedback from higher Stokes orders. The nested waveguide resonators have a 184 million intrinsic and 92 million loaded Q, over an order of magnitude improvement over prior photonic molecules, enabling precision resonance splitting of 198 MHz at the S2 frequency. We demonstrate S2-suppressed single-mode SBL with a minimum fundamental linewidth of 71 +/- 18 mHz, corresponding to a 23 +/- 6-mHz(2)/Hz white-frequency-noise floor, over an order of magnitude lower than prior integrated SBLs, with an similar to 11-mW output power and 2.3-mW threshold power. The frequency noise reaches the resonator-intrinsic thermo-refractive noise from 2-kHz to 1-MHz offset. The laser phase noise reaches -155 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset. The performance of this chip-scale SBL shows promise not only to improve the reliability and reduce size and cost but also to enable new precision experiments that require the high-speed manipulation, control, and interrogation of atoms and qubits.

TI High-order coherence of super-bunching squeezed thermal states and
   squeezed number states of light fields
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The bunching and antibunching effects of light fields reflect the spatiotemporal correlation of photons and are key indicators for distinguishing classical and non-classical quantum statistics. They play a crucial role in quantum information processing and precise measurement. In this paper, we investigate the super-bunching and antibunching effects of the full-time-delay higher-order coherence function g(n) for squeezed thermal states and squeezed number states based on a multi-cascaded Hanbury Brown-Twiss single-photon detection scheme.Under ideal conditions, the high-order coherence of squeezed thermal states and squeezed number states is analyzed by changing compression parameter r, average photon number alpha, and squeezed photon number n. The results indicate that when the compression parameter r is an element of[0,1], the squeezed thermal state exhibits a significant super-bunching effect, with super-bunching values of each order being g((2))=9.98x10(5), g((3))=8.98x10(6), g((4))=8.96x10(12), g(5)=2.24x10(14). The squeezed number state exhibits a continuous transition from antibunching to bunching behavior, with coherence degrees of different orders being g((2))is an element of[1.60x10(-5),1.09], g((3))is an element of[9.02x10(-6),1.16], g((4))is an element of[4.75x10(-6),1.22], and g((5))is an element of[9.39x10(-6),1.30]).Simultaneously, this study analyzes the high-order photon coherence of squeezed thermal states and squeezed number states under experimental conditions, with background noise gamma and detection efficiency eta taken into account. When detection efficiency is relatively low and background noise is substantial, the higher-order coherence of squeezed thermal states with smaller average photon number alpha is disturbed by background noise, but still maintains good super-bunching characteristics. However, when the average photon number alpha becomes large, which is limited by the dead time of single-photon detector, it is challenging to accurately obtain all the information about the squeezed number state light field, leading measurement results to deviate from the ideal values. When the average photon number is alpha=0.5, the super-bunching effects reach their maximum values of g((2))=2.149, g((3))=6.389(sic)g((4))=23.228, corresponding to the squeezing degrees S-(2)=5.47, S-(3)=4.86 and = 4.43, respectively. Furthermore, by adjusting the number of squeezed photons n and the squeezing degree of the squeezed number state light field, S, a continuous and wide-ranging change of high-order coherence function can be achieved, transforming from anti-bunching effect to super-bunching effect. Additionally, under the conditions of high environmental noise and low detection efficiency, higher-order coherence exhibits greater sensitivity to variations in optical field parameters than lower-order coherence. Furthermore, squeezed number states with multi-photon characteristics are less susceptible to disturbances from background noise, demonstrating stronger robustness.In addition, the variation characteristics of the high-order photon coherence function of the squeezed thermal state light field under the full time-delay conditions are investigated. The full time-delay high-order coherence g(n) of the squeezed thermal state light field near the coherence time range tau STS is significantly higher than that of the classical thermal state light field.
   Even when a significant time delay is introduced into one of the optical paths, partial synchronization among photons can still maintain a certain correlation strength. Although unsynchronized photons lead to an overall reduction in coherence, the coherence is still higher than the theoretical predictions for thermal states under identical conditions.Based on the theoretical framework established in this work, future experiments may focus on adjusting the pump power, intracavity loss, and crystal temperature of optical parametric amplifiers to jointly control the squeezing degree and mean photon number, enabling stable generation of squeezed thermal states in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the precise measurement of higher-order coherence can be achieved using cascaded HBT detection systems with multiple inputs and high temporal resolution.In summary, by considering environmental noise, detection efficiency, and time delay, and by adjusting the average photon number, the number of squeezed photons, and the squeezing parameters, this method can prepare super-bunching squeezed thermal states and squeezed number states, whose higher-order coherence can be continuously adjusted over a wide range, thereby facilitating efficient quantum state preparation and manipulation, as well as high-resolution quantum imaging.

TI Theoretical research on quantum gyroscope based on frequency entangled
   biphoton and cascaded interference
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The optical gyroscope for measuring the attitude information of spatial carriers, has emerged as a research hotspot in inertial navigation system. Real-time measurement of rotation angular velocity is crucial for obtaining accurate attitude information. However, the measurement accuracy of traditional optical gyroscope is limited by the short noise limit (SNL), which restricts its further applications. Existing research indicates that the quantum technology is needed to address the measurement limitations of traditional optical gyroscopes. A triaxial rotation angular velocity measurement scheme based on frequency entangled biphoton and cascaded Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is proposed in this study. By using the Sagnac effect induced by the rotation between signal and idler photons, the triaxial angular velocity is introduced into the corresponding measurement arm of a cascaded HOM interferometer. The cascaded HOM interferogram is obtained using a coincidence measurement device, and the relationship between the symmetric dip position and the three independent time delay difference is analyzed. The characteristic parameters of HOM interferogram, including a half-height full width (FWHM) of 0.3 ps and visibilities of 1, 0.25 and 0.06, respectively, are obtained. According to quantum Fisher information theory, the maximum quantum Fisher information values of the three independent time delay differences (tau(1), tau(2), tau(3)) are calculated to be 1, 0.1, and 0.006, respectively. Furthermore, by incorporating measurement uncertainty, it is demonstrated that the accuracy of the time delay measurement can exceed the SNL. Combined with the relationship between time delay and angular velocity, the results show that the angular velocity measurement accuracy exceeds that of classical optical gyroscopes. Therefore, this scheme provides a theoretical foundation for further applying quantum gyroscopes to global navigation sensing and precision measurement systems.

TI Vibronic coupling limits the use of high-lying electronic states in
   complex molecules for laser cooling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Laser cooling of large, complex molecules is a long-standing goal, instrumental for enabling new quantum technology and precision measurements. A primary consideration for the feasibility of laser cooling, which determines the efficiency and technical requirements of the process, is the number of excited-state decay pathways leading to vibrational excitations. Therefore, the assessment of the laser-cooling potential of a molecule begins with estimate of the vibrational branching ratios of the first few electronic excited states theoretically to find the optimum cooling scheme. Such calculations, typically done within the Born-Oppenheimer and harmonic approximations, have suggested that one leading candidate for large, polyatomic molecule laser cooling, alkaline earth phenoxides, can most efficiently be laser cooled via the third electronically excited ( C) state. Here, we report the first detailed spectroscopic characterization of the C state in CaOPh and SrOPh. We find that nonadiabatic couplings between the that enable additional decay pathways. Based on the intensity ratio of these extra decay channels, we estimate a nonadiabatic coupling strength of similar to 0.1 cm-1. While this coupling strength is small, the large density of vibrational states available at photonic energy scales in a polyatomic molecule leads to significant mixing. Only the lowest excited stateA is exempt from this coupling because it is highly separated from the ground state. Thus, this result is expected to be general for large molecules and implies that only the lowest electronic excited state should be considered when judging the suitability of a molecule for laser cooling. A, B, and C states lead to substantial mixing, giving rise to vibronic states

TI Boundary-induced singularity in strongly-correlated quantum systems at
   finite temperature
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Exploring the bulk-boundary correspondences and the boundary-induced phenomena in the strongly-correlated quantum systems belongs to the most fundamental topics of condensed matter physics. In this work, we study the bulk-boundary competition in a simulative Hamiltonian, with which the thermodynamic properties of the infinite-size translationally-invariant system can be optimally mimicked. The simulative Hamiltonian is constructed by introducing local interactions on the boundaries, coined as the entanglement-bath Hamiltonian (EBH) that is analogous to the heat bath. The terms within the EBH are variationally determined by a thermal tensor network method, with coefficients varying with the temperature of the infinite-size system. By treating the temperature as an adjustable hyper-parameter of the EBH, we identify a discontinuity point of the coefficients, dubbed as the 'boundary quench point' (BQP), whose physical implication is to distinguish the point, below which the thermal fluctuations from the boundaries to the bulk become insignificant. Fruitful phenomena are revealed when considering the simulative Hamiltonian, with the EBH featuring its own hyper-parameter, under the canonical ensembles at different temperatures. Specifically, a discontinuity in bulk entropy at the BQP is observed. The exotic entropic distribution, the relations between the symmetries of Hamiltonian and BQP, and the impacts from the entanglement-bath dimension are also explored. Our results show that such a singularity differs from those in the conventional thermodynamic phase transition points that normally fall into the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. Our work provides the opportunities on exploring the exotic phenomena induced by the competition between the bulk and boundaries.

TI Frame dragging and the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip: Gravitational effects in
   multiphoton interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Applying quantum field theory on a classical, curved space-time has led to the enthralling theoretical predictions of, e.g., black hole evaporation and particle creation in the early, expanding universe. However, the prospects of observing such in the near to mid future seem far from practical. This is discouraging because extrapolation of general relativity "down to the Hilbert space level," though expected, carries no empirical support as of yet. On the other hand, fueled by the continuing developments in quantum technology, there has been growing interest in the prospect of observing more modest effects of general relativity at the level of quantum interference phenomena. Motivated by these recent developments, in this work, we investigate the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect-a two-photon quantum-interference effect-in the space-time of a rotating spherical mass. In particular, we propose and analyze a common-path setup restricted to the surface of the Earth and show that, in principle, gravitational frame dragging induces observable shifts in the two-photon HOM dip. For completeness and correspondence with current literature, we also analyze the emergence of gravitational time dilation, for a dual-arm interferometer. The formalism thus presented establishes a basis for encoding general-relativistic effects into local, multiphoton, quantum-interference experiments. We also consider signatures of noninertial reference-frame effects on two-photon interference such as, e.g., the Sagnac effect induced by Earth's rotation, which seems detectable with current quantum-optical technology. This can be viewed as a stepping-stone towards the more ambitious goal of observing gravitational frame dragging at the level of individual photons.

TI Iodine-stabilized VECSEL at 689 nm with 3 x 10-13 stability
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report frequency stabilization of a 689 nm AlGaInP-based vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) directly and exclusively to molecular iodine. Sub-Doppler saturation spectroscopy of iodine around the 689 nm wavelength region was performed to identify suitable absorption features for laser locking. Four spectral features were identified within +/- 2 GHz of the absolute frequency of the 1S0-* 3P1 transition of neutral strontium-88 atoms (434.829 THz). The VECSEL was subsequently directly locked to a transition at +1.77 GHz relative to the 1S0-* 3P1 target. The resulting iodine-locked system exhibited a linewidth of 6.2(1) kHz (4 s averaging time) as determined via beat note measurement to a reference VECSEL (integrated linewidth of similar to 400 Hz). Using the Allan deviation, minimum instability of 2.7 x 10-13 at 4 s averaging time was identified. Over a 20-minute period, the oscillation frequency of the iodine-locked system was observed to drift by only 18 kHz, compared with 88 kHz when using the conventional technique of locking to a reference cavity (finesse =1k). By stabilizing exclusively to molecular iodine-a species compatible with compact glass-blown or micro-machined cell embodiments and usage at room temperatures-the VECSEL offers potentially significant reductions in complexity for quantum technology applications reliant on addressing narrow transitions of neutral Sr atoms. Enhancement of spectroscopy signals presents future opportunities to lock more closely to the 1S0-* 3P1 target, within the range of a standard electronic modulator.

TI Molecularly Imprinted Viral Protein Integrated Zn-Cu-In-Se-P Quantum
   Dots Superlattice for Quantitative Ratiometric Electrochemical Detection
   of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in Saliva
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Solution-processable colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising materials for the development of rapid and low-cost, next-generation quantum-sensing diagnostic systems. In this study, we report on the synthesis of multinary Zn-Cu-In-Se-P (ZCISeP) QDs and the application of the QDs-modified electrode (QDs/SPCE) as a solid superlattice transducer interface for the ratiometric electrochemical detection of the SARS-CoV-2-S1 protein in saliva. The ZCISeP QDs were synthesized through the formation of In(Zn)PSe QDs from InP QDs, followed by the incorporation of Cu cations into the crystal lattice via cation exchange processes. A viral-protein-imprinted polymer film was deposited onto the QDs/SPCE for the specific binding of SARS-CoV-2. Molecular imprinting of the virus protein was achieved using a surface imprinting electropolymerization strategy to create the MIP@QDs/SPCE nanosensor. Characterization through spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrochemical techniques confirmed the structural properties and electronic-band state of the ZCISeP QDs. Cyclic voltammetry studies of the QDs/SPCE superlattice confirmed efficient electron transport properties and revealed an intraband gap energy state with redox peaks attributed to the Cu1+/2+ defects. Binding of SARS-CoV-2-S1 to the MIP@QDs/SPCE cavities induced a gating effect that modulated the Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) and Cu1+/2+ redox processes at the nanosensor interface, producing dual off/on ratiometric electrical current signals. Under optimal assay conditions, the nanosensor exhibited a wide linear detection range (0.001-100 pg/mL) and a low detection limit (0.34 pg/mL, 4.6 fM) for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2-S1 in saliva. The MIP@QDs/SPCE nanosensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against nonspecific protein targets, and the integration with a smartphone-based potentiostat confirmed the potential for point-of-care applications.

TI Complete Mapping of Interacting Charging States in Single Coupled
   Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules
SO ACS NANO
AB Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), major building blocks in modern optoelectronic devices, have so far been synthesized with only one emission center where the exciton resides. Recent development of coupled colloidal quantum dots molecules (CQDM), where two core-shell CQDs are fused to form two emission centers in close proximity, allows exploration of how charge carriers in one CQD affect the charge carriers in the other CQD. Cryogenic single particle spectroscopy reveals that while CQD monomers manifest a simple emission spectrum comprising a main emission peak with well-defined phonon sidebands, CQDMs exhibit a complex spectrum with multiple peaks that are not all spaced according to the known phonon frequencies. Based on complementary emission polarization and time-resolved analysis, this is assigned to fluorescence of the two coupled emission centers. Moreover, the complex peak structure shows correlated spectral diffusion indicative of the coupling between the two emission centers. Utilizing Schro??dinger-Poisson self-consistent calculations, we directly map the spectral behavior, alternating between neutral and charged states of the CQDM. Spectral shifts related to electrostatic interaction between a charged emission center and the second emission center are thus fully mapped. Furthermore, effects of moving surface charges are identified, whereby the emission center proximal to the charge shows larger shifts. Instances where the two emission centers are negatively charged simultaneously are also identified. Such detailed mapping of charging states is enabled by the coupling within the CQDM and its anisotropic structure. This understanding of the coupling interactions is progress toward quantum technology and sensing applications based on CQDMs.

TI Performance comparison between Chaos and quantum-chaos based image
   encryption techniques
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Today's digital era has undertaken most of the responsibilities of public and private sectors, not only the industries or big organizations dependent on the internet but individual's household needs also lying on it. To make the data transmission/reception confidential and secure for both internet users and internet service providers, a large number of researches have been done in this field. It has proved that cryptography is the best solution for solving this purpose. Mostly, digital images are continuously transferring on the network rather than texts. Enciphering a digital image is a much bulkier and a complex task. It has been evident from many types of research that chaotic logistic map-based equations provide a great level of randomness. Hence Chaotic logistic maps-based image encryption techniques (also called chaos techniques) were implemented to obtain highly random cipher images. On the other hand, time consumption must be as low as it can be possible to sustain real-time communication. Presently, the advanced encryption schemes based on quantum technology have enhanced efficiency and security because of having a large key-space and less time complexity along with randomness. The quantum-chaos based encryption is done by utilizing uncertainty principles of quantum mechanics on logistic maps. This paper is an effort to compare chaos and quantum chaos-based image encryption schemes. MATLAB 2016a software is used for the execution and the comparison is made based on various security attack analyses. Based on the study and experimental results, the quantum chaos techniques used for bit plane scrambling provides better results in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and trustworthy that can be adopted for highly secured image encryption.

TI Design and implementation of a nanoscale digital switched network for

SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In the modern era, communications and data exchanges via devices and users are fundamental to the transmission of data on networks and connections. The use of circuit-switched networks is critical in the routing of input information between the users of the network, in which high speed, low power consumption, and small area usage are important. However, it is essential to design and build low-power, high-speed devices, such as circuit-switched networks, because the implementation of these essential structures will result in a significant improvement in the overall performance efficiency of the network system structure. Furthermore, low energy consumption and limited occupied area are regarded as significant challenges in circuit-switched networks in traditional non-complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, so high-performance quantum technology must be used in order to overcome these crucial shortcomings. An emerging nanotechnology known as quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) has many potential advantages over CMOS, including a much smaller area, low energy dissipation, and fast operating speed. This paper proposes an optimized design and implementation of a QCA-based crossbar switch for transmitter and receiver circuits to create an efficient circuit-switched network. The new designs are superior to their counterparts in existing designs in that all utilize a coplanar layout that has low cell count, low latency, and low power consumption. Design and validation testing are performed using QCADesigner 2.0.3 and QCADesigner-E tools, which establish that the performance measures of the proposal have significantly improved over earlier work.

TI Optical and Spin Properties of NV Center Ensembles in Diamond
   Nano-Pillars
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond are excellent quantum sensors possessing high sensitivity and nano-scale spatial resolution. Their integration in photonic structures is often desired, since it leads to an increased photon emission and also allows the realization of solid-state quantum technology architectures. Here, we report the fabrication of diamond nano-pillars with diameters up to 1000 nm by electron beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching in nitrogen-rich diamonds (type Ib) with [100] and [111] crystal orientations. The NV centers were created by keV-He ion bombardment and subsequent annealing, and we estimate an average number of NVs per pillar to be 4300 +/- 300 and 520 +/- 120 for the [100] and [111] samples, respectively. Lifetime measurements of the NVs' excited state showed two time constants with average values of tau(1) approximate to 2 ns and tau(2) approximate to 8 ns, which are shorter as compared to a single color center in a bulk crystal (tau approximate to 10 ns). This is probably due to a coupling between the NVs as well as due to interaction with bombardment-induced defects and substitutional nitrogen (P1 centers). Optically detected magnetic resonance measurements revealed a contrast of about 5% and average coherence and relaxation times of T-2 [100] = 420 +/- 40 ns, T-2 [111] = 560 +/- 50 ns, and T-1 [100] = 162 +/- 11 mu s, T-1 [111] = 174 +/- 24 mu s. These pillars could find an application for scanning probe magnetic field imaging.

TI Model-based real-time synthesis of acousto-optically generated
   laser-beam patterns and tweezer arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) enable spatiotemporal control of laser beams through diffraction at an ultrasonic grating that is controllable by radio-frequency (rf) waveforms. These devices are a widely used tool for high-bandwidth random-access scanning applications, such as optical tweezers in quantum technology. A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one dimension. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns can be realized with two perpendicularly oriented AODs. As the acoustooptical response depends nonlinearly on the applied frequency components, phases, and amplitudes, and in addition experiences dimensional coupling in 2D setups, intensity regulation becomes a unique challenge. Guided by coupled-wave theory and experimental observations, we derive a compute-efficient model which we implement on a graphics processing unit. Only one-time sampling of single-tone laser-power calibration is needed for model parameter determination, allowing for straightforward integration into optical instruments. We implement and experimentally validate an open-loop diffraction efficiency control system that enables programmable 2D multibeam trajectories with intensity control applied at every time step during digital signal generation, overcoming the limited flexibility, pattern-size constraints, and bandwidth limitations of methods using precalculation and precalibration of a predefined pattern set or closed-loop feedback. The system is capable of stable real-time waveform streaming of arrays with up to 50 x 50 tweezers with minimal time resolution of 1.4 ns (700 MS/s) and a peak latency below 257 mu s for execution of newly requested patterns. Reactive, real-time 2D multibeam laser patterning and scanning with strict intensity matching will substantially benefit parallelization and increasing data rates in materials processing, microscopy, and applications of optical tweezers, where the work presented is of immediate relevance for time-critical conditional operations with minimal latency.

TI Intrinsic color centers in 4H-silicon carbide formed by heavy ion
   implantation and annealing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We study the generation and transformation of intrinsic luminescent centers in 4H-polytype of silicon carbide via heavy ion implantation and subsequent annealing. Defects induced by the implantation of germanium (Ge) or tin (Sn) have been characterized by photoluminescence (PL) spectra recorded at cryogenic temperatures. We find three predominant but as-yet-unidentified PL signatures (labeled as DI1-3) at the wavelength of 1002.8 nm (DI1), 1004.7 nm (DI2), and 1006.1 nm (DI3) after high dose implantation (> 4 x 10(13) cm(-2)) and high temperature annealing (> 1700 degrees C). The fact that the DI lines co-occur and are energetically close together suggest that they originate from the same defect. Regardless of the implanted ion (Ge or Sn), a sharp increase in their PL intensity is observed when the implantation damage becomes high (vacancy concentration > 10(22) cm(-3)), indicating that the lines stem from an intrinsic defect caused by the damage. By tracking the PL signals after stepwise annealing, we examine how the overall intrinsic defects behave in the temperature range of 500 - 1800 degrees C; the silicon vacancies formed by the implantation transform into either divacancies or antisite-vacancy pairs with annealing at about 1000 degrees C. These spectral signatures are strongly reduced at 1200 degrees C where the so-called TS defects are maximized in luminescence. As a final stage, the DI defects, which are most likely formed of antisites and vacancies, emerge at 1700 degrees C. Our results provide a knowledge on how to incorporate and manipulate the intrinsic luminescent centers in SiC with ion implantation and annealing, paving the way for fully integrated quantum technology employing SiC.

TI Trainability maximization using estimation of distribution algorithms
   assisted by surrogate modelling for quantum architecture search
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum architecture search (QAS) involves optimizing both the quantum parametric circuit configuration but also its parameters for a variational quantum algorithm. Thus, the problem is known to be multi-level as the performance of a given architecture is unknown until its parameters are tuned using classical routines. Moreover, the task becomes even more complicated since well-known trainability issues, e.g., barren plateaus (BPs), can occur. In this paper, we aim to achieve two improvements in QAS: (1) to reduce the number of measurements by an online surrogate model of the evaluation process that aggressively discards architectures of poor performance; (2) to avoid training the circuits when BPs are present. To detect the presence of the BPs, we employed a recently developed metric, information content, which only requires measuring the energy values of a small set of parameters to estimate the magnitude of cost function's gradient. The main idea of this proposal is to leverage a recently developed metric which can be used to detect the onset of vanishing gradients to ensure the overall search avoids such unfavorable regions. We experimentally validate our proposal for the variational quantum eigensolver and showcase that our algorithm is able to find solutions that have been previously proposed in the literature for the Hamiltonians; but also to outperform the state of the art when initializing the method from the set of architectures proposed in the literature. The results suggest that the proposed methodology could be used in environments where it is desired to improve the trainability of known architectures while maintaining good performance.

TI Analyzing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: Ansätze,
   Symmetries, and Lie Algebras
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has been proposed as a method to obtain approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization tasks. In this work, we study the underlying algebraic properties of three QAOA ans & auml;tze for the maximum-cut problem on connected graphs, while focusing on the generated Lie algebras as well as their invariant subspaces. Specifically, we analyze the standard QAOA ansatz as well as the orbit and multiangle ans & auml;tze. We are able to fully characterize the Lie algebras of the multiangle ansatz across arbitrary connected graphs, finding that they only fall into one of just six families. Aside from the cycle and path graphs, the Lie dimensions for every graph are exponentially large in the system size, meaning that multiangle ans & auml;tze are extremely prone to exhibiting barren plateaus. Then, a similar quasi-graph-independent Lie-algebraic characterization beyond the multiangle ansatz is impeded as the circuit exhibits additional "hidden" symmetries besides those naturally arising from a certain parity-superselection operator and all automorphisms of the considered graph. Disregarding the "hidden" symmetries, we can upper bound the dimensions of the orbit and the standard Lie algebras, and the dimensions of the associated invariant subspaces are determined via explicit character formulas. To finish, we conjecture that (for most graphs) the standard Lie algebras have only components that are either exponential or that grow, at most, polynomially with the system size. This would imply that the QAOA is either prone to barren plateaus or classically simulable. More generally, our work provides a symmetry framework and tools to analyze any desired variational quantum algorithm.

TI The quantum detection of projectors in finite-dimensional algebras and
   holography
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We define the computational task of detecting projectors in finite dimensional associative algebras with a combinatorial basis, labelled by representation theory data, using combinatorial central elements in the algebra. In the first example, the projectors belong to the centre of a symmetric group algebra and are labelled by Young diagrams with a fixed number of boxes n. We describe a quantum algorithm for the task based on quantum phase estimation (QPE) and obtain estimates of the complexity as a function of n. We compare to a classical algorithm related to the projector identification problem by the AdS/CFT correspondence. This gives a concrete proof of concept for classical/quantum comparisons of the complexity of a detection task, based in holographic correspondences. A second example involves projectors labelled by triples of Young diagrams, all having n boxes, with non-vanishing Kronecker coefficient. The task takes as input the projector, and consists of identifying the triple of Young diagrams. In both of the above cases the standard QPE complexities are polynomial in n. A third example of quantum projector detection involves projectors labelled by a triple of Young diagrams, with m, n and m + n boxes respectively, such that the associated Littlewood-Richardson coefficient is non-zero. The projector detection task is to identify the triple of Young diagrams associated with the projector which is given as input. This is motivated by a two-matrix model, related via the AdS/CFT correspondence, to systems of strings attached to giant gravitons. The QPE complexity in this case is polynomial in m and n.

TI Quantum Adiabatic Optimization with Rydberg Arrays: Localization
   Phenomena and Encoding Strategies
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum adiabatic optimization seeks to solve combinatorial problems using quantum dynamics, requiring the Hamiltonian of the system to align with the problem of interest. However, these Hamiltonians are often incompatible with the native constraints of quantum hardware, necessitating encoding strategies to map the original problem into a hardware-conformant form. While the classical overhead associated with such mappings is easily quantifiable and typically polynomial in problem size, it is much harder to quantify their overhead on the quantum algorithm, e.g., the transformation of the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we address this challenge on the concrete example of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which is designed to map optimization problems on arbitrarily connected graphs into Rydberg atom arrays. We consider the fundamental building blocks underlying this encoding scheme and determine the scaling of the minimum gap with system size along adiabatic protocols. Even when the original problem is trivially solvable, we find that the encoded problem can exhibit an exponentially closing minimum gap. We show that this originates from a quantum coherent effect, which gives rise to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wave function. On the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose quantum-aware modifications of the encoding scheme that avoid this quantum bottleneck and lead to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance. This highlights the crucial importance of accounting for quantum effects when designing strategies to encode classical problems onto quantum platforms.

TI Post-Quantum Cryptosystems for Internet-of-Things: A Survey on
   Lattice-Based Algorithms
SO IOT
AB The latest quantum computers have the ability to solve incredibly complex classical cryptography equations particularly to decode the secret encrypted keys and making the network vulnerable to hacking. They can solve complex mathematical problems almost instantaneously compared to the billions of years of computation needed by traditional computing machines. Researchers advocate the development of novel strategies to include data encryption in the post-quantum era. Lattices have been widely used in cryptography, somewhat peculiarly, and these algorithms have been used in both; (a) cryptoanalysis by using lattice approximation to break cryptosystems; and (b) cryptography by using computationally hard lattice problems (non-deterministic polynomial time hardness) to construct stable cryptographic functions. Most of the dominant features of lattice-based cryptography (LBC), which holds it ahead in the post-quantum league, include resistance to quantum attack vectors, high concurrent performance, parallelism, security under worst-case intractability assumptions, and solutions to long-standing open problems in cryptography. While these methods offer possible security for classical cryptosytems in theory and experimentation, their implementation in energy-restricted Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices requires careful study of regular lattice-based implantation and its simplification in lightweight lattice-based cryptography (LW-LBC). This streamlined post-quantum algorithm is ideal for levelled IoT device security. The key aim of this survey was to provide the scientific community with comprehensive information on elementary mathematical facts, as well as to address real-time implementation, hardware architecture, open problems, attack vectors, and the significance for the IoT networks.

TI Shuffle-QUDIO: accelerate distributed VQE with trainability enhancement
   and measurement reduction
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a leading strategy that exploits noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines to tackle chemical problems. It is expected to demonstrate quantum advantage when handling a large number of qubits, where the density matrix cannot be processed efficiently on classical computers. To gain such computational advantages on large-scale problems, a feasible solution is the QUantum DIstributed Optimization (QUDIO) scheme, which partitions the original problem into K \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\varvec{K}$$\end{document} subproblems and allocates them to K \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\varvec{K}$$\end{document} quantum machines followed by the parallel optimization. Despite the provable acceleration ratio, the efficiency of QUDIO may heavily degrade by the synchronization operation. To conquer this issue, here we propose Shuffle-QUDIO to involve shuffle operations into local Hamiltonians during the quantum distributed optimization. Compared with QUDIO, Shuffle-QUDIO significantly reduces the communication frequency among quantum processors and simultaneously achieves better trainability. Particularly, we prove that Shuffle-QUDIO enables a faster convergence rate over QUDIO. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify that Shuffle-QUDIO allows both a wall-clock time speedup and low approximation error in the tasks of estimating the ground state energy of a molecule. We empirically demonstrate that our proposal can be seamlessly integrated with other acceleration techniques, such as operator grouping, to further improve the efficacy of VQE.

TI Enhancing the Quantum Linear Systems Algorithm Using Richardson
   Extrapolation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We present a quantum algorithm to solve systems of linear equations of the form Ax = b, where A is a tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix and b results from discretizing an analytic function, with a circuit complexity of O(1/root is an element of, poly(log kappa, log N)), where N denotes the number of equations,. is the accuracy, and. the condition number. The repeat-until-success algorithm has to be run O (kappa/(1 -is an element of)) times to succeed, leveraging amplitude amplification, and needs to be sampled O( 1/is an element of(2)) times. Thus, the algorithm achieves an exponential improvement with respect to N over classical methods. In particular, we present efficient oracles for state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and a set of observables together with the corresponding error and complexity analyses. As the main result of this work, we show how to use Richardson extrapolation to enhance Hamiltonian simulation, resulting in an implementation of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) within the algorithm with 1/root is an element of circuits that can be run in parallel each with circuit complexity 1/root is an element of instead of 1/is an element of. Furthermore, we analyze necessary conditions for the overall algorithm to achieve an exponential speedup compared to classical methods. Our approach is not limited to the considered setting and can be applied to more general problems where Hamiltonian simulation is approximated via product formulae, although our theoretical results would need to be extended accordingly. All the procedures presented are implemented with Qiskit and tested for small systems using classical simulation as well as using real quantum devices available through the IBM Quantum Experience.

TI Two superconducting thin films systems with potential integration of
   different quantum functionalities
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computation based on superconducting circuits utilizes superconducting qubits with Josephson junctions (JJs). Engineering high-coherence qubits requires materials optimization. In this work, we present two superconducting thin film systems, grown on silicon (Si), and one obtained from the other via annealing. Cobalt (Co) thin films grown on Si were found to be superconducting (Banu et al 2020 Europhys. Lett. 131 47001). These films also happen to be a self-organized hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) structure. Here we present our results on the superconductivity of a hybrid Co film followed by the superconductivity of a CoSi2 film, which was prepared by annealing the Co film. The hybrid Co film revealed superconducting transition temperature Tc = 5 K and anisotropy in the upper critical field between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The anisotropy is of the order of ratio of lateral dimensions to thickness of the superconducting Co grains, suggesting a quasi-2D nature of superconductivity. On the other hand, CoSi2 film showed a Tc = 900 mK. In the resistivity vs temperature curve, we observe a peak near Tc. Magnetic field scan as a function of T shows a monotonic increase in intensity of this peak with temperature. The origin of the peak has been explained in terms of a parallel resistive model for the particular measurement configuration. Although our CoSi2 film contains grain boundaries, we observed a perpendicular critical field of 15 mT and a critical current density of 3.8x107 Am-2, comparable to epitaxial CoSi2 films. The S/F/S hybrids are important for superconducting pi-qubits (Yamashita et al 2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 097001). For conventional qubits, with S/I(insulator)/S JJs, Al is the commonly used superconducting material. CoSi2, with its 1/f noise two-to-three orders of magnitude smaller compared to Al (Chiu et al 2017 ACS Nano 11 516), is a promising material for high-coherence qubits. Localized annealing by laser pulses, could additionally provide the capability of integrating the functionalities of both S/F/S and S/I/S junctions on the same substrate.

TI Design of Hollow-Core Anti-Resonant Fibers Supporting Few Weakly Coupled
   Polarization-Maintaining Modes
SO PHOTONICS
AB A nested semi-tube hollow-core anti-resonant fiber (HC-ARF) that can support the high-purity transmission of a few polarization-maintaining modes is designed in this paper. By employing bi-thickness hybrid silica/silicon anti-resonant tubes, the birefringence of the orthogonal polarized modes is significantly improved, and the weak coupling condition of the five lowest-order polarization maintaining modes, including the LP01_x, LP01_y, LP11a_x, LP11b_x, and LP11a_y, can be met. The effective refractive index difference between each pair of the supported adjacent modes is larger than 1.0 x 10-4. With hybrid multi-layer nested semi-tubes, the confinement losses of the supported modes are all less than 1.50 x 10-1 dB/m within a transmission band from 1.530 to 1.620 mu m. The minimum confinement losses of the LP01_y, LP01_x, LP11a_y, LP11a_x, and LP11b_x modes are 3.71 x 10-4 dB/m, 1.61 x 10-3 dB/m, 2.00 x 10-2 dB/m, 1.30 x 10-1 dB/m, and 4.20 x 10-2 dB/m, respectively. Meanwhile, the unwanted higher-order modes are filtered out well to guarantee the modal purity. The minimum higher-order-mode extinction ratio of the lowest-loss LP21 mode to the highest-loss LP11 mode remains larger than 139 from 1.545 to 1.615 mu m. The numerical results highlight the potential of the proposed polarization-maintaining few-mode hollow-core anti-resonant fibers in many application fields, such as short-range and high-capacity data transmission networks, fiber sensing systems, quantum communication systems, and so on.

TI Droplet epitaxy symmetric InAs/InP quantum dots for quantum emission in
   the third telecom window: morphology, optical and electronic properties
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The rapidly developing quantum communication technology requires deterministic quantum emitters that can generate single photons and entangled photon pairs in the third telecom window, in order to be compatible with existing optical fiber networks and on-chip silicon photonic processors. InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs) are among the leading candidates for this purpose, due to their high emission efficiency in the required spectral range. However, fabricating versatile InAs/InP QD-based quantum emitters is challenging, especially as these QDs typically have asymmetric profiles in the growth plane, resulting in a substantial bright-exciton fine structure splitting (FSS). This hinders the generation of entangled photon pairs and thus, compromises the versatility of InAs/InP QDs. We overcome this by implementing droplet epitaxy (DE) synthesis of low surface density (2.8 x 10(8) cm(-2)) InAs x P1-x  QDs with x = (80 +/- 15)% on an (001)-oriented InP substrate. The resulting QDs are located in etched pits, have concave bases, and most importantly, have symmetric in-plane profiles. We provide an analytical model to explain the kinetics of pit formation and QD base shape modification. Our theoretical calculations of electronic states reveal the properties of neutral and charged excitons and biexcitons confined in such QDs, which agree with the optical investigations of individual QDs. The optical response of QDs' ensemble suggests that FSS may indeed be negligible, as reflected in the vanishing degree of linear polarization. However, single QD spectrum gathered from an etched mesa shows moderate FSS of (50 +/- 5) mu eV that we link to destructive changes made in the QD environment during the post-growth processing. Finally, we show that the studied DE QDs provide a close-to-ideal single-photon emission purity of (92.5 +/- 7.5)% in the third telecom window.

AB Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) based sensors and systems enable a variety of applications in biomedical, automotive, consumer, and security domains. While several established standard technologies, which can facilitate the design of SPAD-based systems are already in existence, challenges remain for the development of deep sub-micron monolithic integration of circuits and SPADs. In this work, we present SPADs along with pixel circuits in a standard GF 55 nm BCDL process. Two different designs demonstrate the flexibility allowed by the technology for a variety of applications. Both shallow and deep junction SPADs present excellent noise performance of less than 1 cps/mu m(2) at 3 V excess bias. An integrated passive-quench active-recharge (PQAR) circuit is used in conjunction with the SPADs, which enables a dead time of less than 2 ns, easily allowing for high dynamic range applications that require > 100 Mcps such as quantum communication and information technologies. The deep and shallow junction SPADs demonstrate an afterpulsing probability of < 0.5 % and < 2 % at 3V excess bias, respectively. The dead time is adjustable through analog control of the active-recharge circuit, allowing for afterpulsing reduction to below 0.1 % while maintaining Mcps operation. The shallow junction, which has a breakdown voltage of about 18 V and a peak sensitivity at 430 nm is particularly interesting for applications requiring low supply voltage, whereas the deep SPAD, which demonstrates > 4 % photon detection probability (PDP) at 940 nm, can be implemented in LiDAR sensors that require enhanced sensitivity at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The measured timing jitter of both SPADs is < 50 ps FWHM at 3 V excess bias and 780 nm.

TI High-efficiency polarization-insensitive superconducting nanowire single
   photon detector
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) has been widely used in many fields such as quantum communication due to its extremely high detection efficiency, low dark count rate, high count rate, and low timing jitter. Compared with conventional single-photon detectors with planar structure, SNSPD is typically made a periodical meandering structure consisting of parallel straight nanowires. However, owing to its unique linear structure, the detection efficiency of SNSPD is dependent on the polarization state of incident light, thus limiting SNSPD's applications in unconventional fiber links or other incoherent light detection. In this paper, a polarization-insensitive SNSPD with high detection efficiency is proposed based on the traditional meandering nanowire structure. A thin silicon film with a high refractive index is introduced as a cladding layer of nanowires to reduce the dielectric mismatch between the nanowire and its surroundings, thereby improving the optical absorption efficiency of nanowires to the transverse-magnetic (TM) polarized incident light. The cladding layer is designed as a sinusoidal-shaped grating structure to minimize the difference in optical absorption efficiency between the transverse electric (TE) polarized incident light and the TM polarized incident light in a wide wavelength range. In addition, the twin-layer nanowire structure and the dielectric mirror are used to improve the optical absorption efficiency of the device. Our simulation results show that with the optimal parameters, the optical absorption efficiency of nanowires to both of the TE polarized incident light and TM polarized incident light has a maximum of over 90% at 1550 nm, and the corresponding polarization extinction ratio is less than 1.22. The fabricated device possesses a maximum detection efficiency of 87% at 1605 nm and a polarization extinction ratio of 1.06. The measured detection efficiency exceeds 50% with a polarization extinction ratio less than 1.2 in a wavelength range from 1505 nm to 1630 nm. This work provides a reference for high-efficiency polarization-insensitive SNSPD in the future.

TI Comparative Analysis of Energy Costs of Asymmetric vs Symmetric
   Encryption-Based Security Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Public key algorithms are heavily used in many digital applications including key establishment schemes, secure messaging apps, and digital signature schemes in cryptocurrencies. Recent developments in the field of quantum computation have placed these algorithms at risk as they enable the implementation of more effective attacks to derive the secret key. Most notably Shor's algorithm exponentially speeds up solving the factoring, discrete logarithm (DLP), and elliptic-curve discrete logarithm (ECDLP) problems. To address this challenge, NIST has initiated a process to develop and standardize a new quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithm. However, asymmetric encryption schemes are known to be computationally intensive, hence energy demanding. The proliferation of energy-constrained internet of things devices, combined with the need to adopt higher complexity quantum resilient cryptographic algorithms, makes it more challenging to continue to use public-key algorithms for all applications. One approach to address these challenges is to adopt symmetric key systems, which are known to be more energy-efficient and more resilient to quantum computers-based attacks. This work performs a comprehensive comparison of energy costs between asymmetric and symmetric key schemes. This comparison is performed using two methods. The first approach uses the energy cost of data usage (ECDU) metric to evaluate the global energy costs associated with internet data usage. It was found that the annual energy consumed by applications associated with public-key cryptography globally is sufficient to provide electricity for 1000 UK households for a year. The second method uses an experimental technique based on constructing a small-scale network of wireless embedded devices. This is subsequently used to compare two key establishment schemes, symmetric and asymmetric, which allows for comparing the computation and communication costs of each solution in a controlled environment, and more importantly estimating the energy consumed by each device participating in the protocol. Our results show that a 58% saving in global energy costs of public key-based applications can be achieved by adopting symmetric key systems. It was also found that a 20% reduction of the energy consumed by a wireless device during a key agreement protocol, can be achieved if symmetric key encryption is used.

TI Design of resonant cavity for linear cavity single frequency fiber laser
   based on temperature controlled Fiber Bragg grating
SO PLOS ONE
AB In response to the limited tuning ability of traditional linear cavity single frequency fiber lasers caused by fixed cavity length and static feedback mechanism, a resonant cavity design for linear cavity single frequency fiber lasers based on temperature controlled fiber gratings is proposed. It achieves synergistic improvement in linewidth compression, power stability, and tuning range through thermal optical coupling modeling and intelligent algorithm collaborative search. The experimental results show that the average line width of the proposed scheme is 0.86 Hz (compared to 1.97 Hz and 1.59 Hz in the comparative scheme), the average tuning range is 38.0 nm (compared to 22.3 nm and 12.5 nm in the comparative scheme), and the average steady-state temperature control error is 0.81 degrees C (compared to 2.08 degrees C and 1.74 degrees C in the comparative scheme). Its average anti vibration offset is 0.75 kHz/g (compared to 2.67 kHz/g and 1.86 kHz/g in the comparative scheme), and its average photoelectric conversion efficiency is 57.60% (compared to 48.85% and 52.24% in the comparative scheme). In addition, the average floating-point computational cost of this scheme is 30.9 G (compared to 65.4 G and 40.7 G in the comparison scheme), the average running energy consumption is 13.1 W center dot h (compared to 66.9 W center dot h and 34.7 W center dot h in the comparison scheme), and the average memory usage is 24.92% (compared to 44.3% and 39.62% in the comparison scheme). It outperforms the comparative scheme in key indicators. The proposed dynamic tuning and multi-objective optimization platform can enhance the comprehensive performance boundary of lasers in complex environments, providing a highly stable light source design solution for precision spectral measurement, high-resolution sensing, and quantum communication fields.

TI Stable and Reduced-Linewidth Laser Through Active Cancellation of
   Reflections Without a Magneto-Optic Isolator
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrating photonics with CMOS electronics in silicon is essential to enable chip-scale, electronic-photonic systems that will revolutionize classical and quantum communication and computing systems. However, the lack of an on-silicon isolator, capable of blocking unwanted back reflections and ensuring the stable operation of the laser, precluded many previous demonstrations from providing single-chip solutions. For most optical systems employing a laser, magneto-optic isolators have been indispensable, but such isolators are incompatible with silicon. To stabilize on-chip lasers, reflections-cancellation circuits were proposed as a way to reduce the reflections going back to the laser. Yet, a stable laser against time-varying back reflections was never demonstrated. Here we demonstrate a stable quantum well-distributed feedback (QWDFB) laser against slowly time-varying reflections using a reflections-cancellation circuit (RCC) on a foundry-produced, silicon-photonic (SiP) chip. The optical spectrum and the relative intensity noise (RIN) of the laser when the RCC was running is comparable to when an isolator was used. By accurately locking the laser in a stable optical feedback regime, the RCC further enhances the QWDFB laser performance by reducing its linewidth by a factor of 100, down to 3 kHz. Both results are enabled using novel techniques in the design, calibration, tuning, and control of the proposed SiP RCC. The optical insertion loss of the RCC is less than 1.5 dB for reflections smaller than -20 dB and can yield isolation ranges of up to 64 dB. Our device paves the way towards the mass production of fully integrated, low-cost electronic-photonic silicon chips without attaching magneto-optic isolators between the laser and the SiP chip.

AB If G is a group, we say a subset S of G is product-free if the equation xy = z has no solutions with x,y,z is an element of S. For D is an element of N, a group G is said to be D-quasirandom if the minimal dimension of a nontrivial complex irreducible representation of G is at least D. Gowers showed that in a D-quasirandom finite group G, the maximal size of a product-free set is at most |G|/D-1/3. This disproved a longstanding conjecture of Babai and Sos from 1985.
   For the special unitary group, G=SU(n), Gowers observed that his argument yields an upper bound of n(-1/3) on the measure of a measurable product-free subset. In this paper, we improve Gowers upper bound to exp(-cn(1/3)), where c > 0 is an absolute constant. In fact, we establish something stronger, namely, product-mixing for measurable subsets of SU(n) with measure at least exp(-cn(1/3)); for this product-mixing result, the n(1/3) in the exponent is sharp.
   Our approach involves introducing novel hypercontractive inequalities, which imply that the non-Abelian Fourier spectrum of the indicator function of a small set concentrates on high-dimensional irreducible representations. Our hypercontractive inequalities are obtained via methods from representation theory, harmonic analysis, random matrix theory and differential geometry. We generalize our hypercontractive inequalities from SU(n) to an arbitrary D-quasirandom compact connected Lie group for D at least an absolute constant, thereby extending our results on product-free sets to such groups.
   We also demonstrate various other applications of our inequalities to geometry (viz., non-Abelian Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities), mixing times, and the theory of growth in compact Lie groups. A subsequent work due to Arunachalam, Girish and Lifshitz uses our inequalities to establish new separation results between classical and quantum communication complexity.

TI Switching on Dark Excitons in WSe2 Monolayer at Room
   Temperature with Plasmonic Au Nanodisk-on-Mirror Cavities
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Dark excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers (MLs) are promising candidates for Bose-Einstein condensation and quantum information processing owing to their long lifetime. Previous studies employing nanoparticle-on-mirror and tip-on-mirror cavities have successfully enabled room-temperature dark exciton emissions through the Purcell effect. However, these approaches suffer from mode complexity, the geometric variability of the contact facet, and the extreme precision of the tip spacing, which limit further control over emission intensities. Herein, the switching-on of dark excitons in WSe2 ML at room temperature is demonstrated using plasmonic Au nanodisk-on-mirror cavities with the ML sandwiched in between. The hybrid structures combine simplicity, reproducibility, and flexible control over the dark exciton emission intensity. The dark exciton emissions are controlled by two orthogonal plasmon modes with strongly confined out-of-plane-polarized electric field and can be switched on and off. The emission intensity ratio between dark excitons and bright excitons is enhanced up to 22 times by flexibly controlling the nanodisk diameter to match the plasmon energy to the dark exciton energy. The plasmonic nanodisk-on-mirror cavities feature enlarged field enhancement, narrowed mode linewidths, and precise geometry, providing a facile platform for switching on and controlling dark exciton emissions in TMDC MLs under readily accessible conditions.

TI Measurements of the amplitude-dependent microwave surface resistance of
   an Au/Nb bilayer
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Surface properties are critical to the capabilities of superconducting microwave devices. The native oxide of niobium-based devices is thought to consist of a thin normal conducting layer. To improve understanding on the importance of this layer, an attempt was made to replace it with a more easily controlled gold film. A niobium sample host microwave cavity was used to measure the surface resistance in continuous wave operation at 4.0GHz and 5.2GHz . Sample conditions studied include temperatures ranging from 1.6K to 4.2K with RF magnetic fields on the sample surface ranging from similar to 1 mT to the maximum field before the superconducting properties were lost (quench field). The nominal film thickness of the gold layer was increased from 0.1nm to 2.0nm in five steps to study the impact of the normal layer thickness on surface resistance on a single niobium substrate. The 0.1nm film was found to reduce the surface resistance of the sample and to enhance the quench field. With the exception of the final step from a 1.5nm gold film to 2.0nm , the magnitude of the surface resistance increased substantially with gold film thickness. The nature of the surface resistance field-dependence appeared to be roughly independent from the gold layer thickness. This initial study provides new perspectives and suggests avenues for optimizing and designing surfaces for resonant cavities in particle accelerators and quantum information applications.

TI On-Surface Synthesis of Edge-Extended Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have gained significant attention in nanoelectronics due to their potential for precise tuning of electronic properties through variations in edge structure and ribbon width. However, the synthesis of GNRs with highly sought-after zigzag edges (ZGNRs), critical for spintronics and quantum information technologies, remains challenging. In this study, a design motif for synthesizing a novel class of GNRs termed edge-extended ZGNRs is presented. This motif enables the controlled incorporation of edge extensions along the zigzag edges at regular intervals. The synthesis of a specific GNR instance-a 3-zigzag-rows-wide ZGNR-with bisanthene units fused to the zigzag edges on alternating sides of the ribbon axis is successfully demonstrated. The resulting edge-extended 3-ZGNR is comprehensively characterized for its chemical structure and electronic properties using scanning probe techniques, complemented by density functional theory calculations. The design motif showcased here opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a diverse range of edge-extended ZGNRs, expanding the structural landscape of GNRs and facilitating the exploration of their structure-dependent electronic properties.
   In this study, a new design motif is introduced to synthesize edge-extended zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). Using scanning probe techniques and density functional theory, the chemical structure and electronic characteristics of a 3-zigzag-row ZGNR instance are confirmed. This approach expands the range of possible ZGNRs, contributing to further understanding of structure-dependent electronic properties in GNRs.image

TI Atomic manufacturing of advanced materials
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB When the dimension of matter is reduced from the three dimensions to low dimensions or even single-atom scale, distinctive features can be observed, indicating broad application prospects in variety fields, such as energy storage and conversion, topological nanocomponents, and semiconductors. Developing smaller-scale, higher-precision manufacturing methods can greatly improve material properties, utilization, and integration, resulting in more efficient and smarter products and systems. Nanomanufacturing has made remarkable progress over the past decades. However, it faces enormous technical obstacles in going from the nanoscale to the atomic scale of the product size and production precision. At the right time, atomic manufacturing emerges, in which atoms are directly manipulated by physical assembly or chemical reaction. Atomic manufacturing presents a novel manufacturing approach that uses atoms as the basic unit and guides their construction or reaction on demand by managing their interactions. As a result, obtaining atomically exact products is a corollary of atomic manufacturing. Furthermore, atomic manufacturing is not simply a scale and precision extension of nanomanufacturing, but the direct manipulation of atoms to produce novel materials, devices, and systems. This manufacturing capability will make it easier to reveal deep mechanisms, which will guide the achievement of accurate material synthesis and performance modification on demand.
   Physical assembly and chemical reaction are the two broad categories of atomic manufacturing strategies. The former mainly uses probes or electron beams to manipulate atomic assembly or rearrangement, whereas the later directs atoms to react in a specified direction. Although the product can be obtained exactly, the efficiency of physical approaches is far too low for most practical applications such as catalysis, batteries, biomedicine, and so on. As a result, this review describes the implementation of atomic manufacturing from a structural design standpoint in single atoms, atom clusters, two-dimensional materials, and high-entropy alloys, with a focus on summarizing the atomic manufacturing process achieved through bottom-up manufacturing using a chemical approach and elucidating the scientific principles involved. Low-dimensional materials have a limited number of atoms in certain dimensions. Because of this structural feature, their properties are particularly sensitive to atom number, arrangement, position, and so on. High-entropy alloys necessitate the atomic-scale combination of multimetallic components. Atomic manufacturing is the only way to achieve the precise fabrication of these materials' structures and features. As a result, these materials provide an appropriate materials research platform for atomic production.
   Atomic manufacturing has ushered in a new era of study into these advanced materials, spawning a slew of new research avenues such as novel quantum information devices, electronic/optoelectronic/spin devices, and energy storage and conversion devices. These applications require atomic-level control of materials and device architectures. This review focused on the precise synthesis of materials and devices at the atomic level, highlights the benefits and significance of atomic manufacturing with examples from emerging advanced application domains. Atomic-level functional materials and devices for quantum information technology, two-dimensional materials with unique properties for semiconductor devices, and catalysts with specific chemical environments for energy conversion are among the uses.
   At present, atomic manufacturing is in its early stages and confronts numerous hurdles. This review summarizes the current progress and puts forward the future development direction of atomic manufacturing.

TI Nonlinear Behavior Research Based on Hybrid Spinning Optomechanical
   System
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Optomechanical systems are a research topic that has been proposed in recent years and has attracted the attention of many researchers. In many optomechanical systems, the radiation pressure-induced optomechanical interactions will lead to phonon modes, which in turn affects the optical properties and then results in remarkable quantum interference effects. Therefore, many important breakthroughs have been achieved in optomechanical systems, such as cooling of mechanical resonators, quantum entanglement, optomechanically induced transparency, optical bistability, fourwave mixing, and so on. The radiation pressure-induced breathing mode oscillations of the boundary of the resonator play a key role in the nonlinear phenomena. However, the possible role of rotation of the resonator itself has not been explored. In a rotating device, an additional phase is accumulated for the propagating light, which is called the optical Sagnac effect. A non-reciprocal optical transmission with an isolation of 99.6% is achieved using a rotating optical cavity in a recent experiment. Subsequently, hybrid spinning optomechanical systems have been extensively studied, and several remarkable phenomena have been founded including nonreciprocal photon blockades, nanoparticle sensing, and slow and fast light. However, optical bistability and four-wave mixing have not yet been explored in hybrid spinning optomechanical systems.
   Methods In this paper, a hybrid spinning optomechanical system driven by a probe laser and pump laser is built to study optical bistability and four-wave mixing, and the composition of the system is analyzed and the definition of each parameter is explained. The drive light entering the system enters from the left side of the fiber and travels clockwise through the optical cavity. The clockwise and counterclockwise modes of the optical cavity experience Sagnac-Fizeau shifts. According to the obtained Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg equation of motion, factorization, and other methods are used to solve it, and relational expressions describing optical bistability and four- wave mixing can be established. Finally, the influence of additional phonon pumping on the four-wave mixing of the system is discussed, and it is found that a small external force is applied, and the four-wave mixing spectral line of the system changes significantly.
   Results and Discussions The study shows that different properties of optical bistability and four- wave mixing can be observed in the hybrid spinning optomechanical system under different parameter mechanisms. When the optical cavity rotates clockwise, the pump power required to observe the optical bistability is relatively large with the increase in rotation rate. In the case of large pump drive power, when the positive rotation rate increases, the upper stable branch of the corresponding bistable curve increases. This result is reversed when the optical cavity rotates counterclockwise ( Fig. 3). In case of no external force and no rotation, two symmetrical peaks appear in the four-wave mixing spectrum, and the mode splitting phenomenon occurs at the resonance. When the optical cavity rotates clockwise, the peak value of the fourwave mixing spectrum will increase, and the mode splitting phenomenon will disappear. When the optical cavity rotates counterclockwise, the peak value of the four-wave mixing spectrum will decrease, and the mode splitting phenomenon gets obvious ( Fig. 4). With the increase of the rotation rate when the optical cavity rotates clockwise, the peak value of the four- wave mixing spectrum will gradually decrease, while the mode splitting phenomenon will emerge. From here, the critical value for distinguishing whether pattern splitting occurs at resonances when the optical cavity rotates clockwise can be determined. With the increase of the rotation rate when the optical cavity rotates counterclockwise, the peak value of the four- wave mixing spectrum will decrease, and the mode splitting phenomenon gets obvious (Fig. 5). In case of a small external force and rotation rate, two symmetrical peaks become asymmetrical. With the increase of the external force when the optical cavity is at a fixed rotation rate, the peak value of the four-wave mixing spectrum will increase significantly, and there is no pattern splitting at the resonance (Fig. 6). However, whether the optical cavity rotates clockwise or counterclockwise, under the same external force, the peak value of the four-wave mixing spectrum will decrease, and the reduced energy is used for pattern splitting at the resonance (Fig. 7).
   Conclusions In this paper, based on the optomechanical systems, a hybrid spinning optomechanical system is proposed. By controlling the rotation speed and direction of the optomechanical cavity, the frequency shift induced by the rotation and the optical bistable behavior can be controlled effectively. The results indicate that the rotating direction and rotation rate of the optomechanical cavity affect the four- wave mixing intensity of the system. The decrease or increase of the four-wave mixing intensity will enhance or suppress the mode splitting phenomenon in the resonance region of the system. The external force will destroy the symmetry of the four-wave mixing spectrum. Moreover, the increase of external force will significantly increase the intensity of the four- wave mixing at a fixed rotation rate. However, under the same external force, the increase of rotation rate will reduce the four-wave mixing intensity of the system. Although the optical bistability and four-wave mixing phenomena have been studied in some optical systems, these two phenomena have not yet been analyzed in spinning optomechanical systems, and the study of nonlinear optical properties of hybrid spinning optomechanical systems will have potential applications in quantum information networks.

TI Hybrid-quantum approach for the optimal lockdown to stop the SARS-CoV-2
   community spread subject to maximising nation economy globally
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (severe acute respiratory corona virus 2 syndromes) has caused major impacts on a global scale. Several countries, including India, Europe, U.S.A., introduced a full state/nation lockdown to minimise the disease transmission through human interaction after the virus entered the population and to minimise the loss of human life. Millions of people have gone unemployed due to lockdown implementation, resulting in business and industry closure and leading to a national economic slowdown. Therefore, preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the world while also preserving the global economy is an essential problem requiring an effective and immediate solution. Using the compartmental epidemiology S, E, I, R or D (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovery or Death) model extended to multiple population regions, the authors predict the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 disease and construct an optimally scheduled lockdown calendar to execute lockdown over phases, using the well-known Knapsack problem. A comparative analysis of both classical and quantum models shows that our model decreases SARS-CoV-2 active cases while retaining the average global economic factor, Gross Domestic Product, in contrast to the scenario with no lockdown.

TI High-order Poincaré beams generated by a dual-rings metasurface with
   orthogonal slit pairs
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The generation and manipulation of high-order Poincar & eacute; (HOP) beams with metasurfaces have attracted wide attention and holds promise for applications in classical physics and quantum science. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that a dual-rings metasurface composed of orthogonal slit pairs whose orientation varies with azimuth enables the generation of the HOP beams. The assumed novelty of this metasurface design lies in the combination of the geometric phase introduced by the rotation of slit pairs and the propagation phase introduced by the gap between two constituent slits of slit pairs, which realizes the elimination of co-polarized component and the superposition of cross-polarized component in the output fields. By controlling the orientation of the nano-slit pairs and adjusting the polarization states of incident light, the superposition of two orthogonal cross-polarized components with equal but opposite topological charges are realized, and correspondingly, the vector beam at an arbitrary point on the HOP sphere is generated. The principles and designs of metasurface are demonstrated by the finite-difference time domain simulation. The evolutions of satisfying quality HOP beams are investigated and experimentally verified. This work will be of significance for the applications of vector beams in different areas, such as precision metrology, optical micro-manipulation, and quantum information.

TI A hyperfine-transition-referenced vector spectrum analyzer for
   visible-light integrated photonics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Integrated photonics has been successfully established in the near-infrared (NIR) telecommunication bands. With the soaring demand in biosensing, quantum information and transportable atomic clocks, extensive endeavors have been stacked on translating integrated photonics into the visible spectrum. Demonstrations of visible-light lasers, frequency combs, and atom traps highlight the prospect of creating chip-based optical atomic clocks that can make timing and metrology ubiquitous. A pillar to the development of visible-light integrated photonics is characterization techniques featuring high frequency resolution and wide spectral coverage, which however remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate a vector spectrum analyzer (VSA) for visible-light integrated photonics, offering spectral bandwidth of 766-795 and 518-541 nm. The VSA is rooted in widely chirping, high-power, narrow-linewidth, mode-hop-free lasers that are frequency-doubled from the near-infrared via efficient, broadband CPLN waveguides. The VSA is further referenced to hyperfine structures of alkaline atoms and iodine molecules, enabling megahertz frequency accuracy. We apply our VSA to showcase the characterization of loss, dispersion and phase response of passive integrated devices, as well as densely spaced spectra of mode-locked lasers. Leveraging individual operations at 518-541, 766-795, 1020-1098, and 1260-1640 nm bands, our VSA achieves an aggregate characterization bandwidth exceeding one octave. This capability establishes the VSA as an invaluable diagnostic tool for spectroscopy, nonlinear optical processing, imaging, and quantum interfaces with atomic systems.

TI High-performance Kerr microresonator optical parametric oscillator on a
   silicon chip
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Flexible and coherent light generation is of paramount importance to enable new functionalities in integrated silicon photonics. Here the authors, develop an optical parametric oscillator with high conversion efficiency and high output power, based on the third order nonlinearity in a silicon nitride microresonator
   Optical parametric oscillation (OPO) is distinguished by its wavelength access, that is, the ability to flexibly generate coherent light at wavelengths that are dramatically different from the pump laser, and in principle bounded solely by energy conservation between the input pump field and the output signal/idler fields. As society adopts advanced tools in quantum information science, metrology, and sensing, microchip OPO may provide an important path for accessing relevant wavelengths. However, a practical source of coherent light should additionally have high conversion efficiency and high output power. Here, we demonstrate a silicon photonics OPO device with unprecedented performance. Our OPO device, based on the third-order (chi((3))) nonlinearity in a silicon nitride microresonator, produces output signal and idler fields widely separated from each other in frequency ( > 150 THz), and exhibits a pump-to-idler conversion efficiency up to 29 % with a corresponding output idler power of > 18 mW on-chip. This performance is achieved by suppressing competitive processes and by strongly overcoupling the output light. This methodology can be readily applied to existing silicon photonics platforms with heterogeneously-integrated pump lasers, enabling flexible coherent light generation across a broad range of wavelengths with high output power and efficiency.

TI An effective approach for real-time drowsy driving prediction using
   quantized fisher-Gabor features and latent-dynamic conditional random
   fields
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Driver drowsiness or fatigue is among the most important factors that cause traffic accidents; therefore, a monitoring system is necessary to detect the state of a driver drowsiness or fatigue. In this paper, an automated vision-based system for real-time prediction of driver drowsiness or fatigue is presented, in which multiple visual ocular features such as eye closure, eyebrow shape, eye blinking, and other perfectly defined geometric facial features are employed as robust cues for driver's drowsiness. In addition, an efficient scheme is applied to extract local Gabor features of driver images based on Fisher's quantum information. A novel Fisher-Gabor descriptor (FGD) is then constructed from the extracted features, which is invariant to scale and rotation and also robust to changes in illumination, noise, and minor changes in viewpoint. The normalized FGDs are ultimately fed to a Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Field (LDCRF) classification model to predict whether the driver is drowsy/fatigued and a warning signal is thus issued (if required). A series of intensive experiments conducted on the benchmark NTHU-DDD video dataset show that the proposed system can predict driver drowsiness or fatigue effectively and efficiently, exceeding several state-of-the art alternatives by achieving a competitive detection accuracy of 97.6%, while still preserving stringent real-time guarantees.

TI Crystal growth and magnetic evolution of antiferromagnetic topological
   insulator Zn-doped MnBi2Te4
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB As the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, MnBi2Te4 has provided a material platform for the realization of various novel physical phenomena arising from the interaction between magnetism and band topology. Here, transition element Zn-doped MnBi2Te4 crystals of millimeter size, synthesized by using self-flux method, are reported. With increasing Zn content, the hexagonal lattice shrinks, and the Raman frequencies show a red shift. All samples undergo a transition from A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) to canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) under magnetic field. The antiferromagnetic ordering temperature slightly increases from 24.2 K for MnBi2Te4 to 25.2 K for Mn0.75Zn0.25Bi2Te4. The transition field from AFM to CAFM decreases from 3.4 T for x = 0-3.07 T for x = 0.25. Isothermal magnetization data suggest that the single-ion anisotropy of Mn2+ decrease and the interlayer magnetic interaction increase slightly due to the diluted magnetic ions and unit cell shrinkage. Samples Mn0.9Zn0.1Bi2Te4 and Mn0.8Zn0.2Bi2Te4 show metallic conduction with a cusplike anomaly at around TN approximate to 24 K, corresponding to a long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition. The increase of TN and decrease of transition field (HcSF) upon Zn doping, make it possible to manipulate magnetic and electrical properties in topological insulators by non-magnetic element substitution, which is of great significance for further application in quantum information storage and spintronics.

TI Ultra-low threshold continuous-wave quantum dot mini-BIC lasers
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Highly compact lasers with ultra-low threshold and single-mode continuous wave (CW) operation have been a long sought-after component for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs), due to their excellent ability of trapping light and enhancing light-matter interaction, have been investigated in lasing configurations combining various BIC cavities and optical gain materials. However, the realization of BIC laser with a highly compact size and an ultra-low CW threshold has remained elusive. We demonstrate room temperature CW BIC lasers in the 1310 nm O-band wavelength range, by fabricating a miniaturized BIC cavity in an InAs/GaAs epitaxial quantum dot (QD) gain membrane. By enabling effective trapping of both light and carriers in all three dimensions, ultra-low threshold of 12 mu W (0.052 kW cm(-2)) is achieved at room temperature. Single-mode lasing is also realized in cavities as small as only 5 x 5 unit cells (similar to 2.5 x 2.5 mu m(2) cavity size) with a mode volume of 1.16(lambda/n)(3). The maximum operation temperature reaches 70 degrees C with a characteristic temperature of T-0 similar to 93.9 K. With its advantages in terms of a small footprint, ultra-low power consumption, and adaptability for integration, the mini-BIC lasers offer a perspective light source for future PICs aimed at high-capacity optical communications, sensing and quantum information.

TI High-Sensitive Uncooled Mid-Wave Infrared Photodetector Based on

SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Mid-wave infrared (MWIR) sensing technology provides tremendous support for cutting-edge applications in autonomous navigation, quantum information, and optical telecommunications. Recent researchers have reported substantial advancements in the MWIR photodetection based on 2D topological semimetal platinum selenide (PtSe2). However, its application prospect has been constrained by limited sensitivity and sluggish response speed. Herein, an uncooled MWIR photodetector integrating PtSe2 with MoTe2 is reported, which features high responsivity (R) of 8.4-2.5 A W-1 and specific detectivity (D*) of 4.5 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(9) cm Hz(1/2)W(-1) from 2.75 to 4.25 mu m. At 10.6 mu m wavelength, it is still able to showcase a decent R of 0.12 A W-1. Notably, the photodetector achieves the brilliant photoresponse speed of 3-5 mu s from visible to near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges with a competitive 3 dB frequency of 0.13 MHz. Meanwhile, a promising fast response speed of 560 mu s is demonstrated at 4050 nm in MWIR range, which unveils its conspicuous ability to track ultrafast and broadband light signals. It might be attributed to the high carrier mobility and strong built-in electric field at the PtSe2/MoTe2 interface. This research can provide a viable pathway for next-generation room-temperature MWIR photodetectors with high sensitivity and fast response speed.

TI Tripartite entanglement in a detuned non-degenerate optical parametric
   oscillator
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Continuous variable multipartite entanglement is an important resource in quantum optics and quantum information. Non-degenerate optical parametric oscillator (NOPO), generally working in a resonant regime, can generate high quality tripartite entanglement. However, the detuning in a real experiment is inevitable and sometimes necessary, for instance, in an optomechanical system. We calculate the tripartite entanglement from a detuned triply quasi-resonant NOPO. Unlike the previous literature using inseparability criterion, we use the positivity of partial transpose, a sufficient and necessary criterion, to characterize the tripartite entanglement with full inseparability generated from a detuned NOPO. We also consider the influence of the pump and signal/idler losses on the tripartite entanglement. The results show that, the tripartite entanglement could exist even with a large detuning of several times cavity linewidth, and may be better for a detuned regime than for the resonant one under some conditions. With a fixed non-zero loss which always exists in a real experiment, an appropriate value of non-zero detuning could lead to the best entanglement. What's more, unlike the bipartite entanglement, which exists both below and above threshold, the tripartite entanglement only occurs for a nonzero classical amplitude of signal/idler field. The jumping between the tripartite and bipartite entanglement could make the NOPO become a quantum state switch element, which promises a potential application on the multiparty quantum secret sharing.

TI AdS3 Einstein gravity and boundary description: pedagogical
   review
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We review the various aspects of the 3D Einstein gravity theory with a negative cosmological constant and its boundary description. We also explore its connections to conformal field theories (CFTs), modular symmetry, and holography. It is worth noting that this particular theory is topological in nature, which means that all the physical degrees of freedom are located on the boundary. Additionally, we can derive the boundary description on a torus, which takes the form of a 2D Schwarzian theory. This observation suggests that the relevant degrees of freedom for the theory can be described using this 2D theory. Because of the renormalizability of the 3D gravity theory, one can probe the quantum regime. This suggests that it is possible to investigate quantum phenomena. Unlike the conventional CFTs, when considering the AdS3 background, the boundary theory loses modular symmetry. This represents a departure from the usual behavior of CFT and is quite intriguing. The Weyl transformation induces anomaly in CFTs, and we indicate that applying this transformation to the 2D Schwarzian theory leads to similar results. Summing over all geometries with the asymptotic AdS3 boundary condition is equivalent to summing over a modular group. The partition function is one-loop exact and therefore an analytical expression from the summation. This theory holds potential applications in Quantum Information and is a recurring theme in the study of holography, where gravitational theories are connected with CFTs.

TI Phononic thermal conduction and thermal regulation in low-dimensional
   micro-nano scale systems: Nonequilibrium statistical physics problems
   from chip heat dissipation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB "Heat death", namely, overheating, which will deteriorate the function of chips and eventually burn the device and has become an obstacle in the roadmap of the semiconductor industry. Therefore, heat dissipation becomes a key issue in further developing semiconductor. Heat conduction in chips encompasses the intricate dynamics of phonon conduction within one-dimensional, two-dimensional materials, as well as the intricate phonon transport through interfaces. In this paper, the research progress of the complexities of phonon transport on a nano and nanoscale in recent three years, especially the size dependent phonon thermal transport and the relationship between anomalous heat conduction and anomalous diffusion are summarized. Further discussed in this paper is the fundamental question within non-equilibrium statistical physics, particularly the necessary and sufficient condition for a given Hamiltonian whose macroscopic transport behavior obeys Fourier's law. On the other hand, the methods of engineering the thermal conduction, encompassing nanophononic crystals, nanometamaterials, interfacial phenomena, and phonon condensation are also introduced. In order to comprehensively understand the phononic thermal conduction, a succinct overview of phonon heat transport phenomena, spanning from thermal quantization and the phonon Hall effect to the chiral phonons and their intricate interactions with other carriers is presented. Finally, the challenges and opportunities, and the potential application of phonons in quantum information are also discussed

TI Structural design of triangular core-shell nanowires for sensing
   polarized mid-infrared light
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Manipulating and detecting polarization states of light plays an important role in developing technology in various fields, such as remote sensing, medical phototherapy, and quantum information. However, polarization control in mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths, especially longer than 10 lm, is obstructed by the limitation of material properties. Searching for materials and designing structures that respond to polarized light in this spectral range is still challenging. In this work, triangular core-shell AlGaAs/ GaAs nanowires are numerically studied using the finite difference method. The effects of the core shift and rotating angle on the absorption coefficients are concentrated. Highly anisotropic absorption of polarized light in the mid-IR range is found when the core shifts upward and downward. Our results show that this anisotropic property is influenced by the symmetries of electron quantum states confined in the system. Broadband absorption wavelengths from 9.7 to 17.5 lm are unexpectedly found in the structure with appropriate system size. Our finding indicates that triangular core-shell nanowires are a potential platform for next-generation photonic devices capable of manipulating polarized light in a wide range of mid-IR wavelengths.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI Absence of operator growth for average equal-time observables in
   charge-conserved sectors of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantum scrambling plays an important role in understanding thermalization in closed quantum systems. By this effect, quantum information spreads throughout the system and becomes hidden in the form of non-local correlations. Alternatively, it can be described in terms of the increase in complexity and spatial support of operators in the Heisenberg picture, a phenomenon known as operator growth. In this work, we study the disordered fully-connected Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and we demonstrate that scrambling is absent for disorder-averaged expectation values of observables. In detail, we adopt a formalism typical of open quantum systems to show that, on average and within charge-conserved sectors, operators evolve in a relatively simple way which is governed by their operator size. This feature only affects single-time correlation functions, and in particular it does not hold for out-of-time-order correlators, which are well-known to show scrambling behavior. Making use of these findings, we develop a cumulant expansion approach to approximate the evolution of equal-time observables. We employ this scheme to obtain analytic results that apply to arbitrary system size, and we benchmark its effectiveness by exact numerics. Our findings shed light on the structure of the dynamics of observables in the SYK model, and provide an approximate numerical description that overcomes the limitation to small systems of standard methods.

TI Automatic detection of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride in optical
   images using deep learning-based computer vision
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Computer vision algorithms can quickly analyze numerous images and identify useful information with high accuracy. Recently, computer vision has been used to identify 2D materials in microscope images. 2D materials have important fundamental properties allowing for their use in many potential applications, including many in quantum information science and engineering. One such material is hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), an isomorph of graphene with a very indistinguishable layered structure. In order to use these materials for research and product development, the most effective method is mechanical exfoliation where single-layer 2D crystallites must be prepared through an exfoliation procedure and then identified using reflected light optical microscopy. Performing these searches manually is a time-consuming and tedious task. Deploying deep learning-based computer vision algorithms for 2D material search can automate the flake detection task with minimal need for human intervention. In this work, we have implemented a new deep learning pipeline to classify crystallites of hBN based on coarse thickness classifications in reflected-light optical micrographs. We have used DetectoRS as the object detector and trained it on 177 images containing hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes of varying thickness. The trained model achieved a high detection accuracy for the rare category of thin flakes (< 50 atomic layers thick). Further analysis shows that our proposed pipeline could be generalized to various microscope settings and is robust against changes in color or substrate background.

TI Loading and spatially resolved characterization of a cold atomic
   ensemble inside a hollow-core fiber
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a thorough experimental investigation of the loading process of laser-cooled atoms from a magneto-optical trap into an optical dipole trap located inside a hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber, followed by propagation of the atoms therein. This, e.g., serves to identify limits to the loading efficiency and thus optical depth which is a key parameter for applications in quantum information technology. Although only limited access in 1D is available to probe atoms inside such a fiber, we demonstrate that a detailed spatially resolved characterization of the loading and trapping process along the fiber axis is possible by appropriate modification of probing techniques combined with theoretical analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate the loading of up to 2.1 x 10(5) atoms with a transfer efficiency of 2.1% during the course of 50 ms and a peak loading rate of 4.7 x 10(3) atoms ms(-1) resulting in a peak atomic number density on the order of 10(12) cm(-3). Furthermore, we determine the evolution of the spatial density (profile) and ensemble temperature as it approaches its steady-state value of T = 1400 mu K, as well as loss rates, axial velocity and acceleration. The spatial resolution along the fiber axis reaches a few millimeters, which is much smaller than the typical fiber length in experiments. We compare our results to other fiber-based as well as free-space optical dipole traps and discuss the potential for further improvements.

TI Controllable Thin-Film Approaches for Doping and Alloying Transition
   Metal Dichalcogenides Monolayers
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit exciting properties and versatile material chemistry that are promising for device miniaturization, energy, quantum information science, and optoelectronics. Their outstanding structural stability permits the introduction of various foreign dopants that can modulate their optical and electronic properties and induce phase transitions, thereby adding new functionalities such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, and quantum states. To accelerate their technological readiness, it is essential to develop controllable synthesis and processing techniques to precisely engineer the compositions and phases of 2D TMDs. While most reviews emphasize properties and applications of doped TMDs, here, recent progress on thin-film synthesis and processing techniques that show excellent controllability for substitutional doping of 2D TMDs are reported. These techniques are categorized into bottom-up methods that grow doped samples on substrates directly and top-down methods that use energetic sources to implant dopants into existing 2D crystals. The doped and alloyed variants from Group VI TMDs will be at the center of technical discussions, as they are expected to play essential roles in next-generation optoelectronic applications. Theoretical backgrounds based on first principles calculations will precede the technical discussions to help the reader understand each element's likelihood of substitutional doping and the expected impact on the material properties.

TI Stimulated emission tomography for efficient characterization of spatial
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Stimulated-emission tomography (SET) is an excellent tool for characterizing the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), which is commonly used to create pairs of entangled photons for use in quantum information protocols. The use of stimulated emission increases the average number of detected photons by several orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. In a SET measurement, the parametric down conversion is seeded by an intense signal field prepared with specified mode properties rather than by broadband multimodal vacuum fluctuations, as is the case for the spontaneous process. The SET process generates an intense idler field in a mode that is the complex conjugate to the signal mode. In this work we use SET to estimate the joint spatial mode distribution (JSMD) in the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) basis of the two photons of an entangled photon pair. The pair is produced by parametric down conversion in a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal with type-II phase matching pumped at a wavelength of 405 nm along with a 780 nm seed signal beam prepared in a variety of LG modes to generate an 842 nm idler beam of which the spatial mode distribution is measured. We observe strong idler production and good agreement with the theoretical prediction of its spatial mode distribution. Our experimental procedure should enable the efficient determination of the photon-pair wavefunctions produced by low-brightness SPDC sources and the characterization of high-dimensional entangled-photon pairs.

TI Invariant measures on p-adic Lie groups: the p-adic
   quaternion algebra and the Haar integral on the p-adic rotation
   groups
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We provide a general expression of the Haar measure-that is, the essentially unique translation-invariant measure-on a p-adic Lie group. We then argue that this measure can be regarded as the measure naturally induced by the invariant volume form on the group, as it happens for a standard Lie group over the reals. As an important application, we next consider the problem of determining the Haar measure on the p-adic special orthogonal groups in dimension two, three and four (for every prime number p). In particular, the Haar measure on SO(2 , Q(p) ) is obtained by a direct application of our general formula. As for SO(3,Q(p))and SO(4,Q(p)), instead, we show that Haar integrals on these two groups can conveniently be lifted to Haar integrals on certain p-adic Lie groups from which the special orthogonal groups are obtained as quotients. This construction involves a suitable quaternion algebra over the field Q(p )and is reminiscent of the quaternionic realization of the real rotation groups. Our results should pave the way to the development of harmonic analysis on the p-adic special orthogonal groups, with potential applications inp-adic quantum mechanics and in the recently proposed p-adic quantum information theory

TI High-speed batch processing of semidefinite programs with feedforward
   neural networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Semidefinite programming is an important optimization task, often used in time-sensitive applications. Though they are solvable in polynomial time, in practice they can be too slow to be used in online, i.e. real-time applications. Here we propose to solve feasibility semidefinite programs using artificial neural networks (NNs). Given the optimization constraints as an input, a NN outputs values for the optimization parameters such that the constraints are satisfied, both for the primal and the dual formulations of the task. We train the network without having to exactly solve the semidefinite program even once, thus avoiding the possibly time-consuming task of having to generate many training samples with conventional solvers. The NN method is only inconclusive if both the primal and dual models fail to provide feasible solutions. Otherwise we always obtain a certificate, which guarantees false positives to be excluded. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we examine the performance of the method on a hierarchy of quantum information tasks, the Navascues-Pironio-Acin hierarchy applied to the Bell scenario. We demonstrate that the trained NN gives decent accuracy, while showing orders of magnitude increase in speed compared to a traditional solver, once trained. The network does not have to be retrained for similarly structured problems, giving the promise for being a fast solver for these types of problems.

TI Nondissipative non-Hermitian dynamics and exceptional points in coupled
   optical parametric oscillators
SO OPTICA
AB Engineered non-Hermitian systems featuring exceptional points (EPs) can lead to a host of extraordinary phenomena in diverse fields ranging from photonics, acoustics, opto-mechanics, and electronics to atomic physics. In optics, non-Hermitian dynamics are typically realized using dissipation and phase-insensitive gain accompanied by unavoidable fluctuations. Here, we introduce non-Hermitian dynamics of coupled optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) arising from phase-sensitive amplification and de-amplification, and show their distinct advantages over conventional non-Hermitian systems relying on laser gain and loss. OPO-based non-Hermitian systems can benefit from the instantaneous nature of the parametric gain, noiseless phase-sensitive amplification, and rich quantum and classical nonlinear dynamics. We show that two coupled OPOs can exhibit spectral anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetry and a EP between its degenerate and nondegenerate operation regimes. To demonstrate the distinct potentials of the coupled OPO system compared to conventional non-Hermitian systems, we present higher-order EPs with two OPOs, tunable Floquet EPs in a reconfigurable dynamic non-Hermitian system, and the generation of a squeezed vacuum around EPs, all of which are not easy to realize in other non-Hermitian platforms. We believe our results show that coupled OPOs are an outstanding non-Hermitian setting with unprecedented opportunities to realize nonlinear dynamical systems for enhanced sensing and quantum information processing.

   b> Heteronuclear Complex
SO CRYSTALS
AB Heterotopic ligands containing chemically different binding centers are appealing candidates for obtaining heteronuclear metal complexes. By exploiting this strategy, it is possible to introduce different paramagnetic centers characterized by specific anisotropic magnetic properties that make them distinguishable when weakly magnetically coupled. This molecular approach has great potential to yield multi-spin adducts capable of mimicking logical architectures necessary for quantum information processing (QIP), i.e., quantum logic gates. A possible route for including a single-ion magnetic center within a finite-sized heterometallic compound uses the asymmetric (1-pyridyl)-butane-1,3-dione (pybd) ligand reported in the literature for obtaining Cr3+-Cu2+ metallo-cages. To avoid the formation of cages, we adopted the cyclen (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane) ligand as a "capping" agent for the Cu2+ ions. We report here the structural and magnetic characterization of the unprecedented adduct {Cr(pybd)(3)[Cu(cyclen)](2)}(BF4)(4), whose structure is characterized by a central Cr3+ ion in a distorted octahedral coordination environment and two peripheral Cu2+ ions with square-pyramidal coordination geometries. As highlighted by Continuous Wave Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and Direct Current (DC) magnetometry measurements, this adduct shows negligible intramolecular magnetic couplings, and it maintains the characteristic EPR signals of Cr3+ and Cu2+ moieties when diluted in frozen solutions.

TI Self-induced optical non-reciprocity
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Non-reciprocal optical components are indispensable in optical applications, and their realization without any magnetic field has attracted increasing research interest in photonics. Exciting experimental progress has been achieved by either introducing spatial-temporal modulation of the optical medium or combining Kerr-type optical nonlinearity with spatial asymmetry in photonic structures. However, extra driving fields are required for the first approach, while the isolation of noise and the transmission of the signal cannot be simultaneously achieved for the other approach. Here, we propose the mechanism of nonlinear non-reciprocal susceptibility for optical media and experimentally realize the self-induced isolation of optical signals without any external bias field. The self-induced isolation by the input signal is demonstrated with an extremely high isolation ratio of 63.4 dB, a bandwidth of 2.1 GHz for 60 dB isolation, and a low insertion loss of similar to 1 dB. Furthermore, the new mechanism allows novel functional optical devices, including polarization purification and non-reciprocal leverage. A complete passive isolator is realized by introducing an asymmetry cavity. It is demonstrated that the 70 mu W signal could lever the non-reciprocity and realize a 30 dB isolation of the backward laser with a power 100 times higher. The demonstrated nonlinear non-reciprocal medium provides a versatile tool to control light and deepen our understanding of light-matter interactions and enables applications ranging from topological photonics to unidirectional quantum information transfer in a network.

TI Characterization of the low electric field and zero-temperature
   two-level-system loss in hydrogenated amorphous silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Two-level systems (TLS) are an important, if not dominant, source of loss and noise for superconducting resonators such as those used in kinetic inductance detectors and some quantum information science platforms. They are similarly important for loss in photolithographically fabricated superconducting mm-wave/THz transmission lines. For both lumped-element and transmission-line structures, native amorphous surface oxide films are typically the sites of such TLS in nonmicrostripline geometries, while loss in the (usually amorphous) dielectric film itself usually dominates in microstriplines. We report here on the demonstration of low TLS loss at GHz frequencies in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in superconducting lumped-element resonators using parallel-plate capacitors (PPCs). The values we obtain from two recipes in different deposition machines, 7x10-6 and 12x10-6, improve on the best achieved in the literature by a factor of 2-4 for a-Si:H and are comparable to recent measurements of amorphous germanium. Moreover, we have taken care to extract the true zero-temperature, low-field loss tangent of these films, accounting for temperature and field saturation effects that can yield misleading results. Such robustly fabricated and characterized films render the use of PPCs with deposited amorphous films a viable architecture for superconducting resonators and they also promise extremely low loss and high quality factor for photolithographically fabricated superconducting mm-wave/THz transmission lines used in planar antennas and resonant filters.

TI Mean hitting time formula for positive maps
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In the classical theory of Markov chains, one may study the mean time to reach some chosen state, and it is wellknown that in the irreducible, finite case, such quantity can be calculated in terms of the fundamental matrix of the walk, as stated by the mean hitting time formula. In this work, we present an analogous construction for the setting of irreducible, positive, trace preserving maps. The reasoning on positive maps generalizes recent results given for quantum Markov chains, a class of completely positive maps acting on graphs, presented by S. Gudder. The tools employed in this work are based on a proper choice of block matrices of operators, inspired in part by recent work on Schur functions for closed operators on Banach spaces, due to F. A. Grunbaum and one of the authors. The problem at hand is motivated by questions on quantum information theory, most particularly the study of quantum walks, and provides a basic context on which statistical aspects of quantum evolutions on finite graphs can be expressed in terms of the fundamental matrix, which turns out to be an useful generalized inverse associated with the dynamics. As a consequence of the wide generality of the mean hitting time formula found in this paper, we have obtained extensions of the classical version, either by assuming only the knowledge of the probabilistic distribution for the

TI Momentum-space gravity from the quantum geometry and entropy of Bloch
   electrons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum geometry is a key quantity that distinguishes electrons in a crystal from those in the vacuum. Its study continues to provide insights into quantum materials, uncovering new design principles for their discovery. However, unlike the Berry curvature, an intuitive understanding of the quantum metric is lacking. Here, we show that the quantum metric of Bloch electrons leads to a momentum-space gravity. In particular, by extending the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics to second order, we find that the resulting velocity is modified by a geodesic term and becomes the momentum-space dual of the Lorentz force in curved space. We calculate this geodesic response for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and show that moire systems with flat bands are ideal candidates to observe this effect. Extending this analogy with gravity further, we find that the momentum-space dual of the Einstein field equations remains sourceless for pure states, while for mixed states it acquires a source term that depends on the von Neumann entropy for small entropies. We compare this stress-energy equation with the weak-field limit of general relativity, and we conclude that the von Neumann entropy is the momentum-space dual of the gravitational potential. Consequently, the momentum-space geodesic equation for mixed states is modified by a term resembling an entropic force. Our results highlight connections between quantum geometry, momentum-space gravity, and quantum information, prompting further exploration of this dual gravity in quantum materials.

TI Entanglement Cost for Infinite-Dimensional Physical Systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We prove that the entanglement cost equals the regularized entanglement of formation for any infinite-dimensional quantum state rho AB\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\rho _{AB}$$\end{document} with finite quantum entropy on at least one of the subsystems A or B. This generalizes a foundational result in quantum information theory that was previously formulated only for operations and states on finite-dimensional systems. The extension to infinite-dimensional systems is nontrivial because the conventional tools for establishing both the direct and converse bounds, i.e., strong typicality, monotonicity, and asymptotic continuity, are no longer directly applicable. To address this problem, we construct a new entanglement dilution protocol for infinite-dimensional states implementable by local operations and a finite amount of one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC), using weak and strong typicality multiple times. We also prove the optimality of this protocol among all protocols, even under infinite-dimensional separable operations, by developing an argument based on alternative forms of monotonicity and asymptotic continuity of the entanglement of formation for infinite-dimensional states. Along the way, we derive a new integral representation for the quantum entropy of infinite-dimensional states, which we believe to be of independent interest. Our results allow us to fully characterize an important operational entanglement measure-the entanglement cost-for all infinite-dimensional physical systems.

TI Toys can't play: physical agents in Spekkens' theory
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Information is physical (Landauer 1961 IBM J. Res. Dev. 5 183-91), and for a physical theory to be universal, it should model observers as physical systems, with concrete memories where they store the information acquired through experiments and reasoning. Here we address these issues in Spekkens' toy theory (Spekkens 2005 Phys. Rev. A 71 052108), a non-contextual epistemically restricted model that partially mimics the behaviour of quantum mechanics. We propose a way to model physical implementations of agents, memories, measurements, conditional actions and information processing. We find that the actions of toy agents are severely limited: although there are non-orthogonal states in the theory, there is no way for physical agents to consciously prepare them. Their memories are also constrained: agents cannot forget in which of two arbitrary states a system is. Finally, we formalize the process of making inferences about other agents' experiments and model multi-agent experiments like Wigner's friend. Unlike quantum theory (Nurgalieva and del Rio Lidia 2019 Electron. Proc. Theor. Comput. Sci. 287 267-97; Fraser et al 2020 Fitch's knowability axioms are incompatible with quantum theory arXiv:2009.00321; Frauchiger and Renner 2018 Nat. Commun. 9 3711; Nurgalieva and Renner 2021 Contemp. Phys. 61 1-24; Brukner 2018 Entropy 20 350) or box world (Vilasini et al 2019 New J. Phys. 21 113028), in toy theory there are no inconsistencies when physical agents reason about each other's knowledge.

TI Postmelting Encapsulation of Glass Microwires for Multipath Light
   Waveguiding within Phosphate Glasses
SO ACS APPLIED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Glass waveguides are the fundamental component of advanced photonic circuits and play a pivotal role in diverse applications, including quantum information processing, light generation, imaging, data storage, and sensing platforms. Up to date, the fabrication of glass waveguides relies mainly on demanding chemical processes or on the employment of expensive ultrafast laser equipment. In this work, we demonstrate an advanced, simple, low-temperature, postmelting encapsulation procedure for the development of glass waveguides. Specifically, silver iodide phosphate glass microwires (MWs) are drawn from splat-quenched glasses. These MWs are then incorporated in a controlled manner within transparent silver phosphate glass matrices. The judicious selection of glass compositions ensures that the refractive index of the host phosphate glass is lower than that of the embedded MWs. This facilitates the propagation of light inside the encapsulated higher refractive index MWs, leading to the facile development of waveguides. Importantly, we substantially enhance the light transmission within the MWs by leveraging the plasmon resonance effects due to the presence of silver nanoparticles spontaneously generated owing to the silver iodide phosphate glass composition. Employing this innovative approach, we have successfully engineered waveguide devices incorporating either one or two MWs. Remarkably, the dual MW devices are capable of transmitting light of different colors and in multipath direction, rendering the developed waveguides outstanding candidates for extending the functionalities of diverse photonic and optoelectronic circuits, as well as in intelligent signaling applications in smart glass technologies.

TI Optimized Squeezing Operation for Phase-Shift Keying Quantum State
   Discrimination
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Many receiver designs have been studied in the past to discriminate Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) quantum states that are used to encode information before transmitting over the communication channel. Among many types of quantum states, there has been significant work on the use of coherent states for encoding information. Previous work has sought to improve the communication performance in terms of various metrics such as error probability of state discrimination and capacities by employing more complex quantum states such as squeezed-displaced states. One of the simplest receivers for state discrimination is the displacement receiver. However, our calculation demonstrates that when we use optimal parameters for a displacement receiver, squeezed-displaced states might not be necessary, and merely using coherent states suffice. We see no performance improvement in terms of probability of error of state discrimination as well as mutual information using displacement receivers when optimal squeezing parameters are used with squeezing operation on the transmitter side for BPSK and QPSK. In addition, we also study the receiver design scheme for QPSK modulation where squeezing is employed at the receiver side. We find that using squeezing operation on the receiver side just before detection provides an advantage in terms of increased mutual information for the low-photon regime compared to when no squeezing is used. For all other cases, squeezing offers no additional advantage.

TI Interference of cavity light by a single atom acting as a double slit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Young's double-slit interference experiment is central to quantum mechanics. While it has been demonstrated that an array of atoms can produce interference in light, it is a fundamental question to ask whether a single atom can act as a double slit when prepared in a superposition of two separate positions. Cohen-Tannoudji et al. [Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Laser Spectroscopy, edited by M. Ducloy, E. Giacobino, and G. Camy (World Scientific, Singapore, 1992), pp. 3-14] showed that the cross section of the light scattered by a single atom is independent of the spatial separation. In this work, however, we show that when a single atom tunneling in a double well is coupled to an optical ring cavity, the interference phenomena arise if the tunneling rate is comparable to the cavity linewidth. Being driven by an external laser in the dispersive regime, the field emitted by the atom into the cavity exhibits an interference pattern when varying the double-well spacing. Super-Poissonian bunched light can also be generated near the destructive interference. Furthermore, we show that the atomic flux of the coherent tunneling motion generates directional cavity emission, which oscillates for many cycles before the decoherence of the atomic motion and the decay of the cavity photons. Our work opens ways to manipulate photons with controllable external states of atoms for quantum information applications and use cavity light as nondestructive measurements for many-body states of atomic systems.

TI Four-Wave Mixing in Cavity-Enhanced Cesium Atomic Ensembles (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB An intensity-differential squeezed state optical field prepared via four-wave mixing in a cesium atomic ensemble offers advantages such as wavelength matching with cesium atomic transition lines and a spatial multimode structure. This renders it valuable for quantum information applications. However, achieving high-compression-state optical fields through four-wave mixing in cesium atoms typically requires high pump light power and atomic pool temperature, thereby limiting its practicality. This study combines a six-mirror ring optical resonant cavity and a cesium atomic ensemble to achieve a single resonance of the pump light within the cavity while allowing the probe and conjugate lights to pass through in a single pass. This configuration improves pump light utilization and achieves cavity-enhanced cesium atomic four-wave mixing. Consequently, the required pump light power and atomic pool temperature are considerably reduced. Experimental results show that at an intensity-difference compression degree of-6 dB, compared to cavity-free four-wave mixing, the cavity-enhanced four-wave mixing reduces the required pump light power from 600 mW to 340 mW and the atomic cell temperature from 109 degrees C to 98 degrees C . These findings offer a new solution for developing low-power, spatially multimode quantum light sources. Further, they are crucial for advancing the application of four-wave mixing in atomic ensembles.

TI Unravelling the nonlinear generation of designer vortices with
   dielectric metasurfaces
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Vortex beams are currently drawing a great deal of interest, from fundamental research to several promising applications. While their generation in bulky optical devices limits their use in integrated complex systems, metasurfaces have recently proven successful in creating optical vortices, especially in the linear regime. In the nonlinear domain, of strategic importance for the future of classical and quantum information, to date orbital angular momentum has only been created in qualitative ways, without discussing discrepancies between design and experimental results. Here, we demonstrate and analyze the generation of high-purity second harmonic (SH) optical vortices via dielectric meta-holograms. Through full-wave simulations and a proper fabrication protocol, we achieve efficient frequency doubling of an unstructured pump beam into SH vortices with topological charges from 1 to 10. Interferometric and modal-purity measurements confirm the generation of high-quality SH vortices with minimal deviations from the intended design thanks to a quasi-local control over the SH phase. Through systematic comparisons between experimental data and semi-analytical calculations, we also provide a clear insight into the occurrence of ghost vortices in the metasurface-generated harmonic beams, highlighting the importance of simple designs that can be readily transposed into fabricated devices with high fidelity. Our findings underscore the potential of nonlinear dielectric metasurfaces for versatile structured-light generation and manipulation, paving the way for future developments in integrated photonic systems.

TI Quantum detectable Byzantine agreement for distributed data trust
   management in blockchain
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB No system entity within a contemporary distributed cyber system can be entirely trusted. Hence, the classic centralized trust management method cannot be directly applied to it. Blockchain technology is essential to achieving decentralized trust management, its consensus mechanism is useful in addressing large-scale data sharing and data consensus challenges. Herein, an n -party quantum detectable Byzantine agreement (DBA) based on the GHZ state to realize the data consensus in a quantum blockchain is proposed, considering the threat posed by the growth of quantum information technology on the traditional blockchain. Relying on the nonlocality of the GHZ state, the proposed protocol detects the honesty of nodes by allocating the entanglement resources between different nodes. The GHZ state is notably simpler to prepare than other multi-particle entangled states, thus reducing preparation consumption and increasing practicality. When the number of network nodes increases, the proposed protocol provides better scalability and stronger practicability than the current quantum DBA. In addition, the proposed protocol has the optimal fault-tolerant found and does not rely on any other presumptions. A consensus can be reached even when there are ������ - 2 traitors. The performance analysis confirms viability and effectiveness through exemplification. The security analysis also demonstrates that the quantum DBA protocol is unconditionally secure, effectively ensuring the security of data and realizing data consistency in the quantum blockchain.

TI Microwave Heating Effect on Diamond Samples of Nitrogen- Vacancy Centers
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Diamond samples of defects with negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are promising solid-state spin sensors suitable for quantum information processing and highly sensitive measurements of magnetic, electric, and thermal fields at the nanoscale. A diamond defect with an NV center is unique for its robust temperature-dependent zero-field splitting Dgs of the triplet ground state. This property enables t h e optical readout of electron spin states through manipulation of the ground triplet state using microwave resonance with Dgs from 100 K to approximately 600 K . Thus, prohibiting Dgs from external thermal disturbances is crucial for an accurate measurement using NV-diamond sensors. Nevertheless, the external microwave field probably exerts a heating effect on the diamond sample of NV centers. To our knowledge, the microwave heating effect on the diamond samples of NV centers has yet to be quantitatively and systematically addressed. Our observation demonstrates t h e existence of a prominent microwave heating effect on the diamond samples of NV centers with the microwave irradiation in a continuous mode and some pulse sequence modes. The zero-field splitting Dg s is largely red-shifted by the temperature rises of the diamond samples. The effect wi l l inevitably cause NV-diamond sensors to misread the true temperature of the target and disturb magnetic field detection by perturbing the spin precession of NV centers. Our observation demonstrates that such a phenomenon is negligible for the quantum lock-in XY8-N method.

TI Dynamic conditioning of two particle discrete-time quantum walks
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In real photonic quantum systems losses are an unavoidable factor limiting the scalability to many modes and particles, restraining their application in fields as quantum information and communication. For this reason, a considerable amount of engineering effort has been taken in order to improve the quality of particle sources and system components. At the same time, data analysis and collection methods based on post-selection have been used to mitigate the effect of particle losses. This has allowed for investigating experimentally multi-particle evolutions where the observer lacks knowledge about the system's intermediate propagation states. Nonetheless, the fundamental question how losses affect the behaviour of the surviving subset of a multi-particle system has not been investigated so far. For this reason, here we study the impact of particle losses in a quantum walk of two photons reconstructing the output probability distributions for one photon conditioned on the loss of the other in a known mode and temporal step of our evolution network. We present the underlying theoretical scheme that we have devised in order to model controlled particle losses, we describe an experimental platform capable of implementing our theory in a time multiplexing encoding. In the end we show how localized particle losses change the output distributions without altering their asymptotic spreading properties. Finally we devise a quantum civilization problem, a two walker generalisation of single particle recurrence processes.

TI Signal formation and sharing in AC-LGADs using the ALTIROC 0 front-end
   chip
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB The development of detectors that provide high resolution in four dimensions has attracted wide-spread interest in the scientific community for applications in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, medical imaging, mass spectroscopy as well as quantum information. However, finding a technology capable of fulfilling such aspiration proved to be an arduous task. Among other silicon-based candidates, the Low-GainAvalanche Diode (LGAD) has already shown excellent timing performances but proved to be unsuitable for fine pixelization. Therefore, the AC-coupled LGAD (AC-LGAD) approach was introduced to provide high resolution in both time and space, making it a promising candidate for future 4D detectors. However, appropriate readout electronics must be developed to match the sensor's fast-time and fine-pitch capabilities. This is currently a major technological challenge. In this paper, we test AC-LGAD prototypes read out by the fast-time ASIC ALTIROC 0, originally developed for the readout of DC-coupled LGADs for the ATLAS experiment at the High Luminosity-LHC. Signal generated by either betas from a 90Sr source or a focused infra-red laser were analyzed. This paper details the first successful readout of an ACLGAD sensor using a readout chip. This result will pave the way for the design and construction of a new generation of AC-LGAD-based 4D detectors.

TI Computational Screening of Ligands for Enhanced Interactions between
   Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Ligand choice in nanoparticle systems is vital for developing efficient materials and enhancing electronic and chemical properties. Focusing on CsPbBr3, we demonstrate a strategy for modifying the electronic properties of lead halide perovskites through a systematic computational study on ligands with varying binding motifs, sizes, bridge lengths, pi-electron conjugation, and electron withdrawing and donating groups. The calculations are benchmarked against experimental data. Choosing a ligand's pi-electron system and binding group, followed by tuning the ligand's properties with substituents to the pi-system, allows one to introduce ligand electronic states into the perovskite system's bands, close to band edges, and inside the material's fundamental band gap. One can also design surface states by inducing local distortions at the binding site, which can be tuned by altering the binding group of the ligand. Extension of a material's frontier orbitals onto ligands and the creation of surface states make charges available for transport and chemical reactivity, while avoiding charge trapping. In contrast, midgap ligand states trap charges permanently. Large ligands with high coverages interact among themselves, influencing ligand electronic properties and binding. Carboxylate tends to bind more strongly than the ammonium group. Electronegative oxygens in the carboxylate binding group and electron withdrawing substituents bound to the pi-system lower ligand orbital energies relative to perovskite states. The reported theoretical analysis guides experimental design of perovskite-ligand systems for optoelectronic, energy, and quantum information applications.

TI Atomic scale etching of diamond: insights from molecular dynamics
   simulations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Diamond is a promising material for multiple applications in quantum information processing and sensing as well as applications in microelectronics. However, diamond devices can be limited by surface defects that compromise charge stability and spin coherence, among others. Improved strategies in plasma etching of diamond could play an important role in minimizing or eliminating these defects. In this work, we explore plasma-assisted atomic scale etching of diamond using argon ions (Ar+), hydrogen ions (H+) and hydrogen atoms (H). We employ classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and test several interatomic potentials based on the Reactive Empirical Bond Order (REBO) form with comparisons to a variety of published experimental results. We performed MD simulations of low-energy hydrogen (<= 50 eV) and argon (<= 200 eV) ion bombardment of diamond surfaces. Ar+ bombardment can be used to locally smooth initially rough diamond surfaces via the formation of an amorphous C layer, the thickness of which increases with argon ion energy. Subsequent exposure with hydrogen ions (or fast neutrals) will selectively etch this amorphous C layer, leaving the underlying diamond layer mostly intact if the H energy is maintained below about 10 eV. The simulations suggest that combining Ar+ smoothing with selective, near threshold energy H removal of amorphous C can be an effective strategy for diamond surface engineering, leading to more reliable and sensitive diamond color center devices.

TI Evidence of Dirac Quantum Spin Liquid in YbZn2GaO5
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter physics [1,2]. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature superconductivity [3] and can host topological properties with potential applications in quantum information science [4]. The excitations of most quantum spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in onedimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate the novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective spin-1/2 moments with no detectable inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on high-quality single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the specific heat and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and inelastic neutron scattering spectra suggest that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with spinon excitations concentrated at certain points in the Brillouin zone. We advanced these results by performing additional specific heat measurements under finite fields, further confirming the theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular lattice of YbZn2GaO5.

TI 3-D Beamforming Training Using Mutually Unbiased Bases for Cell
   Discovery in mm-Wave Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Beamforming training or cell discovery (CD) is a fundamental procedure in millimeter wave communication systems in which the user detects the presence of a base station, acquires the identity of that base station, and finds suitable beamforming directions to establish the wireless link for the subsequent data transmission phase. We consider uniform planar array-based beamforming under both separable and nonseparable configurations as it allows confined antenna placements and 3-D steering of beams. Our focus is to design the beamforming training phase and develop low-complexity receiver algorithms for the cell discovery procedure. By exploiting the sparse nature of the mm-wave channels and using an equivalent compressive sensing measurement model, we obtain analytical bounds for the cell detection probability in terms of the mutual coherence parameter of the resulting sensing matrix. Using mutually unbiased bases (MUB) from quantum information theory, we design CD schemes with low mutual coherence. Our design includes parameters that control the training phase duration, and we analytically characterize the relationship between the training duration and the corresponding mutual coherence value. We present detailed simulation studies using experimentally driven mm-wave channel simulators and show that our MUB based scheme gives superior detection performance when compared to the conventional beam sweeping based schemes and random beamforming schemes.

TI Probing Genuine Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering and
   Entanglement Under an Open Tripartite System
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a peculiar quantum nonlocal correlation and has unique physical characteristics and a wide application prospect. Even more importantly, multipartite steerable states have more vital applications in the future quantum information field. Thus, in this work, we explored the dynamics characteristics of both genuine multipartite steering (GMS) and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) and the relations of both under an open tripartite system. Specifically, the tripartite decoherence system may be modeled by the three parties of a tripartite state that undergo the noisy channels. The conditions for genuine entangled and steerable states can be acquired for the initial tripartite state. The results showed that decoherence noises can degrade the genuine multipartite entanglement and genuine multipartite steering and even induce its death. Explicitly, GME and GMS disappear with the increase in the decoherence strength under the phase damping channel. However, GME and GMS rapidly decay to death with the increase in the channel-noise factor and then come back to life soon after in the bit flip channel. Additionally, the results indicate that GMS is born of GME, but GME does not imply GMS, which means that the set of genuine multipartite steerable states is a strict subset of the set of genuine multipartite entangled states. These conclusions may be useful for discussing the relationship of quantum nonlocal correlations (GME and GMS) in the decoherence systems.

TI Dual-Band Bandpass Filter Optimized for High Q-Factor
SO APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETICS SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB High quality factor bandpass filters based on a number of cascaded resonators of dual-resonance mechanism are proposed in the present paper. Each resonator is constructed as two overlapped coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonant structures. The cascaded resonators mediate microwave coupling between two isolated corner-shaped CPW feeders only at the resonant frequencies leading to a bandpass filter of high quality factor. The two resonant frequencies and the separation between them can be fine-tuned by the dimensions of the structure. The effects of the dimensional parameters of the resonator and the feeding CPW regions on the resonant frequencies and the performance of the bandpass filter are investigated. The effect of the loss tangent of the dielectric substrate material on the quality factors at the two resonant frequencies is studied. Three prototypes of the proposed filter are fabricated and experimentally studied for more understanding of the underlying physical principles of operation and for verifying some of the simulation results. The experimental results show good agreement when compared with the corresponding simulation results. It is shown that, at low enough absolute temperature, the proposed structure can operate as superconducting microwave resonator when made from the appropriate materials. Also, it is shown that an optimized design of the proposed bandpass filter, based on superconducting CPWR structure, can achieve quality factors high enough to form a quantum data bus for hybrid architecture of quantum information systems.

TI Luminescence from Droplet-Etched GaAs Quantum Dots at and Close to Room
   Temperature
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Epitaxially grown quantum dots (QDs) are established as quantum emitters for quantum information technology, but their operation under ambient conditions remains a challenge. Therefore, we study photoluminescence (PL) emission at and close to room temperature from self-assembled strain-free GaAs quantum dots (QDs) in refilled AlGaAs nanoholes on (001)GaAs substrate. Two major obstacles for room temperature operation are observed. The first is a strong radiative background from the GaAs substrate and the second a significant loss of intensity by more than four orders of magnitude between liquid helium and room temperature. We discuss results obtained on three different sample designs and two excitation wavelengths. The PL measurements are performed at room temperature and at T = 200 K, which is obtained using an inexpensive thermoelectric cooler. An optimized sample with an AlGaAs barrier layer thicker than the penetration depth of the exciting green laser light (532 nm) demonstrates clear QD peaks already at room temperature. Samples with thin AlGaAs layers show room temperature emission from the QDs when a blue laser (405 nm) with a reduced optical penetration depth is used for excitation. A model and a fit to the experimental behavior identify dissociation of excitons in the barrier below T = 100 K and thermal escape of excitons from QDs above T = 160 K as the central processes causing PL-intensity loss.

TI Rotaxane rings promote oblique packing and extended lifetimes in
   DNA-templated molecular dye aggregates
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB Molecular excitons play a central role in natural and artificial light harvesting, organic electronics, and nanoscale computing. The structure and dynamics of molecular excitons, critical to each application, are sensitively governed by molecular packing. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) templating is a powerful approach that enables controlled aggregation via sub-nanometer positioning of molecular dyes. However, finer sub-Angstrom control of dye packing is needed to tailor excitonic properties for specific applications. Here, we show that adding rotaxane rings to squaraine dyes templated with DNA promotes an elusive oblique packing arrangement with highly desirable optical properties. Specifically, dimers of these squaraine:rotaxanes exhibit an absorption spectrum with near-equal intensity excitonically split absorption bands. Theoretical analysis indicates that the transitions are mostly electronic in nature and only have similar intensities over a narrow range of packing angles. Compared with squaraine dimers, squaraine:rotaxane dimers also exhibit extended excited-state lifetimes and less structural heterogeneity. The approach proposed here may be generally useful for optimizing excitonic materials for a variety of applications ranging from solar energy conversion to quantum information science.
   DNA templating is a useful strategy to control the positioning and aggregation of molecular dyes on a sub-nanometer scale, but sub-angstrom control is desirable for the precise tailoring of excitonic properties. Here, the authors show that templating squaraine dyes functionalized with rotaxane rings promotes an elusive oblique packing arrangement and extended excited-state lifetimes.

TI Optimization of Longitudinal Alignment of an 4f System in a
   Compact Vectorial Optical-Field Generator Based on a High-Resolution
   Liquid Crystal Spatial Light Modulator
SO PHOTONICS
AB Vectorial optical fields have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in areas such as optical nano-fabrication, optical micromachining, quantum information processing, optical imaging, and so on. Traditional compact vectorial optical generators with amplitude modulation perform poorly in terms of diffraction effect reduction. To tackle this problem, the refractive 4f system in amplitude modulation is longitudinally aligned using an optimization approach presented in this research. The phase images used for longitudinal alignment are loaded into the liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM), and the distance between the lens and the mirror in the reflective 4f system is adjusted for longitudinal alignment by compensating for the neglected phase in the integrated module for the compact vectorial optical-field generator. The spot images collected by the CCD are processed using the improved eight-direction Sobel operator and Roberts function, and the longitudinal alignment in the reflective 4f system is determined by the sharpness of the image. The sharpness of the edges of the lines and the overall image are both enhanced after optimization compared to before optimization. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the longitudinal alignment error of the reflective 4f system in the amplitude modulation of the compact vectorial optical-field generator, lessen the diffraction effect, and improve the performance of the system.

TI High-throughput discovery of perturbation-induced topological magnons
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Topological magnons give rise to possibilities for engineering novel spintronics devices with critical applications in quantum information and computation, due to their symmetry-protected robustness and low dissipation. However, to make reliable and systematic predictions about the material realization of topological magnons has been a major challenge, due to the lack of neutron scattering data for most materials and the absence of reliable ab initio calculations for magnons. In this work, we significantly advance the symmetry-based approach for identifying topological magnons through developing a fully automated algorithm, utilizing the theory of symmetry indicators, that enables a highly efficient and large-scale search for candidate materials hosting perturbation-driven topological magnons. This progress not only streamlines the discovery process but also expands the scope of materials exploration beyond previous manual or traditional approaches, offering a powerful tool for uncovering novel topological phases in magnetic systems. Performing a large-scale search over all 1649 magnetic materials in the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (BCS) with a commensurate magnetic order, we discover 387 perturbation-induced topological magnon materials, significantly expanding the pool of topological magnon materials and showing that more than 23% of all commensurate magnetic compounds in the BCS database are topological. We further discuss examples and experimental accessibility of the candidate materials, shedding light on future experimental realizations of topological magnons in magnetic materials. We provide an open-source program that checks the symmetry-enforced magnon band topology of any commensurate magnetic structure upon perturbations and allows researchers to reproduce our results.

TI Fractal photonic anomalous Floquet topological insulators to generate

SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Anomalous Floquet topological insulators with vanishing Chern numbers but supporting chiral edge modes are attracting more and more attention. Since the existing anomalous Floquet topological insulators usually support only one kind of chiral edge mode even at a large lattice size, they are unscalable and unapplicable for multistate topological quantum systems. Recently, fractal topological insulators with self-similarity have been explored to support more nontrivial modes. Here, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of fractal photonic anomalous Floquet topological insulators based on dual Sierpinski carpet consisting of directional couplers using the femtosecond laser direct writing. The fabricated lattices support much more kinds of chiral edge states with fewer waveguides and enable perfect hopping of quantum states with near unit transfer efficiency. Instead of zero-dimensional bound modes for quantum state transport in previous laser direct-written topological insulators, we generate multiple propagating single-photon chiral edge states in the fractal lattice and observe high-visibility quantum interferences. These suggest the successful realization of highly indistinguishable single-photon chiral edge states, which can be applied in various quantum operations. This work provides the potential for enhancing the multi-fold manipulation of quantum states, enlarging the encodable quantum information capacity in a single lattice via high-dimensional encoding and many other fractal applications.
   We demonstrate the experimental realization of fractal photonic anomalous Floquet topological insulators for generating multiple single-photon chiral edge states in a single lattice fabricated by the femtosecond laser direct writing.

TI Quantum coherence and mutual information of mixed spin-(1/2,5/2)
   Ising-XXZ model on quasi-one-dimensional lattices
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The mixed spin-(1/2, 5/2) Ising-XXZ model on quasi-one-dimensional lattices can be used to study the properties of some materials (such as heterotrimetallic Fe-Mn-Cu coordination polymer), and the study on this model is beneficial to the practical applications of such materials in the field of quantum information. The quantum coherence and mutual information are calculated by the transfer matrix method, and the effects of Ising interaction, temperature and magnetic field on them are discussed. The results show that the quantum coherence decreases gradually with the increase of Ising interaction at extremely low temperatures, while there is one minimum value of mutual information in an isotropic (Delta = 4) system and there appear four minimum values in an anisotropic system. Furthermore, quantum coherence and mutual information jump abruptly at quantum phase transition points where the first derivatives of them exhibit singular behaviors. The quantum coherence and mutual information at finite temperatures are also studied. As the temperature increases, they decrease monotonically in a weak magnetic field, but they first increase and then decrease in a higher magnetic field, which is caused by the competition between thermal fluctuation and magnetic field. Compared with quantum mutual information, quantum coherence exists over a wider range of magnetic field and temperature, which can be easily manipulated experimentally.

TI Linear arrays of InGaAs quantum dots on nanostructured GaAs-on-Si
   substrates
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Linear arrays of high-quality quantum dots (QD) integrated in Si are an ideal platform in exploring the manipulation and transmission of quantum information. Understanding QD self-organization mechanisms on substrates compatible with Si technology is therefore of great practical importance. Here we demonstrate the epitaxial growth of linear arrays of InAs and InGaAs QDs from As2 and In molecular beams on bare and GaAscoated Si(0 0 1) substrates, patterned by high-resolution laser interference nanolithography. Atomic force microscopy, in combination with high-resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopies, show that these arrays exhibit an improvement in growth selectivity, lateral order and size uniformity of the QDs when a pseudomorphic 1 nm-thick GaAs buffer layer is grown prior to InAs deposition. In addition, preferential nucleation of InxGa1-xAs QDs along the 1 1 0 -oriented edges of the nanostructured GaAs-on-Si(0 0 1) substrate results from In adatom migration from (111) to (001) nanofacets and the erosion of the wetting and buffer layers caused by the Ga-In intermixing at the step edge during the Stranski-Krastanov transition. These are key elements in the formation of linear arrays of coherent QDs, which differ in morphology and structure from those obtained on both GaAs(0 0 1) and Si(0 0 1) planar surfaces.

TI Intramolecular Charge Transfer and Ultrafast Nonradiative Decay in
   DNA-Tethered Asymmetric Nitro- and Dimethylamino-Substituted Squaraines
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Molecular (dye) aggregates are a materials platform of interest in light harvesting, organic optoelectronics, and nanoscale computing, including quantum information science (QIS). Strong excitonic interactions between dyes are key to their use in QIS; critically, properties of the individual dyes govern the extent of these interactions. In this work, the electronic structure and excited-state dynamics of a series of indolenine-based squaraine dyes incorporating dimethylamino (electron donating) and/or nitro (electron withdrawing) substituents, so-called asymmetric dyes, were characterized. The dyes were covalently tethered to DNA Holliday junctions to suppress aggregation and permit characterization of their monomer photophysics. A combination of density functional theory and steady-state absorption spectroscopy shows that the difference static dipole moment (Delta d) successively increases with the addition of these substituents while simultaneously maintaining a large transition dipole moment (mu). Steady-state fluorescence and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies uncover a significant nonradiative decay pathway in the asymmetrically substituted dyes that drastically reduces their excited-state lifetime (tau). This work indicates that Delta d can indeed be increased by functionalizing dyes with electron donating and withdrawing substituents and that, in certain classes of dyes such as these asymmetric squaraines, strategies may be needed to ensure long tau, e.g., by rigidifying the pi-conjugated network.

TI Billiard-ball paradox for a quantum wave packet
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Past studies of the billiard-ball paradox, a problem involving an object that travels back in time along a closed timelike curve (CTC), typically concern themselves with entirely classical histories, whereby any trajectorial effects associated with quantum mechanics cannot manifest. Here we develop a quantum version of the paradox, wherein a (semiclassical) wave packet evolves through a region containing a wormhole time machine. This is accomplished by mapping all relevant paths on to a quantum circuit, in which the distinction of the various paths is facilitated by representing the billiard particle with a clock state. For this model, we find that Deutsch's prescription (D-CTCs) provides self-consistent solutions in the form of a mixed state composed of terms which represent every possible configuration of the particle's evolution through the circuit. In the equivalent circuit picture (ECP), this reduces to a binomial distribution in the number of loops of time machine. The postselected teleportation prescription (P-CTCs) on the other hand predicts a pure-state solution in which the loop counts have binomial coefficient weights. We then discuss the model in the continuum limit, with a particular focus on the various methods one may employ in order to guarantee convergence in the average number of clock evolutions. Specifically, for D-CTCs, we find that it is necessary to regularise the theory's parameters, while P-CTCs alternatively require more contrived modification.

TI Advancing large-scale thin-film PPLN nonlinear photonics with segmented
   tunable micro-heaters
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate (TF-PPLN) devices have recently gained prominence for efficient wavelength conversion processes in both classical and quantum applications. However, the patterning and poling of TF-PPLN devices today are mostly performed at chip scales, presenting a significant bottleneck for future largescale nonlinear photonic systems that require the integration of multiple nonlinear components with consistent performance and low cost. Here, we take a pivotal step towards this goal by developing a wafer-scale TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic platform, leveraging ultraviolet stepper lithography and an automated poling process. To address the inhomogeneous broadening of the quasi-phase matching (QPM) spectrum induced by film thickness variations across the wafer, we propose and demonstrate segmented thermal optic tuning modules that can precisely adjust and align the QPM peak wavelengths in each section. Using the segmented micro-heaters, we show the successful realignment of inhomogeneously broadened multi-peak QPM spectra with up to 57% enhancement of conversion efficiency. We achieve a high normalized conversion efficiency of 3802% W-1 cm-2 in a 6 mm long PPLN waveguide, recovering 84% of the theoretically predicted efficiency in this device. The advanced fabrication techniques and segmented tuning architectures presented herein pave the way for wafer-scale integration of complex functional nonlinear photonic circuits with applications in quantum information processing, precision sensing and metrology, and low-noise-figure optical signal amplification.

TI Quantized polarization and Majorana fermions beyond tenfold
   classification
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Exploration of topology is central in condensed matter physics and applications to fault-tolerant quantum information. The bulk-boundary correspondence and tenfold classification determine the topological state compared to a vacuum. Contrary to this belief, we demonstrate that topological zero-energy domain-wall states can emerge for all forbidden 1D classes of the tenfold classification table. The guiding principle is that the difference in the topological quantities of two trivial domains can be quantized, and hence, a topologically protected state can emerge at the domain wall. Such nontrivial domain-wall states are demonstrated using generalized Su-Schrieffeer-Heeger and generalized Kitaev models, which manifest quantized polarization and Majorana fermions, respectively. The quantized Berry phase difference between the domains protects the non-trivial nature of the domain-wall states, extending the bulk-boundary correspondence, also confirmed by the tight-binding and Jackiw-Rebbi methods. Furthermore, we show that the seemingly trivial electronic and superconducting models can be transformed into their topological counterparts in the framework of the topological Fermi-liquid theory. Finally, we propose potential systems where our results may be realized, spanning from electronic and superconducting to optical systems.
   The bulk-boundary correspondence and the tenfold classification table are important concepts for topological insulators and superconductors as they determine the nature or absence of topological boundary states. Using generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Kitaev models, the authors demonstrate topological domain-wall states in the classes where topology is thought to be impossible.

TI Edge-Confined Excitons in Monolayer Black Phosphorus
SO ACS NANO
AB Quantum confinement of two-dimensional excitons in van der Waals materials via electrostatic trapping, lithographic patterning, Moire potentials, and chemical implantation has enabled significant advances in tailoring light emission from nanostructures. While such approaches rely on complex preparation of materials, natural edges are a ubiquitous feature in layered materials and provide a different approach for investigating quantum-confined excitons. Here, we observe that certain edge sites of monolayer black phosphorus (BP) strongly localize the intrinsic quasi-one-dimensional excitons, yielding sharp spectral lines in photoluminescence, with nearly an order of magnitude line width reduction. Through structural characterization of BP edges using transmission electron microscopy and first-principles GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) calculations of exemplary BP nanoribbons, we find that certain atomic reconstructions can strongly quantum-confine excitons resulting in distinct emission features, mediated by local strain and screening. We observe linearly polarized luminescence emission from edge reconstructions that preserve the mirror symmetry of the parent BP lattice, in agreement with calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficient electrical switching of localized edge excitonic luminescence, whose sites act as excitonic transistors for emission. Localized emission from BP edges motivates exploration of nanoribbons and quantum dots as hosts for tunable narrowband light generation, with future potential to create atomic-like structures for quantum information processing applications as well as exploration of exotic phases that may reside in atomic edge structures.

TI Ultracompact topological photonic switch based on valley-vortex-enhanced
   high-efficiency phase shift
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Topologically protected edge states based on valley photonic crystals (VPCs) have been widely studied, from theoretical verification to technical applications. However, research on integrated tuneable topological devices is still lacking. Here, we study the phase-shifting theory of topological edge modes based on a VPC structure. Benefiting from the phase vortex formed by the VPC structure, the optical path of the topological edge mode in the propagation direction is approximately two-fold that of the conventional optical mode in a strip waveguide. In experiments, we show a 1.57-fold improvement in pi-phase tuning efficiency. By leveraging the high-efficiency phase-shifting properties and the sharp-turn features of the topological waveguide, we demonstrate an ultracompact 1 x 2 thermo-optic topological switch (TOTS) operating at telecommunication wavelengths. A switching power of 18.2 mW is needed with an ultracompact device footprint of 25.66 x 28.3 mu m in the wavelength range of 1530-1582 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this topological photonic switch is the smallest switch of any dielectric or semiconductor 1 x 2/2 x 2 broadband optical switches, including thermo-optic and electro-optic switches. In addition, a high-speed transmission experiment employing the proposed TOTS is carried out to demonstrate the robust transmission of high-speed data. Our work reveals the phase-shifting mechanism of valley edge modes, which may enable diverse topological functional devices in many fields, such as optical communications, nanophotonics, and quantum information processing.

TI Enhanced optical nonlinearities under collective strong light-matter
   coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical microcavities and metallic nanostructures have been shown to significantly modulate the dynamics and spectroscopic response of molecular systems. We present a study of the nonlinear optics of a model consisting of N anharmonic multilevel systems (e.g., Morse oscillators) undergoing collective strong coupling with a resonant infrared microcavity. We find that, under experimentally accessible conditions, molecular systems in microcavities may have nonlinear phenomena significantly intensified due to the high quality of polariton resonances and the enhanced microcavity electromagnetic energy density relative to free space. Particularly large enhancement of multiphoton absorption happens when multipolariton states are resonant with bare molecule multiphoton transitions. In particular, our model predicts two-photon absorption cross-section enhancements by several orders of magnitude relative to free space when the Rabi splitting Omega(R) is approximately equal to the molecular anharmonic shift 2 Delta. Our results provide rough upper bounds to resonant nonlinear-response enhancement factors as relaxation to dark states is treated phenomenologically. Notably, ensembles of two-level systems undergoing strong coupling with a cavity (described by the Tavis-Cummings model) show no such optical nonlinearity enhancements, highlighting the rich phenomenology afforded by multilevel anharmonic systems. Similar conclusions are expected to hold for excitonic systems that share features with our model (e.g., molecular dyes with accessible S-0 -> S-1 -> S-2 transitions) and strongly interact with a UV-visible cavity.

TI Ultra-narrowband Coherent THz Source by Chirped-Pulse Difference
   Frequency Generation
SO JOURNAL OF INFRARED MILLIMETER AND TERAHERTZ WAVES
AB We report the generation of extremely narrowband, micro-Joule-level, frequency-tunable THz pulses between 3 and 4 THz in organic DSTMS, without applying any spectral filtering techniques (e.g., bandpass filters). Using difference frequency generation with > 10 ps duration linearly chirped near-infrared (NIR) pulses, THz pulses with 300 nJ output energy and an extremely narrow spectrum of 83 GHz at 3.87 THz were achieved with a relative bandwidth of 2%. Producing table-top picosecond THz pulses with such intensity and an extremely narrow spectrum has been quite challenging in the entire THz gap frequency range (3-15 THz), previously hindered by technical barriers such as low-energy excitation and insufficient pulse stretching of the NIR pulses. We showcased the experimental procedure of minimizing the THz spectrum bandwidth and systematically explored the THz pulse energy and relative bandwidth versus different NIR chirping conditions, aiming to offer practical guidance in preparing tailored THz pulses for different scientific cases. The tunability of the central frequency and spectral bandwidth can both be potentially extended by varying the NIR wavelengths and durations. Our ultra-narrowband THz source will open up new possibilities for controlling quantum states requiring extremely high selectivity, particularly in the applications for quantum information processing by coherently manipulating the Rydberg states in semiconductors, which are currently only possible at free-electron lasers.

SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Detecting a non-zero electric dipole moment in a particle would unambiguously signify physics beyond the Standard Model. A potential pathway towards this is the detection of a nuclear Schiff moment, the magnitude of which is enhanced by the presence of nuclear octupole deformation. However, due to the low production rate of isotopes featuring such 'pear-shaped' nuclei, capturing, detecting and manipulating them efficiently is a crucial prerequisite. Incorporating them into synthetic diamond optical crystals can produce defects with defined, molecule-like structures and isolated electronic states within the diamond band gap, increasing capture efficiency, enabling repeated probing of even a single atom and producing narrow optical linewidths. In this study, we used density functional theory to investigate the formation, structure and electronic properties of crystal defects in diamond containing 229Pa, a rare isotope that is predicted to have an exceptionally strong nuclear octupole deformation. In addition, we identified and studied stable lanthanide-containing defects with similar electronic structures as non-radioactive proxies to aid in experimental methods. Our findings hold promise for the existence of such defects and can contribute to the development of a quantum information processing-inspired toolbox of techniques for studying rare isotopes.This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Diamond for quantum applications'.

TI On-chip unitary generation of arbitrary complex spatial photonic states
SO OPTICA
AB The rapid advancement and high integration of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled energy-efficient and fast computation in compact chip designs. A fundamental challenge in both classical and quantum information processing is the ability to create light wavefronts with complex spatial amplitude and phase distributions. Traditional methods that involve splitting light into multiple channels and modulating each one individually typically lead to chip area and power waste. We introduce a compact programmable PIC capable of generating arbitrary complex spatial states in a power-conserving manner. The proposed system harnesses multipath interference in an interlaced arrangement of phase modulator arrays and photonic lattices to transform excitation from a single input channel to a multi-channel output state with the required amplitude and phase profile. For an N-port device, we demonstrate that two layers of N phase shifters can approximate arbitrary N-dimensional amplitude states with sufficient accuracy, while three layers allow complete control over both amplitude and phase. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary state generation with a silicon photonic platform by utilizing a measurement-and-feedback setting for in situ programming of the device to optimize the desired output state. The present solution allows for a flexible design, compatible across various material platforms, for the integration of state generators used in future PICs that require arbitrarily complex inputs.

TI Can boundary configuration be tuned to optimize directional quantum
   steering harvesting?
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate the harvesting of quantum steering and its asymmetry between two static detectors locally interacting with a vacuum massless scalar field near an infinite, perfectly reflecting boundary. The detectors are arranged either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with detector B assumed to have an energy gap greater than or equal to that of detector A. It is interesting to observe that, with increasing distance between the detectors and the boundary, the boundary tends to suppress quantum steering in one direction while enhancing it in the opposite direction. In the case of identical detectors, steering is symmetric when they are aligned parallel to the boundary. However, orthogonal alignment breaks this symmetry due to their unequal spatial proximity to the boundary. For non-identical detectors in the parallel configuration, the steering from A to B (A -> B) generally surpasses that from B to A (B -> A). In contrast, when the detectors are oriented orthogonally to the boundary, the relative strength of A -> B and B -> A steerability depends on the interplay between the boundary effects and the detectors' energy gap difference. Across most of the parameter space, the orthogonal alignment tends to enhance B -> A steering while suppressing A -> B steering compared to the parallel setup. These findings suggest that boundary configurations should be flexibly adjusted according to the directional dependence of steering harvesting in order to optimize quantum information extraction.

TI Second Harmonic Generation in Apodized Chirped Periodically Poled
   Lithium Niobate Loaded Waveguides Based on Bound States in Continuum
SO PHOTONICS
AB With the rapid development of optical communication and quantum information, the demand for efficient and broadband nonlinear frequency conversion has increased. At present, most single-frequency conversion processes in lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) waveguides suffer from lateral leakage without proper design, leading to an additional increase in propagation loss. Achieving broadband frequency conversion also encounters this problem in that there are no relevant works that have solved this yet. In this paper, we theoretically propose an efficient and flat broadband second harmonic generation (SHG) in silicon nitride loaded apodized chirped periodically poled LNOI waveguides. By using a bound states in the continuum (BICs) mechanism to reduce the propagation loss and utilizing the characteristic that the BICs are insensitive to wavelength, an ultra-low-loss wave band of 80 nm is realized. Then, by employing an apodized chirped design, a flat broadband SHG is achieved. The normalized conversion efficiency (NCE) is approximately 222%W-1cm-2, and the bandwidth is about 100 nm. Moreover, the presented waveguides are simple and can be fabricated without direct etching of lithium niobate, exhibiting excellent fabrication tolerance. Our work may open a new avenue for exploring low-loss and flat broadband nonlinear frequency conversion on various on-chip integrated photonic platforms.

TI Quantum Image Encryption Based on Quantum DNA Codec and Pixel-Level
   Scrambling
SO ENTROPY
AB In order to increase the security and robustness of quantum images, this study combined the quantum DNA codec with quantum Hilbert scrambling to offer an enhanced quantum image encryption technique. Initially, to accomplish pixel-level diffusion and create enough key space for the picture, a quantum DNA codec was created to encode and decode the pixel color information of the quantum image using its special biological properties. Second, we used quantum Hilbert scrambling to muddle the image position data in order to double the encryption effect. In order to enhance the encryption effect, the altered picture was then employed as a key matrix in a quantum XOR operation with the original image. The inverse transformation of the encryption procedure may be used to decrypt the picture since all the quantum operations employed in this research are reversible. The two-dimensional optical image encryption technique presented in this study may significantly strengthen the anti-attack of quantum picture, according to experimental simulation and result analysis. The correlation chart demonstrates that the average information entropy of the RGB three channels is more than 7.999, the average NPCR and UACI are respectively 99.61% and 33.42%, and the peak value of the ciphertext picture histogram is uniform. It offers more security and robustness than earlier algorithms and can withstand statistical analysis and differential assaults.

TI Spin-polarization anisotropy controlled by bending in tungsten
   diselenide nanoribbons and tunable excitonic states
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB A WSe2 monolayer shows many interesting properties due to its spin-orbit coupling induced spin splitting in bands around the Fermi level and the spin-valley configuration. The orientation of the spin-polarization in the relevant bands is crucial for the nature of exciton states and the optical valley selectivity. In this work, we studied the electronic properties of the WSe2 nanoribbons under different mechanical bending curvatures and electron/hole doping using density functional theory and their optical absorption and excitonic states using many-body perturbation GW and BSE (Bethe-Salpeter equation) methods. We found that the WSe2 nanoribbons can exhibit an enhanced SOC effect and a spatially varying spin-polarization in bands around the Fermi level under bending conditions. The spin-polarization can show an anisotropy (or asymmetry) in these nearly degenerate bands, leading to a controllable magnetism via bending and electron/hole doping of the nanoribbons, suggesting a potential application in compact and controllable magnetic nanodevices and spintronics. The optical absorption spectrum of the nanoribbon presents a large tunability with bending within the near infrared region of about 0.4 to 1.5 eV, showing an enhanced absorption under a large bending condition. The exciton states generally show mixed or various spin configurations in the electron and hole pairs that are controlled by bending, potentially useful for applications in spin-based quantum information processes.

TI Frontier Orbital Degeneracy: A New Concept for Tailoring the Magnetic
   State in Organic Semiconductor Adsorbates
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Kondo resonances in molecular adsorbates are important building blocks for applications in the field of molecular spintronics. Here, we introduce the novel concept of using frontier orbital degeneracy for tailoring the magnetic state, which is demonstrated for the case of the organic semiconductor 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN, C18N12) on Ag(111). Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS) measurements reveal the existence of two types of adsorbed HATCN molecules with distinctly different appearances and magnetic states, as evident from the presence or absence of an Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo resonance. Our DFT results show that HATCN on Ag(111) supports two almost isoenergetic states, both with one excess electron transferred from the Ag surface but with magnetic moments of either 0 or 0.65 mu(B). Therefore, even though all molecules undergo charge transfer of one electron from the Ag substrate, they exist in two different molecular magnetic states that resemble a free doublet or an entangled spin state. We explain how the origin of this behavior lies in the 2-fold degeneracy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of gas phase HATCN, lifted upon adsorption and charge-transfer from Ag(111). Our combined STM and DFT study introduces a new pathway to tailoring the magnetic state of molecular adsorbates on surfaces, with significant potential for spintronics and quantum information science.

TI Generalized volume-complexity for RN-AdS black hole
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The connection between quantum information and quantum gravity has captured the imagination of physicists. Recently, a broad new class of gravitational observables have been proposed to provide new possibilities for holographic complexity [1], which is an extension of volume in the Complexity=Volume proposal. In this paper, we investigate generalized volume-complexity for the 4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole. These new gravitational observables satisfy the characteristic of the thermofield double state, i.e., they grow linearly in time on the late stage. We find that there are multiple extremal hypersurfaces anchored at a certain boundary time. In other words, for the same boundary time, more than one gravitational observable (generalized volume-complexity) can exist in the bulk. The size relationship of the gravitational observables on the two hypersurfaces changes over time. This will result in the substitution of the maximum extreme hypersurface which is dual to the complexity of the thermofield double state. We call the time when one hypersurface replaces another to become the largest extreme hypersurface the turning time & tau;(turning). That is, a hypersurface dual to the complexity of the thermofield double state defined on the boundary jumps from one branch to another. This discontinuous jump is highly reminiscent of a phase transition, and the turning time denotes the moment at which this phase transition occurs. Our findings propose a discontinuous variation in bulk physics that is dual to the complexity of the thermofield double state defined on the boundary.

TI Observation of Rabi dynamics with a short-wavelength free-electron laser
SO NATURE
AB Rabi oscillations are periodic modulations of populations in two-level systems interacting with a time-varying field(1). They are ubiquitous in physics with applications in different areas such as photonics(2), nano-electronics(3), electron microscopy(4) and quantum information(5). While the theory developed by Rabi was intended for fermions in gyrating magnetic fields, Autler and Townes realized that it could also be used to describe coherent light-matter interactions within the rotating-wave approximation(6). Although intense nanometre-wavelength light sources have been available for more than a decade(7-9), Rabi dynamics at such short wavelengths has not been directly observed. Here we show that femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses from a seeded free-electron laser(10) can drive Rabi dynamics between the ground state and an excited state in helium atoms. The measured photoelectron signal reveals an Autler-Townes doublet and an avoided crossing, phenomena that are both fundamental to coherent atom-field interactions(11). Using an analytical model derived from perturbation theory on top of the Rabi model, we find that the ultrafast build-up of the doublet structure carries the signature of a quantum interference effect between resonant and non-resonant photoionization pathways. Given the recent availability of intense attosecond(12) and few-femtosecond(13) extreme-ultraviolet pulses, our results unfold opportunities to carry out ultrafast manipulation of coherent processes at short wavelengths using free-electron lasers.

TI A Quantum Spatial Graph Convolutional Network for Text Classification
SO COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The data generated from non-Euclidean domains and its graphical representation (with complex-relationship object interdependence) applications has observed an exponential growth. The sophistication of graph data has posed consequential obstacles to the existing machine learning algorithms. In this study, we have considered a revamped version of a semi-supervised learning algorithm for graph-structured data to address the issue of expanding deep learning approaches to represent the graph data. Additionally, the quantum information theory has been applied through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate Riemannian metrics in closed-form of several graph layers. In further, to pre-process the adjacency matrix of graphs, a new formulation is established to incorporate high order proximities. The proposed scheme has shown outstanding improvements to overcome the deficiencies in Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), particularly, the information loss and imprecise information representation with acceptable computational overhead. Moreover, the proposed Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (QGCN) has significantly strengthened the GCN on semi-supervised node classification tasks. In parallel, it expands the generalization process with a significant difference by making small random perturbations AG of the graph during the training process. The evaluation results are provided on three benchmark datasets, including Citeseer, Cora, and PubMed, that distinctly delineate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of computational accuracy against state-of-the-art GCN and three other methods based on the same algorithms in the existing literature.

TI Phonon Blockade in a Hybrid Quadratically Coupled Optomechanical System
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Phonon statistics in a hybrid optomechanical system, where a mechanical resonator is quadratically coupled to a cavity and couples with another resonator via Coulomb interaction is studied. It is found that the conventional and unconventional phonon blockade can be both achieved at the same parameter regime, which is confirmed by analytical and numerical results. By analyzing the energy level structure, it is found that the anharmonicity of the system is the joint action of both the Coulomb interaction and the optomechanical coupling, where the nonlinearity introduced by the latter has a more significant effect on one branch of the conventional phonon blockade. In addition, the phonon blockade can be enhanced by introducing the mechanical parametric amplifier with optimal parameters, where the physical mechanism underlying comes from the multi-pathway destructive interference. It is found that the phonon blockade is fragile toward thermal noise due to the weak quantum interference, which can be overcome by increasing the driving strength and applying the mechanical parametric amplifier with suitable parameters. This work may provide a way to manipulate the phonon blockade and can be helpful to the application of quantum information processing.
   The study explores phonon statistics in a hybrid quadratically coupled optomechanical system. The conventional and unconventional phonon blockade with different physical mechanisms can be achieved and enhanced by adjusting the parameters. The influence of thermal noise and its corresponding improvement methods are also discussed. image

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The term Poincare beam, which describes the space-variant polarization of a light beam carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), plays an important role in various optical applications. Since the radius of a Poincare beam conventionally depends on the topological charge number, it is difficult to generate a stable and high-quality Poincare beam by two optical vortices with different topological charge numbers, as the Poincare beam formed in this way collapses upon propagation. Here, based on an all-dielectric metasurface platform, we experimentally demonstrate broadband generation of a generalized perfect Poincare beam (PPB), whose radius is independent of the topological charge number. By utilizing a phase-only modulation approach, a single-layer spin-multiplexed metasurface is shown to achieve all the states of PPBs on the hybrid-order Poincare Sphere for visible light. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept demonstration, a metasurface encoding multidimensional SAM and OAM states in the parallel channels of elliptical and circular PPBs is implemented for optical information encryption. We envision that this work will provide a compact and efficient platform for generation of PPBs for visible light, and may promote their applications in optical communications, information encryption, optical data storage and quantum information sciences. Well-controlled Poincare beams are potentially useful in optical communications applications. Here, the authors present phase-only metasurfaces that generate broadband, perfect Poincare beams in the visible, with radius independent of the topological number.

TI Entanglement Thresholds of Doubly Parametric Quantum Transducers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Doubly parametric quantum transducers, such as electro-optomechanical devices, show promise for providing the critical link between quantum information encoded in highly disparate frequencies such as in the optical and microwave domains. This technology would enable long-distance networking of superconducting quantum computers. Rapid experimental progress has resulted in impressive reductions in decoherence from mechanisms such as thermal noise, loss, and limited cooperativities. However, the fundamental requirements on transducer parameters necessary to achieve quantum operation have yet to be characterized. In this work we find simple, protocol-independent expressions for the necessary and sufficient conditions under which doubly parametric transducers in the resolved-sideband, steady-state limit are capable of entangling optical and microwave modes. Our analysis treats the transducer as a two-mode bosonic Gaussian channel capable of both beamsplitter-type and two-mode squeezing-type interactions between optical and microwave modes. For the beamsplitter-type interaction, we find parameter thresholds that distinguish regions of the channel???s separability, capacity for bound entanglement, and capacity for distillable entanglement. By contrast, the two-mode squeezing-type interaction always produces distillable entanglement with no restrictions on temperature, cooperativities, or losses. Counterintuitively, for both interactions, we find that achieving quantum operation does not require either a quantum cooperativity exceeding one, or ground-state cooling of the mediating mode. Finally, we discuss where two state-of-the-art implementations are relative to these thresholds and show that current devices operating in either mode of operation are in principle capable of entangling optical and microwave modes.

TI Color image encryption algorithm based on DNA code and alternating
   quantum random walk
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, image encryption technology has attracted much attention. As people pay more attention to communication privacy and network security, the requirements for information encryption technology are more stringent. As one of the information carriers, images are valuable for carrying the effectiveness and vividness of the information. This paper proposes a color image encryption algorithm based on DNA encoding and alternating quantum random walk. Quantum random walk is an excellent cryptographic tool that participates in all parts of the algorithm process, and DNA encoding is used as the core encryption method to complete the algorithm. This article describes the encryption and decryption process in detail, and conducts simulation experiments to verify and analyze the results of the proposed algorithm. In the simulation stage, we design the simulation key parameters, encode the color image encryption and decryption experiments, and carry out related analysis. The experimental results show that the color image encryption algorithm proposed in this paper can perform safe and effective color image encryption. The correlation analysis shows that the image histogram after encryption is stable, the pixel correlation coefficient approaches 0, and the key space is 2(128), the three-channel information entropy reaches more than 7.997, which can resist statistical attacks, brute force attacks and other attack methods. In addition, DNA coding has unique biological characteristics in addition to the novel coding and calculation methods, which provide new ideas and directions for cryptographic research.

TI IR linewidth and intensity amplifications of nitrile vibrations report
   nuclear-electronic couplings and associated structural heterogeneity in
   radical anions
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Conjugated molecular chains have the potential to act as "molecular wires" that can be employed in a variety of technologies, including catalysis, molecular electronics, and quantum information technologies. Their successful application relies on a detailed understanding of the factors governing the electronic energy landscape and the dynamics of electrons in such molecules. We can gain insights into the energetics and dynamics of charges in conjugated molecules using time-resolved infrared (TRIR) detection combined with pulse radiolysis. Nitrile nu(C equivalent to N) bands can act as IR probes for charges, based on IR frequency shifts, because of their exquisite sensitivity to the degree of electron delocalization and induced electric field. Here, we show that the IR intensity and linewidth can also provide unique and complementary information on the nature of charges. Quantifications of IR intensity and linewidth in a series of nitrile-functionalized oligophenylenes reveal that the C equivalent to N vibration is coupled to the nuclear and electronic structural changes, which become more prominent when an excess charge is present. We synthesized a new series of ladder-type oligophenylenes that possess planar aromatic structures, as revealed by X-ray crystallography. Using these, we demonstrate that C equivalent to N vibrations can report charge fluctuations associated with nuclear movements, namely those driven by motions of flexible dihedral angles. This happens only when a charge has room to fluctuate in space.

TI Controlling directed atomic motion and second-order tunneling of a
   spin-orbit-coupled atom in optical lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically explore the tunneling dynamics for the tight-binding model of a single spin-orbit-coupled atom trapped in an optical lattice subjected to lattice shaking and to time-periodic Zeeman field. By means of analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate that the spin-orbit (SO) coupling adds some results to the tunneling dynamics in both multiphoton resonance and far-off-resonance parameter regimes. When the driving frequency is resonant with the static Zeeman field (multiphoton resonances), we obtain an unexpected dynamical localization (DL) phenomenon where the single SO-coupled atom is restricted to making perfect two-site Rabi oscillation accompanied by spin flipping. By using the unconventional DL phenomenon, we are able to generate a ratchetlike effect which enables directed atomic motion towards different directions and accompanies periodic spin flipping under the action of SO coupling. For the far-off-resonance case, we show that by suppressing the usual intersite tunneling alone, it is possible to realize a type of spin-conserving second-order tunneling between next-nearest-neighboring sites, which is not accessible in the conventional lattice system without SO coupling. We also show that simultaneous controls of the usual intersite tunneling and the SO-coupling-related second-order tunneling are necessary for quasienergies flatness (collapse) and completely frozen dynamics to exist. These results may be relevant to potential applications such as spin-based quantum information processing and design of spintronics devices.

TI Broadening mechanisms of donor-bound exciton photoluminescence in
   Ga-doped ZnO nanowires
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Donor spins in ZnO NWs have promise for quantum information (QI) applications due to high crystalline quality, narrow excitonic luminescence linewidths, and a direct bandgap of this material. It is important to understand the processes that can lead to inhomogeneous broadening of the excitonic transitions for realization of QI devices. We investigate the effect of Ga dopant concentration on the low temperature photoluminescence (PL) of Ga-doped ZnO nanowires. Spectrometer-resolution-limited donor-bound exciton ((DX)-X-0) PL lines are observed at low concentrations with linewidths of around 0.1 meV. A clear increase in the Ga (DX)-X-0 line is observed as trace amounts of Ga are added. Above a certain concentration threshold, we observe a strong increase in the lateral growth coupled with a significant tail on the low energy side of the (DX)-X-0 emission, which scales linearly with dopant precursor concentration. We have analyzed this behavior using different models, including a model based on a bound exciton wavefunction overlap with neigbhouring donors and a Stark effect model due to random charged impurities. We rule out both of these models based on PL excitation spectroscopy measurements and show that a simple exponential model of the Urbach form gives the best fit and points to disorder in the more heavily doped shells.

TI Broadband silicon nitride integrated polarization rotators at 780 nm
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Polarization management, and in particular polarization rotation, is becoming increasingly important for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). While fiber-optic networks are generally polarization insensitive, the large aspect ratio of high-index-contrast PIC waveguides leads to a large polarization-dependent response of integrated components such as waveguides, optical cavities, couplers, etc. Although foundry-processed polarization rotators operating at telecom and datacom wavelengths (C- and O-band) have been demonstrated, to date, there have been few reports of devices operating at shorter wavelengths. This work demonstrates silicon nitride (SiN) polarization rotators operating from lambda = 700-1000 nm (the I/Z-band) that take advantage of optical coupling between two waveguiding layers in a standard foundry process. We demonstrate a broadband white-light polarization measurement setup that enables precise characterization of the polarization-dependent transmission of photonic waveguide devices. Measurements on foundry-processed devices confirm full TE-to-TM rotation exhibiting a maximum polarization extinction ratio (PER) approaching 20 dB (limited by our measurement setup), and an exceptionally large bandwidth of up to 160 nm with an insertion loss less than 0.2 dB. Beam propagation method (3D-BPM) simulations show good agreement with experimental data and enable the device parameters to be adjusted to accommodate different operating wavelengths and geometries with no changes to the existing foundry process. This work opens up opportunities for applications in quantum information and bio-sensing where operation at lambda < 1000nm is needed.

TI The quest for harnessing nuclear effects in graphene-based devices
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The recent successes of superconducting qubits and the demonstration of quantum supremacy over classical bits herald a new era for information processing. Yet, the field is still in its infancy and there exist viable alternative candidates that can also store quantum information. In this review, we will highlight ideas, attempts, and the experimental progress to address nuclear spins in graphene, a readily available Dirac semimetal that consists of a single layer of carbon atoms. Carbon isotopes with a nuclear spin are rare in natural graphene. However, it is possible to enrich the spin-bearing C-13 isotopes to produce large-scale graphene sheets, which constitute the testbed to store, transport, and retrieve spin information, or to engineer nanostructures. Here, the hyperfine interaction between the electron spins and the nuclear spins serves as an experimental control knob and mediator to address nuclear polarization and nuclear spin coherence times through electrical measurements. The exploitation of nuclear spins in graphene is thus an alluring perspective. We will discuss methods to synthesize C-13 graphene and show experimental approaches and challenges to exploit the relatively weak hyperfine interaction in two-dimensional C-13 graphene devices. The ultimate purpose, i.e., the exploitation of nuclear spins in graphene for information processing, is not within reach, but its potential for future applications merits a revisit of the current state-of-the-art.

TI Determination of the asymptotic limits of adaptive photon counting
   measurements for coherent-state optical phase estimation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Physical realizations of the canonical phase measurement for the optical phase are unknown. Single-shot phase estimation, which aims to determine the phase of an optical field in a single shot, is critical in quantum information processing and metrology. Here we present a family of strategies for single-shot phase estimation of coherent states based on adaptive non-Gaussian, photon counting, measurements with coherent displacements that maximize information gain as the measurement progresses, which have higher sensitivities over the best known adaptive Gaussian strategies. To gain understanding about their fundamental characteristics and demonstrate their superior performance, we develop a comprehensive statistical analysis based on Bayesian optimal design of experiments, which provides a natural description of these non-Gaussian strategies. This mathematical framework, together with numerical analysis and Monte Carlo methods, allows us to determine the asymptotic limits in sensitivity of strategies based on photon counting designed to maximize information gain, which up to now had been a challenging problem. Moreover, we show that these non-Gaussian phase estimation strategies have the same functional form as the canonical phase measurement in the asymptotic limit differing only by a scaling factor, thus providing the highest sensitivity among physically-realizable measurements for single-shot phase estimation of coherent states known to date. This work shines light into the potential of optimized non-Gaussian measurements based on photon counting for optical quantum metrology and phase estimation.

TI Quantum control of nuclear-spin qubits in a rapidly rotating diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nuclear spins in certain solids couple weakly to their environment, making them attractive candidates for quantum information processing and inertial sensing. When coupled to the spin of an optically active electron, nuclear spins can be rapidly polarized, controlled, and read via lasers and radio-frequency (rf) fields. Possessing typical coherence times of several milliseconds at room temperature, nuclear spins hosted by a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond are thus intriguing systems to observe how classical physical rotation at quantum timescales affects a quantum system. In this work, we demonstrate optical nuclear-spin polarization and rapid quantum control of nuclear spins in a diamond physically rotating at 1 kHz, faster than the nuclear-spin coherence time. Free from the need to maintain strict field alignment, we are able to measure and control nuclear spins in the presence of a large, time-varying magnetic field that makes an angle of more than 100 degrees to the nitrogen-lattice vacancy axis. The field induces spin mixing between the electron and nuclear states of the qubits, decoupling them from oscillating rf fields. We are able to demonstrate that coherent spin state control is possible at any point of the rotation. We combine continuous dynamical decoupling with feed-forward control to eliminate decoherence induced by imperfect mechanical rotation. Our work liberates a previously inaccessible degree of freedom of the NV nuclear spin, unlocking new approaches to quantum control and rotation sensing.

TI Dark-state engineering in Fock-state lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fock-state lattices (FSLs) are becoming an emerging research hotspot in quantum physics, not only because the FSLs provide a new perspective for studying atom-field interactions, but also because they build a connection between quantum optics and condensed matter physics. Because of the multiple transition paths in the lattices, an inherent quantum interference effect exists in these systems, and hence finding new quantum-coherent phenomena and exploiting their applications become a significant and desired task in this field. In this work, we study the dark-state effect in the FSLs generated by the multimode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) models. By considering the FSLs in certain excitation-number subspaces, we study the dark states with respect to the states associated with the atomic excited state using the arrowhead-matrix method. We find that dark-state subspaces exist with dimensions determined by the number of orthogonal dark states. When the dimension is greater than one, the forms of these dark-state bases are not unique. Further, we obtain the number and form of the orthogonal dark states in the two-, three-, and four-mode JC models. In addition, we find that for a general N-mode JC model, N+n-2 orthogonal dark states in the n-excitation subspace. We also build the relationship between the dark states and dark modes. Our work paves the way for exploring quantum optical effects and quantum information processing based on the FSLs.

TI Heterostructured engineering of topological insulators/metal-organic
   frameworks for efficient electrocatalytic overall water splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Topological insulators (TIs) exhibit exceptional versatility due to their distinctive spin-polarized surface states and robust electronic properties, rendering them promising for applications in quantum information processing and electrocatalysis. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is proposed, coupled with heteroatom doping synergistic electronic modulation, to directly synthesis bifunctional Bi2Se3 topological insulator-based electrocatalysts with hexagonally packed platelets architectures. Specifically, appropriate Fe doping modulates the electronic structure and formation energy of Bi2Se3, while the heterostructure with ZIF-67 further synergistically optimizes charge transfer and reaction kinetics. As anticipated, the hierarchical Fe-doped Bi2Se3/ZIF-67 heterojunction catalyst on carbon cloth (denoted as Fe-BZ/CC), fabricated via hydrothermal and self-assembly methods, displays remarkable catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, along with encouraging durability. Satisfactorily, the asprepared Fe-BZ/CC can drive current density of 10 mA cm-2 at ultralow overpotentials of 250 and 270 mV, for HER and OER in alkaline media, respectively, surpassing the performance of many previously reported topological materials. Furthermore, the two-electrode electrolyzer assembled by Fe-BZ/CC exhibits a cell voltage of 1.90 V at 10 mA cm-2 and demonstrates wonderful stability. Overall, this work presents a promising breakthrough and paves a new way for the design of high-efficiency catalysts based on topological insulator materials, guided by doping and interface engineering strategies.

TI Unifying Non-Markovian Characterization with an Efficient and
   Self-Consistent Framework
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Noise on quantum devices is much more complex than it is commonly given credit. Far from usual models of decoherence, nearly all quantum devices are plagued by both a continuum of environments and temporal instabilities. These induce noisy quantum and classical correlations at the level of the circuit. The relevant spatiotemporal effects are difficult enough to understand, let alone combat. There is presently a lack of either scalable or complete methods to address the phenomena responsible for scrambling and loss of quantum information. Here, we make deep strides to remedy this problem. We establish a theoretical framework that uniformly incorporates and classifies all non-Markovian phenomena. Our framework is universal, assumes no parameters values, and is written entirely in terms of experimentally accessible circuit-level quantities. We formulate an efficient reconstruction using tensor network learning, allowing also for easy modularization and simplification based on the expected physics of the system. This is then demonstrated through both extensive numerical studies and implementations on IBM Quantum devices, estimating a comprehensive set of spacetime correlations. Finally, we conclude our analysis with applications thereof to the efficacy of control techniques to counteract these effects-including noise-aware circuit compilation and optimized dynamical decoupling. We find significant improvements are possible in the diamond norm and average gate fidelity of arbitrary SU(4) operations, as well as related decoupling improvements in contrast to off-the-shelf schemes.

TI Four-wave mixing based spectral Talbot amplifier for programmable
   purification of optical frequency combs
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Optical frequency combs (OFCs) with programmable free spectral range and high optical carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) play a crucial role indiverse research fields, including telecommunications, spectroscopy, quantum information, astronomy, sensing, and imaging. Unfortunately,the presence of stochastic noise often results in degraded optical CNR, leading to limited communication performance and measurementaccuracy in comb-based systems. There is a lack of effective and flexible methods to improve the CNR of OFCs contaminated by broadbandnoise, hampering their widespread utilization. To address this challenge, we propose a four-wave mixing based spectral Talbot amplifier topurify OFCs flexibly. Our approach employs programmable spectral phase filters followed by a nonlinear Kerr medium to regenerate an OFCwith superior CNR. In our experimental demonstration, we regenerated a 165-GHz spaced CNR enhanced OFC from a noise-dominatedcomb source spaced at 11 GHz, achieving up to similar to 11-dB CNR improvement. The technique allows for a user-defined purification factormto range from 7 to 15. Furthermore, our scheme demonstrates flexibility in adjusting the wavelengths of the regenerated comb lines via atunable optical delay line without the need for a tunable seed laser. We also investigated the impact of the pump and signal on the regeneratedcomb experimentally and studied the influence of dispersion mismatch on the suppression of undesired sidebands numerically. Our proposedscheme presents a powerful alternative for programmable purification, manipulation, and detection of noise-dominated spectral waveforms.

TI Morphology Engineering for High-Q Plasmonic Surface Lattice Resonances
   with Large Field Enhancement
SO PHOTONICS
AB Plasmonic surface lattice resonances (SLRs) have endowed plasmonic systems with unprecedently high quality (Q) factors, giving rise to great advantages for light-matter interactions and boosting the developments of nanolaser, photodetector, biosensor and so on. However, it still lacks exploration to develop a strategy for achieving large electric field enhancements (FEs) while maintaining high Q factors of SLRs. Here, we investigate and verify such a strategy by engineering morphologies of plasmonic lattice, in which the influences of geometrical shapes, cross-section areas and structural compositions of particles are investigated. Firstly, we found that the Q factor of a plasmonic SLR is inversely proportional to the square of the cross-section area of the cell particles in the studied cases. Secondly, larger FEs of SLRs appear when the separated cell particles support stronger FEs. By combining these effects of particle morphology, we achieve a plasmonic SLR with Q factor and FE up to 2100 and 592 times, respectively. Additionally, supported by the derived connections between the Q factors and FEs of SLRs and the properties of cell particles, the property optimizations of SLRs can be done by optimizing the separated particles, which are distinctly time-saving in simulations. These results provide a guideline for the design of high-performance optical nanocavities, and can benefit a variety of fields including biosensing, nonlinear optics and quantum information processing.

TI An In-Plane Single-Photon Emitter Combining a Triangular Split-Ring
   Micro-Optical Resonator and a Colloidal Quantum Dot
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB We propose a simple and innovative configuration consisting of a quantum dot and micro-optical resonator that emits single photons with good directionality in a plane parallel to the substrate. In this device, a single quantum dot is placed as a light source between the slits of a triangular split-ring micro-optical resonator (SRR) supported in an optical polymer film with an air-bridge structure. Although most of the previous single photon emitters in solid-state devices emitted photons upward from the substrate, operation simulations confirmed that this configuration realizes lateral light emission in narrow regions above, below, left, and right in the optical polymer film, despite the absence of a light confinement structure such as an optical waveguide. This device can be fabricated using silica-coated colloidal quantum dots, focused ion beam (FIB) lithography, and wet etching using an oxide layer on a silicon substrate as a sacrificial layer. The device has a large tolerance to the variation in the position of the SRR in the optical polymer film and the height of the air-bridge. We confirmed that Pt-SRRs can be formed on the optical polymer film using FIB lithography. This simple lateral photon emitter is suitable for coupling with optical fibers and for fabricating planar optical quantum solid-state circuits, and is useful for the development of quantum information processing technology.

TI Nonassociative gauge gravity theories with R-flux star products and
   Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization in algebraic quantum field theory
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, and quantum gravity, QG, models naturally arise as star product and R-flux deformations considered in string/M-theory. Such nonassociative and noncommutative geometric and quantum information theories were formulated on phase spaces defined as cotangent Lorentz bundles enabled with nonassociative symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics and nonlinear and linear connection structures. We outline the analytic methods and proofs that corresponding geometric flow evolution and dynamical field equations can be decoupled and integrated in certain general off-diagonal forms. New classes of solutions describing nonassociative black holes, wormholes, and locally anisotropic cosmological configurations are constructed using such methods. We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky, BV, formalism for quantizing modified gravity theories, MGTs, involving twisted star products and semi-classical models of nonassociative gauge gravity with de Sitter/affine/ Poincar & eacute; double structure groups. Such theories can be projected on Lorentz spacetime manifolds in certain forms equivalent to GR or MGTs with torsion generalizations etc. We study the properties of the classical and quantum BV operators for nonassociative phase spaces and nonassociative gauge gravity. Recent results and methods from algebraic QFT are generalized to involve nonassociative star product deformations of the anomalous master Ward identity. Such constructions are elaborated in a nonassociative BV perspective and for developing non-perturbative methods in QG.

TI Effect of group-velocity dispersion on the generation of multimode
   pulsed squeezed light in a synchronously pumped optical parametric
   oscillator
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal is a widely employed technique for generating quadrature squeezed light with multiple modes, which finds applications in quantum metrology, quantum information and communication. Here we study the generation of temporally multimode femtosecond pulsed squeezed light in a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) operating below the oscillation threshold, while considering the presence of non-compensated intracavity group-velocity dispersion. Based on the developed time-domain model of the system, we show that the dispersion results in mode-dependent detuning of the broadband supermodes of the pulsed parametric process from the cavity resonance due to temporal Gouy phase, as well as linear coupling between these supermodes. With perturbation theory up to the second order in the coupling coefficients between modes, we obtained a solution for the amplitudes of multiple supermodes given an arbitrary sub-threshold pump level. The dispersion affects the quantum state of the supermodes by influencing their squeezing level and the rotation of the squeezing ellipse. It also affects the entanglement among the supermodes, leading to reduced suppression of shot noise level as measured in the balanced homodyne detection scheme. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of SPOPO with group-velocity dispersion as a testbench for experimental investigations of multimode effects in linearly evanescent coupled parametric oscillators.

TI A thermodynamical model of non-deterministic computation in cortical
   neural networks
SO PHYSICAL BIOLOGY
AB Neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex engage in probabilistic coding, effectively encoding the state of the surrounding environment with high accuracy and extraordinary energy efficiency. A new approach models the inherently probabilistic nature of cortical neuron signaling outcomes as a thermodynamic process of non-deterministic computation. A mean field approach is used, with the trial Hamiltonian maximizing available free energy and minimizing the net quantity of entropy, compared with a reference Hamiltonian. Thermodynamic quantities are always conserved during the computation; free energy must be expended to produce information, and free energy is released during information compression, as correlations are identified between the encoding system and its surrounding environment. Due to the relationship between the Gibbs free energy equation and the Nernst equation, any increase in free energy is paired with a local decrease in membrane potential. As a result, this process of thermodynamic computation adjusts the likelihood of each neuron firing an action potential. This model shows that non-deterministic signaling outcomes can be achieved by noisy cortical neurons, through an energy-efficient computational process that involves optimally redistributing a Hamiltonian over some time evolution. Calculations demonstrate that the energy efficiency of the human brain is consistent with this model of non-deterministic computation, with net entropy production far too low to retain the assumptions of a classical system.

TI Detection of a pair density wave state in UTe2
SO NATURE
AB Spin-triplet topological superconductors should exhibit many unprecedented electronic properties, including fractionalized electronic states relevant to quantum information processing. Although UTe2 may embody such bulk topological superconductivity(1-11), its superconductive order parameter Delta(k) remains unknown(12). Many diverse forms for Delta(k) are physically possible(12) in such heavy fermion materials(13). Moreover, intertwined(14,15) density waves of spin (SDW), charge (CDW) and pair (PDW) may interpose, with the latter exhibiting spatially modulating(14,15) superconductive order parameter Delta(r), electron-pair density(16-19) and pairing energy gap(17,20-23). Hence, the newly discovered CDW state(24) in UTe2 motivates the prospect that a PDW state may exist in this material(24,25). To search for it, we visualize the pairing energy gap with mu eV-scale energy resolution using superconductive scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) tips(26-31). We detect three PDWs, each with peak-to-peak gap modulations of around 10 mu eV and at incommensurate wavevectors P-i=1,P-2,P-3 that are indistinguishable from the wavevectors Q(i=1,2,3) of the prevenient(24) CDW. Concurrent visualization of the UTe2 superconductive PDWs and the non-superconductive CDWs shows that every P-i:Q(i) pair exhibits a relative spatial phase delta phi approximate to pi. From these observations, and given UTe2 as a spin-triplet superconductor(12), this PDW state should be a spin-triplet PDW24,25. Although such states do exist(32) in superfluid He-3, for superconductors, they are unprecedented.

TI Low temperature activation of inert hexagonal boron nitride for metal
   deposition and single atom catalysis
SO MATERIALS TODAY
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has long been considered chemically inert due to its wide bandgap and robust covalent bonds. Its inertness hinders hBN from functionalization for energy conversion applications. A question arising is whether it is possible to make hBN chemically reactive. Here, we report cryomilling in liquid N-2, as an effective strategy to activate the chemical reactivity of hBN by engineering different vacancies to produce defective-BN (d-BN). The local reactivity of the vacancies is probed by photoluminescence (PL) emissions and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of different vacancies with/without oxygen cause the creation of mid-gap states that are responsible for the PL emissions in the visible region. These vacancies also generate localized free radicals which are both theoretically and experimentally confirmed by spin density calculations and ESR. Due to the vacancy induced free radicals and Fermi level shifts, d-BN can be controllably functionalized with single metal atoms by the spontaneous reduction of metal cations; mono-metallic or bi-metallic clusters can also be effectively reduced. As a proof of concept, the surface-bound metal nanostructures, especially substrate confined single metal atoms, exhibit improved hydrogen evolution catalytic performance, and can be further used for sensing, and quantum information.

TI Atomic excitation delocalization at the clean to disordered interface in
   a chirally-coupled atomic array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In one-dimensional quantum emitter systems, the dynamics of atomic excitations are influenced by the collective coupling between emitters through photon -mediated dipole -dipole interactions. By introducing positional disorders in a portion of the atomic array, we investigate the delocalization phenomena at the interface between the disordered and clean zones. The excitation is initialized as symmetric Dicke states in the disordered zone, and several measures are used to quantify the excitation localization. We first use population imbalance and half -chain entropy to investigate the excitation dynamics under time evolutions, and further investigate the crossover of excitation localization to delocalization via the gap ratio from the eigenspectrum in the reciprocal coupling case. In particular, we study the participation ratio of the whole chain and the photon loss ratio between both ends of the atomic chain, which can be used to quantify the delocalization crossover in the nonreciprocal coupling cases. Furthermore, by increasing the overall size or the ratio of the disordered zone under a fixed number of the whole chain, we observe that excitation localization occurs at a smaller disorder strength in the former case, while in the latter, facilitation of the delocalization appears when a significant ratio of the clean zone to disordered zone is applied. Our results can reveal the competition between the clean zone and the disordered zone sizes on localization phenomenon, give insights to nonequilibrium dynamics in the emitter-waveguide interface, and provide potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Metasurface-Based Orbital Angular Momentum Multi-Dimensional
   Demultiplexer and Decoder
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Light beams possess various dimensions, such as wavelength, spin angular momentum (SAM), and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which are indispensable in numerous optical applications. However, traditional techniques entail multiple attempts to disclose desired optical information, utilizing unwieldy multi-pass systems or mechanically moving parts that are cumbersome to integrate into compact and integrated optical systems. Here, a single-layer dielectric metasurface platform is proposed that enables multi-dimensional demultiplexing and decoding, circumventing the need for conventional bulk optical elements. The platform can demultiplex 3D light parameters (wavelength, SAM, and OAM) and focus them at distinct spatial positions on a designated focal plane, providing a superior alternative to far-field beams for integration with optical fiber and communication chips. The study verifies 132-bit independent channels for a multi-dimensional demultiplexer and demonstrates the metasurface-based component's ability to function as an elliptic polarization decoder through a 4-bit elliptic polarization coding transmission experiment. This work provides a compact and efficient platform for demultiplexing multi-dimensional SAM and OAM states over a broad wavelength range, with potential implications for optical communications, optical data storage, optical information encryption, and quantum information sciences.

TI Ultra-wideband integrated photonic devices on silicon platform: from
   visible to mid-IR
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Silicon photonics has gained great success mainly due to the promise of realizing compact devices in high volume through the low-cost foundry model. It is burgeoning from laboratory research into commercial production endeavors such as datacom and telecom. However, it is unsuitable for some emerging applications which require coverage across the visible or mid infrared (mid-IR) wavelength bands. It is desirable to introduce other wideband materials through heterogeneous integration, while keeping the integration compatible with wafer-scale fabrication processes on silicon substrates. We discuss the properties of silicon-family materials including silicon, silicon nitride, and silica, and other non-group IV materials such as metal oxide, tantalum pentoxide, lithium niobate, aluminum nitride, gallium nitride, barium titanate, piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate, and 2D materials. Typical examples of devices using these materials on silicon platform are provided. We then introduce a general fabrication method and low-loss process treatment for photonic devices on the silicon platform. From an applications viewpoint, we focus on three new areas requiring integration: sensing, optical comb generation, and quantum information processing. Finally, we conclude with perspectives on how new materials and integration methods can address previously unattainable wavelength bands while maintaining the advantages of silicon, thus showing great potential for future widespread applications.

TI Improved parameter targeting in 3D-integrated superconducting circuits
   through a polymer spacer process
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Three-dimensional device integration facilitates the construction of superconducting quantum information processors with more than several tens of qubits by distributing elements such as control wires, qubits, and resonators between multiple layers. The frequencies of resonators and qubits in flip-chip-bonded multi-chip modules depend on the details of their electromagnetic environment defined by the conductors and dielectrics in their vicinity. Accurate frequency targeting therefore requires precise control of the separation between chips and minimization of their relative tilt. Here, we describe a method to control the inter-chip separation by using polymer spacers. With the spacers, we measure a mean tilt of (76 +/- 36) mu rad, and a mean deviation of (0.4 +/- 0.8) mu m from the target inter-chip separation of 10 mu m. We apply this process to coplanar waveguide resonator samples and observe chip-to-chip resonator frequency variations below 50 MHz (approximate to 1%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$\approx 1\%$\end{document}).

TI Dislocation Majorana bound states in iron-based superconductors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We show that lattice dislocations of topological iron-based superconductors such as FeTe1-xSex will intrinsically trap non-Abelian Majorana quasiparticles, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Our theory is motivated by the recent experimental observations of normal-state weak topology and surface magnetism that coexist with superconductivity in FeTe1-xSex, the combination of which naturally achieves an emergent second-order topological superconductivity in a two-dimensional subsystem spanned by screw or edge dislocations. This exemplifies a new embedded higher-order topological phase in class D, where Majorana zero modes appear around the "corners" of a low-dimensional embedded subsystem, instead of those of the full crystal. A nested domain wall theory is developed to understand the origin of these defect Majorana zero modes. When the surface magnetism is absent, we further find that s +/- pairing symmetry itself is capable of inducing a different type of class-DIII embedded higher-order topology with defect-bound Majorana Kramers pairs. We also provide detailed discussions on the real-world material candidates for our proposals, including FeTe1-xSex, LiFeAs, beta-PdBi2, and heterostructures of bismuth, etc. Our work establishes lattice defects as a new venue to achieve high-temperature topological quantum information processing.
   The authors propose that screw or edge dislocations can trap Majorana zero modes in the absence of an external magnetic field. They predict that the Majoranas will appear as second-order topological modes on the four corners of an embedded 2D subsystem defined by the cutting plane of the dislocation.

TI Steering coherence in quantum dots by carriers injection via tunneling
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Coherent control is a key experimental technique for quantum optics and quantum information processing. We demonstrate a new degree of freedom in coherent control of semiconductor quantum dot (QD) ensembles operating at room temperature using the tunneling injection (TI) processes in which charge carriers tunnel directly from a quantum well reservoir to QD confined states. The TI scheme was originally proposed and implemented to improve QD lasers and optical amplifiers, by providing a direct injection path of cold carriers thereby eliminating the hot carrier injection problem which enhances gain nonlinearity. The impact of the TI processes on the coherent time of the QDs was never considered, however. We show here that since the cold carriers that tunnel to the oscillating QD state are incoherent, the rate of injection determines the coherent time of the QDs thereby controlling coherent light-matter interactions. Coherent interactions by means of Rabi oscillations were demonstrated in absorption and for weak excitation pulses in the gain regime. However, Rabi oscillations are totally diminished under strong excitation pulses which increase the rate of stimulated emission, causing the tunneling processes to dominate what shortens the coherence time significantly. Since the tunneling rate, and hence, the coherence time, were controlled by the optical excitation and electrical bias, our finding paves the way for TI-based coherence switching on a sub-picosecond time scale in room-temperature semiconductor nanometric structures.

TI Ag-Diamond Core-Shell Nanostructures Incorporated with Silicon-Vacancy
   Centers
SO ACS MATERIALS AU
AB Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond have attracted attention as highly stable fluorophores for sensing and as possible candidates for quantum information science. While prior studies have shown that the formation of hybrid diamond-metal structures can increase the rates of optical absorption and emission, many practical applications require diamond plasmonic structures that are stable in harsh chemical and thermal environments. Here, we demonstrate that Ag nanospheres, produced both in quasi-random arrays by thermal dewetting and in ordered arrays using electron-beam lithography, can be completely encapsulated with a thin diamond coating containing SiV centers, leading to hybrid core-shell nanostructures exhibiting extraordinary chemical and thermal stability as well as enhanced optical properties. Diamond shells with a thickness on the order of 20-100 nm are sufficient to encapsulate and protect the Ag nanostructures with different sizes ranging from 20 nm to hundreds of nanometers, allowing them to withstand heating to temperatures of 1000 degrees C and immersion in harsh boiling acid for 24 h. Ultrafast photoluminescence lifetime and super-resolution optical imaging experiments were used to study the SiV properties on and off the core-shell structures, which show that the SiV on core-shell structures have higher brightness and faster decay rate. The stability and optical properties of the hybrid Ag-diamond core-shell structures make them attractive candidates for high-efficiency imaging and quantum-based sensing applications.

TI Generation of nonclassical optomagnonic states under the influences of
   Stokes scattering process and thermal noise
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a theoretical model for a hybrid optomagnonic system, i.e., a ferromagnetic YIG sphere that supports two optical modes and a magnon mode. The system is considered under the influences of dissipation process, thermal noise, and the Stokes scattering process. In particular, the quantum statistics of particles is evaluated via the dynamical evolution of their respective second-order correlation functions. Generally, the system can provide strong nonclassical features such that both strong antibunching and blockade effects can be realized in the patterns of the photon and magnon quantum statistics. Since the particles lose their nonclassical features in the presence of environmental effects, therefore a quantum-classical crossover takes place, i.e., the antibunched photons are transformed into the bunched particles. Such a crossover may be expected in the patterns of magnon statistics, too. Applying a weak driving field accompanied with a small value of the reorganization parameter facilitates the magnon blockade effect and strong magnon antibunching. Our analyses show that thermal noise degrades the nonclassical features stemming from the individual system components (auto-correlation). In contrast, thermal noise may provide a larger window for realizing the nonclassical properties originated from the joint system components (cross-correlation). Interestingly, when the system includes a small number of particles both correlation and anti-correlation features may be enhanced even in the presence of thermal noise. The nonclassical optomagnonic states can be utilized in various applications, including quantum information processing, sensing, and the study of fundamental quantum mechanics.

TI Magnetic exchange interaction between unpaired π- and d-electrons in
   nanographene-metal coordination complexes
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB The combination of open-shell nanographenes (NGs) and magnetic transition metals holds great promise for generating various new quantum phases applicable in spintronics and quantum information technologies. However, a crucial aspect in accomplishing this is to comprehend the magnetic exchange interactions between unpaired pi- and d-electrons, a topic that has been seldom addressed. In this study, we focus on magnetic pi-d exchange interactions between open-shell NGs and a magnetic coordination center of Fe or Co by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We synthesize two sets of NG-metal coordination complexes on a Au(111) substrate, secured by coordination bonds of carboxyl acid-Fe (Co). Through analysis of the excitation spectra, we observe a characteristic exchange coupling of 9 meV (5 meV) between the unpaired pi-electron and the Fe (Co) d-shell electrons. Our experimental findings are qualitatively in agreement with multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations. This work provides evidence that a substantial magnetic exchange coupling can be achieved and engineered in metal-organic coordination systems, paving the way for designing and customizing extended radical metal-organic frameworks with precisely tailored magnetic properties.
   This study demonstrates the achievement of a significant p-d magnetic exchange interaction in metal-nanographene coordination complexes, laying the groundwork for the design and customization of extended radical metal-organic frameworks with collective quantum magnetic properties.

TI The open effective field theory of inflation
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.

TI Implementation and goals of quantum optics experiments in undergraduate
   instructional labs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB As quantum information science and technology (QIST) is becoming more prevalent and occurring not only in research labs but also in industry, many educators are considering how best to incorporate learning about quantum mechanics into various levels of education. Although much of the focus has been on quantum concepts in nonlab courses, current work in QIST has a substantial experimental component. Many instructors of undergraduate lab courses want to provide their students the opportunity to work with quantum experiments. One common way this is done is through a sequence of quantum optics experiments often referred to as the "single-photon experiments." These experiments demonstrate fundamental quantum phenomena with equipment common to research labs; however, they are resource intensive and cannot be afforded by all institutions. It is therefore imperative to know what unique affordances these experiments provide to students. As a starting point, we surveyed and interviewed instructors who use the single-photon experiments in undergraduate courses, asking how and why they use the experiments. We describe the most commonly used experiments in both quantum and beyond-first-year lab courses, the prevalence of actions the students perform, and the learning goals, ranging from conceptual knowledge to lab skills to student affect. Finally, we present some strategies from these data demonstrating how instructors have addressed the common challenges of preparing students to work with conceptually and technically complex experiments and balancing the practice of technical skills with the completion of the experiments.

TI Transient quantum beatings of trions in hybrid organic tri-iodine
   perovskite single crystal
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Utilizing the spin degree of freedom of photoexcitations in hybrid organic inorganic perovskites for quantum information science applications has been recently proposed and explored. However, it is still unclear whether the stable photoexcitations in these compounds correspond to excitons, free/trapped electron-hole pairs, or charged exciton complexes such as trions. Here we investigate quantum beating oscillations in the picosecond time-resolved circularly polarized photoinduced reflection of single crystal methyl-ammonium tri-iodine perovskite (MAPbI(3)) measured at cryogenic temperatures. We observe two quantum beating oscillations (fast and slow) whose frequencies increase linearly with B with slopes that depend on the crystal orientation with respect to the applied magnetic field. We assign the quantum beatings to positive and negative trions whose Lande g-factors are determined by those of the electron and hole, respectively, or by the carriers left behind after trion recombination. These are g([001])(e) = 2.52 and g([1 (1) over bar0])(e) = 2.63 for electrons, whereas vertical bar g([001])(h)vertical bar = 0.28 and vertical bar g([1 (1) over bar0])(h)vertical bar = 0.57 for holes. The obtained g-values are in excellent agreement with an 8-band K.P calculation for orthorhombic MAPbI(3). Using the technique of resonant spin amplification of the quantum beatings we measure a relatively long spin coherence time of similar to 11 (6) nanoseconds for electrons (holes) at 4 K.

TI Manipulation and enhancement of the performance of Otto cycle in the
   presence of nonthermal reservoirs
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this work, we investigate the impact of energetic coherence in nonthermal reservoirs on the performance of the Otto cycle. We first focus on the situation where the working substance is a qubit. Due to the existence of coherence of nonthermal reservoir, various anomalous operating regimes such as the engine and refrigerator with efficiencies exceeding Carnot limits, as well as the hybrid refrigerator that can simultaneously achieve cooling and supplying work to an external agent, can occur. We demonstrate that the energetic coherence of the system's steady state plays a significant role in determining the cycle's functions by adding an additional stroke implementing dephasing and phase modulation operations in the cycle. The energetic coherence of the system is necessary to trigger the reservoir's coherence to exert influences on the cycle. We decompose the thermodynamic quantities to the components arising from the populations and coherence of the system, and find that the reservoir's coherence impacts the cycle from two aspects: one is the modification of the system's steady-state populations or temperatures, and the other is the direct contributions to the heat in the interaction between the system and reservoirs. We then explore the scenario where the working substance is two identical qubits, and the reservoirs are common to them. We show that the degenerate coherence of the system in the steady state can enhance the performances of the cycle as different machines. Additionally, the energetic coherence of the reservoir modifies the functions of the cycle still through the energetic coherence of the system rather than their degenerate coherence.

   Surface
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Open-shell organic molecules, including S = 1/2radicals, may provide enhanced properties for several emerging technologies;however, relatively few synthesized to date possess robust thermalstability and processability. We report the synthesis of S = 1/2 biphenylene-fused tetrazolinyl radicals 1 and 2. Both radicals possess near-perfect planar structures basedon their X-ray structures and density-functional theory (DFT) computations.Radical 1 possesses outstanding thermal stability asindicated by the onset of decomposition at 269 degrees C, based on thermogravimetricanalysis (TGA) data. Both radicals possess very low oxidation potentials<0 V (vs. SCE) and their electrochemical energy gaps, E (cell) approximate to 0.9 eV, are rather low. Magnetic propertiesof polycrystalline 1 are characterized by superconductingquantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry revealing a one-dimensional S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with exchangecoupling constant J '/k approximate to-22.0 K. Radical 1 in toluene glass possessesa long electron spin coherence time, T (m) approximate to 7 mu s in the 40-80 K temperature range, a propertyadvantageous for potential applications as a molecular spin qubit.Radical 1 is evaporated under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)forming assemblies of intact radicals on a silicon substrate, as confirmedby high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Scanningelectron microscope (SEM) images indicate that the radical moleculesform nanoneedles on the substrate. The nanoneedles are stable forat least 64 hours under air as monitored by using X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of thethicker assemblies, prepared by UHV evaporation, indicate radicaldecay according to first-order kinetics with a long half-life of 50 +/- 4 days at ambient conditions.

TI Gradient-descent methods for fast quantum state tomography
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum state tomography (QST) is a widely employed technique for characterizing the state of a quantum system. However, it is plagued by two fundamental challenges: computational and experimental complexity grows exponentially with the number of qubits, rendering experimental implementation and data post-processing arduous even for moderately sized systems. Here, we introduce gradient-descent (GD) algorithms for the post-processing step of QST in discrete- and continuous-variable systems. To ensure physically valid state reconstruction at each iteration step of the algorithm, we use various density-matrix parameterizations: Cholesky decomposition, Stiefel manifold, and projective normalization. These parameterizations have the added benefit of enabling a rank-controlled ansatz, which simplifies reconstruction when there is prior information about the system. We benchmark the performance of our GD-QST techniques against state-of-the-art methods, including constrained convex optimization, conditional generative adversarial networks, and iterative maximum likelihood estimation. Our comparison focuses on time complexity, iteration counts, data requirements, state rank, and robustness against noise. We find that rank-controlled ansatzes in our stochastic mini-batch GD-QST algorithms effectively handle noisy and incomplete data sets, yielding significantly higher reconstruction fidelity than other methods. Simulations achieving full-rank seven-qubit QST in under three minutes on a standard laptop, with 18 GB of RAM and no dedicated GPU, highlight that GD-QST is computationally more efficient and outperforms other techniques in most scenarios, offering a promising avenue for characterizing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Our Python code for GD-QST algorithms is publicly available at github.com/mstorresh/GD-QST.

TI The paradigm of magnetic molecule in quantum matter: Slow molecular spin
   relaxation
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB The quantum nature of single-ion magnets, single-molecule magnets, and single-chain magnets has been manifested among other phenomena by magnetic hysteresis due to slow spin relaxation, competing with fast quantum tunneling at low temperatures. Slow spin relaxation, described by Arrhenius-type law with the effective barrier energies U-eff = 50 cm(-1), was discovered 3 decades ago in paramagnetic Mn-12-acetate complex of oxy-bridged mixed-valence manganese ions, below the blocking temperature T-B = 3 K. In contrast to common magnetic materials, it is governed primarily by magnetic anisotropy, set by zero-splitting of spin states of a magnetic ion in a field of ligands, and spin-lattice coupling. The emerging studies on the border of coordination chemistry, physics of spin systems with reduced dimensionality, and nanotechnologies, were performed in search of routes for enhancement of U-eff and T-B characteristics, in line with increase of operation temperature and quantum correlation time, mandatory for quantum applications. The best results with T-B similar to 80 K and U-eff similar to 1261 cm(-1), were obtained for Dy-III single-ion magnet, so far. Numerous excellent research and review articles address particular activities behind this achievement. It follows, that present challenges are dictated by the rational development of novel, smart magnetic molecules, featured by butterfly cores, cyano-bridges, 2D metal-organic frameworks, and metal-free graphene nanoclusters, as well as stable free radicals, magnetized by spare electrons. These species are briefly considered here with respect to the unique experience of international collaborative activity, established by Prof. Juan Bartolom & eacute;.

TI Mapping of Spin-Wave Transport in Thulium Iron Garnet Thin Films Using

SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Spin waves, collective dynamic magnetic excitations, offer crucial insights into magnetic material properties. Rare-earth iron garnets offer an ideal spin-wave (SW) platform with long propagation length, short wavelength, gigahertz frequency, and applicability to magnon spintronic platforms. Of particular interest, thulium iron garnet (TmIG) has attracted huge interest recently due to its successful growth down to a few nanometers, observed topological Hall effect, and spin-orbit torque-induced switching effects. However, there is no direct spatial measurement of its SW properties. This work uses diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry in combination with SW electrical transmission spectroscopy to study SW transport properties in TmIG thin films. NV magnetometry allows probing spin waves at the sub-micrometer scale, seen by the amplification of the local microwave magnetic field due to the coupling of NV spin qubits with the stray magnetic field produced by the microwave-excited spin waves. By monitoring the NV spin resonances, the SW properties in TmIG thin films are measured as a function of the applied magnetic field, including their amplitude, decay length (approximate to 50 mu m), and wavelength (0.8-2 mu m). These results pave the way for studying spin qubit-magnon interactions in rare-earth magnetic insulators, relevant to quantum magnonics applications.
   The nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry is used to map spin-wave (SW) transport properties of a thulium iron garnet thin film (thickness of 34 nm). A SW decay length approximate to 50 mu m and SW wavelength approximate to 0.8-2 mu m are measured that depend on the applied magnetic field. These results pave the way for using spin waves in rare-earth magnets for magnon spintronics.image

TI Rapid and Non-Destructive Methodology for Measuring Canopy Coverage at
   an Early Stage and Its Correlation with Physiological and Morphological
   Traits and Yield in Sugarcane
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Screening for elite sugarcane genotypes for canopy cover in a rapid and non-destructive way is important to accelerate varietal/clonal selection, and little information is available regarding canopy cover and leaf production, leaf area, biomass production, and cane yield in sugarcane crop. In the present investigation, the digital images of sugarcane crop by using Canopeo software was assessed for their correlation with the physiological and morphological parameters and cane yield production. The results revealed that among the studied parameters, canopy coverage has shown a significantly better correlation with the plant height (0.581 **), leaf length (0.853 **), leaf width (0.587 **), and leaf area (0.770 **) in commercial sugarcane clones. Two-way cluster analysis has led to the identification of Co 0238, Co 86249, Co 10026, Co 99004, Co 94008, and Co 95020 with better physiological traits for higher sugarcane yield under changing climate. Additionally, in another field experiment with pre-breeding, germplasm, and interspecific hybrid sugarcane clones, the canopy coverage showed a significantly better correlation with germination, shoot count, leaf weight, leaf area index, and plant height, and finally with biomass (r = 0.612 **) and cane yield (r = 0.458 **). It has been found that the plant height, total dry matter (TDM), and leaf area index (LAI) had significant correlation with the cane yield, and the canopy cover data from digital images act as a surrogate for these traits, and further it has been observed that CC had better correlation with cane yield compared to the other physiological traits viz., SPAD, total chlorophyll (TC), and canopy temperature (CT) under ambient conditions. Light interception determined using a line quantum sensor had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.764 **) with canopy coverage, signifying the importance of determining the latter in a non-destructive way in a rapid manner and low cost.

TI Ansatz-Independent Variational Quantum Classifiers and the Price of
   Ansatz
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The paradigm of variational quantum classifiers (VQCs) encodes classical information as quantum states, followed by quantum processing and then measurements to generate classical predictions. VQCs are promising candidates for efficient utilizations of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices: classifiers involving M-dimensional datasets can be implemented with only [log(2) M] qubits by using an amplitude encoding. A general framework for designing and training VQCs, however, is lacking. An encouraging specific embodiment of VQCs, quantum circuit learning (QCL), utilizes an ansatz: a circuit with a predetermined circuit geometry and parametrized gates expressing a time-evolution unitary operator; training involves learning the gate parameters through a gradient-descent algorithm where the gradients themselves can be efficiently estimated by the quantum circuit. The representational power of QCL, however, depends strongly on the choice of the ansatz, as it limits the range of possible unitary operators that a VQC can search over. Equally importantly, the landscape of the optimization problem may have challenging properties such as barren plateaus and the associated gradient-descent algorithm may not find good local minima. Thus, it is critically important to estimate (i) the price of ansatz; that is, the gap between the performance of QCL and the performance of ansatz-independent VQCs, and (ii) the price of using quantum circuits as classical classifiers: that is, the performance gap between VQCs and equivalent classical classifiers. This paper develops a computational framework to address both these open problems. First, it shows that VQCs, including QCL, fit inside the well-known kernel method. Next it introduces a framework for efficiently designing ansatz-independent VQCs, which we call the unitary kernel method (UKM). The UKM framework enables one to estimate the first known computationally-determined bounds on both the price of ansatz and the price of any speedup advantages of VQCs: numerical results with datatsets of various dimensions, ranging from 4 to 256, show that the ansatz-induced gap can vary between 10 and 20%, while the VQC-induced gap (between VQC and kernel method) can vary between 10 and 16%. To further understand the role of ansatz in VQCs, we also propose a method of decomposing a given unitary operator into a quantum circuit, which we call the variational circuit realization (VCR): given any parameterized circuit block (as for example, used in QCL), it finds optimal parameters and the number of layers of the circuit block required to approximate any target unitary operator with a given precision.

TI A 3D-printed handheld device for quick citrus tissue lysis and nucleic
   acid extraction
SO ADVANCES IN SAMPLE PREPARATION
AB A 3D-printed handheld device has been developed for rapid and efficient sample preparation, extracting pathogen total nucleic acids from citrus leaves for downstream molecular analysis. With its high-speed motor, knurled lysis chamber for rapid sample lysis, and quick nucleic acid extraction using cellulose paper disks (Whatman CHR1), this device can yield ready-to-use DNA and RNA in just 12 min. All components, except for the motor, wiring, and paper disks, were printed in-house using a PolyJet 3D printer with photosensitive resins. The device was optimized for maximum sample lysis by evaluating operation voltages and chamber features, as measured by DNA and RNA concentrations using a Qubit fluorometer and quantification cycle (Cq) values obtained through qPCR assays. The results showed that the lysis chamber with internal knurling and the motor operated at 7.5 V was sufficient for effective sample lysis in 1 min, achieving RNA concentrations up to 87.6 % of those obtained with mortar-and-pestle grinding. Paper disk washing and elution conditions were also optimized using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and qPCR assays, where two 1-minute washes and a 100 mu L elution volume resulted in the highest purity and lowest Cq value. The optimized handheld device was validated with citrus sources infected with Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) and Spiroplasma citri (S. citri), demonstrating high detection accuracy (100 %) and low assay variation (CV < 3.8 %) in qPCR-based analysis. Based on these successful results, this device is expected to be broadly applicable to similar viral and bacterial pathogens affecting plants.

TI Ampholytic ion-exchange magnetic beads: a promising tool for selecting
   short fragments in circulating cell-free DNA analysis
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Objective For liquid biopsy of cancer, the extraction of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma is required. We evaluated the efficacy of use of magnetic submicron particles coated with abundant small zwitterions (MSP-ZEWBs) for extracting short fragments of cfDNA.Methods We developed and optimized an MSP-ZEWB-based cfDNA extraction method using ampholytic ion-exchange materials and compared its results with those using a control kit. We measured the cfDNA concentration by quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction and using the Qubit method and analyzed cfDNA fragmentation patterns using a bioanalyzer.Results The fragment size of cfDNA isolated from glycine hydrochloric acid at a pH of 2.2 exhibited a better alignment with the DNA marker. The highest DNA intensity was observed at the final concentration of 0.8% polyethylene glycol 8000. The intensity of cfDNA decreased significantly when isolated from plasma with DNA marker using MSP-ZEWBs with an adsorption buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride or isothiocyanoguanidine. All fragments were successfully extracted using MSP-ZEWBs from both plasma and phosphate-buffered saline. Notably, the intensity of short cfDNA fragments isolated using MSP-ZEWBs remained consistent for recovery of long DNA fragments. indicating a potential selective of small fragments.Conclusion The extraction of plasma cfDNA with MSP-ZEWBs requires no protein denaturation, shows resistance to cells remaining in plasma, and demonstrates higher overall efficiency and better reproducibility than other extraction methods. Use of MSP-ZEWBs may greatly enhance liquid biopsy of cancers through the analysis of plasma cfDNA in clinical practice.

TI Detection of Somatic Mutations with ddPCR from Liquid Biopsy of
   Colorectal Cancer Patients
SO GENES
AB Liquid biopsy and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) show great promise in cancer diagnostics. In this study, we designed a custom droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay for the quantification and quality control of cfDNA isolated from serum. The assay was validated on a group of locally advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and two control groups-patients with hemorrhoids and healthy individuals. The assay shows a high correlation with Qubit measurement (r = 0.976) but offers a higher dynamic range. Mean concentrations of cfDNA were 12.36 ng/mu L, 5.17 ng/mu L, and 0.29 ng/mu L for CRC, hemorrhoid patients, and healthy controls, respectively. The quality of cfDNA was assessed with the measurement of B-cell DNA contamination. On a subset of CRC patients, we compared the mutation status on KRAS (G12A, G12D, G12V, G13D) and BRAF (V600E) genes in the primary tumor and cfDNA isolated from the serum. A total of 70.6% of primary tumor samples were mutated, and the mean fractional abundance of mutations was 9.50%. The matching serum samples were mutated in 38% cases with an average fractional abundance of 0.23%. We conclude that any decisions based solely on the amount of cfDNA present in patient serum must be interpreted carefully and in the context of co-morbidities. This study explores the potential of ddPCR somatic mutations detection from liquid biopsy as a supplement to tissue biopsy in targeted personalized CRC patient management.

TI Theory of Trotter Error with Commutator Scaling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The Lie-Trotter formula, together with its higher-order generalizations, provides a direct approach to decomposing the exponential of a sum of operators. Despite significant effort, the error scaling of such product formulas remains poorly understood. We develop a theory of Trotter error that overcomes the limitations of prior approaches based on truncating the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. Our analysis directly exploits the commutativity of operator summands, producing tighter error bounds for both real- and imaginary-time evolutions. Whereas previous work achieves similar goals for systems with geometric locality or Lie-algebraic structure, our approach holds, in general. We give a host of improved algorithms for digital quantum simulation and quantum Monte Carlo methods, including simulations of second-quantized plane-wave electronic structure, k-local Hamiltonians, rapidly decaying power-law interactions, clustered Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model, and quantum ferromagnets, nearly matching or even outperforming the best previous results. We obtain further speedups using the fact that product formulas can preserve the locality of the simulated system. Specifically, we show that local observables can be simulated with complexity independent of the system size for power-law interacting systems, which implies a Lieb-Robinson bound as a by-product. Our analysis reproduces known tight bounds for first- and second-order formulas. Our higher-order bound overestimates the complexity of simulating a one-dimensional Heisenberg model with an even-odd ordering of terms by only a factor of 5, and it is close to tight for power-law interactions and other orderings of terms. This result suggests that our theory can accurately characterize Trotter error in terms of both asymptotic scaling and constant prefactor.

TI Using High-Frequency PAR Measurements to Assess the Quality of the SIF
   Derived from Continuous Field Observations
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Fluctuations in illumination are one of the major sources for SIF retrieval errors during temporal continuous field measurements. In this study, we propose a method for evaluating the quality of SIF based on simultaneous measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which are acquired using a quantum sensor at a sampling frequency higher than that obtained using spectral measurements. The proposed method is based on the coefficient of variation (known as relative standard deviation) of the high-frequency PAR during a SIF measurement to determine the quality of the SIF value. To evaluate the method, spectral and PAR data of a healthy maize canopy were collected under various illumination conditions, including clear, cloudy, and rapidly fluctuating illumination. The SIF values were retrieved by 3FLD, SFM, and SVD. The results showed that SFM and 3FLD were sensitive to illumination stability. The determination coefficients (R-2) between PAR and SIF extracted by SFM and 3FLD were higher than 0.8 on clear and cloudy days and only approximately 0.48 on the day with rapidly fluctuating illumination. By removing the unqualified data using the proposed method, the R-2 values of SFM and 3FLD on the day of rapidly fluctuating illumination significantly increased to 0.72. SVD was insensitive to illumination stability. The R-2 values of SVD on days with clear, cloudy, and rapidly fluctuating illumination were 0.73, 0.76, and 0.61, respectively. By removing the unqualified data, the R-2 values of SVD were increased to 0.66 on the day with rapidly fluctuating illumination. The results indicated that the quality assessment method based on high-frequency PAR data can eliminate the incorrect SIFs due to unstable illumination. The method can be used to extract more accurate and reliable SIF datasets from long-term field observations for the study of the relationship between SIF and vegetation photosynthesis.

TI Wave-Function Network Description and Kolmogorov Complexity of Quantum
   Many-Body Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Programmable quantum devices are now able to probe wave functions at unprecedented levels. This is based on the ability to project the many-body state of atom and qubit arrays onto a measurement basis which produces snapshots of the system wave function. Extracting and processing information from such observations remains, however, an open quest. One often resorts to analyzing low-order correlation functions-that is, discarding most of the available information content. Here, we introduce wave-function networks-a mathematical framework to describe wave-function snapshots based on network theory. For many-body systems, these networks can become scale-free-a mathematical structure that has found tremendous success and applications in a broad set of fields, ranging from biology to epidemics to Internet science. We demonstrate the potential of applying these techniques to quantum science by introducing protocols to extract the Kolmogorov complexity corresponding to the output of a quantum simulator and implementing tools for fully scalable cross-platform certification based on similarity tests between networks. We demonstrate the emergence of scale-free networks analyzing experimental data obtained with a Rydberg quantum simulator manipulating up to 100 atoms. Our approach illustrates how, upon crossing a phase transition, the simulator complexity decreases while correlation length increases-a direct signature of buildup of universal behavior in data space. Comparing experiments with numerical simulations, we achieve cross-certification at the wave-function level up to timescales of 4 mu s with a confidence level of 90% and determine experimental calibration intervals with unprecedented accuracy. Our framework is generically applicable to the output of quantum computers and simulators with in situ access to the system wave function and requires probing accuracy and repetition rates accessible to most currently available platforms.

TI Maximum PowerPoint Tracking Strategy of Photovoltaic System Based on
   Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization
SO ELECTRICA
AB The basic genetic optimal algorithm tracks the global maximum PowerPoint but needs to work on premature convergence and limited local search, hindering optimal solution guarantees. It prematurely settles on local maxima and needs a robust local search for complex spaces. Despite some global search capacity, its flaws constrain PV conversion system maximum PowerPoint tracking (MPPT) effectiveness. Researchers thus devised an enhanced multiple-group genetic optimal algorithm for MPPT, integrating subgroup division, independent evolution, and periodic communication/sharing to address these limitations. This strategy significantly enhances the diversity of the optimization algorithm, reducing the likelihood of premature convergence. The modified perturbation genetic algorithm (MPGA) integrates the perturbation observation method for cooperative control by introducing perturbations during the evolutionary process, thereby improving the local search capability of the optimization algorithm. While the enhanced multi-group genetic optimization algorithm effectively addresses issues such as early convergence and weak local search, its algorithmic process is relatively complex. The implementation ofa multi-group cooperative control mechanism boosts algorithm performance but comes with an increased computational load. This research introduces a quantum genetic algorithm for MPPT control, employing qubit encoding to achieve high precision and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that in a parallel system incorporating a supercapacitor storage device (SCSD), the output current remains stable at 8.6A, the output voltage reaches 29.4095V at the 6-second mark, and the power output per unit is 252.9217W, resulting in a total power of 767.8434W with a minor 2.31% decrease. Ultracapacitors effectively stabilize the power output, highlighting their essential role in SCSD components.

TI Distinct universality classes of diffusive transport from full counting
   statistics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The hydrodynamic transport of local conserved densities furnishes an effective coarse -grained description of the dynamics of a many -body quantum system. However, the full quantum dynamics contains much more structure beyond the simplified hydrodynamic description. Here we show that systems with the same hydrodynamics can nevertheless belong to distinct dynamical universality classes, as revealed by new classes of experimental observables accessible in synthetic quantum systems, which can, for instance, measure simultaneous site -resolved snapshots of all of the particles in a system. Specifically, we study the full counting statistics of spin transport, whose first moment is related to linear -response transport, but the higher moments go beyond. We present an analytic theory of the full counting statistics of spin transport in various integrable and nonintegrable anisotropic one-dimensional spin models, including the XXZ spin chain. We find that spin transport, while diffusive on average, is governed by a distinct non -Gaussian dynamical universality class in the models considered. We consider a setup in which the left and right half of the chain are initially created at different magnetization densities, and consider the probability distribution of the magnetization transferred between the two half -chains. We derive a closed -form expression for the probability distribution of the magnetization transfer, in terms of random walks on the half-line. We show that this distribution strongly violates the large -deviation form expected for diffusive chaotic systems, and explain the physical origin of this violation. We discuss the crossovers that occur as the initial state is brought closer to global equilibrium. Our predictions can directly be tested in experiments using quantum gas microscopes or superconducting qubit arrays.

TI Efficient Information Retrieval for Sensing via Continuous Measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Continuous monitoring of driven-dissipative quantum-optical systems is a crucial element in the implementation of quantum metrology, providing essential strategies for achieving highly precise measurements beyond the classical limit. In this context, the relevant figure of merit is the quantum Fisher information of the radiation field emitted by the driven-dissipative sensor. Saturation of the corresponding precision limit as defined by the quantum Crame ' r-Rao bound is typically not achieved by conventional, temporally local continuous-measurement schemes such as counting or homodyning. To address the outstanding open challenge of efficient retrieval of the quantum Fisher information of the emission field, we design a novel continuous-measurement strategy featuring temporally quasilocal measurement bases as captured by matrix-product states. Such a measurement can be implemented effectively by injecting the emission field of the sensor into an auxiliary open system, a "quantum-decoder" module, which "decodes" specific input matrix-product states into simple product states as its output field, and performing conventional continuous measurement at the output. We devise a universal recipe for the construction of the decoder by exploiting the time-reversal transformation of quantum-optical input-output channels, thereby establishing a universal method to achieve the quantum Crame ' r-Rao precision limit for generic sensor designs based on continuous measurement. As a by-product, we establish an effective formula for the evaluation of the quantum Fisher information of the emission field of generic drivendissipative open sensors. We illustrate the power of our scheme with paramagnetic open sensor designs including linear force sensors, fiber-interfaced nonlinear emitters, and driven-dissipative many-body sensors, and demonstrate that it can be robustly implemented under realistic experimental imperfections.

TI Visualizing dynamics of charges and strings in (2+1)D lattice gauge
   theories
SO NATURE
AB Lattice gauge theories (LGTs)1, 2, 3-4 can be used to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials5, 6-7. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging, as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits8, 9-10. Here we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a Z2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$\end{document} LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit that prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics by means of a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT, from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement, the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, whereas for strong confinement, transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen11,12. We also demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a new set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.

TI Using crop intercepted solar radiation and vegetation index to estimate
   dry matter yield of Choy Sum
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB An accurate assessment of vegetable yield is essential for agricultural production and management. One approach to estimate yield with remote sensing is via vegetation indices, which are selected in a statistical and empirical approach, rather than a mechanistic way. This study aimed to estimate the dry matter of Choy Sum by both a causality-guided intercepted radiation-based model and a spectral reflectance-based model and compare their performance. Moreover, the effect of nitrogen (N) rates on the radiation use efficiency (RUE) of Choy Sum was also evaluated. A 2-year field experiment was conducted with different N rate treatments (0 kg/ha, 25 kg/ha, 50 kg/ha, 100 kg/ha, 150 kg/ha, and 200 kg/ha). At different growth stages, canopy spectra, photosynthetic active radiation, and canopy coverage were measured by RapidScan CS-45, light quantum sensor, and camera, respectively. The results reveal that exponential models best match the connection between dry matter and vegetation indices, with coefficients of determination (R2) all below 0.80 for normalized difference red edge (NDRE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), red edge ratio vegetation index (RERVI), and ratio vegetation index (RVI). In contrast, accumulated intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (Aipar) showed a significant linear correlation with the dry matter of Choy Sum, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.4 and R2 values of 0.82, implying that the Aipar-based estimation model performed better than that of spectral-based ones. Moreover, the RUE of Choy Sum was significantly affected by the N rate, with 100 kg N/ha, 150 kg N/ha, and 200 kg N/ha having the highest RUE values. The study demonstrated the potential of Aipar-based models for precisely estimating the dry matter yield of vegetable crops and understanding the effect of N application on dry matter accumulation of Choy Sum.

TI Semiconductor optical amplifier-based laser system for cold-atom sensors
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Precise control of atomic systems has led to an array of emerging 'quantum' sensor concepts ranging from Rydberg-atom RF-electric probes to cold-atom interferometer gravimeters. Looking forward, the potential impact of these technologies hinges on their capability to be adapted from laboratory-scale experiments to compact and low-power field-deployable instruments. However, existing setups typically require a bulky and power-hungry laser and optics system (LOS) to prepare, control, and interrogate the relevant atomic system using a variety of frequency-referenced and rapidly reconfigurable laser beams. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) to replace high-power pump lasers and acousto-optic modulators within a simple atom cooling apparatus, looking forward to the ultimate goal of a space-deployable atom interferometer. We find that existing off-the-shelf SOA components operating at relevant wavelengths for Cs and Rb atom cooling (852 and 780 nm, respectively) are able to permit an attractive combination of rapid (sub-microsecond), high extinction ratio (>60-65 dB) switching while acting as power boosters prior to the atom physics package. These attributes enable a radically different, power-efficient approach to LOS design, reducing or eliminating the need for Watt-class laser amplifiers that are unsuitable for flight deployment. Building on these results, we construct a simple and compact all-semiconductor laser/amplifier LOS for atom cooling that is integrated with custom path-to-flight drive electronics. Up to 125 mW of total optical power is delivered to six fiber-coupled channels for magneto-optical-trap-based cooling of a cloud of neutral Cs atoms. The entire LOS, including reference and cooling laser subsystems and control electronics, occupies a volume of 20x20x15 cm and totals DC power consumption of around 13.5 W, and is designed in a modular format so that additional hardware for synthesizing atom interferometry beams may be added through future development efforts. These results indicate the utility of all-semiconductor laser systems for future low-power flyable atom-based sensor instruments.

TI Many-body quantum vacuum fluctuation engines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a many-body quantum engine powered by the energy difference between the entangled ground state of the interacting system and local separable states. Performing local energy measurements on an interacting many-body system can produce excited states from which work can be extracted via local feedback operations. These measurements reveal the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the global ground state in the local basis and provide the energy required to run the engine. The reset part of the engine cycle is particularly simple: The interacting many-body system is coupled to a cold bath and allowed to relax to its entangled ground state. We illustrate our proposal on two types of many-body systems: A chain of coupled qubits and coupled harmonic oscillator networks. These models faithfully represent fermionic and bosonic excitations, respectively. In both cases, analytical results for the work output (average value and standard deviation) and efficiency of the engine are derived. We prove the efficiency is controlled by the "local entanglement gap," the energy difference between the many-body ground state and the lowest-energy eigenstate of the local Hamiltonian. In all the examples analyzed in this work, for a large number of coupled subsystems, the average work output scales linearly or faster and dominates over fluctuations, while the efficiency limits to a constant. In the qubit chain case, we highlight the impact of a quantum phase transition on the engine's performance as work and efficiency sharply increase at the critical point. In the case of a one-dimensional oscillator chain, we show the efficiency approaches unity as the number of coupled oscillators increases, even at finite work output.

TI Monte Carlo Based Techniques for Quantum Magnets with Long-Range
   Interactions
SO ENTROPY
AB Long-range interactions are relevant for a large variety of quantum systems in quantum optics and condensed matter physics. In particular, the control of quantum-optical platforms promises to gain deep insights into quantum-critical properties induced by the long-range nature of interactions. From a theoretical perspective, long-range interactions are notoriously complicated to treat. Here, we give an overview of recent advancements to investigate quantum magnets with long-range interactions focusing on two techniques based on Monte Carlo integration. First, the method of perturbative continuous unitary transformations where classical Monte Carlo integration is applied within the embedding scheme of white graphs. This linked-cluster expansion allows extracting high-order series expansions of energies and observables in the thermodynamic limit. Second, stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo integration enables calculations on large finite systems. Finite-size scaling can then be used to determine the physical properties of the infinite system. In recent years, both techniques have been applied successfully to one- and two-dimensional quantum magnets involving long-range Ising, XY, and Heisenberg interactions on various bipartite and non-bipartite lattices. Here, we summarise the obtained quantum-critical properties including critical exponents for all these systems in a coherent way. Further, we review how long-range interactions are used to study quantum phase transitions above the upper critical dimension and the scaling techniques to extract these quantum critical properties from the numerical calculations.

TI Gaussian-state Ansatz for the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum spin
   lattices
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The study of non-equilibrium dynamics is one of the most important challenges of modern quantum many-body physics, in relationship with fundamental questions in quantum statistical mechanics, as well as with the fields of quantum simulation and computing. In this work we propose a Gaussian Ansatz for the study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin systems. Within our approach, the quantum spins are mapped onto Holstein-Primakoff bosons, such that a coherent spin state - chosen as the initial state of the dynamics - represents the bosonic vacuum. The state of the system is then postulated to remain a bosonic Gaussian state at all times, an assumption which is exact when the bosonic Hamiltonian is quadratic; and which is justified in the case of a nonlinear Hamiltonian if the boson density remains moderate. We test the accuracy of such an Ansatz in the paradigmatic case of the S = 1/2 transverse-field Ising model, in one and two dimensions, initialized in a state aligned with the applied field. We show that the Gaussian Ansatz, when applied to the bosonic Hamiltonian with nonlinearities truncated to quartic order, is able to reproduce faithfully the evolution of the state, including its relaxation to the equilibrium regime, for fields larger than the critical field for the paramagneticferromagnetic transition in the ground state. In particular the spatio-temporal pattern of correlations reconstructed via the Gaussian Ansatz reveals the dispersion relation of quasiparticle excitations, exhibiting the softening of the excitation gap upon approaching the critical field. Our results suggest that the Gaussian Ansatz correctly captures the essential effects of nonlinearities in quantum spin dynamics; and that it can be applied to the study of fundamental phenomena such as quantum thermalization and its breakdown.

TI Ultrafast energy exchange between two single Rydberg atoms on a
   nanosecond timescale
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Rydberg atoms, with their enormous electronic orbitals, exhibit dipole-dipole interactions reaching the gigahertz range at a distance of a micrometre, making them a prominent contender for realizing ultrafast quantum operations. However, such strong interactions between two single atoms have so far never been harnessed due to the stringent requirements on the fluctuation of the atom positions and the necessary excitation strength. Here we introduce novel techniques to explore this regime. First, we trap and cool atoms to the motional quantum ground state of holographic optical tweezers, which allows control of the inter-atomic distance down to 1.5 mu m with a quantum-limited precision of 30 nm. We then use ultrashort laser pulses to excite a pair of these nearby atoms to a Rydberg state simultaneously, far beyond the Rydberg blockade regime, and perform Ramsey interferometry with attosecond precision. This allows us to induce and track an ultrafast interaction-driven energy exchange completed on nanosecond timescales-two orders of magnitude faster than in any other Rydberg experiments in the tweezers platform so far. This ultrafast coherent dynamics gives rise to a conditional phase, which is the key resource for a quantum gate, opening the path for quantum simulation and computation operating at the speed limit set by dipole-dipole interactions with this ultrafast Rydberg platform.
   An array of Rb-87 atoms with inter-atomic distances of 1.5 mu m is prepared by holographic optical tweezers. When a pair of nearby Rb-87 atoms is optically excited to a Rydberg state, the energy exchange between the atoms is observed on a timescale of nanoseconds.

TI Ultracold LiCr: A New Pathway to Quantum Gases of Paramagnetic Polar
   Molecules
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum gases of doubly polar molecules represent appealing frameworks for a variety of cross-disciplinary applications, encompassing quantum simulation and computation, controlled quantum chemistry, and precision measurements. Through a joint experimental and theoretical study, here we explore a novel class of ultracold paramagnetic polar molecules combining lithium alkali and chromium transition metal elements. Focusing on the specific bosonic isotopologue (LiCr)-Li-6-Cr-53, leveraging on the Fermi statistics of the parent atomic mixture and on suitable Feshbach resonances recently discovered, we produce up to 50 x 10(3) ultracold LiCr molecules at peak phase-space densities exceeding 0.1, prepared within the least bound rotationless level of the LiCr electronic sextet ground state X (6)Sigma(+). By also developing new probing methods, we thoroughly characterize the molecular gas, demonstrating the paramagnetic nature of LiCr dimers and the precise control of their quantum state. We investigate their stability against inelastic processes and identify a parameter region where pure LiCr samples exhibit lifetimes exceeding 0.2 s. Parallel to this, we employ state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations to accurately predict the properties of LiCr ground and excited electronic states. This ab initio model, able to reproduce the experimental Li-Cr high-spin, octet scattering length, allows us to identify both efficient paths to coherently transfer weakly bound LiCr dimers to their absolute ground state, and suitable transitions for their subsequent optical manipulation. Our studies establish Li-Cr as a prime candidate to realize ultracold gases of doubly polar molecules with significant electric (3.3 D) and magnetic (5 mu(B)) dipole moments.

TI Quantum fast corner detection algorithm
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Corners are very important local features for an image that can be widely used in many image processing tasks such as object detection, image recognition and data compression. However, current corner detection algorithms are complex and time consuming. In this paper, a new quantum fast corner detection algorithm is proposed taking full advantage of quantum parallelism. The algorithm is implemented in three steps: the 'nucleus' is defined and its neighborhood pixels are determined in the first step. Two thresholds are selected in the second step, and corners are obtained in the third step. The first and second steps are the same as the classical corner detection algorithm. The third step is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the differences between grayscale values of the nucleus and pixels in the neighborhood are calculated, followed by the comparison of those differences with the 'intensity threshold,' then is the quantum measurement on the comparison results, and finally the measured results are organized into an array. In the second stage, the array is used for counting, followed by the comparison of those counted results with the 'accuracy threshold,' and finally the corners are obtained. It is worth noting that through the quantum-classical-quantum mode, quantum resources can be reduced significantly. The analysis in the proposed quantum fast corner detection algorithm shows that the time complexity and quantum delay of the algorithm do not increase with the increase in the size and number of images, and its time complexity is exponentially lower than that of the classical fast corner detection algorithm.

TI Polarons and bipolarons in a two-dimensional square lattice
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quasiparticles and their interactions are a key part of our understanding of quantum many-body systems. Quantum simulation experiments with cold atoms have in recent years advanced our understanding of isolated quasiparticles, but so far they have pro-vided limited information regarding their interactions and possible bound states. Here, we show how exploring mobile impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a two-dimensional lattice can address this problem. First, the spectral properties of individual impurities are examined, and in addition to the attractive and repulsive po-larons known from continuum gases, we identify a new kind of quasiparticle stable for repulsive boson-impurity interactions. The spatial properties of polarons are calculated showing that there is an increased density of bosons at the site of the impurity both for repulsive and attractive interactions. We then derive an effective Schrodinger equation describing two polarons interacting via the exchange of density oscillations in the BEC, which takes into account strong impurity-boson two-body correlations. Using this, we show that the attractive nature of the effective interaction between two polarons com-bined with the two-dimensionality of the lattice leads to the formation of bound states - i.e. bipolarons. The wave functions of the bipolarons are examined showing that the ground state is symmetric under particle exchange and therefore relevant for bosonic impurities, whereas the first excited state is doubly degenerate and odd under particle exchange making it relevant for fermionic impurities. Our results show that quantum gas microscopy in optical lattices is a promising platform to explore the spatial properties of polarons as well as to finally observe the elusive bipolarons.

TI Frequency-tunable magnetic field sensing using continuous-wave optically
   detected magnetic resonance with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a promising candidate to realize practical quantum sensors with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In conventional high-frequency AC magnetometry with NV centers, the setup requires a pulse sequence with an appropriate time synchronization and strong microwave power. To avoid these practical difficulties, AC magnetometry using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) was recently demonstrated. That previous study utilized radio frequency (RF)-dressed states generated by the coherent interaction between the electron spin of the NV center and the RF wave. However, the drawback of this method is that the detectable frequency of the AC magnetic fields is fixed. Here, we propose and demonstrate frequency-tunable magnetic field sensing based on CW-ODMR. In the new sensing scheme, we obtain RF double-dressed states by irradiation with RF fields at two different frequencies. One creates the RF-dressed states and changes the frequency of the target AC field. The other is a target AC field that induces a change in the CW-ODMR spectrum by generating the RF double-dressed states through coherent interaction with the RF-dressed states. The sensitivity of our method is estimated to be comparable to or even higher than that of the conventional method based on the RF field with a single frequency. The estimated bandwidth is 7.5 MHz, higher than that of the conventional method using the RF-dressed states. Our frequency-tunable magnetic field sensor based on CW-ODMR paves the way for new applications in diamond devices.

TI Does the Mott problem extend to Geiger counters?
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB The Mott problem is a simpler version of the quantum measurement problem that asks: Is there a microscopic physical mechanism - based (explicitly or implicitly) only on Schroedinger's equation - that explains why a single alpha particle emitted in a single spherically symmetric s-wave nuclear decay produces a manifestly nonspherically symmetric single track in a cloud chamber? I attempt here to generalize earlier work that formulated such a mechanism. The key ingredient there was identification of sites at which the cross section for ionization by a passing charged particle is near singular at ionization threshold. This near singularity arose from a Penning-like process involving molecular polarization in subcritical vapor clusters. Here, I argue that the same Mott problem question should be asked about Geiger counters. I then define a simple experiment to determine if ionization physics similar to the cloud chamber case takes place in the mica window of a Geiger counter and explains the collimation of wavefunctions that are spherically symmetric outside the counter into linear ion tracks inside. The experiment measures the count rate from a radioactive point source as a function of source-window separation. I have performed a proof of concept of this experiment; results are reported here and support the near-singular-ionization picture. These results are significant in their own right, and they may shed light on physical mechanisms underlying instances of the full quantum measurement problem. I illustrate this for the Stern-Gerlach experiment and a particular realization of superconducting qubits. I conclude by detailing further work required to flesh out these results more rigorously.

TI Dirac oscillator in DSR: A comparative study of Magueijo-Smolin and
   Amelino-Camelia models
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB This investigation examines the one-dimensional Dirac oscillator in the framework of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) , with a comparative analysis of the Magueijo-Smolin (MS) and Amelino-Camelia (AC) formulations up to order O(E2/k2). Exact closed-form energy spectra and non-relativistic (NR) expansions are derived for both particle and antiparticle sectors, revealing distinctive features inherent to each model: a gradual flattening of the energy-level dispersion in the MS realisation and an n-dependent critical deformation scale kc(n) in the AC realisation that constrains the accessible excitation states. Crucially, when k is set to the Planck energy, authentic DSR modifications remain undetectable in laboratory spectroscopic measurements: for energies spanning eV to GeV, relative deviations are bounded by <= 10-38 to 10-18. In light of this, two viable experimental strategies are proposed to optimise detectability: (i) analogue simulation employing a tunable effective deformation parameter keff (e.g., via trapped ions or photonic/microwave lattices) to replicate the anticipated functional dependence of level-spacing perturbations; and (ii) Dirac materials (such as graphene and moir & eacute; heterostructures), wherein engineered departures from linear dispersion mimic DSR-inspired kinematics. Across these platforms, the undeformed regime is seamlessly restored as keff -> infinity. The analytically exact solutions presented here offer precise directives, including parameter regimes, the significance of kc(n), and NR approximations, for empirical inquiries aimed at probing the form of DSR modifications, despite the inaccessibility of genuine Planck-scale effects.

TI Programmable interactions and emergent geometry in an array of atom
   clouds
SO NATURE
AB Interactions govern the flow of information and the formation of correlations between constituents of many-body quantum systems, dictating phases of matter found in nature and forms of entanglement generated in the laboratory. Typical interactions decay with distance and thus produce a network of connectivity governed by geometry-such as the crystalline structure of a material or the trapping sites of atoms in a quantum simulator(1,2). However, many envisioned applications in quantum simulation and computation require more complex coupling graphs including non-local interactions, which feature in models of information scrambling in black holes(3-6) and mappings of hard optimization problems onto frustrated classical magnets(7-11). Here we describe the realization of programmable non-local interactions in an array of atomic ensembles within an optical cavity, in which photons carry information between atomic spins(12-19). By programming the distance dependence of the interactions, we access effective geometries for which the dimensionality, topology and metric are entirely distinct from the physical geometry of the array. As examples, we engineer an antiferromagnetic triangular ladder, a Mobius strip with sign-changing interactions and a treelike geometry inspired by concepts of quantum gravity(5,20-22). The tree graph constitutes a toy model of holographic duality(21,22), in which the quantum system lies on the boundary of a higher-dimensional geometry that emerges from measured correlations(23). Our work provides broader prospects for simulating frustrated magnets and topological phases(24), investigating quantum optimization paradigms(10,11,25,26) and engineering entangled resource states for sensing and computation(27,28).

TI Fast loaded dual species magneto optical trap of cold sodium and
   potassium atoms with light-assisted inter-species interaction
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We present the design, implementation, and detailed experimental characterization and comparison with numerical simulations of twodimensional magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of bosonic Na-23 and K-39 atoms for loading the cold atomic mixture in a dual-species 3DMOT with a large number of atoms. We report our various measurements pertaining to the characterization of two 2D+MOTs via the capture rate in the 3DMOT and also present the optimized parameters for the best performance of the system of the cold atomic mixture. Under the optimized condition, we capture more than 3 x 10(10) K-39 atoms and 5.8 x 10(8) Na-23 atoms in the 3DMOT simultaneously from individual 2D(+) MOTs with a capture rate of 5 x 10(10) and 3.5 x 10(8) atoms/sec for K-39 and Na-23, respectively. We also demonstrate improvements of more than a factor of 5 in the capture rate in the 3DMOT from the cold atomic sources when a relatively high-power ultraviolet light is used to cause light-induced atomic desorption in the 2D(+)MOT glass cells. A detailed study of the light assisted interspecies cold collisions between the co-trapped atoms is presented, and interspecies loss coefficients have been determined to be beta(NaK) similar to 2 x 10(-12) cm(3)/sec. The cold atomic mixture would be useful for further experiments on quantum simulation with ultra-cold quantum mixtures in optical potentials. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled quantum gases
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB We briefly review the recent progress of theories and experiments on spin-orbital-angular-momentum (SOAM)-coupled quantum gases. The coupling between the intrinsic degree of freedom of particles and their external orbital motions widely exists in the universe and leads to a broad variety of fundamental phenomena in both classical physics and quantum mechanics. The recent realization of synthetic SOAM coupling in cold atoms has attracted a great deal of attention and stimulated a large amount of considerations on exotic quantum phases in both Bose and Fermi gases. In this review, we present a basic idea of engineering SOAM coupling in neutral atoms, starting from a semiclassical description of atom-light interaction. Unique features of single-particle physics in the presence of SOAM coupling are discussed. The intriguing ground-state quantum phases of weakly interacting Bose gases are introduced, with emphasis on a so-called angular stripe phase, which has not yet been observed at present. It is demonstrated how to generate a stable giant vortex in a SOAM-coupled Fermi superfluid. We also discuss the topological characters of a Fermi superfluid in the presence of SOAM coupling. We then introduce the experimental achievement of SOAM coupling in 87\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>{87}$$\end{document}Rb Bose gases and its first observation of phase transitions. The most recent development of SOAM-coupled Bose gases in experiments is also summarized. Regarding the controllability of ultracold quantum gases, it opens a new era, from the quantum simulation point of view, to study the fundamental physics resulting from SOAM coupling as well as newly emergent quantum phases.

TI Spontaneous symmetry breaking in frustrated triangular atom arrays due
   to cooperative light scattering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate the presence of an optical phase transition with frustration-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking in a triangular planar atomic array due to cooperative light-mediated interactions. We show how the array geometry of triangle unit cells at low light intensities leads to degenerate collective radiative excitations forming nearly flat bands. We drive degenerate pairs of collective excitations to be equally populated in both the case of the atomic polarization being in the lattice plane and the case of the atomic polarization being perpendicular to it. At higher intensities, above specific threshold values, this symmetry in the populations is spontaneously broken. We also develop an effective few-mode model that provides semianalytic descriptions of the symmetry-breaking threshold and infinite-lattice limit phase transition. Surprisingly, we find how excitations due to dipolar interactions correspond to optical analogs of those found in frustrated magnets and superfluids, with closely related symmetry-breaking mechanisms despite the significant physical differences between these systems, opening the potential for simulating even quantum magnetism. Transmitted light through the array conveys information about symmetry breaking in the hysteresis behavior of the spectrum. Moreover, in a Mott-insulator state, the atomic positions are subject to zero-point quantum fluctuations. Interpreting each stochastic realization as a light-induced quantum measurement of the atomic position configuration, we find how strong nonlinearities and even weak position uncertainties lead to considerable measurement-induced symmetry breaking, while ensemble averaging over many realizations restores the original symmetry and the unbroken state. Larger position uncertainty results in the formation of domains of different broken symmetries.

TI Non-adiabtic population transfer in SU(3) Lie algebra based
   three-level system without the rotating wave approximation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Coherent population transfer in quantum systems is of fundamental importance in many fields such as atomic and molecular collision dynamics, and information processing for qubit systems. Stimulated Raman nonadiabatic passage technique, when implemented in an externally driven three-level system, provides an efficient approach for realizing accelerated population transfer while maintaining robust quantum coherence, with no need of rotating wave approximation. However, previous protocols employ multiple pulses and imply that Rabi frequencies have a few oscillations during dynamical evolution. In this work, under the condition of two-photon resonance, we use a gauge transformation method to inversely design a L-configuration three-level system that can be solved exactly. By using SU(3) transformation, we establish the relationship between Schr & ouml;dinger representation and gauge representation, where the effective Hamiltonian is an Abelian operator. Subsequently, we construct the desired Hamiltonian and further investigate its dynamic behavior. The result shows that by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the control parameters, high-fidelity population transfer can be achieved in ideal evolution. In addition, for the practical case with pulse truncation and intermediate state decay, the fidelities of specific models can reach about 99.996% and 99.983%, respectively. Compared with other existing nonadiabatic quantum control schemes, the present scheme has the distinctive advantages. We achieve the required quantum control by applying only a few sets of Stokes and pump pulses without introducing any additional microwave field. This method does not exhibit Rabi oscillations in the dynamic process, nor does it produce singularities in the pulse itself.

TI Laser manipulation of spin-exchange interaction between alkaline-earth
   atoms in 1S0 and
   3P2 states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ultracold gases of fermionic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms are hopeful candidates for the quantum simulation of many-body physics induced by magnetic impurities (e.g., the Kondo physics), because there are spin-exchange interactions (SEIs) between two atoms in the electronic ground (S-1(0)) and metastable (P-3) state, respectively. Nevertheless, this SEI cannot be tuned via magnetic Feshbach resonance. In this paper, we propose three methods to control the SEI between one atom in the S-1(0) state and another atom in the P-3(2) states or P-3(2) - P-3(0) dressed states, with one or two laser beams. These methods are based on the spin-dependent ac-Stark shifts of the P-3(2) states or the P-3(2) - P-3(0) Raman coupling. We show that due to the structure of alkaline-earth (like) atoms, the heating effects induced by the laser beams of our methods are very weak. For instance, for ultracold Yb atoms, ac-Stark-shift difference of variant spin states of the P-3(2) (F = 3/2) level, or the strength of the P-3(2) - P-3(0) Raman coupling, could be of the order of (2 pi) MHz, while the heating rate (photon scattering rate) is only of the order of Hz. As a result, the Feshbach resonances, with which one can efficiently control the SEI by changing the laser intensity, may be induced by the laser beams with a low-enough heating rate, even if the scattering lengths of the bare interatomic interaction are so small that they are comparable with the length scale associated with the van der Waals interaction.

TI Dissipative quantum chaos unveiled by stochastic quantum trajectories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We define quantum chaos and integrability in open quantum many-body systems as a dynamical property of single stochastic realizations, referred to as quantum trajectories. This definition relies on the predictions of random matrix theory applied to the subset of the Liouvillian eigenspectrum involved in each quantum trajectory. Our approach, which we name spectral statistics of quantum trajectories (SSQT), enables a natural distinction between transient and steady-state quantum chaos as general phenomena in open setups. We test the generality and reliability of the SSQT criterion on several dissipative systems, further showing that an open system with a chaotic structure can evolve towards either a chaotic or integrable steady state. We apply our theoretical framework to two driven-dissipative bosonic systems. First, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, a paradigmatic example of a quantum simulator, clarifying the interplay of integrability, transient, and steady-state chaos across its phase diagram. Our analysis shows the existence of an emergent dissipative quantum chaotic phase, whereas the classical and semiclassical limits display an integrable behavior. In this regime, chaos arises from the quantum and classical fluctuations associated with the dissipation mechanisms. Second, we investigate dissipative quantum chaos in the dispersive readout of a transmon qubit: a measurement technique ubiquitous in superconducting-based quantum hardware. Through the SSQT, we distinguish several regimes where the performance of the measurement instrument can be connected to the integrable or chaotic nature of the underlying driven-dissipative bosonic system. Our work offers a general understanding of the integrable and chaotic dynamics of open quantum systems and paves the way for the investigation of dissipative quantum chaos and its consequences on state-of-the-art noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Quantum Heat Engines with Spin-Chain-Star Systems
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This study investigates a theoretical model of a Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC) that utilizes a working fluid spin-chain-star model. The system consists of a central atom interacting with multiple Heisenberg spin chains. Employing unitary transformations, the spin-chain-star system is transformed into a spin-star model. The work done and heat transferred for three distinct working fluid configurations: the X$X$, XX$XX$, and XYZ$XYZ$ cases are discussed. The efficiency of the heat engine is examined, and a comparative study between the efficiencies of the three configurations is presented. The study assumes two interaction scenarios for the central atom: either with a single chain (resulting in a two-qubit system after transformation) or with three Heisenberg chains. The results demonstrate that increasing the ratio between the central atom's frequency in the hot bath and the cold bath leads to an enhancement in positive work performed for the X$X$ and XX$XX$ cases. In the XYZ$XYZ$ case, the magnitude of this enhancement exhibits a dependence on the system's temperature. The QOC employing the X$X$ configuration working fluid exhibits superior efficiency compared to the other two configurations. Moreover, increasing the central atom's relative frequency improves efficiency for all three cases.
   A quantum Otto cycle model using a central atom interacting with multiple Heisenberg spin chains is examined. The system turns into a spin-star model and work, heat transfer, and efficiency for X, XX, and XYZ configurations are studied. The study explores how frequency and coupling parameters affect performance. The X-configuration demonstrates superior efficiency, with increased central atom frequency. image

TI Rapid Nanopore Sequencing of Positive Blood Cultures Using Automated
   Benzyl-Alcohol Extraction Improves Time-Critical Sepsis Management
SO ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB Background/Objective: Timely identification of bloodstream pathogens is critical for sepsis management; however, PCR inhibitors such as sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) in blood culture broth compromise nucleic acid recovery and long read sequencing. We assessed whether coupling a benzyl alcohol SPS-removal step to the fully automated LabTurbo AIO extractor improves Oxford Nanopore-based pathogen detection. Methods: Thirteen positive blood culture broths were pre-treated with benzyl alcohol and divided: half volumes were purified on the LabTurbo AIO; paired aliquots underwent manual QIAamp extraction. DNA purity was evaluated by NanoDrop and Qubit. Barcoded libraries were sequenced on MinION R9.4.1 flow cells for 6 h. Results: Automated eluates showed a median A(260)/A(280) of 1.92 and A(260)/A(230) of 1.96, versus 1.80 and 1.48 for manual extracts. The automated workflow generated 1.69 x 10(6) total reads compared with 3.9 x 10(5) reads for manual extraction. The median N50 read length increased from 5.9 kb to 8.7 kb, and the median proportion of reads classified to species increased from 62% to 84%. The hands-on time was <5 min and the sample-to-answer turnaround was <8 h, compared with >9 h and 90 min for the manual protocol, respectively. Conclusions: Benzyl alcohol SPS removal integrated into the LabTurbo AIO extractor yielded purer, longer, and higher read counts, enhancing nanopore sequencing depth and accuracy while compressing diagnostic turnaround to a single working day. This represents a practical advance for rapid blood culture pathogen identification in critical care settings.

TI A Scheduling Method for Heterogeneous Signal Processing Platforms Based
   on Quantum Genetic Algorithm
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Currently, many problems such as variable signal resources, complex execution environments, and low efficiency of scheduling algorithms are faced by heterogeneous signal processing platforms. The task scheduling algorithm is one of the key factors that directly affect the performance of the processing platform. In order to solve the problems of low efficiency of task scheduling algorithms and high computational cost of processors, a heterogeneous platform scheduling algorithm based on the quantum genetic algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm constructs a task scheduling model by using a directed acyclic graph. This paper quantifies the mapping relationship between the quantum genetic algorithm and task scheduling. It corresponds qubits to binary, chromosomes to processor numbers, and individuals to processor scheduling strategies. In this paper, a new way of coding chromosomes using quantum coherence properties is designed to reduce the population size and increase population diversity. Crossover operations are performed on all individuals using full-interference crossover to avoid the results falling into local optimal solutions. The population of slow convergence is solved by implementing mutation operations on populations through quantum rotation gates. In addition, a task pre-ordering stage is designed based on the table scheduling algorithm. The task scheduling priority developed at this stage is used as the reference value for the initial encoding of the population, so that the search space for solutions is reduced. Finally, experiments are conducted using randomly generated task graphs. The algorithm is compared with improved genetic algorithms and existing intelligent scheduling algorithms. The results show that the algorithm can still obtain better results when the number of populations and iterations is small. It is more appropriate for heterogeneous platforms and computation-intensive tasks.

TI Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop

SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum loop and dimer models are prototypical correlated systems with local constraints, which are not only intimately connected to lattice gauge theories and topological orders but are also widely applicable to the broad research areas of quantum materials and quantum simulation. Employing our sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, we reveal the complete phase diagram of the triangular-lattice fully packed quantum loop model. Apart from the known lattice nematic (LN) solid and the even Z2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$\end{document} quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases, we discover a hidden vison plaquette (VP) phase, which had been overlooked and misinterpreted as a QSL for more than a decade. Moreover, the VP-to-QSL continuous transition belongs to the (2 + 1)D cubic* universality class, which offers a lattice realization of the (fractionalized) cubic fixed point that had long been considered as irrelevant towards the O(3) symmetry until corrected recently by conformal bootstrap calculations. Our results are therefore of relevance to recent developments in both experiments and theory, and facilitate further investigations of hidden phases and transitions.

TI Synergy of Electrostatic and Chemical Doping to Improve the Performance
   of Junctionless Carbon Nanotube Tunneling Field-Effect Transistors:
   Ultrascaling, Energy-Efficiency, and High Switching Performance
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The low on-current and direct source-to-drain tunneling (DSDT) issues are the main drawbacks in the ultrascaled tunneling field-effect transistors based on carbon nanotube and ribbons. In this article, the performance of nanoscale junctionless carbon nanotube tunneling field-effect transistors (JL CNTTFETs) is greatly improved by using the synergy of electrostatic and chemical doping engineering. The computational investigation is conducted via a quantum simulation approach, which solves self-consistently the Poisson equation and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism in the ballistic limit. The proposed high-performance JL CNTTFET is endowed with a particular doping approach in the aim of shrinking the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) window and dilating the direct source-to-drain tunneling window, while keeping the junctionless paradigm. The obtained improvements include the on-current, off-current, ambipolar behavior, leakage current, I-60 metric, subthreshold swing, current ratio, intrinsic delay, and power-delay product. The scaling capability of the proposed design was also assessed, where greatly improved switching performance and sub-thermionic subthreshold swing were recorded by using JL CNTTFET with 5 nm gate length. Moreover, a ferroelectric-based gating approach was employed for more enhancements, where further improvements in terms of switching performance were recorded. The obtained results and the conducted quantum transport analyses indicate that the proposed improvement approach can be followed to improve similar cutting-edge ultrascaled junctionless tunnel field-effect transistors based on emerging atomically thin nanomaterials.

TI Experience of quantity and quality of DNA and RNA extraction from
   limited pediatric blood samples: A comparative analysis of automated and
   manual kit-based method
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY
AB Introduction: Optimal DNA and RNA quantity and purity is essential for downstream molecular biology experimentation and to avoid re-processing of sample. Despite availability of different kits and automated systems for nucleic acid isolation there is limited data on their performance evaluation, more so with pediatric blood samples, that are usually compromised in quantity. Hence, we evaluated the performance of automated QIAcube platform using pediatric blood samples in parallel with manual Qiagen extraction kits. Materials and Methods: A total of 500 samples were analyzed based on groups of PBMC and direct blood input. The isolated DNA and RNA were surveyed for quantity and quality tests by spectrophotometric and downstream analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in the DNA quantity (ng/ul) between manual and automated method based on similar sample input but quality (260/280) was significantly better with the QIAcube platform when direct blood and or PBMCs were used for extraction respectively (1.82 +/- 004 Vs. 1.84.002; P-0.000008 and 1.859 +/- 005 Vs. 1.843 +/- 0.003; P-0.02). Moreover, the standard error mean was low for both quantity and quality in the QIAcube method suggesting uniformity. Comparison of quality assessment by spectrophotometer and qubit fluorimeter showed that QIAcube sheared DNA less (P- 0.038) as compared to manual method (P-0.013). Also, time taken to process the samples in QIAcube was 23% less than the kit-based method. Conclusion: Overall analysis of QIAcube platform suggests that it yields more better, uniform, and less-sheared quality of nucleic acid in a relatively less time as compared to manual extraction kits.

TI Unraveling excitation energy transfer assisted by collective behaviors
   of vibrations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate how collective behaviors of vibrations such as cooperativity and interference can enhance energy transfer in a nontrivial way, focusing on an example of a donor-bridge-acceptor trimeric chromophore system coupled to two vibrational degrees of freedom. Employing parameters selected to provide an overall uphill energy transfer from donor to acceptor, we use numerical calculations of dynamics in a coupled exciton-vibration basis, together with perturbation-based analytics and calculation of vibronic spectra, to identify clear spectral features of single- and multi-phonon vibrationally-assisted energy transfer (VAET) dynamics, where the latter include up to six-phonon contributions. We identify signatures of vibrational cooperation and interference that provide enhancement of energy transfer relative to that obtained from VAET with a single vibrational mode. We observe a phononic analogue of two-photon absorption, as well as a novel heteroexcitation mechanism in which a single phonon gives rise to simultaneous excitation of both the trimeric system and the vibrational degrees of freedom. The impacts of vibrations and of the one- and two-phonon VAET processes on the energy transfer are seen to be quite different in the weak and strong site-vibration coupling regimes. In the weak coupling regime, two-phonon processes dominate, whereas in the strong coupling regime up to six-phonon VAET processes can be induced. The VAET features are seen to be enhanced with increasing temperature and site-vibration coupling strength, and are reduced in the presence of dissipation. We analyze the dependence of these phenomena on the explicit form of the chromophore-vibration couplings, with comparison of VAET spectra for local and non-local couplings.

TI Clarification of large-volume bacterial cultures using a centrifuge-free
   protocol
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB Aims To provide a reliable, reproducible and centrifuge-free filtration protocol for clarification of large volumes of bacterial cultures. Methods and Results Four experiments were designed to compare different techniques enabling clarification of Escherichia coli cultures using as a benchmark the concentration and quality of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The experiments were designed to examine the performance of different extraction methods on large volume (>= 1 L) filtrations of bacterial culture media. Performance parameters included filtration flow rates, sterility testing and characterization of the filtrates by: (i) SDS-PAGE, (ii) cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, (iii) nanoparticle tracking analysis and (iv) Qubit protein quantification. The experiments revealed that: (i) addition of the filter aid Diatomaceous Earth to the bacterial cultures improved filtration flow rates significantly and eliminated the need for centrifugation prior to filtration; (ii) sterile filtration was successful as no bacterial passage was identified through the membrane filter; (iii) centrifuge-free filtrates contained an increased amount of OMVs compared to centrifuged filtrates. Conclusions In comparison to conventional centrifuge-based protocols, the clarification method presented has universal applicability for a broad range of microbial extraction procedures, regardless of the volume of culture harvested. Moreover, the decreased amount of OMVs presented in the filtrates following centrifugation step provides an additional argument in favour of a centrifuge-free approach. Significance and Impact of the Study Sterile filtration is a universal method for the clarification of bacterial cultures. Common challenges related to filtration include filter clogging and long processing times, due to limited centrifugation capacity, which can affect product quality. The proposed protocol is likely to ensure a highly effective filtration process and could be a novel approach in improving the filtrate products without the need of centrifugation.

TI Electronic structure of mononuclear Cu-based molecule from
   density-functional theory with self-interaction correction
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate the electronic structure of a planar mononuclear Cu-based molecule [Cu(C6H4S2)(2)](z) in two oxidation states (z = -2, -1) using density-functional theory (DFT) with Fermi-Lowdin orbital (FLO) self-interaction correction (SIC). The dianionic Cu-based molecule was proposed to be a promising qubit candidate. Self-interaction error within approximate DFT functionals renders severe delocalization of electron and spin densities arising from 3d orbitals. The FLO-SIC method relies on optimization of Fermi-Lowdin orbital descriptors (FODs) with which localized occupied orbitals are constructed to create SIC potentials. Starting with many initial sets of FODs, we employ a frozen-density loop algorithm within the FLO-SIC method to study the Cu-based molecule. We find that the electronic structure of the molecule remains unchanged despite somewhat different final FOD configurations. In the dianionic state (spin S = 1/2), FLO-SIC spin density originates from the Cu d and S p orbitals with an approximate ratio of 2:1, in quantitative agreement with multireference calculations, while in the case of SIC-free DFT, the orbital ratio is reversed. Overall, FLO-SIC lowers the energies of the occupied orbitals and, in particular, the 3d orbitals unhybridized with the ligands significantly, which substantially increases the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) compared to SIC-free DFT results. The FLO-SIC HOMO-LUMO gap of the dianionic state is larger than that of the monoanionic state, which is consistent with experiment. Our results suggest a positive outlook of the FLO-SIC method in the description of magnetic exchange coupling within 3d-element-based systems. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Optical and Magnetic Response by Design in GaAs Quantum Dots
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single photons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to co-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system-a capability that has been notably absent in solid-state platforms where spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment lead to inhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we demonstrate the ability to design both the optical and magnetic response of a solid-state quantum emitter a priori. We show that GaAs quantum dots (QDs), obtained via local droplet etching epitaxy and already known as exceptionally coherent and efficient quantum light sources, also exhibit spin and optical properties that follow directly from assuming the highest possible system symmetry. Our measurements of electron and hole g-tensors-using a new sign-sensitive measurement protocol based on the hyperfine interaction-and of transition dipole moment orientations for charged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k <middle dot> p simulation constrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD morphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific growth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 to 790 nm for the exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the in-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from -0.1 to 0.3 and linear optical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic field. The robustness and generality of these results establish a fundamentally new paradigm for solid-state spin-photon interfaces: one in which the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical interface can be designed-prior to growth-for a target magnetic and photonic environment, with direct applications to scalable and high-fidelity spin-photon entanglement.

TI DNA extraction from long-term preserved formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
   samples of thymic epithelial tumours-a performance comparison of three
   commercial kits
SO WSPOLCZESNA ONKOLOGIA-CONTEMPORARY ONCOLOGY
AB Introduction: Thymic epithelial tumours (TET) are a rare, histologically varied group of malignancies, classified by the World Health Organization into 5 subtypes ranging from indolent to aggressive forms. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues represent the conventional approach for preserving TET tissues in pathology archives, ensuring long-term stability. Advancements in molecular techniques have significantly improved the molecular analysis in TET. Their efficacy is dependent upon the extraction of high-quality DNA from FFPE samples. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded preservation method and extended storage duration, however, pose challenges for molecular analysis because of DNA crosslinking, fragmentation, and reduced recovery efficiency and purity. Material and methods: This investigation evaluated the performance of 3 commercial DNA extraction kits: the QIAamp (R) DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, the GeneJET (R) FFPE DNA Purification Kit, and the MasterPureTM Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit, across 20 FFPE and 3 fresh TET samples, representing various sexes, ages, histological subtypes, and preservation conditions. The evaluation of DNA yield, purity, and compatibility for subsequent applications was conducted for each method. Results: The QIAamp kit produced the most substantial and reliable DNA yields of 1785.5 ng (Qubit) and 3280 ng (NanoDrop), along with a high level of purity. The DNA has been determined to be appropriate for polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, and whole genome sequencing regarding its quality and quantity. Conclusions: The QIAamp kit demonstrates superior performance compared to the others, providing high-quality DNA that is suitable for all molecular applications across all TET subtypes and sample conditions.

TI Role of ssDNA as a Noninvasive Indicator for the Diagnosis and Prognosis
   of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Exploratory Study
SO DISEASE MARKERS
AB Background and Aim. This exploratory study explored single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis and prognosis. Methods. This prospective study enrolled 102 patients with newly diagnosed HCC, 21 with cirrhosis, 20 with chronic hepatitis, 284 with nonliver diseases, and 45 healthy individuals at the Affiliated Wuxi No. 2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (May-October 2018). ssDNA was extracted using magnetic beads and quantified using the Qubit ssDNA assay. ssDNA levels were compared among the disease groups and in HCC vs. non-HCC. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic value of ssDNA. In patients with resectable HCC, ssDNA and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured during follow-up and compared with HCC recurrence detected by imaging. Results. The median ssDNA levels were higher in HCC than in healthy individuals, cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis (median, 23.20 vs. 9.36, 9.64, and 9.76 ng/mu L, respectively, P < 0.001). ssDNA levels in HCC were higher than those in cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis (both P < 0.001); there were no differences in ssDNA levels between healthy controls and patients with cirrhosis (P = 0.15) or chronic liver disease (P = 0.39). The area under the curve of ssDNA for HCC diagnosis was 0.909 (95% CI: 0.879-0.933). The ssDNA levels decreased by 3.19-fold (P < 0.001) after HCC radical resection. In six patients, the ssDNA levels increased about 3-6 months before a recurrence was detected by AFP and imaging. Conclusions. ssDNA might be a noninvasive indicator for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. ssDNA could eventually be complementary to AFP levels and imaging, but confirmatory studies are necessary.

TI Network structure and dynamics of effective models of nonequilibrium
   quantum transport
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Across all scales of the physical world, dynamical systems can be usefully represented as abstract networks that encode the systems' units and interunit interactions. Understanding how physical rules shape the topological structure of those networks can clarify a system's function and enhance our ability to design, guide, or control its behavior. In the emerging area of quantum network science, a key challenge lies in distinguishing between the topological properties that reflect a system's underlying physics and those that reflect the assumptions of the employed conceptual model. To elucidate and address this challenge, we study networks that represent nonequilibrium quantum-electronic transport through quantum antidot devices-an example of an open, mesoscopic quantum system. The network representations correspond to two different models of internal antidot states: a single-particle, noninteracting model and an effective model for collective excitations including Coulomb interactions. In these networks, nodes represent accessible energy states and edges represent allowed transitions. We find that both models reflect spin conservation rules in the network topology through bipartiteness and the presence of only even-length cycles. The models diverge, however, in the minimum length of cycle basis elements, in a manner that depends on whether electrons are considered to be distinguishable. Furthermore, the two models reflect spin-conserving relaxation effects differently, as evident in both the degree distribution and the cycle-basis length distribution. Collectively, these observations serve to elucidate the relationship between network structure and physical constraints in quantum-mechanical models. More generally, our approach underscores the utility of network science in understanding the dynamics of quantum systems.

TI Electrical circuit simulation of non-Hermitian lattice models
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum simulation serves as a significant tool for studying and understanding novel phenomena in the quantum world. In recent years, it has be realized that apart from quantum platforms, classical systems like photonic crystals, phononic crystals, and mechanical oscillators can also be used to simulate quantum models by analogizing the Schrodinger equation. Among these systems, electrical circuits have emerged as a promising simulation platform owing to their low cost, technological maturity, and ease of scalability, successfully simulating numerous important quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, non-Hermitian physics breaks the Hermiticity of systems' Hamiltonians in traditional quantum mechanics, providing a fresh perspective for understanding the physics of quantum systems, particularly open quantum systems. Non-Hermitian systems, owing to their manifestation of unique phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, have become emerging research subjects in various fields of physics. However, many non-Hermitian phenomena require specialized configurations that pose relatively high technical thresholds on quantum platforms. For instance, the non-Hermitian skin effect typically requires systems to possess non-reciprocal hopping between lattice sites. Therefore, utilizing flexible electrical circuits to simulate non-Hermitian physics becomes a natural choice. This paper provides a short review of the current experimental progress in simulating non-Hermitian lattice models by using electrical circuits. It offers a brief introduction to the relevant knowledge of non-Hermitian physics, including mathematical concepts and novel phenomena, as well as the simulation theory of electrical circuits, including the mapping theory of the lattice models, the introduction of non-Hermiticity, and the measurement of physical quantities. The aim is to provide readers with a reference for better understanding or engagement in related researches, thus promoting further development in this field.

TI Revisiting cobaloxime(ii) chemistry and clearing misconceptions of
   cobaloxime(ii) in diamagnetic Ni(ii) and Pd(ii) matrixes using
   comprehensive magnetic measurements
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Co(ii) was doped into the diamagnetic one-dimensional framework of bis(dimethylglyoximato) Ni(ii) and Pd(ii) complexes [Ni/PdII(Hdmg)2] (Hdmg = dimethylglyoximate anion) (hereafter referred to as Co@Ni and Co@Pd samples) to study magnetic properties as a potential spin qubit. In a previous report of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of this compound prepared using the same doping strategy in the Ni matrix, a spectrum assigned to S = 1/2 Co(ii) with gx = 2.58, gy = 2.26 gz = 1.98 was observed. The relatively large gx value, compared to those typically observed in [Co(Hdmg)2Bx] complexes (B = Lewis base ligand, x = 1 or 2), which fall within the ranges gx = 2.1-2.4, gy = 2.0-2.2 and gz approximate to 2.01, led to the interpretation of this species to be Co(Hdmg)2 with an extremely axial interaction. However, our EPR analysis, combined with SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) and XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) analyses, revealed that the previously identified species are mu-O bridged dimers: [Co(Hdmg)(mu-Hdmg)]2 and [Co(Hdmg)(mu-Hdmg)][Ni/Pd(Hdmg)(mu-Hdmg)]. Furthermore, our liquid-helium temperature EPR spectra revealed a Co species with much greater axial g anisotropy (gx = 4.75 gy,z approximate to 0.75 for Co@Ni and gx = 4.2 gy,z approximate to 1.33 for Co@Pd). We assign this species to the truly planar Co(Hdmg)2 with negligibly weak axial interaction, which might have been overlooked in previous EPR studies.

TI Cryogen-free scanning gate microscope for the characterization of
   Si/Si0.7Ge0.3 quantum devices at milli-Kelvin
   temperatures
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Silicon can be isotopically enriched, allowing for the fabrication of highly coherent semiconductor spin qubits. However, the conduction band of bulk Si exhibits a six-fold valley degeneracy which may adversely impact the performance of silicon quantum devices. To date, the spatial characterization of valley states in Si has remained limited. Moreover, techniques for probing valley states in functional electronic devices are needed. Here, we describe a cryogen-free scanning gate microscope for the characterization of Si/Si0.7Ge0.3 quantum devices at mK temperatures. The newly built instrument is the first cryogen-free scanning gate microscope capable of forming and measuring a quantum dot on a Si/SiGe device with an overlapping gate structure without compromising the ability to host multiple DC and microwave lines for quantum control experiments. The microscope is based on the Pan-walker design, with coarse positioning piezostacks and a fine scanning piezotube. A tungsten microscope tip is attached to a tuning fork for active control of the tip-to-sample distance. To reduce vibration noise from the pulse tube cooler, we utilize both active and passive vibration isolation mechanisms and achieve a root-mean-square noise in z of similar to 2 nm. Our microscope is designed to characterize fully functioning Si/Si0.7Ge0.3 quantum devices. As a proof of concept, we use the microscope to manipulate the charge occupation of a Si quantum dot, opening up a range of possibilities for the exploration of quantum devices and materials.

TI Utilizing a Novel Universal Quantum Gate in the Design of Fault-Tolerant
   Architecture
SO NANO COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB In nano communication, fault-tolerant networks play a crucial role in error control. A significant practical challenge for nanocircuits is their ability to transmit information over networks to different endpoints. Faulttolerant and reversible circuits have control error problems. The advantage of a quantum gate-based architecture is that it prevents heat loss, and it has been extensively researched. In this article, we have developed reversible multiplexers (mux's), half-adder (HA), and full-adder (FA) and latches that are fault-tolerant by making use of new gate and implementing them on the IBM Qiskit platform. A power-efficient and fault-tolerant mux's and latches is proposed that uses reversible gates to preserve parity. Multiplexer kinds such as 2:1, 4:1, and n:1 is covered in depth by the new Parity Preserving Multiplexer (PPM) gate and verified by IBM-Qiskit. An algorithmic design for an n:1 multiplexer is invented. In order to assess a PPM gate effectiveness, 13 standard Boolean functions and 8 standard types of gates are implemented. The PPM quantum gate is built using quantum assembly code (QAC), which runs on IBM Quantum Lab and IBM Quantum Composer platforms to measure the output qubits. Additional HA, muxes, and latches design led to the code creation in the Qiskit platform, which was used to measure the output qubits. A comparison of the D-latch, T-latch, JK-latch, and mux designs with existing circuits shows a reduction in quantum cost (qc) and junk output (go) and the implementation of a custom design in the IBM-Qiskit platform to measure output qubits is a first time in literature.

TI Finding the Dynamics of an Integrable Quantum Many-Body System via
   Machine Learning
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB The dynamics of the Gaudin magnet ("central-spin model") is studied using machine-learning methods. This model is of practical importance, for example, for studying non-Markovian decoherence dynamics of a central spin interacting with a large bath of environmental spins and for studies of nonequilibrium superconductivity. The Gaudin magnet is also integrable, admitting many conserved quantities. Machine-learning methods may be well suited to exploiting the high degree of symmetry in integrable problems, even when an explicit analytic solution is not obvious. Motivated in part by this intuition, a neural-network representation (restricted Boltzmann machine) is used for each variational eigenstate of the model Hamiltonian. Accurate representations of the ground state and of the low-lying excited states of the Gaudin-magnet Hamiltonian are then obtained through a variational Monte Carlo calculation. From the low-lying eigenstates, the non-perturbative dynamic transverse spin susceptibility is found, describing the linear response of a central spin to a time-varying transverse magnetic field in the presence of a spin bath. Having an efficient description of this susceptibility opens the door to improved characterization and quantum control procedures for qubits interacting with an environment of quantum two-level systems.
   Machine-learning methods are used to find nonperturbative dynamics of the Gaudin magnet (central-spin model). The Gaudin magnet has important applications in qubit dynamics/decoherence and in nonequilibrium superconductivity. Integrable models like the Gaudin magnet have many conserved quantities and their dynamics may therefore admit an efficient machine-learning solution even when an analytic solution is not evident. image

TI Qualitative and quantitative comparison of cell-free DNA and cell-free
   fetal DNA isolation by four (semi-)automated extraction methods: impact
   in two clinical applications: chimerism quantification and noninvasive
   prenatal diagnosis
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Non-invasive molecular analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) became a sensitive biomarker for monitoring organ transplantation or for detection of fetal DNA (cffDNA) in noninvasive prenatal test. In this study, we compared the efficiencies of four (semi)-automated cfDNA isolation instruments using their respective isolation kit: MagNA Pure 24 (Roche (R)), IDEAL (IDSolution (R)), LABTurbo 24 (Taigen (R)) and Chemagic 360 (Perkin Elmer (R)). The cfDNA was isolated from 5 plasma samples and the Rhesus D (RhD)-cffDNA from 5 maternal plasmas. The cfDNA were quantified by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), BIABooster system and QUBIT fluorometer. The cfDNA fragment size profiles were assessed by BIABooster system. Chimerism were quantified by home-made ddPCR and Devyser NGS kit. RhD-cffDNA in maternal plasma were detected between weeks 14 and 24 of amenorrhea using free DNA Fetal RHD Kit (R) (Biorad (R)).
   Results: Statistical tests have shown differences in DNA yield depending on the isolation procedure and quantification method used. Magna Pure isolates smaller cfDNA fragment size than other extraction methods (90% +/- 9% vs. 74% +/- 8%; p = 0.009). Chimerism was only reliable from LABTurbo 24 extractions using the NGS but not with ddPCR whatever extraction methods. RhD-cffDNA were detected by all isolation methods, although IDEAL and LABTurbo 24 systems seemed more efficient.
   Conclusions: This comparative study showed a dependency of cfDNA yield depending on isolation procedure and quantification method used. In total, these results suggest that the choice of pre-analytical isolation systems needs to be carefully validated in routine clinical practice.

TI Comparison of level of circulating tumor DNA between oral squamous cell
   carcinoma and healthy controls: a case control study
SO BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB Objective To compare circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels between patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and healthy controls. Methods A case-control study was conducted at Khyber College of Dentistry and Khyber Medical University, Peshawar. A total of 124 participants (94 OSCC patients and 30 healthy controls) were recruited using a non-probability consecutive sampling technique after obtaining the written informed consent. ctDNA was extracted from plasma and quantified using Qubit fluorometry and Nanodrop spectrophotometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TaqMan probes was used for detection. Independent t-tests compared ctDNA levels between OSCC patients and controls, and linear regression was conducted to assess the influence of age, gender, tumor site, and histopathological grade on ctDNA levels. Results The mean age of OSCC patients (56.82 +/- 11.92 years) was significantly higher than that of controls (31.93 +/- 7.10 years, p < 0.001). The most common tumor site was the buccal mucosa (20.16%), and moderately differentiated OSCC was the most prevalent histopathological grade (38.71%). The mean ctDNA level was significantly higher in OSCC cases (37.52 +/- 8.71 ng/ml) compared to controls (11.00 +/- 6.39 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis confirmed significantly elevated ctDNA levels in OSCC cases (beta = 28.13, 95% CI: 19.67-36.60, p < 0.001). Age, gender, tumor site, and histopathological grade did not significantly influence ctDNA levels. Conclusion OSCC patients exhibited significantly higher ctDNA levels than healthy controls. ctDNA quantification may serve as a promising non-invasive biomarker, though further validation is needed.

TI Entanglement-enhanced ac magnetometry in the presence of Markovian noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is a resource to improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In an ideal case, using an entangled state as a probe to detect target fields, we can beat the standard quantum limit by which all classical sensors are bounded. However, since entanglement is fragile against decoherence, it is unclear whether entanglement-enhanced metrology is useful in a noisy environment. Its benefit is indeed limited when estimating the amplitude of dc magnetic fields under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence, where the noise operator is parallel to the target field. In this paper, on the contrary, we show an advantage to using an entanglement over the classical strategy under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence when we try to detect ac magnetic fields. We consider a scenario to induce a Rabi oscillation of the qubits with the target ac magnetic fields. Although we can, in principle, estimate the amplitude of the ac magnetic fields from the Rabi oscillation, the signal becomes weak if the qubit frequency is significantly detuned from the frequency of the ac magnetic field. We show that, by using the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, we can significantly enhance the signal of the detuned Rabi oscillation even under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence. Our method is based on the fact that the interaction time between the GHZ states and ac magnetic fields scales as 1/L to mitigate the decoherence effect, where L is the number of qubits, which contributes to improving the bandwidth of the detectable frequencies of the ac magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for new applications of entanglement-enhanced ac magnetometry.

TI Cryogenic Current-Steering DAC Design and Validation Using Transistor
   Modeling Based on Physics-Inspired Residual Neural Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents a method for designing a cryogenic current-steering digital-to-analog converter (CS-DAC), particularly in cases where cryogenic precise device models are unavailable. The proposed design method utilizes a physics-inspired residual multilayer perceptron (Phy-ResMLP) network to model the current-voltage (I-V) and mismatch characteristics of cryogenic transistor pairs in 28-nm technology. The Phy-ResMLP network comprises multilayer perceptron (MLP) based residual blocks and a physics-inspired loss function, which improves the model's interpretability and accuracy. The established model demonstrates a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.95%, which is 27% lower than that of the state-of-the-art models. This model is then applied to design a 10-bit, 2GS/s CS-DAC, resulting in an average simulated differential non-linearity (DNL)/integral non-linearity (INL) of 1.03/2.34 LSB, with a standard deviation of 0.22/0.63 LSB, respectively. The average simulated spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is 50.39 dBc, with a standard deviation of 4.11 dBc. In addition, 10 fabricated CS-DACs in 28-nm technology are measured at 4K, with DNL ranging from 0.92 LSB to 1.15 LSB, INL from 2.18 LSB to 2.68 LSB, and SFDR from 49.4 dBc to 51.3 dBc. These measured values fall within the +/- 1- sigma confidence interval of the simulated DNL/INL and SFDR based on the proposed cryogenic transistor model, with a mean error of less than 3%.

TI Intrusion detection model using optimized quantum neural network and
   elliptical curve cryptography for data security
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Secure data transmission in wireless mesh networks is a necessary attribute for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Numerous attacks may have an adverse effect on the system's computing efficiency. In order to accurately detect an attack and enable data protection, Whale with Cuckoo search optimization (WCSO) based quantum neural network (QNN) and elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) is presented. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used to choose the features in the network data that aid in precisely detecting intrusions. To identify attacks, the optimized quantum network which combines the WOA approach with the feedforward and backpropagation algorithms, is used. Sensitive data retrieving requires an encryption procedure that is enabled by the ECC algorithm, which could safely save the data files in the server, in order to, secure the documentation with security measures. In the event that the data owner maintains sensitive data on a server, the document is encrypted using the encryption method. To determine the best key optimized ECC is used. The QNN with WOA-based IDS framework is a solid option for real-time intrusion detection analysis with high accuracy of 98.5%. Thus, the study has demonstrated that the suggested effort will also provide better secure data storage, resolving security concerns. (c) 2023 The Authors.

TI Making the best of a bad sample: Comparison of DNA extraction and
   quantification methods using sub-optimally stored Ixodes ricinus
   ticks
SO PLOS ONE
AB The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of four DNA extraction methods on a collection of 200 sub-optimally stored Ixodes ricinus ticks from Southeastern Norway (177 nymphs, 11 males and 12 females). The methods were ammoniium hydroxide hydrolysis of homogenised or intact ticks and two commercial silica membrane-based kits, the QIAGEN Blood and Tissue kit and the QIAGEN Mini kit. DNA was evaluated by spectrophotometry, fluorometry, agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR. The second aim was to compare methods of evaluating the yield and purity. All four extraction methods provided amplifiable DNA, but the yield was variable (median 151 ng, range 0.13 to 4500 ng). DNA yields were not significantly different across the methods. Nine of 200 samples were inhibitory, all of which were ammonium hydroxide extracts of homogenised ticks. DNA purity, as judged by A(260/280) ratios, was low; it was highest (mean = 1.63) for the Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit with the other methods showing values averaging 1.44. DNA yield measurements using qPCR, fluorometry (Qubit), drop spectrophotometry (NanoDrop) and gel electrophoresis (E-gels) correlated poorly, r ranging from <0 to 0.9 with no systematic pattern (average 0.4), probably reflecting the effects of low purity, low concentrations and differing amounts of single- and double-stranded DNA. Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. were detected in 5 and 13% of samples, respectively by qPCR. Our findings indicate that for the purposes of qPCR analysis, ammoniium hydroxide hydrolysis of intact ticks, a very cheap and simple method is as good as any of the other methods tested.

TI Quantum oscillation phenomena in low-dimensional superconductors
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Low-dimensional superconductor serves as an excellent platform for investigating emergent superconductingquantum oscillation phenomena. The low-dimensional natures of these materials, originating from the finite sizewhich is comparable with the superconducting coherence length, indicate that the corresponding physicalproperties will be constrained by quantum confinement effects. Importantly, some of the frontiers and hot issuesin low-dimensional superconductors, including the anomalous metal state during the superconductor-insulatortransition, spin-triplet pairing mechanism in superconductors, thermal-excited and electrical current-excitedvortex dynamics in superconductors, and the " charge-vortex duality" in quantum dot materials andsuperconducting nanowires, are strongly correlated with the superconducting quantum oscillation effects. Inrecent years, all the above-mentioned topics have achieved breakthroughs based on the studies ofsuperconducting quantum oscillation effects in low-dimensional superconductors. Generally, the periodicity andamplitude of the oscillation can clearly demonstrate the relation between the geometric structure ofsuperconductors and various superconducting mechanisms. In particular, superconducting quantum oscillationphenomena are always correlated with the quantization of magnetic fluxoids and their dynamics, the pairingmechanism of superconducting electrons, and the excitation and fluctuation of superconducting systems.ICI-V In this review article, three types of typical superconducting quantum oscillation effects observed in low-dimensional superconductors will be discussed from the aspects of research methods, theoretical expectations,and experimental results. a) The Little-Parks effect is the superconducting version of the Aharonov-Bohmeffect, whose phase, amplitude and period are all helpful in studying superconductivity: the phase reflects thepairing mechanism in superconductors, the amplitude can be used for investigating the anomalous metal state,and the period provides the information about the sample geometry. b) The vortex motion effect is excited bythermal fluctuation or electrical current, and the corresponding oscillation phenomena show distincttemperature-dependent amplitudes compared with the Little-Parks effect. c) The Weber blockade effectoriginates from the magnetic flux moving across the superconducting nanowire, and such an effect provides aunique nonmonotonic critical current under a magnetic field in characteristics. The prospects of theabove-mentioned quantum oscillation effects of low-dimensional superconductors for applications are alsodiscussed at the end of this review, including quantum computing, device physics and low-temperature physics

TI The straightforward fabrication of thin silicide layers at low
   temperatures by employing the molecular-incident reaction effect
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Because of the ease of formation, and good lattice match with Si, metal silicides often form high-quality epitaxial layers and have established themselves over the years as important technological materials with industrial applications. For the fabrication of silicon-based devices, the contact between metal electrodes and Si is a key issue. The properties of thin films on silicon substrates are strongly dependent on their microstructure and local chemistry. However, a concrete understanding of the influence of a silver layer on different transition metal/silicon interfaces is not currently available. We propose, for the first time, a new model called molecular-incident reaction effect (MoIRE) model that successfully explains the different chemical reactions for Co/Si and Ni/Si interfaces by the introduction of a root 3 x root 3R30 degrees-Ag layer. The interaction transfer of silicon atoms forms a Co silicide for Co/root 3 x root 3R30 degrees-Ag/Si(111) with a thickness of a few nanometers, thus greatly reducing the temperature needed for the formation of a layered CoSi2 silicide compared to that for typical CoSi2 silicide formation at a Co/Si interface. Based on the MoIRE mechanism, the introduction of the root 3 x root 3R30 degrees-Ag layer as an intermediate layer permits the silicidation temperature needed to produce a NiSi layer to be reduced to 400 K from typically above 600 K. This approach is advantageous for the formation of a silicide at the Ni/Si interface at low temperature. Based on the MoIRE model for silicide formation at Ni/root 3 x root 3R30 degrees-Ag/Si(111), we propose a technique for the synthesis Ni silicide layers at lower temperatures with simpler fabrication steps due to the difference in the properties between Co and Ni. This mechanism of low-temperature fabrication includes the formation of (1) a root 3 x root 3R30 degrees-Ag and (2) a NiSi layer. The findings presented herein will be useful for more efficiently forming salicides in integrated circuit fabrication, as well as for developing superconducting circuits and quantum bits for quantum computing.

TI A Survey on Technologies Which Make Bitcoin Greener or More Justified
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB According to recent estimates, one bitcoin transaction consumes as much energy as 1.5 million Visa transactions. Why is bitcoin using so much energy? Most of the energy is used during the bitcoin mining process, which serves at least two significant purposes: a) distributing new cryptocurrency coins to the cryptoeconomy and b) securing the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. In reality, the comparison of bitcoin transactions to Visa transactions is not that simple. The amount of transactions in the Bitcoin network is not directly connected to the amount of bitcoin mining power nor the energy consumption of those mining devices; for example, it is possible to multiply the number of bitcoin transactions per second without increasing the mining power and the energy consumption. Bitcoin is not only "digital money for hackers". It has very promising future potential as a global reserve currency and a method to make the World Wide Web (WWW) immune to cyberattacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks. This survey approached cryptocurrencies' various technological and environmental issues from many different perspectives. To make various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), greener and more justified, what technological solutions do we have? We found that cryptocurrency mining might be cleaner than is generally expected. There is also a plan to make a vast renewable energy source available by combining Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and Bitcoin mining. There are plans to use unconventional computing methods (quantum computing, reversible computing, ternary computing, optical computing, analog computing) to solve some of the issues regarding the vast energy consumption of conventional computing (including cryptocurrency mining). We think using spare computing cycles for grid computing efforts is justified. For example, there are billions of smartphones in the world. Many smartphones are being recharged every day. If this daily recharging period of twenty to sixty minutes would be used for grid computing, for example, finding new cures to cancer, it would probably be a significant breakthrough for medical research simulations. We call cryptocurrency communities to research and develop grid computing and unconventional computing methods for the most significant cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).

TI Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction
   to linear response
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e. the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.

TI The foundation of the hyperunified field theory II - Fundamental
   interaction and evolving universe
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB In part I of the foundation of the hyperunified field theory, we have shown the presence of entangled hyperqubit-spinor field as fundamental building block with appearance of Minkowski hyper-space-time as free-motion space-time and emergence of inhomogeneous hyperspin symmetry as fundamental symmetry. In this paper as part II, we demonstrate by following along gauge invariance principle and scaling invariance hypothesis that the inhomogeneous hyperspin gauge symmetry and scaling gauge symmetry govern fundamental interactions and reveal the nature of gravity and space-time. With the fiber bundle structure of biframe hyper-space-time and emergence of noncommutative geometry, we explore methodically the gauge-geometry duality and genesis of gravitational interaction in locally flat gravigauge hyper-space-time. A whole hyperunified field theory in 19-dimensional hyper-space-time is established to unify not only all discovered leptons and quarks into hyperunified qubit-spinor field but also all known basic forces into hyperunified interaction governed by inhomogeneous hyperspin gauge symmetry. We present a systematic investigation on the hyperunified field theory by deriving the dynamics of fundamental fields as basic laws of nature and conservation laws relative to basic symmetries and showing Higgs-like bosons and three families of lepton-quark states. We provide a detailed analysis on inflationary early universe with evolving graviscalar field and a discussion on scaling gauge field as dark matter candidate and Q(c)-spin scalar field as source of dark energy.

TI Artificial intelligence and public sector human resource management in
   South Africa: Opportunities, challenges and prospects
SO SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
AB Orientation: The Fourth Industrial Revolution has transformed modern society by ushering in the fusion of advances in robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), genetic engineering, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) among others. AI brings a range of different technologies and applications to interact with environments that comprise both the relevant objects and the interaction rules and have the capacity to process information in a way that resembles intelligent behaviour. Similarly, artificial intelligence is also being used in the human resources management (HRM) processes and functions in the public sector to map sequences to actions.Research purpose: The study explores the opportunities, challenges, and future prospects of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Public Sector Human Resource Management (HRM) in South Africa's public sector.Motivation for the study: The study was motivated by the need to examine the dynamics surrounding the adoption, implementation and operationalisation of the 4IR in the management of human resources in the SA public sector in this unfolding dispensation.Research Approach: Data was collected using the extensive review of written records such as books, journal articles, book chapters among others which were purposively selected for use in this study. Data was analysed using content and thematic analysis techniques.Research Findings: The study established that Artificial Intelligence is beneficial in the sense that it can improve public service delivery in South Africa as the HRM personnel is enabled to focus more on the strategic areas of management by taking over routine tasks, and that it helps minimize bias in public service recruitment and selection. In contrast, research on potential challenges has revealed that combining Artificial Intelligence and Public Sector Human Resource Management may pose a threat to white-collar jobs.Practical/ Managerial Implications: This study may lead to practical applications of AI to support the HR functions of public sector entities in SA. The public managers are better informed about the impediments, gaps and opportunities that may arise from using AI in managing human resources in SA's public sector.Contributions: This study contributes to the body of knowledge as it unpacks and informs the dynamics associated with the implementation of AI in managing human resources in public sector entities.

TI Quantum Differential Meet-In-The-Middle Attack and Some Applications to
   Lightweight Ciphers
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB At CRYPTO 2023, Boura et al. proposed a new cryptanalysis technique, differential meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. They used MITM technique to make the key recovery step of a differential attack more efficient. In this study, a quantum differential meet-in-the-middle attack is proposed by using nested quantum search algorithm, which can achieve up to a quadratic speed-up compared to the classical version. Besides, the time complexity of the attack can be reduced by at least a factor of 2(kin boolean OR kout-n)/2${2<^>{({\left| {{k_{in}} \cup {k_{out}}} \right| } - n)/2}}$ (kin boolean OR kout${{\left| {{k_{in}} \cup {k_{out}}} \right| }}$ is the guessed key length and n$n$ is the block size) compared to the first quantum differential attack proposed by Kaplan et al. at ToSC 2016. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of our attack, it is applied to two reduced-round lightweight block ciphers, PIPO and SIMON, to evaluate their post-quantum security. When attacking the same number of rounds, the time complexity of our attack is significantly lower than that of classical attacks. For the 8-round PIPO-128, the attack significantly improves efficiency, reducing the time complexity from 264+260.94$2<^>{64} + 2<^>{60.94}$ to 260.48$2<^>{60.48}$, cutting down the required qRAM size by a factor of 214$2<^>{14}$ and obtaining the data complexity 257$2<^>{57}$ instead of 264$2<^>{64}$ compared to the best quantum attack proposed by Schrottenloher at CRYPTO 2023. For the 19-round SIMON-32-64, the time complexity here will be 231.68$2<^>{31.68}$ instead of 233.39$2<^>{33.39}$ compared to the other quantum attack, and the attack can target more rounds than using Grover-meets-Simon technique.
   The development of quantum computing drives a shift in cryptanalysis. Many quantum cryptanalysis techniques are proposed. This study proposes a new quantum cryptanalysis technique, quantum differential meet-in-the-middle (QDMITM) attack, which is based on nested quantum search algorithm. And its quantum circuit is shown in the cover graphic. image

The AI applied in the organization enables us to obtain effects on such elements of organizational entrepreneurship as creating new strategic solutions, evaluating these proposals, and monitoring the approach of the organization's management through the use of tools such as a management cockpit and simulation models. The use of artificial intelligence in a modern organization is necessary to improve multifaceted and interdisciplinary processes that support organizational entrepreneurship. The use of AI shows the usefulness of digital technology in operational and strategic management. Limitations: Due to the lack of empirical, especially quantitative, materials concerning the application of all levels of categorization of the use of artificial intelligence in the discussed cases, supplementary research is required to provide a more comprehensive analysis of its applications. Originality/value: The thesis was justified that IT systems containing AI technology solutions are helpful in the implementation of procedures supporting organizational entrepreneurship. The thesis is comple-mented by a study consisting of examining the truthfulness of the statement that the consequence of using AI is to obtain in an organization the effects of both generating proposals for new development solutions and verifying the feasibility of the implementation of the procedures proposed by the organization management. The conducted research focuses on the assessment of the relationship between advanced information technologies and organizational entrepreneurship.

TI Be bold, start cold! cold formalin fixation of colorectal cancer
   specimens granted superior DNA and RNA quality for downstream molecular
   analysis
SO HISTOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY
AB The use of cold formalin fixation (CFF; i.e., fixating tissue samples with 4 degrees C precooled formalin) recently attracted further attention owing to its putative improved ability to preserve nucleic acid compared with standard room temperature formalin (SFF). In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of four formalin-based fixation protocols (SFF, CFF, delayed formalin fixation-DFF, and cold formalin hyperfixation; CFH) on both DNA and RNA quality. We collected 97 colorectal cancer (CRC) and analyzed 23 metrics of nucleic acid quantity and quality yield using a multiplatform approach by combining spectrophotometric, fluorimetric, electrophoretic, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Following confirmation of fixation-protocol-related different effects via clustering analysis, CFF presented best metrics compared with all protocols, specifically positive coefficients of DV1000-60000, DV2/DV1, DNA lambda ratio 260/230, and ABL gene expression absolute copies, and negative coefficient of DV150-1000. The SFF subgroup presented a positive coefficient of DV150-1000 and negative coefficients for DV1000-60000, DV2/DV1, RNA lambda ratio 260/230, RNA QuBit concentration, DV100/200, RNA electrophoresis concentration and absolute quantity, and ABL copies. Overall, we confirmed the superior yield performances of CFF preservation for both DNA and RNA compared with the other protocols in our series of CRC samples. Pending further validations and clarification of the specific mechanisms behind these findings, our study supports the implementation of CFF in the pathology unit routine specimen management for tumor tissue molecular profiling.

TI Allergen-induced DNA release by the airway epithelium amplifies type 2
   immunity
SO JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
AB Background: Alternaria alternata and house dust mite exposure evokes IL-33 secretion from the airway epithelium, which functions as an alarmin to stimulate type 2 immunity. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is also an alarmin that intensifies inflammation in cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. Objective: We investigated the mechanisms underlying allergen -evoked DNA mobilization and release from the airway epithelium and determined the role of eDNA in type 2 immunity. Methods: Human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells were used to characterize allergen-induced DNA mobilization and extracellular release using comet assays to measure DNA fragmentation, Qubit double-stranded DNA assays to measure DNA release, and DNA sequencing to determine eDNA composition. Mice were used to investigate the role of eDNA in type 2 immunity. Results: Alternaria extract rapidly induces mitochondrial and nuclear DNA release from human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas house dust mite extract induces mitochondrial DNA release. Caspase-3 is responsible for nuclear DNA fragmentation and becomes activated after cleavage by furin. Analysis of secreted nuclear DNA showed disproportionally higher amounts of promotor and exon sequences and lower intron and intergenic regions compared to predictions of random DNA fragmentation. In mice, Alternaria-induced type 2 immune responses were blocked by pretreatment with a DNA scavenger. In caspase-3- deficient mice, Alternaria-induced DNA release was suppressed. Furthermore, intranasal administration of mouse genomic DNA with Alternaria amplified secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid while DNA alone had no effect. Conclusion: These findings highlight a novel, allergen-induced mechanism of rapid DNA release that amplifies type 2 immunity in airways. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2023;151:494-508.)

TI Correlated optical convolutional neural network with "quantum speedup"
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Compared with electrical neural networks, optical neural networks (ONNs) have the potentials to break the limit of the bandwidth and reduce the consumption of energy, and therefore draw much attention in recent years. By far, several types of ONNs have been implemented. However, the current ONNs cannot realize the acceleration as powerful as that indicated by the models like quantum neural networks. How to construct and realize an ONN with the quantum speedup is a huge challenge. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a new type of optical convolutional neural network by introducing the optical correlation. It is called the correlated optical convolutional neural network (COCNN). We show that the COCNN can exhibit "quantum speedup" in the training process. The character is verified from the two aspects. One is the direct illustration of the faster convergence by comparing the loss function curves of the COCNN with that of the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Such a result is compatible with the training performance of the recently proposed quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN). The other is the demonstration of the COCNN's capability to perform the QCNN phase recognition circuit, validating the connection between the COCNN and the QCNN. Furthermore, we take the COCNN analog to the 3-qubit QCNN phase recognition circuit as an example and perform an experiment to show the soundness and the feasibility of it. The results perfectly match the theoretical calculations. Our proposal opens up a new avenue for realizing the ONNs with the quantum speedup, which will benefit the information processing in the era of big data.
   We propose a new type of classical optical convolutional neural network by introducing the optical correlation. Such a network can exhibit "quantum speedup"like the quantum neural networks.

TI Thin-film lithium niobate photonic integrated devices: Advances and
   oppotunities
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Lithium niobate, known as one of the most widely used nonlinear optical crystals, has recently received significant attention from both academia and industrial circles. The surge in interest can be attributed to the commercial availability of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) wafers and the rapid advancements in nanofabrication techniques. A milestone was achieved in 2020 with the successful fabrication of wafer-scale TFLN photonic integrated circuits, which paved the way for mass-producible and cost-effective manufacturing of TFLN-based products. At present, the majority of research on TFLN photonic integrated devices focuses on light manipulation, i.e. field modulation and frequency conversion. The electro-optic, acousto-optic, photo-elastic and piezo-electric effects of lithium niobate are harnessed to modulate the amplitude, phase and frequency of light. The second-order and third-order nonlinearities of lithium niobate enable frequency conversion processes, which leads to the development of frequency converters, optical frequency combs, and supercontinuum generation devices. These exceptional optical properties of lithium niobate enable the electromagnetic wave to manipulate covering from radio-frequency to terahertz, infrared, and visible bands. Using the outstanding performance of TFLN photonic integrated devices, including remarkable modulation rate, wide operation bandwidth, efficient nonlinear frequency conversion, and low power consumption, diverse applications, such as spanning optical information processing, laser ranging, optical frequency combs, microwave optics, precision measurement, quantum optics, and quantum computing, are demonstrated. Additionally, it is reported that TFLN-based lasers and amplifiers have made remarkable progress, and both optical and electrical pumps are available. These achievements include combining gain materials, such as rare-earth ions or heterostructures, with III-V semiconductors. The integration of low-dimensional materials or absorptive metals with TFLN can also realize TFLN-based detectors. These significant developments expand the potential applications of TFLN photonic integrated devices, thus paving the way for monolithic TFLN chips. The versatility and high performances of TFLN photonic integrated devices have made revolutionary progress in these fields, opening up new possibilities for cutting-edge technologies and their practical implementations. In this point of view, we briefly introduce the development of TFLN nanofabricationn technology. Subsequently, we review the latest progress of TFLN photonic integrated devices, including lasers, functional nonlinear optical devices, and detectors. Finally, we discuss the future development directions and potential ways of TFLN photonics.

TI Enhancing Communication Security in Drones Using QRNG in Frequency
   Hopping Spread Spectrum
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the security and reliability of drone communications through the integration of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) in Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) systems. We propose a multi-drone framework that leverages QRNG technology to generate truly random frequency hopping sequences, significantly improving resistance against jamming and interception attempts. Our method introduces a concurrent access protocol for multiple drones to share a QRNG device efficiently, incorporating robust error handling and a shared memory system for random number distribution. The implementation includes secure communication protocols, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality through encryption and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) verification. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through comprehensive simulations and statistical analyses, including spectral density, frequency distribution, and autocorrelation studies of the generated frequency sequences. The results show a significant enhancement in the unpredictability and uniformity of frequency distributions compared to traditional pseudo-random number generator-based approaches. Specifically, the frequency distributions of the drones exhibited a relatively uniform spread across the available spectrum, with minimal discernible patterns in the frequency sequences, indicating high unpredictability. Autocorrelation analyses revealed a sharp peak at zero lag and linear decrease to zero values for other lags, confirming a general absence of periodicity or predictability in the sequences, which enhances resistance to predictive attacks. Spectral analysis confirmed a relatively flat power spectral density across frequencies, characteristic of truly random sequences, thereby minimizing vulnerabilities to spectral-based jamming. Statistical tests, including Chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnov, further confirm the unpredictability of the frequency sequences generated by QRNG, supporting enhanced security measures against predictive attacks. While some short-term correlations were observed, suggesting areas for improvement in QRNG technology, the overall findings confirm the potential of QRNG-based FHSS systems in significantly improving the security and reliability of drone communications. This work contributes to the growing field of quantum-enhanced wireless communications, offering substantial advancements in security and reliability for drone operations. The proposed system has potential applications in military, emergency response, and secure commercial drone operations, where enhanced communication security is paramount.

TI Healthcare 5.0-Driven Clinical Intelligence: The
   Learn-Predict-Monitor-Detect-Correct Framework for Systematic Artificial
   Intelligence Integration in Critical Care
SO HEALTHCARE
AB Background: Healthcare 5.0 represents a shift toward intelligent, human-centric care systems. Intensive care units generate vast amounts of data that require real-time decisions, but current decision support systems lack comprehensive frameworks for safe integration of artificial intelligence. Objective: We developed and validated the Learn-Predict-Monitor-Detect-Correct (LPMDC) framework as a methodology for systematic artificial intelligence integration across the critical care workflow. The framework improves predictive analytics, continuous patient monitoring, intelligent alerting, and therapeutic decision support while maintaining essential human clinical oversight. Methods: Framework development employed systematic theoretical modeling integrating Healthcare 5.0 principles, comprehensive literature synthesis covering 2020-2024, clinical workflow analysis across 15 international ICU sites, technology assessment of mature and emerging AI applications, and multi-round expert validation by 24 intensive care physicians and medical informaticists. Each LPMDC phase was designed with specific integration requirements, performance metrics, and safety protocols. Results: LPMDC implementation and aggregated evidence from prior studies demonstrated significant clinical improvements: 30% mortality reduction, 18% ICU length-of-stay decrease (7.5 to 6.1 days), 45% clinician cognitive load reduction, and 85% sepsis bundle compliance improvement. Machine learning algorithms achieved an 80% sensitivity for sepsis prediction three hours before clinical onset, with false-positive rates below 15%. Additional applications demonstrated effectiveness in predicting respiratory failure, preventing cardiovascular crises, and automating ventilator management. Digital twins technology enabled personalized treatment simulations, while the integration of the Internet of Medical Things provided comprehensive patient and environmental surveillance. Implementation challenges were systematically addressed through phased deployment strategies, staff training programs, and regulatory compliance frameworks. Conclusions: The Healthcare 5.0-enabled LPMDC framework provides the first comprehensive theoretical foundation for systematic AI integration in critical care while preserving human oversight and clinical safety. The cyclical five-phase architecture enables processing beyond traditional cognitive limits through continuous feedback loops and system optimization. Clinical validation demonstrates measurable improvements in patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and clinician satisfaction. Future developments incorporating quantum computing, federated learning, and explainable AI technologies offer additional advancement opportunities for next-generation critical care systems.

TI Terahertz Topological Insulators: Breaking Barriers for Future On-Chip
   Wireless Communication
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS MAGAZINE
AB Terahertz (THz) wireless communication is a key enabling technology for sixth-generation (6G) and beyond, offering ultra-fast data rates, sub-millisecond latency, and high-capacity connectivity. THz on-chip communication is essential for realizing these benefits, supporting compact, high-speed, and energy-efficient intra/inter-chip data exchange through signal generation, modulation, and processing. However, practical deployment faces challenges such as scattering losses, low coupling efficiency, and degradation at sharp bends, limiting scalability and performance. Conventional THz platforms struggle to address these issues, highlighting the need for innovative solutions. Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) offer a transformative approach, using topologically protected edge states to enable backscatter-free, low-loss THz wave transport. Unlike traditional photonic platforms, PTIs offer intrinsic robustness to fabrication imperfections, structural defects, and environmental fluctuations, ensuring stable, high-efficiency signal transmission. Different classes of PTIs-Quantum Hall, Quantum Spin Hall (QSH), Floquet, and Quantum Valley Hall (QVH)-offer distinct trade-offs in nonreciprocity, integration complexity, and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) THz systems, with QSH and QVH PTIs particularly suited for passive robustness and scalable, low-loss network-on-chip (NoC) architectures. Beyond signal transport, PTIs offer additional functionalities critical to 6G on-chip systems-including nonreciprocal magnetless wave propagation, enhanced spectral efficiency in beamformers for spatially distributed users, ultrafast and miniaturized reconfigurable switching and power splitting, compact delay control, cellular-level on-chip sensing, efficient THz modulation, and programmable reconfigurability-while their CMOS compatibility, structural robustness, and energy-efficient operation through low-loss routing and thermally optimized, picojoule-per-bit transmission support scalable, low-cost deployment for adaptive, high-density NoC architectures. Integrating PTIs with low-loss photonic and electronic components enhances THz circuit performance, enabling advanced applications such as high-resolution imaging and sensing, biomedical diagnostics, adaptive routing, and secure on-chip communications. This review critically analyzes the impact of PTIs in addressing key limitations of THz on-chip communication, highlighting their potential to enable scalable, energy-efficient, and ultra-reliable wireless networks. PTIs also hold promise in quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, and analog in-memory processing, advancing next-generation information technologies.

TI Laser fusion cutting: The missing link between gas dynamics and cut edge
   topography
SO JOURNAL OF LASER APPLICATIONS
AB In laser cutting, the fundamental role of the gas flow for melt removal and kerf formation is generally accepted. Beyond this vague understanding, however, the underlying physical mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In particular, detailed data concerning the momentum and heat transfer between the gas and melt have seldom been reported. This study addresses the local interactions between the cutting gas and kerf surface (melt film surface) in a fundamental way based on a combined experimental, theoretical, and numerical approach. Typical solid-state laser cut edges are analyzed considering the characteristic surface structures and the basic influences of the gas flow on the global and local melt movement. Here, apparent structures in the micrometer range indicate the effect of vortical gas structures close to the wall. Theoretical investigation of the gas boundary layer is conducted by semiempirical equations and the transfer of basic results from the boundary layer theory. It is shown that the boundary layer is in transition between the laminar and turbulent flow, and local flow separations and shock-boundary layer interactions primarily induce spatially periodic and quasistationary instability modes. An improved numerical model of the cutting gas flow confirms the theoretical results and exhibits good agreement with experimental cut edges, reproducing relevant instability modes and quantifying the local momentum and heat transfer distributions between the gas and melt. With the knowledge gained about the underlying physical mechanisms, promising approaches for improvements of the fusion cutting performance are proposed.

TI Cosmic coding and transfer storage (COSMOCATS) for invincible key
   storage
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Thus far, a perfectly secure encryption key storage system doesn't exist. As long as key storage is connected to a network system, there is always a chance that it can be cracked. Even if storage is not continually connected to a network system; it is repeatedly necessary for an individual to access storage to upload and download the data; hence there is always a loophole with every conventional encryption key storage system. By utilizing the penetrative nature of cosmic-ray muons, the COSMOCAT (Cosmic coding and transfer) technique may tackle this problem by eliminating the requirement for any network connection to data storage. COSMOCAT was invented as a post quantum key generation and distribution technique for wireless near field communication. However, in its first stage of development, COSMOCAT relied on standard comparators and Global Positioning System (GPS) or other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for key generation. Temporal jitters of the signals outputted from comparators and frequency fluctuations in GPS-disciplined oscillators degraded the key strength and the efficiency of both the key generation and distribution. New strategies are tested in this paper to improve these factors. As a result, the key strength and the key authenticating rate limit are respectively improved by 4 orders of magnitude and more than 5 orders of magnitude. As a consequence, it has become possible to propose a practical methodology for a new key storage and authentication strategy which has the potential to be an impregnable defense against any kind of cyber/physical attack to data storage. Practical applications of COSMOCATS-based symmetric-key cryptosystems to an electronic digital signing system, communication, and cloud storage are also discussed.

TI Remote Characterization and Dissemination of Disper sion Compensated
   Ultrashort Pulses Through Dynamic Fiber Optic Links
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Ultrashort optical pulse sources are often complex and resource-intensive, and thus, delivering pulses to multiple satellite locations over a fiber-optic network dynamically from a central location reduces overhead and increases the efficacy of the source usage. For robust delivery, accurate characterization of the pulse dispersion at the satellite locations without specialized equipment and its compensation is essential. This work demonstrates the delivery of dispersion-compensated pulses over standard optical fiber links and their characterization using a simple measurement module at satellite locations. The module uses a second-harmonic crystal and power detectors at the fundamental and second-harmonic wavelengths. A centrally located pulse shaper-based interferometer creates pulse pairs with varying time delays during the characterization phase. Together with the remote detectors, this provides the field and intensity autocorrelations, which describe the spectral and temporal domain of the pulse. We demonstrate our technique by transmitting dispersion compensated sub-400 fs pulses over two fiber optic links of 50 and 100 meters. The pulses are shaped adaptively before transmission to compensate for the dispersion-induced distortions. The pulse intensity and power spectrum are measured remotely and agree with those made at the source. This provides an easy distribution method for femtosecond lasers from central to satellite locations via standard optical fiber links on a time-share basis and their remote characterization.

TI Numerical Simulation of Fictitious Magnetic Field in Hybrid Quantum
   System with Micro/Nano Waveguide and Cold Atoms
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective In hybrid quantum systems of micro/nano photonics devices and cold atoms, the fictitious magnetic field generated by the constrained light field for atoms has the advantages such as a high gradient, ease of manipulation, and chirality. Therefore, such systems hold significant applications in atomic manipulation, quantum information, quantum simulation, and precision measurement. The calculation and analysis of fictitious magnetic fields are crucial and indispensable. However, for micro/nano photonics devices with irregular structures, it is impossible to obtain the optical field distribution analytically, making it difficult to directly acquire the fictitious magnetic field. In our study, the finite element method is used to numerically simulate the electric field distributions of the nanofiber waveguide and rectangular waveguide, and the fictitious magnetic field distributions are calculated accordingly. We systematically study the fictitious magnetic field intensity as a function of the size of the two micro/nano waveguides. This work provides theoretical guidance for the experimental study of single-atom traps and internal state manipulation using this micro/nano photonics structure. Methods We numerically simulate a fictitious field of nanofibers and rectangular waveguides. The material of the waveguides is silica, with a refractive index of 1.4537 (Fig. 1). The optical wavelength of 880 nm is used because the scalar optical frequency shift of the ground state is 0, which indicates that the optical field of the 880 nm laser will not affect the atom trap and only produces a fictitious magnetic field (Fig. 2). The power of the laser is set to 1 mW, and the polarization is in the y direction. The field intensity distributions of the nanofibers and rectangular waveguide are numerically simulated via the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD, Lumerical solutions) (Figs. 3 and 8). After obtaining the electric field intensity distribution, we calculate the fictitious magnetic field intensity distribution using Eqs. (1) -(8) for the optical frequency shift and the matrix operation method (Figs. 4 and 9). Results and Discussions The fictitious magnetic field obtained through finite element numerical simulation is consistent with the analytical results for the nanofibers, which verifies the feasibility of this method (Fig. 6). To obtain the maximum fictitious magnetic field strength, we optimize the fiber diameter. The diameter of the nanofiber is changed from 0.2 to 1.0 mu m. The maximum value of the fictitious magnetic field first increases and then decreases as the nanofiber diameter increases, and it can reach 68.3 G when the nanofiber diameter is 0.475 mu m (Fig. 7). To obtain the maximum fictitious magnetic field, we optimize the aspect ratio of the rectangular waveguide. The side lengths of the square rectangular waveguide are changed from 0.1 to 1.0 mu m. When the side length is 0.475 mu m, the maximum value of the fictitious magnetic field reaches 53.61 G [Fig. 11 (a)]. To determine the maximum of the fictitious magnetic field with a changing aspect ratio, the rectangular waveguide length is kept at 0.475 mu m, and the width value is changed from 0.1 to 1.0 mu m. The maximum value of the fictitious magnetic field of the rectangular waveguide first increases and then decreases as the width increases. When the aspect ratio is 1 (a square waveguide), the maximum value of the fictitious magnetic field reaches 53.61 G [Fig. 11(b)].
   Conclusions We verify the feasibility of finite element numerical simulations of fictitious magnetic fields and provide a method for calculating the fictitious magnetic field of complex micro/nano structures. A numerical simulation of the nanofiber waveguide and rectangular waveguide is implemented, and the distributions of the electric field and fictitious magnetic field are obtained. For the nanofibers, the maximum value of the fictitious magnetic field first increases and then decreases as the nanofiber diameter increases, and it can reach 68.3 G when the nanofiber diameter is 0.475 mu m. For the square waveguide, the maximum value of the fictitious magnetic field first increases and then decreases as the side length increases. When the side length is 0.475 mu m, the fictitious magnetic field reaches a maximum of 53.61 G. When it is a square waveguide, the maximum value of the fictitious magnetic field reaches 53.61 G. The above simulation results provide a theoretical basis for determining the relative size of the fictitious magnetic field when the rectangular waveguide is used to capture atoms.

TI Multiple-nanowire superconducting quantum interference devices: critical
   currents, symmetries, and vorticity stability regions
SO NANO EXPRESS
AB An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for homogeneous superconducting thin wires. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current (Ic) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey a simultaneous bias current (I) and magnetic field (B) inversion symmetry, called IB symmetry. Each VSR obeys a simultaneous I, B and the vorticity state inversion (V) symmetry (called IBV symmetry). The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.

TI Traceable characterisation of fibre-coupled single-photon detectors
SO METROLOGIA
AB The detection of single photons plays an essential role in advancing single-photon science and technologies. Yet, within the visible/near-infrared spectral region, accurate fibre-based optical power measurements at the few-photon level are not yet well-established. In this study, we report on a fibre-based setup, enabling traceable optical power measurements at the few-photon level in this spectral region. The setup was used to calibrate the detection efficiency (DE) of four single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The relative standard uncertainties on the mean DE values obtained from repeat fibre-to-detector couplings ranged from 0.67% to 0.81% (k = 2). However, the relative standard deviation of DE values, which ranged from 1.38% to 3.20% (k = 2), poses a challenge for the metrology of these devices and applications that require high accuracy and repeatability. We investigated the source of these variations by spatially mapping the response of a detector's fibre connector port, using a focused free-space beam, allowing us to estimate the detector's spatial non-uniformity. In addition, we realise a novel calibration approach for fibre-coupled SPADs in a free-space configuration, enabling a direct comparison between the fibre-based setup and the National Physical Laboratory's established free-space facility using a single SPAD. Finally, we investigated alternative coupling methods, testing the repeatability of different fibre-to-fibre connectors in addition to direct fibre-to-detector couplings: SPADs from three manufacturers were tested, with both single-mode and multi-mode fibre.

TI A Novel 5G PMN-Driven Approach for AI-Powered Irrigation and Crop Health
   Monitoring
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Precision agriculture is a crucial field that addresses food security for the growing population. This article presents an innovative approach merging deep learning with a 5G Private Mobile Network (PMN) to construct a smart agriculture system. We simulated a 5G PMN infrastructure using UERANSIM and Free5GC with the Quantum Key Distribution Function (QKDF) integration. The 5G connectivity enhances agricultural practices through real-time crop healthcare monitoring and reliable transmission of irrigation control commands. In addition to using 5G, our proposed system integrates a lightweight model and three YOLOv8 models for AI-powered irrigation and crop health monitoring. While the lightweight model automatically generates irrigation schedules based on current weather conditions and soil moisture levels, optimizing crop water needs, the three YOLOv8 models are trained to predict growth stage, health status, and nutritional status (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). All deep learning models are optimized for lettuce and feature lightweight architecture for easy deployment on low-power devices. Evaluation on test datasets reveals promising accuracy scores: the irrigation schedule generation model achieves 73%, the growth stage model attains 93.8%, the health status model reaches 87%, and the nutritional status model obtains 83%. This research contributes to improving precision agriculture while providing practical solutions to enhance irrigation management and crop health monitoring. We have also developed a QKDF that is integrated with the 5G core network to improve the security of the proposed system by establishing secure session keys with a length of 256 bits.

TI Multiplier Effects of Photodetectors-Source of Gain
SO COATINGS
AB A photodetector is a type of optoelectronic device with excellent photoelectric conversion abilities, which has especially important applications in many fields such as optical communication, image sensing, aerospace/environmental detection, and military safety. Among these applications, the multiplier effect of optoelectronic devices has been widely explored because photodetectors can convert a very weak optical signal into electrical signal output and offer amazing electron multiplication abilities. To date, hundreds of multiplier effects of photodetectors have been reported. However, there are few reviews on the multiplier effects of such devices. Here, a review of the multiplier effects of photodetectors covering detection spectra from ultraviolet to infrared is presented, including photodetectors based on inorganic materials, organic materials, and organic/inorganic materials. First, we provide brief insights into the detection mechanisms of multiplier effects of photodetectors and introduce the merits that represent key factors for a reasonable comparison of different photodetectors. Then, the multiplier effect on different types of material photodetectors is reviewed. Notably, we summarize the optimization directions of the performance of the multiplier photodetectors, including improving the external quantum efficiency, reducing the dark current, and increasing the response speed and spectral regulation. Finally, an outlook is delivered, the challenges and future directions are discussed, and general advice for designing and realizing novel high-performance photodetectors with multiplier effects is given to provide a guideline for the future development of this fast-developing field. The bottlenecks of existing multiplier technology are also analyzed, which has strong reference significance for the future development of this field.

TI Implementation of QKD-based system using Nano PCF for healthcare
   applications
SO SENSING AND BIO-SENSING RESEARCH
AB The present paper proposed a design of a Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) with a nano-scale coating of very thin gold dielectric rods in the first ring. In such a configuration, the single-ring PCF may act as a bridge or a connector between two multi-ring PCFs on both sides. This arrangement could be used in various optical communications where one is required to interface different types of PCF. Also, it can be used as a sensor for analyte as a blood sample for different patients. The envisioned sensor can identify unknown analytes either by passing through the metal surface or being applied to the outer surface of the metal layer. The single-ring PCF will be infused with blood samples from various patients to monitor changes in ligand and receptor concentrations with temperature. Additionally, this proposed sensor design features symmetrical elliptical gold-dielectric rods, with two small metal-rods in the first ring. These supplementary thin metal-dielectric rods in place of air holes enhance the generation of the evanescent field. This helps in adjusting the phase matching between the cores-guided mode and surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) mode. The sensing mechanism is based on the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technique and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) occurring at the interfaces of dielectric-metal contacts. To estimate the dispersion and birefringence of the patterned PCF we employ the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Such research holds significance in the realm of biochemical sensing, offering potential advancements in this field. These simulation result is required to make its experimental validation and immediate applicability in clinical or diagnostic contexts to confirm the real-world feasibility and performance of the proposed PCFs structure in future works.

TI Revealing incommensurability between device-independent randomness,
   nonlocality, and entanglement using Hardy and Hardy-type relations
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A comprehensive treatment of the quantification of randomness certified device-independently by using the Hardy and Cabello-Liang-Li (CLL) nonlocality relations is provided in the two parties-two measurements per party-two outcomes per measurement (2-2-2) scenario. For the Hardy nonlocality, it is revealed that for a given amount of nonlocality signified by a particular non-zero value of the Hardy parameter, the amount of Hardy-certifiable randomness is not unique, unlike the way the amount of certifiable randomness is related to the CHSH nonlocality. This is because any specified non-maximal value of Hardy nonlocality parameter characterises a set of quantum extremal distributions. Then this leads to a range of certifiable amounts of randomness corresponding to a given Hardy parameter. On the other hand, for a given amount of CLL-nonlocality, the certifiable randomness is unique, similar to that for the CHSH nonlocality. Furthermore, the tightness of our analytical treatment evaluating the respective guaranteed bounds for the Hardy and CLL relations is demonstrated by their exact agreement with the Semi-Definite-Programming based computed bounds. Interestingly, the analytically evaluated maximum achievable bounds of both Hardy and CLL-certified randomness have been found to be realisable for non-maximal values of the Hardy and CLL nonlocality parameters. In particular, we have shown that even close to the maximum 2 bits of CLL-certified randomness can be realised from non-maximally entangled pure two-qubit states corresponding to small values of the CLL nonlocal parameter. This, therefore, clearly illustrates the quantitative incommensurability between randomness, nonlocality and entanglement.

TI Quantum coherent microwave-optical transduction using high-overtone bulk
   acoustic resonances
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A device capable of converting single quanta of the microwave field to the optical domain is an outstanding endeavor in the context of quantum interconnects between distant superconducting qubits, but likewise can have applications in other fields, such as radio astronomy or, in the classical realm, microwave photonics. A variety of transduction approaches, based on optomechanical or electro-optical interactions, have been proposed and realized, yet the required vanishing added noises and an efficiency approaching unity, have not yet been attained. Here we present a transduction scheme that could in theory satisfy the requirements for quantum coherent bidirectional transduction. Our scheme relies on an intermediary mechanical mode, a high-overtone bulk acoustic resonance (HBAR), to coherently couple microwave and optical photons through the piezoelectric and strain-optical effects. Its efficiency results from the combination of integrated Si3N4 photonic circuits with ultra-low loss sustaining high intracavity photon numbers with the highly efficient microwave to mechanical transduction offered by piezoelectrically coupled HBAR. We develop a quantum theory for this multipartite system by first introducing a quantization method for the piezoelectric interaction between the microwave mode and the mechanical mode from first principles (which to our knowledge has not been presented in this form) and link the latter to the conventional Butterworth-Van Dyke model. The HBAR is subsequently coupled to a pair of hybridized optical modes from coupled optical ring cavities via the strain-optical effect. We analyze the conversion capabilities of the proposed device using signal flow graphs, and demonstrate that near quantum coherent transduction is possible, with realistic experimental parameters. Combined with the high thermal conduction via the device bulk, heating effects are mitigated, and the approach does not require superconducting resonators that are susceptible to absorption of optical photons.

TI Reachable sets for two-level open quantum systems driven by coherent and
   incoherent controls
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this work, we study controllability in the set of all density matrices for a two-level open quantum system driven by coherent and incoherent controls. In Pechen (2011 Phys. Rev. A 84 042106) an approximate controllability, i.e. controllability with some precision, was shown for generic N-level open quantum systems driven by coherent and incoherent controls. However, the explicit formulation of this property, including the behavior of this precision as a function of transition frequencies and decoherence rates of the system, was not known. The present work provides a rigorous analytical study of reachable sets for two-level open quantum systems. First, it is shown that for N = 2 the presence of incoherent control does not affect the reachable set (while incoherent control may affect the time necessary to reach particular state). Second, the reachable set in the Bloch ball is described and it is shown that already just for one coherent control any point in the Bloch ball can be achieved with precision delta similar to gamma/omega, where gamma is the decoherence rate and omega is the transition frequency. Typical values are delta less than or similar to 10(-3) that implies high accuracy of achieving any density matrix. Moreover, we show that most points in the Bloch ball can be exactly reached, except of two lacunae of size similar to delta. For two coherent controls, the system is shown to be completely controllable in the set of all density matrices. Third, the reachable set as a function of the final time is found and shown to exhibit a non-trivial structure.

TI Extending the spectral operation of multimode and
   polarization-independent power splitters through subwavelength
   nanotechnology
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Power splitters play a crucial role in virtually all photonic circuits, enabling precise control of on-chip signal distribution. However, state-of-the-art solutions typically present trade-offs in terms of loss, bandwidth, and fabrication robustness, especially when targeting multimode operation. Here, we present a novel multimode 3-dB power splitter based on a symmetric Y-junction assisted by two regions of subwavelength grating metamaterials with different geometries. The proposed device demonstrates high-performance for multimode and dualpolarization operation with relaxed fabrication tolerances by leveraging the additional degrees of freedom offered by two distinct geometries of subwavelength metamaterials to control mode evolution. Our design achieves, to the best of our knowledge, the widest operational bandwidth reported to date for a nanophotonic multimode silicon power splitter. Simulations for a standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator platform predict minimal excess loss (< 0.2 dB) for the fundamental and the first-order transverse-electric modes over an ultrabroad 700 nm bandwidth (1300 - 2000 nm). For the fundamental transverse-magnetic mode, losses are less than 0.3 dB in the 1300 - 1800 nm range. Experimental measurements validate these predictions in the 1430 - 1630 nm wavelength range, demonstrating losses < 0.4 dB for all three modes, even in the presence of fabrication deviations of up to +/- 10 nm. We believe that this device is suitable for the implementation of advanced photonic applications requiring high--performance distribution of optical signals, such as programmable photonics, multitarget spectroscopy and quantum key distribution.

TI Adiabatic weak coherent MHz linewidth O-band single-photon carrier for
   low erroneous phase decoding
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB For weak coherent single-photon secure data communication among short-reach metropolitan intra-/inter-city networks at the O-band (1250-1350 nm), the commercially available semiconductor laser sources are emerging but still suffering from high single-mode-fiber (SMF) loss, broad linewidth, and unstable wavelength. To overcome such disadvantages for enabling the efficient phase-coding link with sufficient secure key rate, a specifically designed adiabatic package with active temperature-/current-feedback control is proposed for the paired O-band MHz-linewidth master-to-slave injection-locked DFBLDs and a polarization-maintaining 1bit-delay interferometer is stabilized with using a passively adiabatic cell to achieve accurate differential phase decoding. Even though, the phonon-induced phase fluctuation still occurs at rising and falling edges of the decoded long-pattern secure data bits delivered from the slave DFBLD, which is mainly attributed to the intra-cavity heating under excessive free-carrier generation via the master DFBLD injection. To stabilize the differential-phase-shift (DPS) keying protocol, the phase-code distortion caused by over-injection-induced Auger heating is effectively suppressed by reducing the overly biased injection with precise master-injection-level control. The rising-/falling-edge damping distortion of the phase-shift-encoded secure bit-stream envelope is suppressed by appropriately decreasing the DC bias current and adjusting the AC encoding amplitude of the master DFBLD. Such operation reduces the incorrect pi phase shift in the injection-locked slave DFBLD biased at optimized below-threshold DC offset, thus allowing single-photon DPS-keying data transmission over 15-km SMF with slightly increasing the single-photon bit-error ratio from <3% (0-km) to 6.2% (15-km).

TI Numerical analysis of dynamical behavior in Josephson junctions with
   non-sinusoidal current-phase relations
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Josephson junction, as the core nonlinear element underpinning superconducting electronics, is characterized by its current-phase relation (CPR), which fundamentally determines the dynamical properties and functional capabilities of superconducting quantum devices. Traditional Josephson junctions typically exhibit a traditional sinusoidal CPR; however, the junctions characterized by non-sinusoidal CPR have recently attracted considerable attention due to their distinctive physical properties and promising quantum device applications. In this work, a numerical model tailored specifically for junctions exhibiting non-sinusoidal CPR is developed by integrating experimentally measured current-voltage (I-V ) characteristics from Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb junctions into a resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) framework. By leveraging this refined model, the influence of CPR skewness on Josephson junction dynamics is systematically investigated. Our results indicate that in underdamped junctions, the critical current significantly diminishes with the increase of CPR skewness, a behavior reminiscent of the adjustable critical currents typically observed in DC superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Conversely, in overdamped junctions, the influence of CPR skewness on the I-V characteristics is found to be negligible. However, our numerical simulations under microwave irradiation indicate that nonsinusoidal CPRs readily promote the emergence of half-integer Shapiro steps in overdamped junctions, thereby establishing CPR skewness as a plausible microscopic origin for this phenomenon. In addition, the advanced design system (ADS) simulations is employed to model nonlinear resonators and DC SQUID circuits, offering a detailed investigation into how nonsinusoidal CPRs modulate the Josephson inductance and magnetic flux response. Our findings reveal that engineering the CPR of Josephson junctions provides substantial flexibility in the design of superconducting qubits, parametric amplifiers, and non-magnetic nonreciprocal devices. This tunability underscores significant opportunities for developing next-generation superconducting electronic components. The Josephson junctions with engineered CPR offer expanded functionality for superconducting quantum technologies. This study suggests that customized CPR can enhance control over the dynamical behavior of junctions, and promote the optimized designs of superconducting qubits, parametric amplifiers, and nonmagnetic nonreciprocal devices.

TI Electronic structure of (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4: Experimental evidence of
   topological phase transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The investigation of methods to control and optimize the physical properties of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4 is a critical challenge for the development of functional materials for quantum technologies and spintronics. The promising approach is to substitute Mn atoms with Ge, Sn, or Pb atoms in the (Mn1-xAIVx)Bi2Te4 (AIV = Ge, Sn, Pb) solid solutions. This substitution enables manageable tuning of the system's magnetic and electronic properties. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of the electronic structure evolution in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 as a function of Pb concentration, using a variety of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy based techniques, including photon-energy-dependent studies, spin-resolved, and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. Special emphasis was placed on identifying experimental evidence of the theoretically predicted topological phase transitions (TPTs) in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 near x approximate to 50%. The criteria for detecting TPT include the presence or absence of topological surface states (TSS) in the electronic structure, which can be identified by their characteristic helical spin structure in spin-resolved or CD spectra, as well as the closure of the bulk band gap. Our results show that the bulk gap in the MnBi2Te4-like electronic structure decreases gradually with increasing Pb concentration up to 40%, where it almost closes. From 40% to 60%, the band gap remains unchanged, and above 80%, the PbBi2Te4-like electronic structure emerges, with the bulk gap reopening. Additionally, the TSS were detected in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 samples with Pb concentrations up to at least 30% and beyond 80%, correlating with the regions where the bulk gap is open. However, no TSS were observed at x approximate to 55%, indicating that the system is in topologically distinct phase compared to MnBi2Te4 or PbBi2Te4. At this concentration, the system may be in a semimetallic state or a trivial insulator phase with a very narrow bulk gap. The demonstrated tunability of the electronic structure in (Mn1-xPbx)Bi2Te4 highlights its potential for further exploration in topological and spintronic applications.

TI Spin dynamics under the influence of elliptically rotating fields:
   Extracting the field topology from time-averaged quantities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Systems that can be effectively described as a localized spin-s particle subject to time-dependent fields have attracted a great deal of interest due to, among other things, their relevance for quantum technologies. Establishing analytical relationships between the topological features of the applied fields and certain time-averaged quantities of the spin can provide important information for the theoretical understanding of these systems. Here, we address this question in the case of a localized spin-s particle subject to a static magnetic field coplanar to a coexisting elliptically rotating magnetic field. The total field periodically traces out an ellipse which encloses the origin of the coordinate system or not, depending on the values taken on by the static and the rotating components. As a result, two regimes with different topological properties characterized by the winding number of the total field emerge: the winding number is 1 if the origin lies inside the ellipse, and 0 if it lies outside. We show that the time average of the energy associated with the rotating component of the magnetic field is always proportional to the time average of the out-of-plane component of the expectation value of the spin. Moreover, the product of the signs of these two time-averaged quantities is uniquely determined by the topology of the total field and, consequently, provides a measurable indicator of this topology. We also propose an implementation of these theoretical results in a trapped-ion quantum system. Remarkably, our findings are valid in the totality of the parameter space and regardless of the initial state of the spin. In particular, when the system is prepared in a Floquet state, we demonstrate that the quasienergies, as a function of the driving amplitude at constant eccentricity, have stationary points at the topological transition boundary. The ability of the topological indicator proposed here to accurately locate the abrupt topological transition can have practical applications for the determination of unknown parameters appearing in the Hamiltonian. In addition, our predictions about the quasienergies can assist in the interpretation of conductance measurements in transport experiments with spin carriers in mesoscopic rings.

TI Efficiency of five RNA extraction protocols for Grammostola actaeon
   (Pocock, 1903) small spinneret tissue samples
SO JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY
AB Systemic optimization of RNA extraction protocols in non-model arachnids is indispensable for gene expression studies, including transcriptome sequencing and analyses. Spinnerets of the Neotropical tarantula Grammostola actaeon (Pocock, 1903) (family Theraphosidae) were used to evaluate the performance of two RNA extraction reagents and three commercially available kits for isolating total RNA from small eukaryotic tissue samples. Total RNA was extracted from spinneret tissues, using two samples for each method. We used the commercially available reagents TRIzol and NucleoZOL and the RNA extraction kits NucleoSpin and NucleoSpin XS (Macherey Nagel) and Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek Corp). Quantification using Qubit revealed that NucleoSpin, Norgen, and NucleoSpin XS resulted in the highest RNA yields respectively, while Nanodrop analysis ranked Norgen, TRIzol, NucleoSpin, NucleoSpin XS in descending order. Bioanalyzer analysis indicated that Nucleospin, and NucleoSpin XS delivered the best results for our samples. While each method successfully yielded sufficient RNA for RNA-seq experiments, variations in RNA quality among methods indicate differences in their suitability for specific applications. Our data provide further evidence that RNA integrity number (RIN)-based assessments in G. actaeon may not be reliable for evaluating RNA quality due to a widespread occurrence of the 'gap deletion' phenomenon in arthropods. RNA from species with 28S rRNA collapsed can yield high-quality transcriptomes, suggesting that current RIN-based assessments may not be reliable for evaluating RNA quality in many non-model invertebrates. Overall, differences in results of commercially available RNA extraction reagents/kits should be considered when selecting the most appropriate RNA extraction method for gene expression analysis.

TI Gut microbiota and physical activity level: characterization from
   sedentary to soccer players
SO BIOLOGY OF SPORT
AB Evidence of the relationship between physical activity and gut microbiota composition is steadily increasing. The purpose of the study is to compare the gut microbiota composition of a group of elite male soccer players with a group of subjects with different physical activity levels. Cross-sectional studies were performed on 91 healthy young males, in detail: 17 elite soccer players (23.7 +/- 4.2 yrs, BMI 23.2 +/- 1.2 kg/m 2 ); 14 with high levels of physical training (24.5 +/- 5.6 yrs, BMI 22.7 +/- 0.8 kg/m 2 ); 23 with moderate levels of physical training (29.3 +/- 3.9 yrs, BMI 22.5 +/- 0.8 kg/m 2 ); and 37 healthy men without exercise habits (28.1 +/- 5.9 yrs, BMI 22.4 +/- 1.0 kg/m 2 ). Relative microbiota composition was determined by analyzing DNA extracted from stool samples. The quality and quantity of extracted DNA were assessed using a Qubit Fluorometer. Differences between subjects' populations were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni's post -hoc test was employed to identify localized effects. Elite soccer players and subjects with high physical activity levels showed a significantly higher prevalence of the nine microbiota populations analyzed than subjects with moderate physical training or who were sedentary. No differences were found in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio among the different study populations. This study reports the gut microbiota parameters of elite footballers for the first time. In addition, it brings new insights into the effects of different levels of physical activity on the composition of the gut microbiota.

TI Indistinguishable MHz-narrow heralded photon pairs from a whispering
   gallery resonator
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference plays a vital role in many quantum optical applications where indistinguishability of two photons is important. Such photon pairs are commonly generated as the signal and idler in the polarization-degenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). To scale this approach to a larger number of photons, we demonstrate how two independent signal photons radiated into different spatial modes can be rendered conditionally indistinguishable by a heralding measurement performed on their respective idlers. We use the SPDC in a whispering gallery resonator, which is already proven to be versatile sources of quantum states. Its extreme conversion efficiency allowed us to perform our measurements with only 50 nW of in-coupled pump power in each propagation direction. The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two counterpropagating signal photons manifested itself in the fourfold coincidence rate, where the detection of two idler photons heralds a pair of signal photons with a desired temporal overlap. We achieved the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip contrast of 74% +/- 5%. Importantly, the optical bandwidth of all involved photons is of the order of a MHz and is continuously tunable. This, on the one hand, makes it possible to achieve the necessary temporal measurement resolution with standard electronics and, on the other hand, creates a quantum state source compatible with other candidates for qubit implementation, such as optical transitions in solid-state or vaporous systems. We also discuss the possibility of generating photon pairs with similar temporal modes from two different whispering gallery resonators. (c) 2025 Author(s).

AB The non-destructive readout capability of the Skipper Charge Coupled Device (CCD) has been demonstrated to reduce the noise limitation of conventional silicon devices to levels that allow single-photon or single-electron counting. The noise reduction is achieved by taking multiple measurements of the charge in each pixel. These multiple measurements come at the cost of extra readout time, which has been a limitation for the broader adoption of this technology in particle physics, quantum imaging, and astronomy applications. This work presents recent results of a novel sensor architecture that uses multiple non-destructive floating-gate amplifiers in series to achieve sub-electron readout noise in a thick, fully-depleted silicon detector to overcome the readout time overhead of the Skipper-CCD. This sensor is called the Multiple-Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) can perform multiple independent charge measurements with each amplifier, and the measurements from multiple amplifiers can be combined to further reduce the readout noise. We will show results obtained for sensors with 8 and 16 amplifiers per readout stage in new readout operations modes to optimize its readout speed. The noise reduction capability of the new techniques will be demonstrated in terms of its ability to reduce the noise by combining the information from the different amplifiers, and to resolve signals in the order of a single photon per pixel. The first readout operation explored here avoids the extra readout time needed in the MAS-CCD to read a line of the sensor asociated with the extra extent of the serial register. The second technique explore the capability of the MAS-CCD device to perform a region of interest readout increasing the number of multiple samples per amplifier in a targeted region of the active area of the device.

TI Multidimensional compressed sensing to advance 23Na
   multi-quantum coherences MRI
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE
AB Purpose: Sodium ((23) Na) multi-quantum coherences (MQC) MRI was accelerated using three-dimensional (3D) and a dedicated five-dimensional (5D) compressed sensing (CS) framework for simultaneous Cartesian single (SQ) and triple quantum (TQ) sodium imaging of in vivo human brain at 3.0 and 7.0 T.Theory and methods: 3D (23) Na MQC MRI requires multi-echo paired with phase-cycling and exhibits thus a multidimensional space. A joint reconstruction framework to exploit the sparsity in all imaging dimensions by extending the conventional 3D CS framework to 5D was developed. 3D MQC images of simulated brain, phantom and healthy brain volunteers obtained from 3.0 T and 7.0 T were retrospectively and prospectively undersampled. Performance of the CS models were analyzed by means of structural similarity index (SSIM), root mean squared error (RMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal quantification of tissue sodium concentration and TQ/SQ ratio.Results: It was shown that an acceleration of three-fold, leading to less than 2 x 102 x 10 min of scan time with a resolution of ( )8 x 8 x 20mm(3) at 3.0 T, are possible. 5D CS improved SSIM by 3%, 5%, 1% and reduced RMSE by 50%, 30%, 8% for in vivo SQ, TQ, and TQ/SQ ratio maps, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time prospective undersampling enabled unprecedented high resolution from 8 x 8 x 20mm(3) to 6 x 6 x 10mm(3) MQC images of in vivo human brain at 7.0 T without extending acquisition time.Conclusion: 5D CS proved to allow up to three-fold acceleration retrospectively on 3.0 T data. 2-fold acceleration was demonstrated prospectively at 7.0 T to reach higher spatial resolution of (23) Na MQC MRI.

TI Low-rank reconstruction for simultaneous double half-echo
   23Na and undersampled 23Na multi-quantum
   coherences MRI
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE
AB Purpose: To develop a new sequence to simultaneously acquire Cartesian sodium (Na-23) MRI and accelerated Cartesian single (SQ) and triple quantum (TQ) sodium MRI of in vivo human brain at 7 T by leveraging two dedicated low-rank reconstruction frameworks. Theory and Methods: The Double Half-Echo technique enables short echo time Cartesian Na-23 MRI and acquires two k-space halves, reconstructed by a low-rank coupling constraint. Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) Na-23 Multi-Quantum Coherences (MQC) MRI requires multi-echo sampling paired with phase-cycling, exhibiting a redundant multidimensional space. Simultaneous Autocalibrating and k-Space Estimation (SAKE) were used to reconstruct highly undersampled Na-23 MQC MRI. Reconstruction performance was assessed against five-dimensional (5D) CS, evaluating structural similarity index (SSIM), root mean squared error (RMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and quantification of tissue sodium concentration and TQ/SQ ratio in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. Results: The proposed sequence enabled the simultaneous acquisition of fully sampled Na-23 MRI while leveraging prospective undersampling for Na-23 MQC MRI. SAKE improved TQ image reconstruction regarding SSIM by 6% and reduced RMSE by 35% compared to 5D CS in vivo. Thanks to prospective undersampling, the spatial resolution of Na-23 MQC MRI was enhanced from 8 x 8 x 15 mm(3) to 8 x 8 x 8 mm(3) while reducing acquisition time from 2 x 31 min to 2 x 23 min. Conclusion: The proposed sequence, coupled with low-rank reconstructions, provides an efficient framework for comprehensive whole-brain sodium MRI, combining TSC, T2*, and TQ/SQ ratio estimations. Additionally, low-rank matrix completion enables the reconstruction of highly undersampled Na-23 MQC MRI, allowing for accelerated acquisition or enhanced spatial resolution.

TI Historical Perspectives, State of Art and Research Trends of SPAD Arrays
   and Their Applications (Part II: SPAD Arrays)
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The ability to detect single photons is becoming an enabling key capability in an increasing number of fields. Indeed, its scope is not limited to applications that specifically rely on single photons, such as quantum imaging, but extends to applications where a low signal is overwhelmed by background light, such as laser ranging, or in which faint excitation light is required not to damage the sample or harm the patient. In the last decades, SPADs gained popularity with respect to other single-photon detectors thanks to their small size, possibility to be integrated in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor processes, room temperature operability, low power supply and, above all, the possibility to be fast gated (to time filter the incoming signal) and to precisely timestamp the detected photons. The development of large digital arrays that integrates the detectors and circuits has allowed the implementation of complex functionality on-chip, tailoring the detectors to suit the need of specific applications. This review proposes a complete overview of silicon SPADs characteristics and applications. In the previous Part I, starting with the working principle, simulation models and required frontend, the paper moves to the most common parameters adopted in literature for characterizing SPAD performance and describes single pixels applications and their performance. In this Part II, the focus is posed on the development of SPAD arrays, presenting some of the most notable examples found in literature. The actual exploitation of these designs in real applications (e.g., automotive, bioimaging and radiation detectors) is then discussed.

TI Cybersecurity in Satellite Communication Networks: Key Threats and
   Neutralization Measures
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB The proliferation of satellite mega-constellations, such as SpaceX's Starlink and NewSpace initiatives, particularly CubeSat deployments, and their integration into terrestrial 5G/6G networks have transformed space-based communications. While this technological convergence has brought numerous advantages, it has also introduced a new vector of cybersecurity threats to both traditional satellite infrastructure and novel small-satellite architectures. Owing to their broadcast nature and extensive coverage area, satellite signals are inherently susceptible to jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping, rendering them appealing targets for malicious actors. Moreover, satellites operate under power, computational, and bandwidth limits, which restrict the implementation of resource-intensive security measures. Therefore, it is necessary to develop robust and lightweight security frameworks capable of countering threats across multiple orbital domains, communication protocols, and network integration points. This paper presents a hybrid research contribution that combines a systematic survey of key cyber threats with novel conceptual and practical security frameworks for satellite communication (SATCOMs) networks. It weaves threats, defenses, and governance into a coherent scaffold that follows the entire SATCOM stack-space, ground, and user-across all orbits. Unlike most previous studies-which treat countermeasures in a fragmented manner with limited synergy across layers-this study presents cyber threats using the confidentiality-integrity-availability (CIA) triad and presents a multilayered security framework that combines physical-layer hardening, quantum-resilient encryption, and AI-driven analytics, supported by a governance framework aligned with standards, within one integrated workflow. The undertaken approach uniquely addresses prevention, defense, resilience, and collaboration through detailed countermeasures. This bridges the gap between isolated security solutions and the interconnected nature of modern SATCOM ecosystems. The analysis of the research reveals that prioritizing lightweight AI, quantum resilience, and cross-layer security by real-world SATCOM operators and agencies is critical for securing next-generation SATCOMs against sophisticated cyber-attacks. Moreover, the convergence of SATCOMs with 5G/6G, AI, and quantum technologies requires interdisciplinary research to address the interoperability, scalability, and ever-increasing cyber threats in SATCOMs.

TI Ultra-low-energy nitrogen ion interactions with diamond surfaces: Impact
   of crystal orientation on bonding and thermal stability
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This study investigates the influence of crystal orientation on nitrogen incorporation, bonding configurations, and thermal stability in (100)- and (111)-oriented single-crystal diamond (SCD) surfaces implanted with ultra-low-energy N-2(+) ions (100 and 200 eV; dose: 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2)). Upon impact, N-2(+) ions dissociate, and each interacting nitrogen atom receives half the kinetic energy (50 and 100 eV), making the process ideal for studying near-threshold defect formation. Low-energy electron diffraction revealed a reconstructed surface with coexisting (2 x 1) and (1 x 2) domains on (100) SCD, while the (111) surface maintained a well-ordered (1 x 1) structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that (100) SCD incorporates and retains more nitrogen than (111), with superior thermal stability up to 1000 degrees C. Despite the low implantation energy, both surfaces exhibit minimal structural defect (C-def), although (100) SCD is slightly more susceptible to defect formation. Implanted nitrogen forms primarily C-N/C=N and N-(sp(2) C/C-def) bonds, with the former dominating. These bonding configurations evolve with temperature and crystal orientation. The N-(sp(2) C/C-def) component remains stable between 300 and 700 degrees C and decreases at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures, nitrogen remains in interstitial form (N-i), forming N-i-C-i complexes with mobile carbon interstitials (C-i), which stabilize N-(sp(2) C/C-def) bonding. At elevated temperatures (800-1000 degrees C), N-i converts to substitutional nitrogen (N-s), reducing the defect-associated bonding signal. Overall, (100) SCD shows a stronger tendency for defect-mediated nitrogen stabilization than (111). These insights into ultra-low-energy nitrogen-diamond interactions may guide future strategies for surface engineering and stabilization of shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond-based quantum technologies.

TI The Role of 6G Technologies in Advancing Smart City Applications:
   Opportunities and Challenges
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks has already laid the ground-work for futuristic smart cities but along with this, it has also triggered the rapid growth of a wide range of applications, for example, the Internet of Everything (IoE), online gaming, extended/virtual reality (XR/VR), telemedicine, cloud computing, and others, which require ultra-low latency, ubiquitous coverage, higher data rates, extreme device density, ultra-high capacity, energy efficiency, and better reliability. Moreover, the predicted explosive surge in mobile traffic until 2030 along with envisioned potential use-cases/scenarios in a smart city context will far exceed the capabilities for which 5G was designed. Therefore, there is a need to harness the 6th Generation (6G) capabilities, which will not only meet the stringent requirements of smart megacities but can also open up a new range of potential applications. Other crucial concerns that need to be addressed are related to network security, data privacy, interoperability, the digital divide, and other integration issues. In this article, we examine current and emerging trends for the implementation of 6G in the smart city arena. Firstly, we give an inclusive and comprehensive review of potential 6th Generation (6G) mobile communication technologies that can find potential use in smart cities. The discussion of each technology also covers its potential benefits, challenges and future research direction. Secondly, we also explore promising smart city applications that will use these 6G technologies, such as, smart grids, smart healthcare, smart waste management, etc. In the conclusion part, we have also highlighted challenges and suggestions for possible future research directions. So, in a single paper, we have attempted to provide a wider perspective on 6G-enabled smart cities by including both the potential 6G technologies and their smart city applications. This paper will help readers gain a holistic view to ascertain the benefits, opportunities and applications that 6G technology can bring to meet the diverse, massive and futuristic requirements of smart cities.

TI Structured Light Fields with 2D Tunable Indices Generated in a Raman
   Microchip Laser
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Structured light fields in the form of Hermite-Gaussian modes with 2D tunable indices of m and n (HGm,n), and optical vortices in the form of Laguerre-Gaussian modes with radial index p and azimuthal index l (LGp,l) are extremely needed for applications on optical communications, optical trapping, and quantum information processing. Here, high-order HGm,n modes and LGp,l optical vortices with 2D tunable indices are generated in a gain-manipulated Yb:YAG/YVO4 Raman microchip laser (RML). The gain distribution is manipulated by controlling the separation between Yb:YAG crystal and the focus spot of the y-axis of the laser diode (Delta z). HGm,n modes with 2D tunable indices of m up to 14 and n up to 2 are generated in Yb:YAG/YVO4 RML by setting Delta z = -0.5, -4.1, and -6.6 mm. The power of HG14,0, HG7,1, and HG6,2 mode lasers are 0.49, 0.31, and 0.34 W under pump power of 3.1 W, and corresponding optical efficiencies are 11%, 7%, and 7.7%. LGp,l optical vortices with p = 0, 1, 2, and l up to 14 are converted from HGm,n mode lasers with a conversion efficiency of over 90%. High beam quality HGm,n modes, and LGp,l optical vortices with 2D tunable indices oscillating at Stokes wavelengths dramatically extend their applications.

TI Ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules
SO NATURE
AB Ultracold polyatomic molecules offer opportunities1 in cold chemistry2,3, precision measurements4 and quantum information processing5,6, because of their rich internal structure. However, their increased complexity compared with diatomic molecules presents a challenge in using conventional cooling techniques. Here we demonstrate an approach to create weakly bound ultracold polyatomic molecules by electroassociation7 (F.D. et al., manuscript in preparation) in a degenerate Fermi gas of microwave-dressed polar molecules through a field-linked resonance8-11. Starting from ground-state NaK molecules, we create around 1.1 x 103 weakly bound tetratomic (NaK)2 molecules, with a phase space density of 0.040(3) at a temperature of 134(3) nK, more than 3,000 times colder than previously realized tetratomic molecules12. We observe a maximum tetramer lifetime of 8(2) ms in free space without a notable change in the presence of an optical dipole trap, indicating that these tetramers are collisionally stable. Moreover, we directly image the dissociated tetramers through microwave-field modulation to probe the anisotropy of their wavefunction in momentum space. Our result demonstrates a universal tool for assembling weakly bound ultracold polyatomic molecules from smaller polar molecules, which is a crucial step towards Bose-Einstein condensation of polyatomic molecules and towards a new crossover from a dipolar Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid13-15 to a Bose-Einstein condensation of tetramers. Moreover, the long-lived field-linked state provides an ideal starting point for deterministic optical transfer to deeply bound tetramer states16-18.
   Ultracold polyatomic molecules can be created by electroassociation in a degenerate Fermi gas of microwave-dressed polar molecules through a field-linked resonance.

TI Investigation of artificial quantum structures constructed by atom
   manipulation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The atom manipulation technique based on scanning tunneling microscope refers to a method of relocating single atoms or molecules on a certain surface at atomic accuracy by using an atomically sharp tip, which is a unique and powerful tool for studying the quantum physics and prototype quantum devices on a nanometer scale. This technique allows us to build artificial structure atom-by-atom, thus some desired interesting quantum structures which are difficult to grow or fabricate by conventional methods could be realized, and unique quantum states, spin order, band structure could be created by the fine tuning of the structural parameters like lattice constant, symmetry, periodicity, etc. Combined with nanosecond scale time domain electric measurement and autonomous control technique, the atom manipulation would be useful in exploring the atomic precision prototype quantum devices, and providing some valuable knowledge for future electronics. In this review, we introduce the atom manipulation technique and related milestone research achievements and latest progress of artificial quantum structures, including electronic lattices with exotic quantum states on Cu(111), quantum dots on III-V semiconductors, magnetic structures with tunable spin order, structures for quantum information storage and processing, prototype Boolean logic devices and single atom devices. The STM lithography and autonomous atom manipulation are discussed as well. With such improvements, this technique would play more important roles in developing the functional quantum devices in future.

TI Raw QPP-RNG randomness via system jitter across platforms: a NIST SP
   800-90B evaluation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB High-quality randomness is fundamental to the security of modern cryptographic systems. We present QPP-RNG, a true random number generator (TRNG) that harvests entropy from diverse system-level jitters-including CPU pipeline timing divergences, DRAM refresh cycle perturbations, cache miss-driven memory access latencies, and other subtle hardware and operating system-induced fluctuations. QPP-RNG's core mechanism measures the elapsed time of randomized array sorting operations-where each Fisher-Yates shuffle is infinitesimally perturbed by these microscopic jitters-and amplifies these timing variations into cryptographically strong randomness through a quantum permutation pad (QPP) architecture, all achievable on commodity hardware. The raw output of QPP-RNG underwent rigorous evaluation for independent and identically distributed (IID) behavior using the NIST SP 800-90B IID test suite, alongside the comprehensive NIST SP 800-22 and ENT statistical test batteries. Across a range of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Raspberry Pi, QPP-RNG consistently achieved high IID min-entropy between \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$7.85$$\end{document} and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$7.95$$\end{document} bits/byte. It passed all NIST SP 800-90B IID tests with \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$p$$\end{document}-values significantly above the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha =0.01$$\end{document} threshold, confirming that its generated randomness is statistically indistinguishable from ideal IID sources derived directly from system jitter. Cross-platform analyses spanning x86_64 and ARM64 architectures further demonstrate that the extracted jitter fingerprint-and consequently the generated randomness-exhibits remarkable statistical consistency, irrespective of the underlying hardware or operating system. QPP-RNG's entropy density compares favorably with leading commercial entropy sources. It matches or slightly exceeds the NIST IID-certified min-entropy of ID Quantique's Quantis QRNG (7.8744 bits/byte), and significantly outperforms both Red Hat's CPU Time Jitter RNG (7.4528 bits/byte) and Quside's PCIe One quantum entropy source (6.5136 bits/byte). Even against specialized hardware RNGs like Microchip's ECC608 (4.0568 bits/byte), QPP-RNG demonstrates superior performance using only general-purpose processors. By effectively transforming otherwise discarded system noise into a reliable and high-quality entropy stream, QPP-RNG establishes a novel paradigm for embedded security, providing a robust entropy source on general-purpose devices without specialized hardware. This makes it especially well-suited for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing applications where strong entropy sources are paramount.

TI Quantum Electrodynamics from Quantum Cellular Automata, and the Tension
   Between Symmetry, Locality, and Positive Energy
SO ENTROPY
AB Recent work has demonstrated a correspondence that bridges quantum information processing and high-energy physics: discrete quantum cellular automata (QCA) can, in the continuum limit, reproduce quantum field theories (QFTs). This QCA/QFT correspondence raises fundamental questions about how matter/energy, information, and the nature of spacetime are related. Here, we show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose QCA theories on the cubic lattice derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so, we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space and a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the QCA theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of QCAs and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of QCAs seems to require a non-zero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that, by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range, it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.

TI Influence of Substituents on the Vectorial Difference Static Dipole Upon
   Excitation in Synthetic Bacteriochlorins
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Organic dye aggregates have been shown to exhibit exciton delocalization in natural and synthetic systems. Such dye aggregates show promise in the emerging area of quantum information science (QIS). We believe that the difference in static dipole (Delta d) is an essential dye parameter in the development of molecular QIS systems. However, a foundational understanding of the structural factors influencing Delta d remains elusive. Bacteriochlorins play a vital role in photosynthesis due to their exceptional photophysical properties. Therefore, bacteriochlorins are particularly suitable dyes for the construction of aggregate systems for QIS. Synthetic bacteriochlorins further offer stability and tunability via chemical modifications. Here, the influence of substituents on the Delta d of monomeric (nonaggregated) dyes was investigated via density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)DFT in a set of 5-methoxybacteriochlorins progressively substituted with ethynyl, phenyl, and phenylethynyl substituents at the 3,13 and 3,13,15 positions of the macrocycle. Symmetrically substituted 5-methoxybacteriochlorins were shown to have the largest Delta d. The increase in Delta d in the series of dyes was largely due to changes in the orientation of the static dipole upon excitation rather than large changes in magnitude. In addition, the transition dipole (mu) and the angle between Delta d and mu (zeta) were calculated. Three 5-methoxybacteriochlorins with large predicted Delta d and mu values were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. The trend in Delta d values empirically determined using the solvatochromic Stokes shift method was comparable to the DFT calculations.

TI Electronic Structure and Excited-State Dynamics of DNA-Templated
   Monomers and Aggregates of Asymmetric Polymethine Dyes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Aggregates of conjugated organic molecules (i.e., dyes) may exhibit relatively large one- and two-exciton interaction energies, which has motivated theoretical studies on their potential use in quantum information science (QIS). In practice, one way of realizing large one- and two-exciton interaction energies is by maximizing the transition dipole moment (mu) and difference static dipole moment (Delta d) of the constituent dyes. In this work, we characterized the electronic structure and excited-state dynamics of monomers and aggregates of four asymmetric polymethine dyes templated via DNA. Using steady-state and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy along with quantum-chemical calculations, we found the asymmetric polymethine dye monomers exhibited a large mu, an appreciable Delta d, and a long excited-state lifetime (tau(p)). We formed dimers of all four dyes and observed that one dye, Dy 754, displayed the strongest propensity for aggregation and exciton delocalization. Motivated by these results, we undertook a more comprehensive survey of Dy 754 dimer and tetramer aggregates using steady-state absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Modeling these spectra revealed an appreciable excitonic hopping parameter (J). Lastly, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to characterize tau(p) of the dimer and tetramer, which we observed to be exceedingly short. This work revealed that asymmetric polymethine dyes exhibited mu, Delta d, monomer tau(p), and J values promising for QIS; however, further work is needed to overcome excited-state quenching and achieve long aggregate tau(p).

TI Angular momentum of the vortex ultrashort pulsed beam with a smaller
   beam waist
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The angular momentum (AM) of light has important implications for many fields of optics research, such as optics communication, quantum information and laser-scan microscopy. Thus, in this paper, we intend to investigate the average AM of the vortex ultrashort pulsed beam (VUPB), which is generated and widely applied in the field of high-intensity and ultrafast regimes. According to the vector potential, we firstly derive the electromagnetic field of the VUPB, then analyze the spatial intensity, the phase profile and the polarization state of the beam. We explore that the total AM per photon of VUPB is not nh value when the beam waist wo is of wavelength or sub-wavelength order, since the polarization of VUPB is changed from linear to circular polarization with the decrease of beam waist, which introduces the conversion of the orbital AM to the spin AM. Moreover, based on the conservation of the total AM, the minimum waist of VUPB can be obtained, which is dependent on the pulse duration time a and topological charge n. Finally, the average AM of the fractional VUPB expressed by the superposition of the integer VUPB with different weights, is analyzed, which is not equal to the AM of fractional CW beam mu - sin (2 mu pi)/2 pi (mu is the fractional topological charge), but is associated with the beam waist w(0) and alpha. Therefore, we think that the AM of VUPB can be controlled by adjusting the alpha and w(0). (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB In a semi-review paper (a review with novel results included), we note first that the so-called Jahn-Teller effects (JTEs), in their presently recognized four modifications, emerge as particular cases of a more general law, stating that "Nature tends to avoid degeneracies and pseudo-degeneracies in atomic matter by means of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)". This "Law of Nature" obviously influences all the relevant properties of polyatomic systems, including those with direct applications in materials science and engineering, as well as in materials transformations, notably, in chemical reactions. The exploration to the latter is quite novel: we show that the energy barriers in chemical transformations are controlled by the pseudo-JTE (PJTE), opening uncharted ways of catalytic action. The applications of JTEs theory in materials science is already more advanced, utilizing the SSB-induced special nuclear dynamics, which is very sensitive to external perturbations. One of its novel aspects is to modify the properties of the system by means of external influence targeting its JTEs parameters, their underlying degeneracies. We show here some notable trends with illustrative examples, including the JTEs in local centers in crystals used as qubits in quantum information storage, alteration of whole crystal lattice properties by inducing the JTE in one of its sublattices, planarization of puckered (buckled) two-dimensional systems by coordination to atoms that quench their PJTE-induced out-of-plane distortion, and the origin of a whole series of solid state properties of perovskite crystals, triggered by the local PJTE.

TI Operator Relaxation and the Optimal Depth of Classical Shadows
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Classical shadows are a powerful method for learning many properties of quantum states in a sampleefficient manner, by making use of randomized measurements. Here we study the sample complexity of learning the expectation value of Pauli operators via "shallow shadows," a recently proposed version of classical shadows in which the randomization step is effected by a local unitary circuit of variable depth t. We show that the shadow norm (the quantity controlling the sample complexity) is expressed in terms of properties of the Heisenberg time evolution of operators under the randomizing ("twirling") circuit- namely the evolution of the weight distribution characterizing the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially. For spatially contiguous Pauli operators of weight k, this entails a competition between two processes: operator spreading (whereby the support of an operator grows over time, increasing its weight) and operator relaxation (whereby the bulk of the operator develops an equilibrium density of identity operators, decreasing its weight). From this simple picture we derive (i) an upper bound on the shadow norm which, for depth t & SIM; log(k), guarantees an exponential gain in sample complexity over the t = 0 protocol in any spatial dimension, and (ii) quantitative results in one dimension within a mean-field approximation, including a universal subleading correction to the optimal depth, found to be in excellent agreement with infinite matrix product state numerical simulations. Our Letter connects fundamental ideas in quantum many-body dynamics to applications in quantum information science, and paves the way to highly optimized protocols for learning different properties of quantum states.

TI Research progress of photon response mechanism of superconducting
   nanowire single photon detector
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) plays a significant role in plenty of fields such as quantum information, deep space laser communication and lidar, while the mechanism of the photon response process still lacks a recognized theory. It is prerequisite and essential for fabricating high-performance SNSPD to understand in depth and clarify the photon response mechanism of the SNSPD. As mature theories on the SNSPD response progress, hot-spot model and vortex-based model both have their disadvantages: in the former there exists the cut-off wavelength and in the later there is the size effect, so they both need further improving. The Cut-off wavelength means that the detection efficiency of the SNSPD drops to zero with the increase of light wavelength, which is indicated by the hot-spot model but not yet observed in experiment. The size effect implies that the vortex does not exist in the weak link with the width less than 4.41 xi, where xi is the GL coherence length. Phase slip is responsible for the intrinsic dissipation of superconductors, which promises to expound the SNSPD photon response progress and to establish a complete theory. This paper reviews and discusses the fundamental conception, the development history and the research progress of the hot-spot models, i.e. the vortex-based model and the superconductor phase slips, providing a reference for studying the SNSPD photon response mechanism.

TI Quantum hypothesis testing in many-body systems
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB One of the key tasks in physics is to perform measurements in order to determine the state of a system. Often, measurements are aimed at determining the values of physical parameters, but one can also ask simpler questions, such as "is the system in state A or state B?". In quantum mechanics, the latter type of measurements can be studied and optimized using the framework of quantum hypothesis testing. In many cases one can explicitly find the optimal measurement in the limit where one has simultaneous access to a large number n of identical copies of the system, and estimate the expected error as n becomes large. Interestingly, error estimates turn out to involve various quantum information theoretic quantities such as relative entropy, thereby giving these quantities operational meaning. In this paper we consider the application of quantum hypothesis testing to quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory. We review some of the necessary background material, and study in some detail the situation where the two states one wants to distinguish are parametrically close. The relevant error estimates involve quantities such as the variance of relative entropy, for which we prove a new inequality. We explore the optimal measurement strategy for spin chains and two-dimensional conformal field theory, focusing on the task of distinguishing reduced density matrices of subsystems. The optimal strategy turns out to be somewhat cumbersome to implement in practice, and we discuss a possible alternative strategy and the corresponding errors. Copyright J. de Boer et al.

TI Leveraging 3d-4f Coordination: Molecular Quantum Spring-Magnet Behavior
   in Axial Ni2Ln Complexes
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB We report heterotrimetallic 3d-4f complexes, mimicking classical exchange spring magnets at the molecular scale. The complexes feature a linear Ni<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>Ln<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>Ni core, where the lanthanide ion is sandwiched between two Ni2+ centers coordinated by N3O3 ligand environments. The complexes are isostructural, while CASSCF calculations reveal collinear anisotropy axes and favorable electronic configurations for magnetic bistability in selected systems. Magnetic characterization via DC, AC, and mu SQUID magnetometry down to 30 mK demonstrates slow magnetic relaxation and open hysteresis loops exclusively in Ni2Tb, Ni2Dy, and Ni2Ho. These systems exhibit ferromagnetic 3d-4f coupling, while their isolated or antiferromagnetically coupled analogs (Ni2Y, Zn2Tb/Dy) and Ni2Er/Yb counterparts show fast relaxation and closed loops. Analysis suggests that the Ni2+ ions alone, with modest anisotropy, deviate from the expected "hard" magnetic behavior due to a broad zero-field QTM, while the Ln3+ ions alone serve as the "soft" phase with large magnetic moments and sharp zero-field QTM. Nevertheless, when brought together, their coupling and alignment of the anisotropy axis enhances the magnetic performance with exchange-bias features mimicking the macroscopic exchange spring magnets. We highlight an optimal utilization of 3d-4f coordination in designing molecular magnets with tunable relaxation and bistability, advancing prospects for quantum information and nanoscale magnetic devices.

TI Disordered hyperuniform solid state materials
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) states are recently discovered exotic states of condensed matter. DHU systems are similar to liquids or glasses in that they are statistically isotropic and lack conventional long-range translational and orientational order. On the other hand, they completely suppress normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations like crystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range correlation. Very recently, there have been several exciting discoveries of disordered hyperuniformity in solid-state materials, including amorphous carbon nanotubes, amorphous 2D silica, amorphous graphene, defected transition metal dichalcogenides, defected pentagonal 2D materials, and medium/high-entropy alloys. It has been found that the DHU states of these materials often possess a significantly lower energy than other disorder models and can lead to unique electronic and thermal transport properties, which results from mechanisms distinct from those identified for their crystalline counterparts. For example, DHU states can enhance electronic transport in 2D amorphous silica; DHU medium/high-entropy alloys realize the Vegard's law and possess enhanced electronic bandgaps and thermal transport at low temperatures. These unique properties open up many promising potential device applications in optoelectronics and thermoelectrics. Here, we provide a focused review on these important new developments of hyperuniformity in solid-state materials, taking an applied and "materials" perspective, which complements the existing reviews on hyperuniformity in physical systems and photonic materials. Future directions and outlook are also provided, with a focus on the design and discovery of DHU quantum materials for quantum information science and engineering.

TI Constructing a bridge between functioning of oscillatory neuronal
   networks and quantum-like cognition along with quantum-inspired
   computation and AI
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB Quantum-like (QL) modeling, one of the outcomes of the quantum information revolution, extends quantum theory methods beyond physics to decision theory and cognitive psychology. While effective in explaining paradoxes in decision making and effects in cognitive psychology, such as conjunction, disjunction, order, and response replicability, it lacks a direct link to neural information processing in the brain. This study bridges neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive psychology, exploring how oscillatory neuronal networks give rise to QL behaviors. Inspired by the computational power of neuronal oscillations and quantum-inspired computation (QIC), we propose a quantum-theoretical framework for coupling of cognition/decision making and neural oscillations-QL oscillatory cognition. This is a step, may be very small, toward clarification of the relation between mind and matter and the nature of perception and cognition. We formulate four conjectures within QL oscillatory cognition and in principle they can be checked experimentally. But such experimental tests need further theoretical and experimental elaboration. One of the conjectures (Conjecture 4) is on resolution of the binding problem by exploring QL states entanglement generated by the oscillations in a few neuronal networks. Our findings suggest that fundamental cognitive processes align with quantum principles, implying that humanoid AI should process information using quantum-theoretic laws. Quantum-Like AI (QLAI) can be efficiently realized via oscillatory networks performing QIC.

TI Generation of Higher-Order Hermite-Gaussian Modes Based on Physical
   Model and Deep Learning
SO PHOTONICS
AB The higher-order Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes exhibit complex spatial distributions and find a wide range of applications in fields such as quantum information processing, optical communications, and precision measurements. In recent years, the advancement of deep learning has emerged as an effective approach for generating higher-order HG modes. However, the traditional data-driven deep learning method necessitates a substantial amount of labeled data for training, entails a lengthy data acquisition process, and imposes stringent requirements on system stability. In practical applications, these methods are confronted with challenges such as the high cost of data labeling. This paper proposes a method that integrates a physical model with deep learning. By utilizing only a single intensity distribution of the target optical field and incorporating the physical model, the training of the neural network can be accomplished, thereby eliminating the dependency of traditional data-driven deep learning methods on large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the traditional data-driven deep learning method, the method proposed in this paper yields a smaller root mean squared error between the generated higher-order HG modes. The quality of the generated modes is higher, while the training time of the neural network is shorter, indicating greater efficiency. By incorporating the physical model into deep learning, this approach overcomes the limitations of traditional deep learning methods, offering a novel solution for applying deep learning in light field manipulation, quantum physics, and other related fields.

TI Tailoring Coherent Microwave Emission from a Solid-State Hybrid System

SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Quantum electronics operating in the microwave domain are burgeoning and becoming essential building blocks of quantum computers, sensors, and communication devices. However, the field of microwave quantum electronics has long been dominated by the need for cryogenic conditions to maintain delicate quantum characteristics. Here, a solid-state hybrid system, constituted by a photo-excited pentacene triplet spin ensemble coupled to a dielectric resonator, is reported for the first time capable of both coherent microwave quantum amplification and oscillation at X band via the masing process at room temperature. By incorporating external driving and active dissipation control into the hybrid system, efficient tuning of the maser emission characteristics at approximate to 9.4 GHz is achieved, which is key to optimizing the performance of the maser device. The work not only pushes the boundaries of the operating frequency and functionality of the existing pentacene masers but also demonstrates a universal route for controlling the masing process at room temperature, highlighting opportunities for optimizing emerging solid-state masers for quantum information processing and communication.
   A solid-state hybrid quantum system, constituted by the optically polarized pentacene triplet spins coupled to a high-quality-factor sapphire microwave cavity, exhibits great potential for quantum amplification and oscillation at X band (approximate to 9.4 GHz) via the masing process at room temperature. The hybrid system can also serve as a nascent platform for investigating the microwave cavity quantum electrodynamics at room temperature. image

TI Beyond islands: a free probabilistic approach
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We give a free probabilistic proposal to compute the fine-grained radiation entropy for an arbitrary bulk radiation state, in the context of the Penington-Shenker-Stanford-Yang (PSSY) model where the gravitational path integral can be implemented with full control. We observe that the replica trick gravitational path integral is combinatorially matching the free multiplicative convolution between the spectra of the gravitational sector and the matter sector respectively. The convolution formula computes the radiation entropy accurately even in cases when the island formula fails to apply. It also helps to justify this gravitational replica trick as a soluble Hausdorff moment problem. We then work out how the free convolution formula can be evaluated using free harmonic analysis, which also gives a new free probabilistic treatment of resolving the separable sample covariance matrix spectrum.
   The free convolution formula suggests that the quantum information encoded in competing quantum extremal surfaces can be modelled as free random variables in a finite von Neumann algebra. Using the close tie between free probability and random matrix theory, we show that the PSSY model can be described as a random matrix model that is essentially a generalization of Page's model. It is then manifest that the island formula is only applicable when the convolution factorizes in regimes characterized by the one-shot entropies. We further show that the convolution formula can be reorganized to a generalized entropy formula in terms of the relative entropy.

TI Optimal subradiant spin wave exchange in dipole-coupled atomic ring
   arrays
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The subwavelength array of quantum emitters provides an ideal platform for exploring rich many-body dynamics, such as super- and subradiance. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of spin wave exchange between two dipole-coupled atomic ring arrays. Subradiant spin waves lead to low-loss and high efficiency of ring-to-ring transfer. The optimal subradiant spin wave exchange occurs at appropriate separations between coplanar rings, despite the fact that the energy transfer efficiency is monotonically enhanced (in the regime <=lambda 0/2 ) as the rings' separation decreases. However, the spin wave will scatter due to the dephasing mechanism of close-by atom pairs, as the separation of two rings is too small. With the increase in the number of atoms on the ring, the subradiant shielding effect also strengthens, leading to a shorter distance for the transfer of spin waves. We investigate the rotation of one of the rings and find that the optimal spin wave exchange corresponds to the scenario where the line connecting the two nearest atoms of the two rings aligns with the center of the circle. Moreover, we study the influence of transition dipole moment orientations on the effective interaction between two atomic rings. We observe that there is a critical point where the effective interaction strength changes dramatically owing to the cooperative effect of the subwavelength atomic array. We believe that our results could be important for quantum information processing based on atomic arrays.

TI Disentangling the physics of the attractive Hubbard model as a fully
   interacting model of fermions via the accessible and symmetry-resolved
   entanglement entropies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The complicated ways in which electrons interact in many-body systems such as molecules and materials have long been viewed through the lens of local electron correlation and associated correlation functions. However, quantum information science has demonstrated that more global diagnostics of quantum states like the entanglement entropy can provide a complementary and clarifying lens on electronic behavior. One particularly useful measure that can be used to distinguish between quantum and classical sources of entanglement is the accessible entanglement, the entanglement available as a quantum resource for systems subject to conservation laws, such as fixed particle number, due to superselection rules. In this work, we introduce an algorithm and demonstrate how to compute accessible and symmetry-resolved entanglements for interacting fermion systems. This is accomplished by combining an incremental version of the swap algorithm with a recursive auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm recently developed by the authors. We apply these tools to study the pairing and charge density waves exhibited in the paradigmatic attractive Hubbard model via entanglement. We find that the particle and spin symmetry-resolved entanglements and their related full probability distribution functions show very clear-and unique-signatures of the underlying electronic behavior even when those features are less pronounced in conventional correlation functions. Overall, this work provides a systematic means of characterizing the entanglement within quantum systems that can grant a deeper understanding of the complicated electronic behavior that underlies quantum phase transitions and crossovers in many-body systems.

TI Silicon Programmable Photonic Circuits Based on Periodic Bimodal
   Waveguides
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Programmable photonic circuits are dense assemblies of waveguide meshes in which the flow of light can be reconfigured by software to implement a wide variety of functions, ranging from radiofrequency filtering to optical computing. However, most programmable architectures to date rely on rather bulky Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), which are not suitable for large-scale and high-density integration. Here, an alternative approach to MZI-based programmable photonic circuits by using slow-light-enhanced periodic bimodal waveguides (PBWs) as programmable units is presented. This study experimentally demonstrates low-loss short tuning elements of 30x 1.7 & mu;m2 in area, achieving a two-orders of magnitude integration density improvement compared to conventional MZIs. A rectangular arrangement of these tunable units is proposed for 3x 3 and 4x 4 matrix multiplication operations to design a feedforward circuit with a footprint of only 100x 250 & mu;m2. Finally, the performance trade-off and benchmark with alternative programmable unit cells are analyzed in order to address the ever-growing demand for large computing requirements in next-generation applications such as artificial intelligence and quantum information processing.
   This study proposes an alternative tunable unit to address some of the most challenging limitations in programmable photonics: large-scale integration and space utilization. It demonstrates the use of periodic bimodal waveguides in the core of the programmable photonic circuit for optical matrix multiplication, with a resulting footprint that vastly outperforms conventional MZI-based approaches by more than two-orders of magnitude.image

TI Roadmap on Optics and Photonics for Security and Encryption
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In 1994, Javidi and Horner published a paper in Optical Engineering that highlighted the ability of free space optical systems to manipulate sensitive data for authentication purposes. The underlying idea was effective yet surprisingly simple: an optical nonlinear joint transform using a random phase mask in both the input and the reference could produce a correlation peak to indicate whether the input object is authentic or not. This seminal paper fueled the development of this new discipline. After three decades, optical encryption and security have matured into a field that plays a central role in the development of photonics techniques. While the pioneering work was mainly focused on the field of optical information processing, nowadays, a broad spectrum of disciplines are contributing to developing security solutions, including nanotechnology, materials science, quantum information, and deep learning, just to cite a few. The present roadmap paper gathers 28 leading authors in the field from 21 academic institutions across nine different countries. It is organized into 17 sections which discuss the present and future challenges, state-of-the-art technology, and real-world solutions to address the security challenges facing our society.

TI Ultracompact 3D Splitter for Single-Core to Multi-Core Optical Fiber
   Connections Fabricated Through Direct Laser Writing in Polymer
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The deployment and advancement of high-bandwidth communication networks, quantum information systems, and sensing platforms relying on multi-core optical fibers (MCFs) are challenged by the scarcity of cost-effective, compact, and efficient optical interfacing components. This study introduces an unprecedented 3D-printed 1 x 4 splitter for MCFs fabricated with 2-photon polymerization-based direct laser writing. The pivotal element is a triangular cross-section 3D multimode interference (MMI) coupler, supplemented with S-bends and adiabatic tapers to facilitate the splitting of a signal from a single core of a single-mode fiber into four cores of a multi-core fiber. All components are initially designed and assessed to minimize loss and polarization dependence across the C- and L-bands using optical simulation. Subsequently, a proof-of-concept model of the splitter, compactly integrated within the fiber volume, featuring a remarkably short length of 180 mu m and insertion loss of approximate to-3 dB, is fabricated. The manufacturing speed, minimal loss, component compactness, and flexibility of the approach, collectively present promising avenues for pioneering developments in MCF-coupling components.

TI Magnetic field mapping along a NV-rich nanodiamond-doped fiber
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Integration of NV--rich diamond with optical fibers enables guiding quantum information on the spin state of the NV- color center. Diamond-functionalized optical fiber sensors have been demonstrated with impressive sub-nanotesla magnetic field sensitivities over localized magnetic field sources, but their potential for distributed sensing remains unexplored. The volumetric incorporation of diamonds into the optical fiber core allows developing fibers sensitive to the magnetic field over their entire length. Theoretically, this makes distributed optical readout of small magnetic fields possible, but does not answer questions on the addressing of the spatial coordinate, i.e., the location of the field source, nor on the performance of a sensor where the NV- fluorescence is detected at one end, thereby integrating over color centers experiencing different field strength and microwave perturbation. Here, we demonstrate distributed magnetic field measurements using a step-index fiber with the optical core volumetrically functionalized with NV- diamonds. A microwave antenna on a translation stage is scanned along a 13 cm long section of a straight fiber. The NV- fluorescence is collected at the fiber's far end relative to the laser pump input end. Optically detected magnetic resonance spectra were recorded at the fiber output for every step of the antenna travel, revealing the magnetic field evolution along the fiber and indicating the magnetic field source location. The longitudinal distribution of the magnetic field along the fiber is detected with high accuracy. The simplicity of the demonstrated sensor would be useful for, e.g., magnetic-field mapping of photonics- and/or spintronics-based integrated circuits.

TI Improved Heralded Single-Photon Source with a Photon-Number-Resolving
   Superconducting Nanowire Detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Deterministic generation of single photons is essential for many quantum information technologies. A bulk optical nonlinearity emitting a photon pair, where the measurement of one of the photons heralds the presence of the other, is commonly used with the caveat that the single-photon emission rate is constrained due to a trade-off between multiphoton events and pair emission rate. Using an efficient and low noise photon-number-resolving superconducting nanowire detector we herald, in real time, a single photon at telecommunication wavelength. We perform a second-order photon correlation g2(0) measurement of the signal mode conditioned on the measured photon number of the idler mode for various pump powers and demonstrate an improvement of a heralded single-photon source. We develop an analytical model using a phase-space formalism that encompasses all multiphoton effects and relevant imperfections, such as loss and multiple Schmidt modes. We perform a maximum-likelihood fit to test the agreement of the model to the data and extract the best-fit mean photon number mu of the pair source for each pump power. A maximum reduction of 0.118 +/- 0.012 in the photon g2(0) correlation function at mu = 0.327 +/- 0.007 is obtained, indicating a strong suppression of multiphoton emissions. For a fixed g2(0) = 7 x 10-3, we increase the single pair generation probability by 25%. Our experiment, built using fiber-coupled and off-the-shelf components, delineates a path to engineering ideal sources of single photons.

TI Modeling and Representing Conceptual Change in the Learning of
   Successive Theories The Case of the Classical-Quantum Transition
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
AB Most educational literature on conceptual change concerns the process by which introductory students acquire scientific knowledge. However, with modern developments in science and technology, the social significance of learning successive theories is steadily increasing, thus opening new areas of interest to discipline-based education research, e.g., quantum logic, quantum information, and communication. Here, we present an initial proposal for modeling the transition from the understanding of a theory to the understanding of its successor and explore its generative potential by applying it to a concrete case-the classical-quantum transition in physics. In pursue of such task, we make coordinated use of contributions from research not only on conceptual change in education, but also on the history and philosophy of science, on the teaching and learning of quantum mechanics, and on mathematics education. By means of analytical instruments developed for characterizing conceptual trajectories at different representational levels, we review empirical literature in the search for the connections between theory change and cognitive demands. The analysis shows a rich landscape of changes and new challenges that are absent in the traditionally considered cases of conceptual change. In order to fully disclose the educational potential of the analysis, we visualize categorical changes by means of dynamic frames, identifying recognizable patterns that answer to students' need of comparability between the older and the new paradigm. Finally, we show how the frame representation can be used to suggest pattern-dependent strategies to promote the understanding of the new content, and may work as a guide to curricular design.

TI Terahertz dual-mechanism dual-band linear-to-circular polarization
   converter with one-octave band separation and orthogonal polarization
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multi-band polarization converters are crucial for reducing coupling between multipleinput multiple-output antenna components, promoting the integration of communication systems, and improving information transmission efficiency. However, current research faces challenges such as narrow operational bandwidth, low conversion efficiency, and lack of correlation between frequency bands for multi-band operation. A dual-wideband linear-to-circular (LC) polarization converter (PC) based on the dual mechanism of metal and dielectric is proposed in this paper. The unit cell of LC PC is optimized through three steps from a conventional metal-dielectricmetal structure. The optimization primarily involves creating cavities with special structures in the dielectric, which introduces the mechanism of dielectric resonance in addition to the original metal resonance. Simulation results demonstrate that this LC PC can convert incident linearly polarized waves into orthogonal circularly polarized waves in two nonadjacent frequency bands. The upper and lower cutoff frequencies of the second frequency band are exactly twice those of the first. The first operating frequency band ranges from 0.645 to 0.865 THz, with a relative bandwidth of 29%, producing a right-handed circularly polarized wave. The second operating frequency band is 1.29-1.73 THz, with a relative bandwidth of 29%, and the circularly polarized wave is left-handed. The device's capability to achieve LC polarization conversion with frequency-doubling relationship and orthogonal circular polarization makes it promising for applications in advanced high-speed communications, signal encryption, quantum information technology, and differential detection of chiral molecules.

TI Quantum indistinguishability by path identity and with undetected
   photons
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Two processes of photon-pair creation can be arranged such that the paths of the emitted photons are identical. The path information is thereby not erased but rather never born in the first place due to this path identity. In addition to its implications for fundamental physics, this concept has recently led to a series of impactful discoveries in the fields of imaging, spectroscopy, and quantum information science. Here the idea of path identity is presented and a comprehensive review of recent developments is provided. Specifically, the concept of path identity is introduced based on three defining experimental ideas from the early 1990s. The three experiments have in common that they contain two photon-pair sources. The paths of one or both photons from the different sources overlap such that no measurement can recognize from which source they originate. A wide range of noteworthy quantum interference effects (at the single-or two-photon level), such as induced coherence, destructive interference of photon pairs, and entanglement generation, are subsequently described. Progress in the exploration of these ideas has stagnated and has gained momentum again only in the last few years. The focus of the review is the new development in the last few years that modified and generalized the ideas from the early 1990s. These developments are overviewed and explained under the same conceptual umbrella, which will help the community develop new applications and realize the foundational implications of this sleeping beauty.

TI Integrated photonics on thin-film lithium niobate
SO ADVANCES IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
AB Lithium niobate (LN), an outstanding and versatile material, has influenced our daily life for decades-from enabling high-speed optical communications that form the backbone of the Internet to realizing radio-frequency filtering used in our cell phones. This half-century-old material is currently embracing a revolution in thin-film LN integrated photonics. The successes of manufacturing wafer-scale, high-quality thin films of LN-on-insulator (LNOI) and breakthroughs in nanofabrication techniques have made high-performance integrated nanophotonic components possible. With rapid development in the past few years, some of these thin-film LN devices, such as optical modulators and nonlinear wavelength converters, have already outperformed their legacy counterparts realized in bulk LN crystals. Furthermore, the nanophotonic integration has enabled ultra-low-loss resonators in LN, which has unlocked many novel applications such as optical frequency combs and quantum transducers. In this review, we cover-from basic principles to the state of the art-the diverse aspects of integrated thin-film LN photonics, including the materials, basic passive components, and various active devices based on electro-optics, all-optical nonlinearities, and acousto-optics. We also identify challenges that this platform is currently facing and point out future opportunities. The field of integrated LNOI photonics is advancing rapidly and poised to make critical impacts on a broad range of applications in communication, signal processing, and quantum information.

TI Extensive long-range entanglement at finite temperatures from a
   nonequilibrium bias
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may, however, be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures-the mutual information, its R & eacute;nyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity-that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R & eacute;nyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.

TI Optically controlled single- valley exciton doublet states with tunable
   internal spin structures and spin magnetization generation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Manipulating quantum states through light-matter interactions has been actively pursued in two-dimensional materials research. Significant progress has been made toward the optical control of the valley degrees of freedom in semiconducting monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, based on doubly degenerate excitons from their two distinct valleys in reciprocal space. Here, we introduce a type of optically controllable doubly degenerate exciton states that come from a single valley, dubbed as single-valley exciton doublet (SVXD) states. They are unique in that their constituent holes originate from the same valence band, making possible the direct optical control of the spin structure of the excited constituent electrons. Combining ab initio GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) calculations and a theoretical analysis method, we demonstrate such SVXD in substrate-supported monolayer bismuthene-which has been successfully grown using molecular beam epitaxy. In each of the two distinct valleys in the Brillouin zone, strong spin-orbit coupling and C-3v symmetry lead to a pair of degenerate 1s exciton states (the SVXD states) with opposite spin configurations. Any coherent linear combinations of the SVXD in a single valley can be excited by light with a specific polarization, enabling full manipulation of their internal spin configurations. In particular, a controllable net spin magnetization can be generated through light excitation. Our findings open routes to control quantum degrees of freedom, paving the way for applications in spintronics and quantum information science.

TI Spin-phonon coupling and magnetic relaxation in single-molecule magnets
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Electron-phonon coupling is important in many physical phenomena, e.g. photosynthesis, catalysis and quantum information processing, but its impacts are difficult to grasp on the microscopic level. One area attracting wide interest is that of single-molecule magnets, which is motivated by searching for the ultimate limit in the miniaturisation of binary data storage media. The utility of a molecule to store magnetic information is quantified by the timescale of its magnetic reversal processes, also known as magnetic relaxation, which is limited by spin-phonon coupling. Several recent accomplishments of synthetic organometallic chemistry have led to the observation of molecular magnetic memory effects at temperatures above that of liquid nitrogen. These discoveries have highlighted how far chemical design strategies for maximising magnetic anisotropy have come, but have also highlighted the need to characterise the complex interplay between phonons and molecular spin states. The crucial step is to make a link between magnetic relaxation and chemical motifs, and so be able to produce design criteria to extend molecular magnetic memory. The basic physics associated with spin-phonon coupling and magnetic relaxation was outlined in the early 20th century using perturbation theory, and has more recently been recast in the form of a general open quantum systems formalism and tackled with different levels of approximations. It is the purpose of this Tutorial Review to introduce the topics of phonons, molecular spin-phonon coupling, and magnetic relaxation, and to outline the relevant theories in connection with both the traditional perturbative texts and the more modern open quantum systems methods.

TI Absence of localization in interacting spin chains with a discrete
   symmetry
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Novel paradigms of strong ergodicity breaking have recently attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. Understanding the exact conditions required for their emergence or breakdown not only sheds more light on thermalization and its absence in closed quantum many-body systems, but it also has potential benefits for applications in quantum information technology. A case of particular interest is many-body localization whose conditions are not yet fully settled. Here, we prove that spin chains symmetric under a combination of mirror and spin-flip symmetries and with a non-degenerate spectrum show finite spin transport at zero total magnetization and infinite temperature. We demonstrate this numerically using two prominent examples: the Stark many-body localization system (Stark-MBL) and the symmetrized many-body localization system (symmetrized-MBL). We provide evidence of delocalization at all energy densities and show that delocalization persists when the symmetry is broken. We use our results to construct two localized systems which, when coupled, delocalize each other. Our work demonstrates the dramatic effect symmetries can have on disordered systems, proves that the existence of exact resonances is not a sufficient condition for delocalization, and opens the door to generalization to higher spatial dimensions and different conservation laws.
   Many-body localization is an important example of non-ergodic behaviour, however the conditions for its existence and stability are not fully established. Kloss et al establish theoretically and numerically the absence of many-body localization in a broad class of spin models respecting certain symmetries.

TI Computational perspective on recent advances in quantum electronics:
   from electron quantum optics to nanoelectronic devices and systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Quantum electronics has significantly evolved over the last decades. Where initially the clear focus was on light-matter interactions, nowadays approaches based on the electron's wave nature have solidified themselves as additional focus areas. This development is largely driven by continuous advances in electron quantum optics, electron based quantum information processing, electronic materials, and nanoelectronic devices and systems. The pace of research in all of these areas is astonishing and is accompanied by substantial theoretical and experimental advancements. What is particularly exciting is the fact that the computational methods, together with broadly available large-scale computing resources, have matured to such a degree so as to be essential enabling technologies themselves. These methods allow to predict, analyze, and design not only individual physical processes but also entire devices and systems, which would otherwise be very challenging or sometimes even out of reach with conventional experimental capabilities. This review is thus a testament to the increasingly towering importance of computational methods for advancing the expanding field of quantum electronics. To that end, computational aspects of a representative selection of recent research in quantum electronics are highlighted where a major focus is on the electron's wave nature. By categorizing the research into concrete technological applications, researchers and engineers will be able to use this review as a source for inspiration regarding problem-specific computational methods.

TI Theoretical Description of Changes in Conformation and Symmetry of
   Supramolecular Systems During the Reception of a Molecular Signal
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Aqueous solutions are not homogeneous and could be considered supramolecular systems. They can emit electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic emission from one supramolecular system ("source") can be received by another supramolecular system ("receiver") without direct contact (distantly). This process represents a transfer of a "molecular signal" and causes changes in conformation and symmetry of the "receiver". The aim of the current work is to theoretically describe such changes primarily using a solution of the chiral protein interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) as an example. We provide theoretical evidence that supramolecular systems of highly diluted (HD) aqueous solutions formed by self-assembly after mechanical activation generate a stronger molecular signal compared to non-activated solutions, due to their higher energy-saturated state. Additionally, molecular signals cause supramolecular systems with complex (including chiral) structures to undergo easier changes in conformation and symmetry compared to simpler systems, enhancing their biological activity. Using statistical physics, we obtained the parameter Ic, characterizing the magnitude of conformational and symmetry changes in supramolecular (including chiral) systems caused by molecular signals. In quantum information science, there is an analogue of the parameter Ic, which characterizes the entanglement depth of quantum systems. This study contributes to the understanding of the physico-chemical basis of distant molecular interactions and opens up new possibilities for controlling the properties of complex biological and chemical systems.

TI Efficient Second-Harmonic Generation in Adapted-Width Waveguides Based
   on Periodically Poled Thin-Film Lithium Niobate
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Frequency conversion process based on periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (PPTFLN) has been widely recognized as an important component for quantum information and photonic signal processing. Benefiting from the tight confinement of optical modes, the normalized conversion efficiency (NCE) of nanophotonic waveguides is improved by orders of magnitude compared to their bulk counterparts. However, the power conversion efficiency of these devices is limited by inherent nanoscale inhomogeneity of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), leading to undesirable phase errors. In this paper, we theoretically present a novel approach to solve this problem. Based on dispersion engineering, we aim at adjusting the waveguide structure, making local waveguide width adjustment at positions of different thicknesses, thus eliminating the phase errors. The adapted waveguide width design is applied for etched and loaded waveguides based on PPTFLN, achieving the ultrahigh power conversion efficiency of second harmonic generation (SHG) up to 2.1 x 104%W-1 and 6936%W-1, respectively, which surpasses the power conversion efficiency of other related works. Our approach just needs standard periodic poling with a single period, significantly reducing the complexity of electrode fabrication and the difficulty of poling, and allows for the placing of multiple waveguides, without individual poling designs for each waveguide. With the advantages of simplicity, high production, and meeting current micro-nano fabrication technology, our work may open a new way for achieving highly efficient second-order nonlinear optical processes based on PPTFLN.

TI Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Superposition of Profile-Tunable Tightly
   Focused Vector Beams and Generation of the Structured Light
SO PHOTONICS
AB Vector beams (VBs) and their superposition have found important applications in versatile fields such as optical communications, super-resolution microscopy and quantum information, and metasurfaces have enabled the miniaturization and integration of the optical systems manipulating the vector beams, providing potential applications to subwavelength regimes. In this work, we propose a metasurface to realize the superposition of profile-tunable tightly focused VBs, with the novel structured light fields generated. The metasurface is composed of two sets of orthogonal-nanoslit pairs arranged on the inner and outer rings. By realizing the chiral conversion of circularly polarized light with the slit-pairs which act as half-wave plates, and by creating helical phase profiles of optical vortices with the geometrical phase of rotational nano-slit pairs, two focused Bessel VBs are formed. By finely varying the diameters of two sets of rings, the doughnuts of the two Bessel VBs of different orders are tuned to be of the same size, and the superposition of the two VBs is realized. The theoretical analyses of the superimposed fields were presented, the FDTD simulations were performed to optimize the designed metasurfaces, and the experimental measurements were carried out to validate feasibility of the metasurface. The novel and interesting characteristics of the superposed fields different from those of the conventional VBs were demonstrated. This work will be of significance for classical and quantum applications of VBs in various fields.

TI Comparing bound entanglement of bell diagonal pairs of qutrits and
   ququarts
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We compare the classification as entangled or separable of Bell diagonal bipartite qudits with positive partial transposition (PPT) and their properties for different dimensions. For dimension d = 3, a form of entanglement exists that is hard to detect and called bound entanglement due to the fact that such entangled states cannot be used for entanglement distillation. Up to this date, no efficient solution is known to differentiate bound entangled from separable states. We address and compare this problem named separability problem for a family of bipartite Bell diagonal qudits with special algebraic and geometric structures and applications in quantum information processing tasks in different dimensions. Extending analytical and numerical methods and results for Bell diagonal qutrits ( d = 3 ), we successfully classify more than 75% of representative Bell diagonal PPT states for d = 4. Via those representative states we are able to estimate the volumes of separable and bound entangled states among PPT ququarts ( d = 4 ). We find that at least 75.7% of all PPT states are separable, 1.7% bound entangled and for 22.6% it remains unclear whether they are separable or bound entangled. Comparing the structure of bound entangled states and their detectors, we find considerable differences in the detection capabilities for different dimensions and relate those to differences of the Euclidean geometry for qutrits ( d = 3 ) and ququarts ( d = 4 ). Finally, using a detailed visual analysis of the set of separable and bound entangled Bell diagonal states in both dimensions, qualitative observations are made that allow to better distinguish bound entangled from separable states.

TI Dispersion-less Kerr solitons in spectrally confined optical cavities
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Solitons are self-reinforcing localized wave packets that manifest in the major areas of nonlinear science, from optics to biology and Bose-Einstein condensates. Recently, optically driven dissipative solitons have attracted great attention for the implementation of the chip-scale frequency combs that are decisive for communications, spectroscopy, neural computing, and quantum information processing. In the current understanding, the generation of temporal solitons involves the chromatic dispersion as a key enabling physical effect, acting either globally or locally on the cavity dynamics in a decisive way. Here, we report on a novel class of solitons, both theoretically and experimentally, which builds up in spectrally confined optical cavities when dispersion is practically absent, both globally and locally. Precisely, the interplay between the Kerr nonlinearity and spectral filtering results in an infinite hierarchy of eigenfunctions which, combined with optical gain, allow for the generation of stable dispersion-less dissipative solitons in a previously unexplored regime. When the filter order tends to infinity, we find an unexpected link between dissipative and conservative solitons, in the form of Nyquist-pulse-like solitons endowed with an ultra-flat spectrum. In contrast to the conventional dispersion-enabled nonlinear Schrodinger solitons, these dispersion-less Nyquist solitons build on a fully confined spectrum and their energy scaling is not constrained by the pulse duration. Dispersion-less soliton molecules and their deterministic transitioning to single solitons are also evidenced. These findings broaden the fundamental scope of the dissipative soliton paradigm and open new avenues for generating soliton pulses and frequency combs endowed with unprecedented temporal and spectral features.

TI Machine-learning-assisted photonic device development: a multiscale
   approach from theory to characterization
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging, sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step process that consists of: (i) deriving device behavior from design parameters, (ii) simulating device performance, (iii) finding the optimal candidate designs from simulations, (iv) fabricating the optimal device, and (v) measuring device performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization, material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods. However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the development of complex photonic devices and systems.

TI In situ electric-field control of ferromagnetic resonance in the
   low-loss organic-based ferrimagnet V[TCNE]x∼2
SO APL MATERIALS
AB We demonstrate indirect electric-field control of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in devices that integrate the low-loss, molecule-based, room-temperature ferrimagnet vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE](x similar to 2)) mechanically coupled to PMN-PT piezoelectric transducers. Upon straining the V[TCNE](x) films, the FMR frequency is tuned by more than 6 times the resonant linewidth with no change in Gilbert damping for samples with alpha = 6.5 x 10(-5). We show this tuning effect is due to a strain-dependent magnetic anisotropy in the films and find the magnetoelastic coefficient |lambda(s)| similar to (1-4.4) ppm, backed by theoretical predictions from density-functional theory calculations and magnetoelastic theory. Noting the rapidly expanding application space for strain-tuned FMR, we define a new metric for magnetostrictive materials, magnetostrictive agility, given by the ratio of the magnetoelastic coefficient to the FMR linewidth. This agility allows for a direct comparison between magnetostrictive materials in terms of their comparative efficacy for magnetoelectric applications requiring ultra-low loss magnetic resonance modulated by strain. With this metric, we show V[TCNE](x) is competitive with other magnetostrictive materials, including YIG and Terfenol-D. This combination of ultra-narrow linewidth and magnetostriction, in a system that can be directly integrated into functional devices without requiring heterogeneous integration in a thin film geometry, promises unprecedented functionality for electric-field tuned microwave devices ranging from low-power, compact filters and circulators to emerging applications in quantum information science and technology.

TI Diabetes Prediction Using an Optimized Variational Quantum Classifier
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Quantum information processing introduces novel approaches for classical data encoding to encompass the complex patterns of input data of practical computational challenges using basic principles of quantum mechanics. The classification of diabetes is an example of a problem that can be efficiently resolved by using quantum unitary operations and the variational quantum classifier (VQC). This study demonstrates the effects of the number of qubits, types of feature maps, optimizers' class, and the number of layers in the parametrized circuit, and the number of learnable parameters in ansatz influences the effectiveness of the VQC. In total, 76 variants of VQC are analyzed for four and eight qubits' cases and their results are compared with six classical machine learning models to predict diabetes. Three different types of feature maps (Pauli, Z, and ZZ) are implemented during analysis in addition to three different optimizers (COBYLA, SPSA and SLSQP). Experiments are performed using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). The results conclude that VQC with six layers embedded with an error correction scaling factor of 0.01 and having ZZ feature map and COBYLA optimizer outperforms other quantum variants. The optimal proposed model attained the accuracy of 0.85 and 0.80 for eight and four qubits' cases, respectively. In addition, the final quantum model among 76 variants was compared with six classical machine learning models. The results suggest that the proposed VQC model has outperformed four classical models including SVM, random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and linear regression (LR).

TI Ab Initio Design of Molecular Qubits with Electric Field Control
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Current scalable quantum computers require large footprints and complex interconnections due to the design of superconducting qubits. While this architecture is competitive, molecular qubits offer a promising alternative due to their atomic scale and tuneable properties through chemical design. The use of electric fields to precisely, selectively and coherently manipulate molecular spins with resonant pulses has the potential to solve the experimental limitations of current molecular spin manipulation techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR can only address a macroscopic ensemble of molecules, defeating the inherent benefits of molecule-based quantum information. Hence, numerous experiments have been performed using EPR in combination with electric fields to demonstrate coherent spin manipulation. In this work, we explore the underlying theory of spin-electric coupling in lanthanide molecules, and outline ab initio methods to design molecules with enhanced electric field responses. We show how structural distortions arising from electric fields generate coupling elements in the crystal field Hamiltonian within a Kramers doublet ground state and demonstrate the impact of molecular geometry on this phenomenon. We use perturbation theory to rationalize the magnetic and electric field orientation dependence of the spin-electric coupling. We use pseudo-symmetry point groups to decompose molecular distortions to understand the role that symmetry has on spin-electric coupling. Finally, we present an analytical electric field model of structural perturbations that provides large savings in computational expense and allows for the investigation of experimentally accessible electric field magnitudes which cannot be accessed using common ab initio methods.

TI Multielectron transfer and field-induced slow magnetic relaxation in
   opto-electroactive spin crossover cobalt(ii) complexes:
   structure-function correlations
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Designing and implementing multielectron transfer and single-molecule magnet properties in spin crossover compounds constitute a promising way to obtain a new class of multiresponsive and multifunctional materials. This contribution uses N-phenyl-substituted pyridine-2,6-diimine (PDI) ligands to explore a novel family of spin-crossover cobalt(ii) complexes, with general formula [CoL2](ClO4)(2)<middle dot>xH(2)O [L = 4-MePhPDI (1, x = 1), 4-MeOPhPDI (2, x = 0), 4-MeSPhPDI (3, x = 0), 4-Me2NPhPDI (4, x = 0.5), and 2,4-Me2PhPDI (5, x = 0)]. These mononuclear six-coordinate octahedral cobalt(ii) bis(chelating) complexes incorporate tridentate PDI derivatives with various electron-donating substituents at para (X-4 = Me, OMe, SMe, and Me2N) or ortho and para positions (X-2, X-4 = Me) of terminal phenyl rings. Our investigations reveal that these complexes exhibit both thermally-induced low-spin (LS)/high-spin (HS) transition and field-induced slow magnetic relaxation in the LS (S = 1/2) and HS (S = 3/2) states. Moreover, they display a dual multiredox behaviour featuring one-electron oxidation of the paramagnetic Co-II ion to the diamagnetic Co-III ion and stepwise two-electron reduction of each PDI ligand to the corresponding imine-type PDI center dot- pi-radical anion and diimine-type PDI2- dianion, which positions them as candidates for prototypes of spin quantum transistors and capacitors, offering potential applications in quantum information processing.

SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Local constraint in the lattice gauge theory provides an exotic mechanism that facilitates the disorder-free localization. However, the understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics in the non-Hermitian lattice gauge model remains limited. Here, we investigate the quench dynamics in a system of spinless fermions with nonreciprocal hopping in the Z2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$\end{document} gauge field. By employing a duality mapping, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect, localization-delocalization transition, and real-complex transition. Through the identification of diverse scaling behaviors of quantum mutual information for fermions and spins, we propose that the non-Hermitian quantum disentangled liquids exist both in the localized and delocalized phases, the former originates from the Z2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$\end{document} gauge field and the latter arises from the non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nonreciprocal dissipation causes the flow of quantum information. Our results provide valuable insights into the nonequilibrium dynamics in the gauge field, and may be experimentally validated using quantum simulators.
   Lattice gauge theory, a subset of gauge theory, has been successfully applied to a range of quantum systems allowing for the investigation of localised phenomena within these systems. Here, the authors consider a non-Hermitian lattice model observing a quantum disentangled liquid state that exists in both the localised and delocalised phases.

TI Simple interferometric setup enabling sub-Fourier-scale ultra-short
   laser pulses
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB In this work, we describe an interferometric method to generate ultra-short pulses below the Fourier limit. It is done by extending concepts first developed in the spatial domain to achieve sub-diffractive beams through the addition of a spatial chirp in one of the arms of a Michelson interferometer using a spherical mirror. To experimentally synthesize sub-Fourier pulses, we replace the spherical mirror with a water cell, since it produces chirp in the temporal domain. We also present an alternative procedure, based on asymmetrical interference between the widened pulse and the original pulse where the peaks of both pulses exhibit a temporal delay achieving the narrowing of ultra-short pulses with sub-Fourier scales. To characterize the performance of the system, we performed a preliminary assessment considering the percentage of full width at half-maximum shrinking obtained for each scheme. By means of a symmetrical configuration, 7% and 12% pulse reductions were verified, both experimentally and analytically, while for the non-symmetrical configuration, 10% and 24% reductions were achieved corresponding to main lobe to side-lobe ratios of 10% and 30%. The experimental setup scheme is simple, versatile and able to work with high-power laser sources and ultra-short pulses with a broad bandwidth at any central wavelength. The results presented in this work are promising and help to enlighten new routes and strategies in the design of coherent control systems. We envision that they will become broadly useful in different areas from strong field domain to quantum information.

TI Gapless Spin Wave Transport through a Quantum Canted Antiferromagnet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB In the Landau levels of a two-dimensional electron system or when flat bands are present, e.g., in twisted van derWaals bilayers, strong electron-electron interaction gives rise to quantum Hall ferromagnetism with spontaneously broken symmetries in the spin and isospin sectors. Quantum Hall ferromagnets support a rich variety of low-energy collective excitations that are instrumental to understand the nature of the magnetic ground states and are also potentially useful as carriers of quantum information. Probing such collective excitations, especially their dispersion omega(k), is experimentally challenging due to small sample size and measurement constraints. In this work, we demonstrate an all-electrical approach that integrates a Fabry-Perot cavity with nonequilibrium transport to achieve the excitation, wave vector selection, and detection of spin waves in graphene heterostructures. Our experiments reveal gapless, linearly dispersed spin wave excitations in the E = 0 Landau level of bilayer graphene, thus providing direct experimental evidence for a predicted canted antiferromagnetic order. We show that the gapless spin wave mode propagates with a high group velocity of several tens of kilometers per second and maintains phase coherence over a distance of many micrometers. Its dependence on the magnetic field and temperature agree well with the hydrodynamic theory of spin waves. These results lay the foundation for the quest of spin superfluidity in this high-quality material. The resonant cavity technique we develop offers a powerful and timely method to explore the collective excitation of many spin- and isospin-ordered many-body ground states in van derWaals heterostructures and opens the possibility of engineering magnonic devices.

TI Convex roofs witnessing Kirkwood-Dirac nonpositivity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Given two orthonormal bases (|ai >)i and (|bj >)j, one can associate to every quantum state a Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution. KD distributions are like joint classical probabilities except that they can have negative or nonreal values, which are associated to nonclassical features of the state. In the last decade, KD distributions have proven to be versatile tools to investigate and construct quantum advantages and nonclassical phenomena. KD distributions are also used to determine quantum-classical boundaries, for example in the theory of (non)contextuality. Optimal use of the KD distributions relies on useful witnesses of KD nonpositivity. Previous works have established such a witness based on the observation that KD-nonpositive pure states have large support uncertainty with respect to the bases (|ai >)i and (|bj >)j. Here, we extend this witness to mixed states. We introduce two convex roof constructions: the convex roof of the support uncertainty and the convex roof of the KD nonpositivity. These constructions both witness the set of quantum states that cannot be written as a convex combination of KD-positive pure states. Moreover, the first one extends to mixed states the relation between two phenomena: large support uncertainty and the fact that the state belongs to the convex hull of the KD-positive pure states. The convex roof of the KD nonpositivity together with the KD nonpositivity itself give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be KD positive but not to belong to the convex hull of the KD-positive pure states.

TI Effect of Quantum Coherence on Landauer's Principle
SO ENTROPY
AB Landauer's principle provides a fundamental lower bound for energy dissipation occurring with information erasure in the quantum regime. While most studies have related the entropy reduction incorporated with the erasure to the lower bound (entropic bound), recent efforts have also provided another lower bound associated with the thermal fluctuation of the dissipated energy (thermodynamic bound). The coexistence of the two bounds has stimulated comparative studies of their properties; however, these studies were performed for systems where the time-evolution of diagonal (population) and off-diagonal (coherence) elements of the density matrix are decoupled. In this paper, we aimed to broaden the comparative study to include the influence of quantum coherence induced by the tilted system-reservoir interaction direction. By examining their dependence on the initial state of the information-bearing system, we find that the following properties of the bounds are generically held regardless of whether the influence of the coherence is present or not: the entropic bound serves as the tighter bound for a sufficiently mixed initial state, while the thermodynamic bound is tighter when the purity of the initial state is sufficiently high. The exception is the case where the system dynamics involve only phase relaxation; in this case, the two bounds coincide when the initial coherence is zero; otherwise, the thermodynamic bound serves the tighter bound. We also find the quantum information erasure inevitably accompanies constant energy dissipation caused by the creation of system-reservoir correlation, which may cause an additional source of energetic cost for the erasure.

TI Lightwave electronics in condensed matter
SO NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS
AB Key properties of quantum materials stem from dynamic interaction chains that connect stable electronic quasiparticles through short-lived coherences, which are difficult to control at their natural time and length scales. Lightwave electronics sculpts the quantum flow of electrons and coherences faster than an oscillation cycle of light by using intense optical-carrier waves as fast biasing fields, which can access multi-electron interaction chains. In this Review, we summarize the key functionalities and the latest advances in lightwave electronics for both fundamental and technological explorations. For example, lightwave-driven ballistic electron transport through dynamically changing band structures has already led to the demonstration of phenomena such as high-harmonic emission and dynamic Bloch oscillations. Lightwave electronic control could also seamlessly convert quantum states between light and matter to create quantum chips that simultaneously exploit electronics for efficient interactions and optics for speed or long coherence lifetimes. Additionally, we present an outlook towards applications of lightwave electronics including quasiparticle colliders to explore quantum phenomena; all-optical band-structure reconstruction in ambient conditions; attoclocks to measure the interaction dynamics of diverse quantum phenomena; ultrafast electron videography to watch electronic reactions unfold; efficient light sources to create compact integration; and petahertz electronics to speed up traditional semiconductor electronics.
   Lightwave electronics could enable the control of interactions in quantum materials and provide access to the quantum phases and quantum information of condensed-matter systems. This Review discusses the fundamental concepts of lightwave electronics and outlines key advances and potential applications.

TI Record-Breaking Frequency of 44 GHz Based on the Higher Order Mode of
   Surface Acoustic Waves with LiNbO3/SiO2/SiC Heterostructures
SO ENGINEERING
AB Surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology has been extensively explored for wireless communication, sensors, microfluidics, photonics, and quantum information processing. However, due to fabrication issues, the frequencies of SAW devices are typically limited to within a few gigahertz, which severely restricts their applications in 5G communication, precision sensing, photonics, and quantum control. To solve this critical problem, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates a nanomanufacturing process (i.e., nanolithography) with a LiNbO3/SiO2/SiC heterostructure and successfully achieve a record-breaking frequency of about 44 GHz for SAW devices, in addition to large electromechanical coupling coefficients of up to 15.7%. We perform a theoretical analysis and identify the guided higher order wave modes generated on these slow-on-fast SAW platforms. To demonstrate the superior sensing performance of the proposed ultra-high-frequency SAW platforms, we perform micro-mass sensing and obtain an extremely high sensitivity of approximately 33151.9 MHz center dot mm2.lg 1, which is about 1011 times higher than that of a conventional quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and about 4000 times higher than that of a conventional SAW device with a frequency of 978 MHz.

TI Time-evolution of local information: Thermalization dynamics of local
   observables
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum many-body dynamics generically result in increasing entanglement that eventually leads to thermalization of local observables. This makes the exact description of the dynamics complex despite the apparent simplicity of (high-temperature) thermal states. For accurate but approximate simulations one needs a way to keep track of essential (quantum) information while discarding inessential one. To this end, we first introduce the concept of the information lattice, which supplements the physical spatial lattice with an additional dimension and where a local Hamiltonian gives rise to well-defined locally conserved von Neumann information current. This provides a convenient and insightful way of capturing the flow, through time and space, of information during quantum time-evolution, and gives a distinct signature of when local degrees of freedom decouple from long-range entanglement. As an example, we describe such de-coupling of local degrees of freedom for the mixed-field transverse Ising model. Building on this, we secondly construct algorithms to time-evolve sets of local density matrices without any reference to a global state. With the notion of information currents, we motivate algorithms based on the intuition that information for statistical reasons flows from small to large scales. Using this guiding principle, we construct an algorithm that, at worst, shows two-digit convergence in time-evolutions up to very late times for diffusion process governed by the mixed-field transverse Ising Hamiltonian. While we focus on dynamics in 1D with nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians, the algorithms do not essentially rely on these assumptions and can in principle be generalized to higher dimensions and more complicated Hamiltonians.

TI Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of entangled photons generated under
   pump-tight-focusing condition
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a non-classical effect of photons and plays an important role in quantum optics. The beta-barium borate (BBO) has a high nonlinear efficiency, and is commonly used to generate biphoton states, thereby exhibiting HOM interference. However, in previous experiments, researchers often used band-pass filters, so the resulting spectrum was directly determined by the band-pass filter. As a result, the original spectrum of the BBO crystal, especially the spectrum under tight focusing, was lack of systematic research. In this paper, the biphoton spectral distribution and HOM interference generated by the BBO crystal under the condition of tight focusing are systematically studied for the first time. Theoretical calculations show that using a lens with 50-mm focusing length, the spectral width of the down-converted photons is increased by 7.9 times that of the non-focused case; the width of the HOM interference fringe is reduced to 1/8, and the visibility of the interference fringe increases from 53.0% to 98.7%. We experimentally prepare the energy-time entanglement state by using type-II BBO crystal and perform HOM interference, thereby obtaining the interference visibility of (86.6 +/- 1.0) %. The increasing of the HOM visibility is due to the improvement of biphoton's spectral symmetry. In addition, the proposed technique by which different spectral distributions are obtained at different incident angles is expected to be applied to the preparation of high-dimensional qudits in the future.

TI Spatiotemporal manipulation of high-order plasmonic vortex fields in a
   modified Archimedean spiral structure by a chirped femtosecond light
   pulse
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Plasmonic vortex (PV) field has garnered widespread attention due to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) it carries, which provides topological charge as another channel for information transmission, transportation, and encoding. Dynamical modulation of higher-order PV field will enable flexible responses to various application scenarios and optimize the light-matter interaction. Here, we propose to utilize the time-dependent frequency component in the chirped femtosecond laser pulse as a new degree of freedom for spatiotemporal modulation of the OAM of the PV field in a modified Archimedean spiral structure comprised of two wavelength-dependent PV lenses without the necessity to alter the polarization of the incident light. By employing a chirped femtosecond light pulse, ultrafast switching of the topological charge in PV field from 3 to-5 and from 5 to-3 of the excited PV field within the femtosecond timescale has been achieved. The switching time of the OAM of the PV field can be actively controlled by varying the pulse duration and chirp coefficient of the incident laser pulse. The results indicate that the switching time between the different topological charges in the PV field is directly proportional to the pulse duration and inversely proportional to the chirp coefficient of the chirped pulse light. Ultrafast modulation of the PV field has the potential application in various fields, including optical communication, quantum information, and topological optics, laying a foundation for the development of PV devices.

TI Topological Edge States on Different Domain Walls of Two Opposed Helical
   Waveguide Arrays
SO PHOTONICS
AB Floquet topological insulators (FTIs) have richer topological properties than static systems. In this work, we designed different domain wall (DW) structures consisting of a Floquet photonic lattice with opposite helical directions. We investigated the existence and types of edge states in three shared coupling structures and the impact of these shared coupling structures on edge states. When two opposite helical lattices share a straight waveguide array coupling, the edge states are localized on the straight waveguide. When two opposite helical lattices share a clockwise (or anticlockwise) helical waveguide array coupling, the DWs consist of zigzag and bearded edges, but the positions of the zigzag and bearded edges of the shared clockwise waveguide array are different from those of the shared anticlockwise waveguide array. The slope and transmission rate of the edge states both vary with the degree of coupling between the shared waveguides. The characteristics of these edge states, such as transmission speed and band gap width, are also affected by the incidence angle, modulation phase factor, and helical radii, and the methods for controlling the edge states in different shared coupling structures are provided. This will help deepen our understanding of how topological structures influence the electronic and photonic properties of materials. This could also lead to combining topology with metasurface-based structured light, which would highlight many novel properties with great application potential for various fields, such as imaging, metrology, communication, quantum information processing, and light-matter interaction.

TI A Differential-Geometric Approach to Quantum Ignorance Consistent with
   Entropic Properties of Statistical Mechanics
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we construct the metric tensor and volume for the manifold of purifications associated with an arbitrary reduced density operator ?S. We also define a quantum coarse-graining (CG) to study the volume where macrostates are the manifolds of purifications, which we call surfaces of ignorance (SOI), and microstates are the purifications of ?S. In this context, the volume functions as a multiplicity of the macrostates that quantifies the amount of information missing from ?S. Using examples where the SOI are generated using representations of SU(2), SO(3), and SO(N), we show two features of the CG: (1) A system beginning in an atypical macrostate of smaller volume evolves to macrostates of greater volume until it reaches the equilibrium macrostate in a process in which the system and environment become strictly more entangled, and (2) the equilibrium macrostate takes up the vast majority of the coarse-grained space especially as the dimension of the total system becomes large. Here, the equilibrium macrostate corresponds to a maximum entanglement between the system and the environment. To demonstrate feature (1) for the examples considered, we show that the volume behaves like the von Neumann entropy in that it is zero for pure states, maximal for maximally mixed states, and is a concave function with respect to the purity of ?S. These two features are essential to typicality arguments regarding thermalization and Boltzmann's original CG.

TI Broadband 2D n x n Vortex Arrays Generated from an
   Efficient Petal-Like Raman Laser with an Astigmatic Mode Convertor
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Broadband vortex arrays distributed in 2D n x n vortices are extremely needed for multiple microparticle manipulation, high-capacity optical communication, and quantum information. Vortex arrays are usually generated with spatial light modulators, metamaterials; it is a big challenge to improve beam quality and output power. Herein, crisscross 2D n x n vortex arrays are converted from petal-like Raman lasers with an astigmatic mode convertor. Efficient petal-like lasers in the form of the Laguerre-Gaussian mode with zero radial index and l azimuthal index (LG(0,l)) are irradiated in a Raman microchip laser (RML) by adjusting optimal beam waist and locating the position of focus spot of the annular pump beam. High-beam-quality LG(0,9) petal-like Raman laser oscillating at broadband wavelength (bandwidth: 16.2 nm) is generated with power of 773 mW and an efficiency of 10.6%. The conversion efficiency from petal-like laser to crisscross vortex array is as high as 90%. The vortex array with 5 x 5 vortices operating around 1078 nm is generated with a power of 693 mW and an optical efficiency of 9.5%. Taking advantages of the broad emission spectrum of ytterbium-doped laser materials and stimulated Raman scattering effect, RMLs are potential sources for generating flexible vortex arrays with desired 2D n x n vortices oscillating in Raman wavelengths.

TI Tuning and switching effects of quasi-BIC states combining phase change
   materials with all-dielectric metasurfaces
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Emission enhancement of quantum emitters is particularly relevant in the development of single-photon sources, which are key elements in quantum information and quantum communications. All-dielectric metasurfaces offer a route towards strong enhancement of local density of optical states via engineering of high quality factor optical modes. In particular, the recently proposed concept of quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC) allows for precise control of such resonances in lattices with an asymmetric unit cell. Still, the spectral band of emission enhancement is usually fixed by the geometric parameters of the metasurface. Here, we propose to utilize phase change materials to tune the properties of light-emitting metasurfaces designed to support quasi-BIC states in the telecom wavelength range. In our design, a thin layer of a phase change material, which provides strong contrast of refractive index when switched from the amorphous to the crystalline state, is located on top of the resonators made of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Depending on the selected phase change material, we numerically demonstrate different functionalities of the metasurface, In particular, for low-loss Sb2Se3 we evidence spectral tuning effects, whereas for Ge2Sb2Te5, we report an "on"/"off" switching effect of the quasi-BIC resonance. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the crystallization fraction and the asymmetry parameter of the metasurface on the results. This work provides concrete design blueprints for switchable metasurfaces, offering new opportunities for nanophotonics devices or integrated photonic circuits.

TI Group theoretic approach to many-body scar states in fermionic lattice
   models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB It has been shown [K. Pakrouski et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 230602 (2020)] that three families of highly symmetric states are many-body scars for any spin-1/2 fermionic Hamiltonian of the form H-0 + OT, where T is a generator of an appropriate Lie group. One of these families consists of the well-known eta-pairing states. In addition to having the usual properties of scars, these families of states are insensitive to electromagnetic noise and have advantages for storing and processing quantum information. In this paper we show that a number of well-known coupling terms, such as the Hubbard and the Heisenberg interactions, and the Hamiltonians containing them, are of the required form and support these states as scars without fine tuning. The explicit H-0 + OT decomposition for a number of most commonly used models, including topological ones, is provided. To facilitate possible experimental implementations, we discuss the conditions for the low-energy subspace of these models to be comprised solely of scars. Further, we write all the generators T that can be used as building blocks for designing new models with scars, most interestingly including the spin-orbit coupled hopping and superconducting pairing terms. We expand this framework to the non-Hermitian open systems and demonstrate that for them the scar subspace continues to undergo coherent time evolution and exhibit the "revivals." A full numerical study of an extended two-dimensional tJU model explicitly illustrates the novel properties of the invariant scars and supports our findings.

TI Uncovering recent progress in nanostructured light-emitters for
   information and communication technologies
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Semiconductor nanostructures with low dimensionality like quantum dots and quantum dashes are one of the best attractive and heuristic solutions for achieving high performance photonic devices. When one or more spatial dimensions of the nanocrystal approach the de Broglie wavelength, nanoscale size effects create a spatial quantization of carriers leading to a complete discretization of energy levels along with additional quantum phenomena like entangled-photon generation or squeezed states of light among others. This article reviews our recent findings and prospects on nanostructure based light emitters where active region is made with quantum-dot and quantum-dash nanostructures. Many applications ranging from silicon-based integrated technologies to quantum information systems rely on the utilization of such laser sources. Here, we link the material and fundamental properties with the device physics. For this purpose, spectral linewidth, polarization anisotropy, optical nonlinearities as well as microwave, dynamic and nonlinear properties are closely examined. The paper focuses on photonic devices grown on native substrates (InP and GaAs) as well as those heterogeneously and epitaxially grown on silicon substrate. This research pipelines the most exciting recent innovation developed around light emitters using nanostructures as gain media and highlights the importance of nanotechnologies on industry and society especially for shaping the future information and communication society. Quantum dot are one of the best practical examples of nanotechnologies. Owing to the discrete energy levels, quantum dot lasers output unique features like thermal stability, feedback insensitivity and spectral purity.

TI Continuous tunability of refractive index contrast in LiNbO3
   optical waveguides fabricated by high-vacuum vapor-phase proton exchange
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The actual techniques allowing the fabrication of waveguides in lithium niobate are not able to satisfy one of the demands of modern integrated photonics namely the well-controlled tunability of index contrast over a large range of values (from high-index contrast to low index contrast). This paper presents a simple and reliable method allowing well-controlled index contrast tunability between high-index contrast (Delta ne = 0.1) and low-index contrast (Delta ne = 0.035) while benefiting from the optical nonlinearity of LiNbO3 waveguides fabricated using HiVac-VPE technique. The study involves both planar and channel lithium niobate waveguides. The planar waveguides subjected to an annealing process for 1 to 5.5 h, are characterized before and after the thermal treatment, in order to determine the index contrast evolution and to analyze the changes of index profile shapes. Furthermore, it is found that the index profile after annealing is fitted by an exponential function different from Gaussian fit found in well-known Annealed Proton Exchange technique. Additionally, the index contrast dependence of the annealing time is also fitted by an exponential function. Channel waveguides, fabricated in the same condition, were designed for single-mode propagation at telecom wavelength. After characterization, the best of investigated annealed channel waveguides exhibits propagation losses around 1.5 +/- 0.1 dB/cm. Therefore, the presented technique offers the opportunity for customization of photonics circuitry, scalability of integrated photonics platform, enhancement of non-linear optical efficiency at the single photon level for quantum information platforms.

TI Controlling the interactions in a cold atom quantum impurity system
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We implement an experimental architecture in which a single atom of K is trapped in an optical tweezer, and is immersed in a bath of Rb atoms at ultralow temperatures. In this regime, the motion of the single trapped atom is confined to the lowest quantum vibrational levels. This realizes an elementary and fully controllable quantum impurity system. For the trapping of the K atom, we use a species-selective dipole potential, that allows us to independently manipulate the quantum impurity and the bath. We concentrate on the characterization and control of the interactions between the two subsystems. To this end, we perform Feshbach spectroscopy, detecting several inter-dimensional confinement-induced Feshbach resonances for the KRb interspecies scattering length, that parametrizes the strength of the interactions. We compare our data to a theory for inter-dimensional scattering, finding good agreement. Notably, we also detect a series of p-wave resonances stemming from the underlying free-space s-wave interactions. We further determine how the resonances behave as the temperature of the bath and the dimensionality of the interactions change. Additionally, we are able to screen the quantum impurity from the bath by finely tuning the wavelength of the light that produces the optical tweezer, providing us with a new effective tool to control and minimize the interactions. Our results open a range of new possibilities in quantum simulations of quantum impurity models, quantum information, and quantum thermodynamics, where the interactions between a quantized system and the bath is a powerful yet largely underutilized resource.

TI Primordial Gravitational Wave Circuit Complexity
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this article, we investigate the various physical implications of quantum circuit complexity using the squeezed state formalism of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGW). Recently, quantum information-theoretic concepts, such as entanglement entropy and complexity, have played a pivotal role in understanding the dynamics of quantum systems, even in diverse fields such as high-energy physics and cosmology. This paper is devoted to studying the quantum circuit complexity of PGW for various cosmological models, such as de Sitter, inflation, radiation, reheating, matter, bouncing, cyclic and black hole gas models, etc. We compute complexity measures using both Covariance and Nielsen's wave function method for three different choices of quantum initial vacua: Motta-Allen, a and Bunch-Davies. Besides computing circuit complexity, we also compute the Von Neumann entanglement entropy. By making the comparison between complexity and entanglement entropy, we are able to probe various features regarding the dynamics of evolution for different cosmological models. Because entanglement entropy is independent of the squeezing angle, we are able to understand more details of the system using Nielsen's measure of complexity, which is dependent on both squeezing parameter and angle. This implies that quantum complexity could indeed be a useful probe to study quantum features on a cosmological scale. Quantum complexity is also becoming a powerful technique to understand the chaotic behaviour and random fluctuations of quantum fields. Using the growth of complexity, we are able to compute the quantum Lyapunov exponent for various cosmological models and comment on its chaotic nature.

TI Electronic spin separation induced by nuclear motion near conical
   intersections
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Though the concept of Berry force was proposed thirty years ago, little is known about the practical consequences of this force as far as chemical dynamics are concerned. Here, we report that when molecular dynamics pass near a conical intersection, a massive Berry force can appear as a result of even a small amount of spin-orbit coupling (<10(-3) eV), and this Berry force can in turn dramatically change pathway selection. In particular, for a simple radical reaction with two outgoing reaction channels, an exact quantum scattering solution in two dimensions shows that the presence of a significant Berry force can sometimes lead to spin selectivity as large as 100%. Thus, this article opens the door for organic chemists to start designing spintronic devices that use nuclear motion and conical intersections (combined with standard spin-orbit coupling) in order to achieve spin selection. Vice versa, for physical chemists, this article also emphasizes that future semiclassical simulations of intersystem crossing (which have heretofore ignored Berry force) should be corrected to account for the spin polarization that inevitably arises when dynamics pass near conical intersections. Spin polarization is at the basis of quantum information and underlies some natural processes, but many aspects still need to be explored. Here, the authors, by quantum mechanical computations, show that even a weak spin-orbit coupling near a conical intersection can induce large spin selection, with consequences for spin manipulation in photochemical or electrochemical reactions.

TI Deep Thermalization under Charge-Conserving Quantum Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB "Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wave-function distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a U(1) symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or "charge") and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wave-function distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a "coarse graining" that is an essential feature of bona fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a "replica-limit" approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; and (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.

TI Development of 6-inch h-BN thick wafers
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We report the first successful synthesis of 40 mu m thick h-BN wafers with a diameter of 6 in. using hydride vapor phase epitaxy. This accomplishment was made possible by employing BCl3 as the B precursor to eliminate carbon impurities, utilizing inert N-2 as the carrier and separation gas to isolate BCl3 and NH3 gas sources, and implementing low-pressure growth to prevent parasitic reactions in the gas phase. These strategies enabled the growth of h-BN wafers 6 in. in diameter with improved uniformity in thickness and crystallinity. Analysis through x-ray diffraction, selected area electron diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the wafer deposited at the lowest pressure of 20 Torr exhibited highest crystalline quality with measured c-lattice constant c = 6.66 & Aring; and an a-lattice constant a = 2.48 & Aring;, in good agreement with the expected lattice parameters of phase-pure h-BN. Time-resolved photoluminescence emission spectroscopy unveiled a dominant emission line near 3.41 eV, with a recombination lifetime of 2.7 ns at room temperature. These spectroscopic characteristics, when considered alongside a previous theoretical study, suggest that nitrogen vacancies (V-N) constitute the primary defects in these large-diameter h-BN wafers. The achievement of 6 in. diameter wafers with substantial thickness represents a significant advancement in h-BN development, paving the way for the industrial adoption of h-BN technologies, with implications for quantum information and technology, single photon emitters, neutron detectors, power electronics, and deep UV photonics.

TI Orbital Optimization of Large Active Spaces via AI-Accelerators
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We present an efficient orbital optimization procedure that combines the highly GPU accelerated, spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with the complete active space self-consistent field (CAS-SCF) approach for quantum chemistry implemented in the ORCA program package. Leveraging the computational power of the latest generation of Nvidia GPU hardware, we perform CAS-SCF based orbital optimizations for unprecedented CAS sizes of up to 82 electrons in 82 orbitals [CAS(82,82)] in molecular systems comprising active space sizes of hundreds of electrons in thousands of orbitals. For both the NVIDIA DGX-A100 and DGX-H100 hardware, we provide a detailed scaling and error analysis of our DMRG-SCF approach for benchmark systems consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and iron-sulfur complexes of varying sizes. Our efforts demonstrate for the first time that highly accurate DMRG calculations at large bond dimensions are critical for obtaining reliably converged CAS-SCF energies. For the more challenging iron-sulfur benchmark systems, we furthermore find the optimized orbitals of a converged CAS-SCF calculation to depend more sensitively on the DMRG parameters than those for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability to obtain converged CAS-SCF energies and orbitals for active spaces of such large sizes within days reduces the challenges of including the appropriate orbitals into the CAS or selecting the correct minimal CAS, and may open up entirely new avenues for tackling strongly correlated molecular systems.

TI Computationally guided experimental validation of divacancy defect
   formation in 4H-SiC
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Recent research into solid-state qubits for quantum information science has focused on optically addressable spin defects such as the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and the neutrally charged divacancy (VV) in 4H-SiC as scalable quantum sensors and networking qubits. Within this context, direct investigations of the structural origin and defect formation dynamics of a sub-set of the VV center in 4H-SiC remain lacking. Here, we take a systematic experimental approach guided by predictions from first-principles simulations to gain a thorough mechanistic understanding of the VV defect formation and control in 4H-SiC. We study the effect of annealing time and temperature on VV formation in high-purity semi-insulating 4H-SiC samples following electron irradiation. Three different temperatures (1123, 1273, and 1473 K) and annealing duration (from 0.5 to 72 h) are chosen to explore VV formation in different regions. We find that samples annealed at 1273 K give the highest VV-related photoluminescence (PL) intensities, in agreement with the prediction from first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the logarithmic dependence of VV-related PL intensities on the annealing duration at 1273 K indicates that 1273 K provides sufficient thermal energy for silicon vacancy migration but not for VV migration. Together, these results suggest that efficient VV formation occurs above the VSi migration temperature and below the VV migration threshold. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy at liquid
   helium temperatures for quantum materials
SO ULTRAMICROSCOPY
AB Fundamental quantum phenomena in condensed matter, ranging from correlated electron systems to quantum information processors, manifest their emergent characteristics and behaviors predominantly at low temperatures. This necessitates the use of liquid helium (LHe) cooling for experimental observation. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with LHe cooling (cryo-STEM) provides a powerful characterization technique to probe local atomic structural modulations and their coupling with charge, spin and orbital degrees-of-freedom in quantum materials. However, achieving atomic resolution in cryo-STEM is exceptionally challenging, primarily due to sample drifts arising from temperature changes and noises associated with LHe bubbling, turbulent gas flow, etc. In this work, we demonstrate atomic resolution cryo-STEM imaging at LHe temperatures using a commercial side-entry LHe cooling holder. Firstly, we examine STEM imaging performance as a function of He gas flow rate, identifying two primary noise sources: He-gas pulsing and He-gas bubbling. Secondly, we propose two strategies to achieve low noise conditions for atomic resolution STEM imaging: either by temporarily suppressing He gas flow rate using the needle valve or by acquiring images during the natural warming process. Lastly, we show the applications of image acquisition methods and image processing techniques in investigating structural phase transitions in Cr2Ge2Te6, CuIr2S4, and CrCl3. Our findings represent an advance in the field of atomic resolution electron microscopy imaging for quantum materials and devices at LHe temperatures, which can be applied to other commercial side-entry LHe cooling TEM holders.

TI Shortcuts to adiabaticity with general two-level non-Hermitian systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Shortcuts to adiabaticity are alternative fast processes which reproduce the same final state as the adiabatic process in a finite or even shorter time, which have been extended from Hermitian systems to non-Hermitian systems in recent years, but they are barely explored for general non-Hermitian systems where off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian are not Hermitian. In this paper, we propose a shortcuts to adiabaticity technique which is based on a transitionless quantum driving algorithm to realize population transfer for general two level non-Hermitian systems and give both exact and approximate analytical solutions of the corresponding counteradiabatic driving Hamiltonian, where the latter can be extended to the zeroth-order and first-order terms by applying perturbative theory. We find that the first-order correction term is different from the previous results, which is caused by the non-Hermiticity of the off-diagonal elements. We work out an exact expression for the control function and present examples consisting of a general two-level system with gain and loss to show the theory. The results suggest that the high-fidelity population transfer can be implemented in general non-Hermitian systems by our method, which works even with strong non-Hermiticity and without rotating wave approximation. Furthermore, we show that the general Hamiltonian the off-diagonal elements of which are not conjugate to each other can be implemented in many physical systems with the present experimental technology, such as an atom-light interaction system and whispering-gallery microcavity, which might have potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI First-principles study of the Stark shift effect on the zero-phonon line
   of the NV center in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Point defects in semiconductors are attractive candidates for quantum information science applications owing to their ability to act as spin-photon interface or single-photon emitters. However, the coupling between the change of dipole moment upon electronic excitation and stray electric fields in the vicinity of the defect, an effect known as Stark shift, can cause significant spectral diffusion in the emitted photons. In this work, using first principles computations, we revisit the methodology to compute the Stark shift of point defects up to the second order. The approach consists of applying an electric field on a defect in a slab and monitoring the changes in the computed zero-phonon line (i.e., difference in energy between the ground and excited state) obtained from constraining the orbital occupations (constrained-DFT). We study the Stark shift of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond using this slab approach. We discuss and compare two approaches to ensure a negatively charged defect in a slab and we show that converged values of the Stark shift measured by the change in dipole moment between the ground and excited states (Delta mu) can be obtained. We obtain a Stark shift of Delta mu=2.68D using the semilocal GGA-PBE functional and of Delta mu=2.23D using the HSE hybrid functional. These values are in good agreement with experimental results. We also show that modern theory of polarization can be used on constrained-DFT to obtain Stark shifts in very good agreement with the slab computations.

TI Isoenergetic model for optical down-conversion and error-specific limits
   of the parametric approximation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical down-conversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a nondepleted and nonentangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schr & ouml;dinger equation of the down-conversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. Our model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of r 1.8 and a coherent pump amplitude of alpha 2 x 106, can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of alpha 2 x 106, the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds r 4.5, whereas the new approximation remains valid up to r 6 with an acceptable error of 1%.

TI Efficient large-scale quantum optimization via counterdiabatic ansatz
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the fundamental variational quantum algorithms, while a version of QAOA that includes counterdiabatic driving, termed digitized counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA), is generally considered to outperform QAOA for all system sizes when the circuit depth for the two algorithms are held equal. Nevertheless, DC-QAOA introduces more CNOT gates per layer, so the overall circuit complexity is a tradeoff between the number of CNOT gates per layer and the circuit depth and must be carefully assessed. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DC-QAOA and QAOA on MAXCUT problem with the total number of CNOT gates held equal, and we focus on one implementation of counterdiabatic terms using nested commutators in DC-QAOA, termed as DC-QAOA(NC). We have found that DC-QAOA(NC) reduces the overall circuit complexity as compared to QAOA only for sufficiently large problems, and for MAXCUT problem the number of qubits must exceed 16 for DC-QAOA(NC) to outperform QAOA. Additionally, we benchmark DC-QAOA(NC) against QAOA on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model under realistic noise conditions, finding that DC-QAOA(NC) exhibits significantly improved robustness compared to QAOA, maintaining higher fidelity as the problem size scales. Notably, in a direct comparison between one-layer DC-QAOA(NC) and three-layer QAOA where both use the same number of CNOT gates, we identify an exponential performance advantage for DC-QAOA(NC), further signifying its suitability for large-scale quantum optimization tasks. We have further shown that this advantage can be understood from the effective dimensions introduced by the counterdiabatic driving terms. Moreover, based on our finding that the optimal parameters generated by DC-QAOA(NC) strongly concentrate in the parameter space, we have devised an instance-sequential training method for DC-QAOA(NC) circuits, which, compared to traditional methods, offers performance improvement while using even fewer quantum resources. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the advantages of DC-QAOA circuits and an efficient training method based on their generalizability.

AB Collision problems are important problems in complexity theory and cryptography with diverse applications. Previous fruitful works have mainly focused on query models. Driven by various applications, several works by Bauer, Farshim and Mazaheri (CRYPTO 2018), Itsykson and Riazanov (CCC 2021), Goos and Jain (RANDOM 2022) independently proposed the communication version of collision problems. In the communication setting, both Alice and Bob receive : random subsets of [N]: (S-1,..., S-k and T1,..., T-k with each of size roughly root N, where a typical choice of k is in the order of root N for applications. Then Alice and Bob aim to find a pair (x, x') such that x, x' is an element of Si boolean AND T-j for some S-i T-j. A simple protocol that solves this problem with O(N-1/4) communication bits is the following: Alice sends to Bob a random subset of S-1 of size N-1/4 and Bob checks if there is a T-j that has more than two intersections to this subset. All the papers mentioned above believe this bound should be tight up to some log factors. In this paper, we prove an (Omega) over tilde (N-1/4) randomized communication lower bound, affirming the conjecture above. Previously, only an (Omega) over tilde (N-1/2) was known by a work of Goos and Jain (RANDOM 2022). Our lower bound provides direct applications to cryptography and proof complexity via connections by Bauer, Farshim, and Mazaheri (CRYPTO 2018) and Itsykson and Riazanov (CCC 2021). Our proof technique could be of independent interest as it is an extension of simulation methods to non-lifted functions. Previously, simulations have been widely applied to lifted functions (a.k.a composed functions), which leads to beautiful query-to-communication lifting theorems. However, many important communication problems are not lifted functions. We believe our methods could give more applications. In particular, it may have applications to communication complexity of search problems with many solutions. Note that many existing methods do not apply to this setting.

TI Diamond surface nano-structures in an oxidizing atmosphere: A first
   principles study
SO SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Diamond's unique properties has found it numerous applications in electronics, optics and medicine. As desirable are diamond's potential applications, it is notoriously difficult to process on the nanoscale. Anew and promising mechanism involving a two-photon laser induced desorption could solve many of these problems. However, the underlying mechanism of this process is still not well understood; what is known, is that oxygen plays an important role. Therefore a detailed and consistent understanding of the fundamental behaviour of oxygen on diamond surfaces is required. In the present paper, systematic density-functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the interaction of oxygen with the low-index surfaces of diamond, taking into account the effect of pressure and temperature. This affords predictions of the surface atomic structures, including the newly discovered keto-ether structure on the C(110) surface, and the associated properties such as the adsorption energies, work-function, surface dipole moment, electron density difference, density of states, and electronic bandstructure. By including the effect of the environment, namely, the oxygen pressure and temperature in which the surface is held, surface phase diagrams are obtained. From these results, and using the Wulff construction, the shape of oxygen-terminated nanoparticles are predicted. Further, using the calculated surface free energies, the surface populations of different structures on the C(100), C(110) and C(111) surfaces as a function of temperature, for both atmospheric pressure and ultra high vacuum conditions are evaluated. Interestingly, the results predict that although the full monolayer bridge site on C(100) has the highest population, the top site ketone structure can be populated by as much as 20% and coexist. Regarding the half monolayer bridge structure on the reconstructed C(111) -(1 x 2) surface, the bandstructure shows that it possesses no surface states in the band gap making it attractive for quantum sensing applications and is the most favourable structure at this coverage. Interestingly, the calculations predict another structure that is only 0.02 eV less favourable and so is likely to coexist on the surface. Overall, the present work provides a most comprehensive theoretical understanding of the interaction of oxygen with the low index diamond surfaces, which maybe valuable for future studies of this system.

TI Spectral characteristics of Floquet-electromagnetically induced
   transparency dressed by radio frequency field in a direct current
   electric field
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB A Rydberg atom is a special type of atom characterized by a high principal quantum number. Electric field sensors based on Rydberg atoms have received widespread attention due to their high polarizability. However, there is currently little research on the use of Rydberg atoms for direct current (DC) or low-frequency electric fields, mainly due to the shielding effect of atomic vapor cells in low-frequency electric fields, which makes accurate measurement of the electric fields extremely challenging. In this paper, we construct a Rydberg ladder configuration by using probe laser at 852 nm and coupling laser at 510 nm in a room-temperature cesium vapor cell with integrated electrode plates, thereby enabling the realizing of a Floquet-EIT (electromagnetically induced transparency) spectrum dressed by a radio frequency (RF) field in the presence of a DC electric field. We further study the influence of DC electric field on spectral characteristic. Experimentally, it is observed that when only the RF electric field is applied, the EIT spectrum displays solely even-order sidebands. Furthermore, when both the RF field and the DC electric field are simultaneously present, the first-order sideband signal of the Floquet-EIT is observed. As the intensity of the DC electric field increases, the amplitude of the first-order sideband gradually increases. However, increasing the DC electric field to a sufficient magnitude induces sideband interference, which leads the sideband amplitudes to decrease. Furthermore, increasing the RF frequency can alleviate the interference effects induced by the DC electric field on the first-order sideband. Finally, comparing the relative standard deviation of the sideband amplitudes of the Floquet-EIT spectra with the frequency shifts of the DC-Stark spectra under weak DC electric fields, we find that the measurement accuracy of the former is significantly superior to that of the latter. This work makes use of a Cs atomic vapor cell with an integrated electrode to avoid shielding effects. By observing Floquet-EIT spectra, the response of the spectra to DC electric fields is investigated. This experiment provides novel insights into the quantum sensing measurements of DC and low-frequency electric fields.

TI Entanglement Based Detection, Networking, Sensing, and Radars
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Entanglement based (EB) communication, networking, and sensing represent excellent alternatives to corresponding classical counterparts in particular in either low-brightness or high-attenuation regime and when the signal photons are buried in noise. In EB applications idler photons are stored in memory while the signal photons, carrying information, are transmitted over lossy, noisy, and for communication/networking over free-space optical (FSO) channels signal photons are also affected by the atmospheric turbulence and scattering effects. In optical phase conjugation (OPC)-based EB receiver, the OPC operation is performed on signal photons, which are severely affected by FSO channel impairments, with many signal photons being either absorbed or scattered by the FSO channel. Here we propose to perform the OPC operation on idler photons instead. The OPC operation is performed using low-cost, C-band components including tunable laser, periodically polled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides, tunable filter, and WDM demultiplexer; and this implementation is suitable for the photonic integrated circuit (PIC) realization. A similar approach is applied to implement the C-band devices-based entanglement source. Given that the idler photons are brighter compared to the signal photons transmitted over either FSO channel or fiber-optics channel, the OPC operation is much more efficient. In the OPC-based receiver for FSO communications, we need to couple the signal photons to the single-mode fiber (SMF) before the OPC takes place, making the OPC process sensitive to the FSO-to-SMF coupling inefficiency. By performing the OPC on the idler photons instead, the OPC process is insensitive to poor coupling efficiency. In addition to being superior in terms of spectral efficiency compared to classical counterparts, in particular in highly lossy and noisy environment, the proposed EB scheme with the phase-conjugation on idler photons is superior to the corresponding scheme performing the phase-conjugation on signal photons in terms of receiver sensitivity making it an attractive option for radar applications. To validate the proposed concept at the University of Arizona campus we have developed a terrestrial FSO testbed. For detection probability of 0.99 the proposed EB radar outperforms the classical counterpart by 6.7 dB. We experimentally demonstrate that the target detection probability of the proposed entanglement based radar over turbulent FSO channel is significantly better than that of corresponding classical detection scheme.

TI Regulation of Stark effect in Rydberg atoms by AC and DC electric fields
   and measurement of power-frequency strong fields
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The Stark effect in Rydberg atoms exhibits remarkable sensitivity to external electric fields, thus forming the fundamental basis for precision electric field measurements. This study systematically and comprehensively investigates the regulatory effects of DC and AC electric fields on cesium Rydberg atoms, both experimentally and theoretically. Utilizing a two-photon three-level system, we generate 28D(5/2) Rydberg states and establish electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) as the macroscopic observable. Our experimental results demonstrate distinct Stark splitting patterns under DC fields, revealing three fine-structure states each with polarization-dependent frequency shift, they being the negative polarizability states (m(j) = 1/2, 3/2) exhibiting rightward shifts, and the positive polarizability state (m(j) = 5/2) showing leftward displacement. For power-frequency AC fields (50 Hz), we observe characteristic double-frequency modulation of the EIT-Stark spectra, with measurement limitations emerging at field strengths above 24 V/cm due to laser scanning range constraints. To overcome this limitation, we develop an innovative DC field regulated measurement scheme, establishing a dynamic model for the combined AC/DC field interaction with Rydberg atoms. The model successfully derives demodulation expressions for extracting both DC and AC field components from the composite spectral shifts. Experimental validation shows that applying an 8 V/cm DC bias field can extend the measurable AC field range to 32 V/cm, achieving a 33.3% improvement over direct measurement methods within a 1 GHz laser scanning range, while maintaining exceptional accuracy with demodulation errors below 0.8% across all tested configurations. The detailed error analysis reveals that the measurement precision improves with the increase of field strength, with a standard deviation of sigma = 0.2196%, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. Compared with existing techniques, this DC-field regulation method effectively addresses the critical challenge of limited laser scanning range in strong-field measurements, while preserving the quantum advantages of Rydberg atom sensors. The research provides both theoretical foundations and practical solutions for measuring power-frequency strong electric fields in power systems, with potential applications extending to other low-frequency strong-field measurement scenarios. Future work will focus on enhancing measurement stability in extreme field conditions, improving accuracy, and further expanding the operational range of this quantum sensing technology.

TI SP-A binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using hybrid quantum and
   classical in silico modeling and molecular pruning by Quantum
   Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Based MaxCut with ZDOCK
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB The pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a constitutively expressed immune-protective collagenous lectin (collectin) in the lung. It binds to the cell membrane of immune cells and opsonizes infectious agents such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses through glycoprotein binding. SARS-CoV-2 enters airway epithelial cells by ligating the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell surface using its Spike glycoprotein (S protein). We hypothesized that SP-A binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and this binding interferes with ACE2 ligation. To study this hypothesis, we used a hybrid quantum and classical in silico modeling technique that utilized protein graph pruning. This graph pruning technique determines the best binding sites between amino acid chains by utilizing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)-based MaxCut (QAOA-MaxCut) program on a Near Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. In this, the angles between every neighboring three atoms were Fourier-transformed into microwave frequencies and sent to a quantum chip that identified the chemically irrelevant atoms to eliminate based on their chemical topology. We confirmed that the remaining residues contained all the potential binding sites in the molecules by the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) database. QAOA-MaxCut was compared with GROMACS with T-REMD using AMBER, OPLS, and CHARMM force fields to determine the differences in preparing a protein structure docking, as well as with Goemans-Williamson, the best classical algorithm for MaxCut. The relative binding affinity of potential interactions between the pruned protein chain residues of SP-A and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins was assessed by the ZDOCK program. Our data indicate that SP-A could ligate the S protein with a similar affinity to the ACE2-Spike binding. Interestingly, however, the results suggest that the most tightly-bound SP-A binding site is localized to the S2 chain, in the fusion region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, that is responsible for cell entry Based on these findings we speculate that SP-A may not directly compete with ACE2 for the binding site on the S protein, but interferes with viral entry to the cell by hindering necessary conformational changes or the fusion process.

AB Two novel methoxyphenyl-based piperazine compounds have been investigated. The crystal structures of [C11H18N2O][Co(SCN)(4)] (1) and [(C11H18N2O)(4)]Cl-8 center dot 7H(2)O (2) have been determined using single crystal X-ray crystallography. However, (1) crystallizes in an orthorhombic system with the non-centrosymmetric space group P 212121 with the following lattice parameters: a = 8.4637(2) angstrom, b = 14.5848 (5) angstrom, c = 17.1847 (5) angstrom with V = 2121.3 (1) angstrom(3) and Z = 4, otherwise (2) crystallizes in monoclinic system with P 2(1)/c space group and the following lattice parameters: a = 7.2551 (2) angstrom, b = 9.0523 (4) angstrom, c = 22.3575 (8) angstrom, beta = 95.998 (3). with V = 1460.30 (9) angstrom(3) and Z = 1. Different interactions packed the system through N-H.S hydrogen bonds for (1). The organic entities are grouped into dimers for (2) through weak interactions and N-H ... Cl, N-H ... O, and OH ... Cl. The robustness of the crystals is also enhanced by C-H. p of the piperazine ring. Infrared spectrums were recorded to reveal the vibrational modes of the compounds, and to highlight the optical behavior, UV-visible analysis has been carried out. Thermal analysis was carried out to highlight the thermal stability of complexes. In addition, the antibacterial assets were investigated against different bacteria. The C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance was carried out to highlight the presence of primary reagents in the final product. Intermolecular interaction and stabilization of dimer complexes in the crystal packing are explored using Hirshfeld surface analysis to highlight the role of molecular interaction in the crystal packing. The more detailed quantum computation from crystallographic reported self-assembled dimer complexes occurred for comprehensive structure elucidation and showed good findings. The nature of dimer complexes has been assessed by strong and weak intermolecular interactions which were examined by NCI plots and analyzed by QTAIM calculation. Then, the thermal analysis was used to confirm the crystal thermal stability, Furthermore, biological behavior was performed for the compounds against different antibacterial targets to identify to which target the compounds show the best affinity. and finally, the magnetic properties were studied to show the spin coupling for the metal complex. Magnetic measurements of the novel cobalt compound show.T values that are typical for Co(II) cations with S = 3/2.

TI Experimentally estimating of physical parameters of the fabricated
   superconducting Josephson junctions
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Superconducting Josephson junctions are the key devices for superconducting quantum computation and microwave single photon detection. It is important to fabricate the Josephson junctions with designable parameters. Different from the typical methods to calibrate the parameters of the Josephson junctions, e.g., by using the microwave drivings and measuring the ratio of hysteresis current to critical one, in this paper we achieve the calibrations with the low frequency current biases. First, we measure the I-V characteristic curves of the fabricated Al/AlOx/Al junctions. Second, we measure the statistical distributions of the jump currents of the Josephson junction samples driven by the low frequency (@71.3 Hz) biased currents at an extremely low temperature of 50 mK. These two sets of experimental data are utilized to estimate the typical parameters of the Josephson junction, i.e., junction capacitance, critical current, and the damping coefficient, which are difficult to be directly measured in the usual experiments. The critical current and capacitance of the Josephson junction are estimated by fitting the statistical distribution of the measured jump currents with the relevant theoretical model of the "particle" escape from the potential driven by the thermal excitations and quantum tunnelings. With the calibrated critical current of the junction, the relation between I/I-c and d phi/d(tau), tau = omega(c)t (with omega(c) being the plasmon frequency) is obtained from the measured I-V curve. Using the standard resistively capacitance shunted junction model to fit such a relation, the damping coefficient of the junction can be estimated. With the estimated critical current, capacitance, and damping coefficient, the resistance R-n of the junction at the working temperature is calibrated consequently. It is shown that our estimated results are in good agreement with that predicted by the famous Ambgaokar-Baratoff formula. Physically, the method demonstrated here possesses two advantages. First, it is relatively insensitive to the noise during the measurement of the junction's I-V characteristic curve, compared with the usual method to calibrate damping coefficient by measuring the ratio of hysteresis current to critical current. Second, only the low frequency driving is required to measure the jump current of the junction for estimating the damping coefficient. The microwave driving is not necessary. Hopefully, the present work is useful for the on-demand designs of the Josephson junctions for various applications.

TI Investigations into Vector Light and Its Application in Optically Pumped
   Magnetometers
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are crucial in magnetic- field measurements. Its high sensitivity and low noise allow it to detect weak magnetic- field changes up to the nT level, thus significantly expanding human understanding into the micro- magnetic- field environment. OPMs are beneficial in various areas, including the precise mapping of Earth's magnetic field, the detection of weak biological magnetic signals within biological tissues, quantum computing, and magnetic- material research. The main function of an OPM is to detect magnetic fields using specific polarized pump light and detection light. High- purity pump light, which is typically linearly or circularly polarized, interacts with atomic cells. The selective excitation of pump light causes the arrangement of atomic magnetic moments to align with the polarization direction of light, thus forming a magnetized region. This process is known as optical pumping, which effectively places atoms in specific magnetic quantum states, thereby enhancing their sensitivity to magnetic fields. This allows the detection of light passing through magnetized regions with different polarization states. Under the effect of a magnetic field, the energy levels of atoms undergo Zeeman splitting, which affects the absorption and scattering of detection light. By analyzing and detecting changes in light intensity or polarization rotation, the intensity and direction of the magnetic field can be inferred accurately. The polarization state must be controlled precisely as it determines the manner by which atoms are excited and their response to magnetic fields, thereby ensuring the high sensitivity and measurement accuracy of the equipment. This principle based on atomic magnetic resonance renders the OPM an ideal tool for detecting weak magnetic fields; thus, OPMs are widely used in scientific research and practical applications. Aided by the development of modern technology, researchers have comprehensively investigated vector lights with complex polarization states and gradually applied them to OPMs. In an OPM, particularly the component involving the interaction between vector light and atoms, dichroism and birefringence are two key optical phenomena. Dichroism refers to the different propagation characteristics of light in different polarization directions. This characteristic is used to selectively excite or manipulate atoms of specific energy levels in an OPM. Birefringence refers to the difference in the refractive index between vertically and horizontally polarized light in a medium, which causes a beam to separate when it passes through an atomic medium. By leveraging the properties above and examining the practical application of vector light in OPMs, we can further improve the sensitivity of OPMs. Compared with conventional OPMs, a new type of OPM based on vector light pumping/detection features rapid response, adaptability to more complex environments, and high sensitivity. Owing to the vector characteristics of vector light, this OPM can simultaneously measure multiple components of the magnetic field, thus achieving complete magnetic- field vector measurements without requiring additional optical paths. Therefore, it is more suitable for integration into complex optical systems in fields such as biomedical, material science, and space exploration. Progress This paper summarizes the development history of OPMs, describes their operating principle (Figs.
   2 and 3), and explains the energy- level transition of optically pumped polarized alkali metal atoms based on a 87 Rb atomic energy- level diagram (Fig. 4). As per the development history of OPMs, optical polarization is crucial to the entire process (Fig. 5). Vector light is a new type of beam that has emerged in recent years, and its polarization state is distributed in a certain pattern on the cross-section of the beam (Fig. 6). The measurement of vector light in a magnetic field has been investigated extensively (Fig. 7). In terms of light and matter, investigating the dichroism and birefringence in the interaction between vector light and alkali metal atoms is crucial for OPMs. Based on dichroism, when a beam of linearly polarized light is irradiated onto an alkali metal atomic- gas chamber, the absorption and scattering efficiency of light varies owing to the ultrafine structure of the atoms and the energy levels of different magnetic quantum numbers. By adjusting the polarization direction of light, atoms can be more effectively pumped into specific magnetic states, thereby enhancing their response to magnetic fields (Fig. 8). Based on birefringence, vector light is incident in the orthogonal pumping direction, and the relationship between the polarization rotation angle of the detected light and the external magnetic field after the light passes through the gas chamber can be derived (Fig. 9). In practical applications, vector light with complex polarization states can be used as pump/detection light not only for the real-time dynamic detection of the magnetic- field size (Fig. 10) but also for solving the " dead zone" problem in magnetometers, improving spatial resolution and sensitivity (Fig. 11), and achieving miniaturized OPMs. Conclusions and Prospects Comprehensive investigations into quantum optics and the development of micro- and nano- technology will refine the manipulation of vector light, which is expected to enable magnetic- field measurements with higher sensitivities and resolutions. New OPMs based on vector optical pumping/detection have gradually received the attention of researchers. Thus, the application of OPMs in biomedicine, geological exploration, quantum information processing, and other fields will be promoted. Additionally, the miniaturization and integrated design of OPMs render them more portable and will further broaden their practical use. In the future, the development of vector- light technology will significantly improve OPMs.

TI Review on optical nonlinearity of group-IV semiconducting materials for
   all-optical processing
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Group-IV semiconductor compounds with intense optical nonlinearity have emerged as a new branch of all-optical processing materials benefiting from the manufacturing compatibility with silicon electronic and photonic integrated circuits. Due to the chemical reforming on the bonding or precipitating feature of the compositional atoms in the membrane matrix, either the orbital hybridization or the quantum self-assembly of interstitial composites can be employed to reform the electronic and optical characteristics. The recent development on enhancing the nonlinear refractive indices of the group-IV semiconductor materials has revealed significant progress to accelerate the all-optical switching logic, which greatly reduces the energy consumption to enable the constitution of the advanced multi-logic gating and the entry-level photonic computing circuits. This work not only overviews the group-IV semiconductor photonic data processing elements but also prospects for the future direction of optical quantum computation and communication. To date, the nonlinear refractive indices of the group-IV semiconductor materials can be obtained as 10(-8) to 10(-16) cm(2)/W in the range between 300 and 10 000 nm in 2022. The wavelength conversion and data switching with bit rate beyond 25 Gbps have been achieved via nonlinear photonic waveguide components. By taking the non-stoichiometric SiC-made micro-ring waveguide as an example, the n(2) as high as 3.05 x 10(-14) cm(2)/W of the resonant SiC micro-ring gate is retrieved from the pump-probe analysis. The eye-diagram of the wavelength converted data in the micro-ring achieves its signal-to-noise and on/off-extinction ratios (SNR and ER) of 5.6 and 11.8 dB, while up to 25-Gbps all-optical data-format inversion with 4.8-dB SNR and 10.2-dB ER is also performed during an ultrafast switching within rising and falling time of less than 22 ps. Such all-optical data processing including both wavelength switching and format conversion in the highly nonlinear optical SiC waveguide resonator can achieve error-free operation with corresponding bit-error-ratios of lower than 1 x 10(-5) at 25 Gbps after forward error correction.

TI Interference Suppression and Frequency- Locking Circuit Design in Ultra-
   Stable Laser Systems
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective Ultra - stable lasers, characterized by high - frequency stability and extremely narrow linewidths, serve as vital tools in precision measurement and physics research. They find extensive applications in fields such as atomic clocks, gravitational wave detection, and quantum communication. With improvements in experimental precision, the demand for lasers with narrower linewidths and higher frequency stability has increased. Therefore, enhancing the frequency stability of ultrastable lasers has become a significant area of research. Currently, the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) frequency stabilization technique is widely used for generating ultrastable lasers. By employing this technique, the laser frequency is locked to a high - precision Fabry- Perot (FP) cavity to reduce the laser linewidth and improve frequency stability. If the feedback system has a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio (SNR), an appropriate loop bandwidth, and gain, it can fully suppress the free - running frequency noise and drift of the laser. Ultimately, the frequency stability primarily depends on the performance of the ultrastable cavity (reference cavity), which serves as the frequency reference, and the servo system that controls the laser frequency. Thus, enhancing the stability of the reference cavity and optimizing the performance of the frequency - locking system are critical for improving the frequency stability of ultrastable lasers. Methods This study theoretically investigates the influence of interference effects on PDH locking error signals and identifies optimization directions for the optical path. In experiments, a reflection mirror was initially used instead of the reference cavity to prevent data distortion caused by laser frequency drifts when the laser operates freely and scans through the resonances of the reference cavity. Subsequently, an Agilent 34401A digital multimeter was employed to measure the voltage values of the locking error signals under different optical path conditions. The stabilities of the locking error were calculated and compared under different optical path designs. Finally, the optimal design for reducing interference effects in the optical path was chosen. A self - developed photodetector and frequency - locking circuit were used to stabilize the laser frequency to a 10 cm reference cavity. To enhance the stability of the length of the reference cavity, it was enclosed within a vacuum chamber using a transportable mounting structure. Additionally, a Peltier temperature control system was installed inside the vacuum chamber to maintain the cavity temperature near the zero - crossing point of its coefficient of thermal expansion. The entire system was positioned on an active vibration isolation platform. We replicated this setup to create two independent ultrastable laser systems. The two beams of ultrastable lasers were combined using a fiber combiner and directed to a high - speed photodetector for beat - note detection. Beat - note frequencies were collected using a Microchip 53100A phase noise analyzer, which was used to evaluate the frequency stability of the locked lasers. Results and Discussions The study reveals that adding isolators and wave plates after an electro - optic modulator (EOM) can effectively suppress interference in the optical path (Fig. 2). After optimization, the relative stability of the locked frequency system reaches 9 X 10 -7 . The reference cavity s vibration sensitivity (Table 1, Fig. 7) and temperature instability (Fig.
   9) are both sufficiently low, such that the impact of vibration noise and environmental temperature fluctuations on cavity length stability is overshadowed by that of thermal noise. With a reference cavity linewidth of 21 kHz (precision of 75000), the frequency stability of a 1.5 p.m laser is locked at the 4.0 X 10 -16 level (Fig. 10), which is approaching the thermal noise limit of the 10 cm reference cavity. Conclusions This study theoretically analyzes the influence of interference effects in the optical path on PDH frequency locking error signals and experimentally studies effective methods for reducing these effects. We develop two independent 1.5 p.m ultrastable lasers locked onto two 10 cm ULE reference cavities. Through mutual comparison, the short - term stability of each individual laser is evaluated. The stability reaches 4.6 X 10 -16 for integration times of 1 s and 4.0 X 10 -16 for integration times in the range 2-5 s. This ultrastable laser system, which utilizes a 1.5 p.m polarization - maintaining optical fiber output, is suitable for application in long - distance optical frequency transfer and quantum communication. The study on eliminating interference effects in the optical path provides a reference for future development of ultrastable lasers with frequency stability at the level of 10 -17 .

TI Are Brain-Computer Interfaces Feasible With Integrated Photonic Chips?
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB The present paper examines the viability of a radically novel idea for brain-computer interface (BCI), which could lead to novel technological, experimental, and clinical applications. BCIs are computer-based systems that enable either one-way or two-way communication between a living brain and an external machine. BCIs read-out brain signals and transduce them into task commands, which are performed by a machine. In closed loop, the machine can stimulate the brain with appropriate signals. In recent years, it has been shown that there is some ultraweak light emission from neurons within or close to the visible and near-infrared parts of the optical spectrum. Such ultraweak photon emission (UPE) reflects the cellular (and body) oxidative status, and compelling pieces of evidence are beginning to emerge that UPE may well play an informational role in neuronal functions. In fact, several experiments point to a direct correlation between UPE intensity and neural activity, oxidative reactions, EEG activity, cerebral blood flow, cerebral energy metabolism, and release of glutamate. Therefore, we propose a novel skull implant BCI that uses UPE. We suggest that a photonic integrated chip installed on the interior surface of the skull may enable a new form of extraction of the relevant features from the UPE signals. In the current technology landscape, photonic technologies are advancing rapidly and poised to overtake many electrical technologies, due to their unique advantages, such as miniaturization, high speed, low thermal effects, and large integration capacity that allow for high yield, volume manufacturing, and lower cost. For our proposed BCI, we are making some very major conjectures, which need to be experimentally verified, and therefore we discuss the controversial parts, feasibility of technology and limitations, and potential impact of this envisaged technology if successfully implemented in the future.

TI Archimedes optimisation algorithm quantum dilated convolutional neural
   network for road extraction in remote sensing images
SO HELIYON
AB Roads are closely intertwined with human existence, and the process of extracting road networks has emerged as the most prominent task in remote sensing (RS). The automated road interpretation process of remote sensing images (RSI) efficiently acquires road network data at a reduced expense in comparison to the traditional visual interpretation of RSI. However the manifestation of RSI is completely distinct because of the great difference in length, width, material, and shape of road networks in dissimilar areas. Thus, the extraction of road network data in RSI is still a complex issue. In recent times, DL-based approaches have projected a famous development in image segmentation outcomes, but a lot of them still could not retain boundary data and attain high-resolution road segmentation maps while processing the RSI. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate impressive performance in road extract tasks; however, they frequently encounter difficulties in capturing intricate details and contextual information. The study introduces a novel method, named Archimedes Optimisation Algorithm, Quantum Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for Road Extraction (AOA-QDCNNRE), to tackle the challenges encountered in remote sensing images. The AOA-QDCNNRE technique aims to generate a highresolution road segmentation map using DL with a hyperparameter tuning process. The AOAQDCNNRE technique primarily relies on the QDCNN model, which integrates quantum technology (QC) with dilated convolutions to augment the network's capacity to capture local as well as global contextual information. In addition, the incorporation of the dilated convolutional technique effectively enhances the receptive field without sacrificing spatial resolution, enabling the extraction of precise road features. To develop the road extraction outcomes of the QDCNN approach, the AOA-based hyperparameter tuning process can be exploited. The AOA-QDCNNRE system's simulation results can be tested on benchmark databases, and the results indicate that the AOA-QDCNNRE method surpasses recent algorithms.

TI Tunneling current and noise of entangled electrons in correlated double
   quantum dot
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We developed general approach for the analysis of tunneling current and its zero frequency noise for a wide class of systems where electron transport occurs through the intermediate structure with localized electrons. Proposed approach opens the possibility to study electron transport through multi-electron correlated states and allows to reveal the influence of spatial and spin symmetry of the total system on the electron transport. This approach is based on Keldysh diagram technique in pseudo-particle representation taking into account the operator constraint on the number of pseudo-particles, which gives the possibility to exclude non-physical states. It was shown that spatial and spin symmetry of the total system can block some channels for electron transport through the correlated quantum dots. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the stationary tunneling current and zero frequency noise in correlated coupled quantum dots depend on initial state of the system. In the frame of the proposed approach it was also shown that for the parallel coupling of two correlated quantum dots to the reservoirs tunneling current and its zero frequency noise are suppressed if tunneling occurs through the entangled triplet state with zero total spin projection on the z axis or enhanced for the tunneling through the singlet state in comparison with electron transport through the uncorrelated localized single-electron state. Obtained results demonstrate that two-electron entangled states in correlated quantum dots give the possibility to tune the zero frequency noise amplitude by blocking some channels for electron transport that is very promising in the sense of two-electron entangled states application in quantum communication and logic devices. The obtained nonmonotonic behavior of Fano factor as a function of applied bias is the direct manifestation of the possibility to control the noise to signal ration in correlated quantum dots. We also provide detailed calculations of current and noise for both single type of carriers and two different types of carriers in the presence and in the absence of Coulomb interaction in Supplementary materials.

TI In Situ Study of the Magnetic Field Gradient Produced by a Miniature
   Bi-Planar Coil for Chip-Scale Atomic Devices
SO MICROMACHINES
AB The miniaturization of quantum sensors is a popular trend for the development of quantum technology. One of the key components of these sensors is a coil which is used for spin modulation and manipulation. The bi-planar coils have the advantage of producing three-dimensional magnetic fields with only two planes of current confinement, whereas the traditional Helmholtz coils require three-dimensional current distribution. Thus, the bi-planar coils are compatible with the current micro-fabrication process and are quite suitable for the compact design of the chip-scale atomic devices that require stable or modulated magnetic fields. This paper presents a design of a miniature bi-planar coil. Both the magnetic fields produced by the coils and their inhomogeneities were designed theoretically. The magnetic field gradient is a crucial parameter for the coils, especially for generating magnetic fields in very small areas. We used a NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) method based on the relaxation of 131Xe nuclear spins to measure the magnetic field gradient in situ. This is the first time that the field inhomogeneities of the field of such small bi-planar coils have been measured. Our results indicate that the designed gradient caused error is 0.08 for the By and the Bx coils, and the measured gradient caused error using the nuclear spin relaxation method is 0.09 +/- 0.02, suggesting that our method is suitable for measuring gradients. Due to the poor sensitivity of our magnetometer under a large Bz bias field, we could not measure the Bz magnetic field gradient. Our method also helps to improve the gradients of the miniature bi-planar coil design, which is critical for chip-scale atomic devices.

TI Speed Limits for Macroscopic Transitions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Speed of state transitions in macroscopic systems is a crucial concept for foundations of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as well as various applications in quantum technology represented by optimal quantum control. While extensive studies have made efforts to obtain rigorous constraints on dynamical processes since Mandelstam and Tamm, speed limits that provide tight bounds for macroscopic transitions have remained elusive. Here, by employing the local conservation law of probability, the fundamental principle in physics, we develop a general framework for deriving qualitatively tighter speed limits for macroscopic systems than many conventional ones. We show for the first time that the speed of the expectation value of an observable defined on an arbitrary graph, which can describe general many-body systems, is bounded by the "gradient" of the observable, in contrast with conventional speed limits depending on the entire range of the observable. This framework enables us to derive novel quantum speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics. Unlike previous bounds, the speed limit decreases when the expectation value of the transition Hamiltonian increases; this intuitively describes a new trade-off relation between time and the quantum phase difference. Our bound is dependent on instantaneous quantum states and thus can achieve the equality condition, which is conceptually distinct from the Lieb-Robinson bound. We also find that, beyond expectation values of macroscopic observables, the speed of macroscopic quantum coherence can be bounded from above by our general approach. The newly obtained bounds are verified in transport phenomena in particle systems and nonequilibrium dynamics in many-body spin systems. We also demonstrate that our strategy can be applied for finding new speed limits for macroscopic transitions in stochastic systems, including quantum ones, where the bounds are expressed by the entropy production rate. Our work elucidates novel speed limits on the basis of local conservation law, providing fundamental limits to various types of nonequilibrium quantum macroscopic phenomena.

TI Formation mechanism of InAs nanostructures on GaAs (001) surface at low
   temperature
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, low-dimensional nanostructures such as quantum dots (QD) and quantum rings (QR) have been widely used in many fields such as optoelectronics, microelectronics and quantum communication due to their unique electrical, optical and magnetic properties. Owing to the similarity between nanostructures and atomic systems, the flexible modulation of several quantum properties of nanomaterials and the preparation of new optoelectronic devices around the characteristics of these structural systems have become a hot topic of research. Changing the growth process to control and tune the atomic diffusion mechanism in droplets is a key way of preparing complex nanostructures, which is important for the study of semiconductor nanostructure by droplet epitaxy. In the present experiment, the same amount (5 monolayer (5 ML)) of indium is deposited on GaAs (001) at different substrate temperatures (140, 160, 170 and 180 degrees C) and different arsenic pressures (1.6, 3.3 and 4.6 ML/s), and the surface morphology evolutions are observed. As the substrate temperature increases, the radius of the disk gradually expands and a pit appears in the center of the diffusion disk. As the arsenic pressure increases, the density of the formed droplets increases, and the width of the diffusion disk formed in the center of the droplets gradually decreases. Our work involving nucleation theory is done at T < 200 degrees C to deactivate many thermal processes. This is a result of the diffusion coefficient being more complexly related to temperature. Based on the classical nucleation diffusion theory, the results of experimental data fitting include that the diffusion activation energies of In atoms on the surface of GaAs (001) are (0.62 +/- 0.01) eV in and (1.37 +/- 0.01) eV in [110] respectively, and that the diffusion coefficient D-0 is 1.2 x 10(-2) cm(2)/s:those results confirm the theory after having been compared with the results obtained by other research groups. The diffusion activation energy of indium atoms and the diffusion mechanism of indium droplets on GaAs (001) obtained from the experiment can provide experimental guidance for modulating the structural property of InAs nanostructures.

TI Quantum message-passing algorithm for optimal and efficient decoding
SO QUANTUM
AB Recently, Renes proposed a quantum algorithm called belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) for decoding classical data encoded using a binary linear code with tree Tanner graph that is transmitted over a pure-state CQ channel [1], i.e., a channel with classical input and pure-state quantum output. The algorithm presents a genuine quantum counterpart to decoding based on the classical belief propagation algorithm, which has found wide success in classical coding theory when used in conjunction with LDPC or Turbo codes. More recently Rengaswamy et al. [2] observed that BPQM implements the optimal decoder on a small example code, in that it implements the optimal measurement that distinguishes the quantum output states for the set of input codewords with highest achievable probability. Here we significantly expand the understanding, formalism, and applicability of the BPQM algorithm with the following contributions. First, we prove analytically that BPQM realizes optimal decoding for any binary linear code with tree Tanner graph. We also provide the first formal description of the BPQM algorithm in full detail and without any ambiguity. In so doing, we identify a key flaw overlooked in the original algorithm and subsequent works which implies quantum circuit realizations will be exponentially large in the code dimension. Although BPQM passes quantum messages, other information required by the algorithm is processed globally. We remedy this problem by formulating a truly message-passing algorithm which approximates BPQM and has quantum circuit complexity O(poly n, polylog 1/epsilon), where n is the code length and epsilon is the approximation error. Finally, we also propose a novel method for extending BPQM to factor graphs containing cycles by making use of approximate cloning. We show some promising numerical results that indicate that BPQM on factor graphs with cycles can significantly outperform the best possible classical decoder.

TI Compensatory Structural Growth Responses of Early-Succession Native
   Warm-Season Grass Stands to Defoliation Management
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB There is a growing recognition of the significance of unique morphological and physiological adaptation of native warm-season grasses (NWSG) of North America as summer forage resources and major grassland ecosystem components. Defoliation management plays a major role in ensuring eco-friendly utilization of grassland natural resources. To assess sward structural responses of big bluestem (BB, Andropogon gerardii Vitman), eastern gamagrass (GG, Tripsacum dactyloides L.), indiangrass (IG, Sorghastrum nutans L. Nash), and switchgrass (SG, Panicum virgatum L.) stands to seasonal changes in harvest regimes, a five-year forage harvesting trial was conducted, in a randomized complete block design, at Virginia State University's research farm. Vegetation structural response attributes (sward-height, canopy closure, stand density and basal cover) of newly established the NWSG stands to second year changes in harvest regimes were monitored. In 2013, 64 plots of year-old stands of transplanted BB, GG, IG, and SG separated by =120-cm alleys were cut once in early-August and mid-November to suppress weeds and promote tillering. Starting June 2014, each plot had three 1.5-m wide side-by-side harvest-strips cut once-, twice-, or thrice year(-1) (frequencies) ending mid-Oct for four consecutive years followed by a single mid-summer harvest in 26 June 2018, using a forage plot-harvester. In 2015, harvest frequencies for the three- and single-cut strips, in plots 32-64, were switched/flipped once and never reverted. Data was recorded on four early-summer and late-fall sward heights, from each strip at 60-cm intervals before the first and the last harvest, each year. early-spring basal- and canopy-diameter, for mid-April 2015 and 2016, concurrent early-spring canopy light interception, using the LI-191 Line Quantum Sensor, and season-end visual obstruction heights, for stand density in 2016 and 2017. All regrowth sward-heights showed effects of harvest frequency and exhibited compensatory structural responses to the change in harvest regimes. Basal and canopy diameters tended to be greater for the single-cut strips that were previously cut thrice.

TI Evolutionary Game Theory in Energy Storage Systems: A Systematic Review
   of Collaborative Decision-Making, Operational Strategies, and
   Coordination Mechanisms for Renewable Energy Integration
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB As global energy systems transition towards greater reliance on renewable energy sources, the integration of energy storage systems (ESSs) becomes increasingly critical to managing the intermittency and variability associated with renewable generation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the application of evolutionary game theory (EGT) to optimize ESSs, emphasizing its role in enhancing decision-making processes, operation scheduling, and multi-agent coordination within dynamic, decentralized energy environments. A significant contribution of this paper is the incorporation of negotiation mechanisms and collaborative decision-making frameworks, which are essential for effective multi-agent coordination in complex systems. Unlike traditional game-theoretic models, EGT accounts for bounded rationality and strategic adaptation, offering a robust tool for modeling the interactions among stakeholders such as energy producers, consumers, and storage operators. The paper first addresses the key challenges in integrating ESS into modern power grids, particularly with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy. It then introduces the foundational principles of EGT and compares its advantages over classical game theory in capturing the evolving strategies of agents within these complex environments. A key innovation explored in this review is the hybridization of game-theoretic models, combining the stability of classical game theory with the adaptability of EGT, providing a comprehensive approach to resource allocation and coordination. Furthermore, this paper highlights the importance of deliberative democracy and process-based negotiation decision-making mechanisms in optimizing ESS operations, proposing a shift towards more inclusive, transparent, and consensus-driven decision-making. The review also examines several case studies where EGT has been successfully applied to optimize both local and large-scale ESSs, demonstrating its potential to enhance system efficiency, reduce operational costs, and improve reliability. Additionally, hybrid models incorporating evolutionary algorithms and particle swarm optimization have shown superior performance compared to traditional methods. The future directions for EGT in ESS optimization are discussed, emphasizing the integration of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and blockchain technologies to address current challenges such as data scarcity, computational complexity, and scalability. These interdisciplinary innovations are expected to drive the development of more resilient, efficient, and flexible energy systems capable of supporting a decarbonized energy future.

TI Concrete quantum cryptanalysis of binary elliptic curves via addition
   chain
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Thus far, several papers reported concrete resource estimates of Shor's quantum algorithm for solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. In this paper, we study quantum FLT-based inversion algorithms over binary elliptic curves. There are two major algorithms proposed by Banegas et al. and Putranto et al., where the former and latter algorithms achieve fewer numbers of qubits and smaller depths of circuits, respectively. We propose two quantum FLT-based inversion algorithms that essentially outperform previous FLT-based algorithms and compare the performance for NIST curves of the degree n. Specifically, for all n, our first algorithm achieves fewer qubits than Putranto et al.'s one without sacrificing the number of Toffoli gates and the depth of circuits, while our second algorithm achieves smaller depths of circuits without sacrificing the number of qubits and Toffoli gates. For example, when n = 571 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n = 571$$\end{document} , the number of qubits of our first algorithm is 74 % of that of Putranto et al.'s one, while the depth of our second algorithm is 83 % of that of Banegas et al.'s one. The improvements stem from the fact that FLT-based inversions can be performed with arbitrary sequences of addition chains for n - 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n - 1$$\end{document} although both Banegas et al. and Putranto et al. follow fixed sequences that were introduced by Itoh and Tsujii's classical FLT-based inversion. In particular, we analyze how several properties of addition chains, which do not affect the computational resources of classical FLT-based inversions, affect the computational resources of quantum FLT-based inversions and find appropriate sequences.

TI Spider silk inspires a new route to organic magnets
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Spider dragline silk is one of the most versatile natural materials ever known, with several incredible mechanical, optical, thermal, piezoelectric, and biological properties. However, its fundamental magnetic nature remains unknown. In the present study, we report the observation of room-temperature ferromagnetism in metal-free pristine spider dragline silks upon induction of defects in its beta-sheet nanocrystals. The magnetism originates in spider silks due to ferromagnetic coupling among carbon radicals (dangling bonds) generated in beta-sheet nanocrystals. Direct control over silk's magnetic properties can be achieved by controlling its microstructure. This was achieved by changing the spinning speed of dragline silks from the spider and observing a direct effect on its magnetism. Owing to the high-temperature stability of silk, their ferromagnetism survives up to 400 K and remains unaffected by high humidity or contact with water. This makes silk-based magnets suitable for medical and technological applications. Spider silk can thus act as a multifunctional nontoxic biomagnet with incredible mechanical properties. Our work demonstrates a new paradigm of magnetic proteins and opens a route toward the bioinspired discovery of iron-free magnetic proteins. Biomimicking its structure is of great importance for designing future medical sensors and actuators, including advancements in tissue engineering and artificial muscles.Impact statementIt is well known that densely bound beta-sheet nanocrystals within silk biopolymers are responsible for their incredible mechanical strength and stiffness. In the present study, we show that these beta-sheet nanocrystals also create an ideal environment for stable carbon radicals within the silk structures. A magnetic exchange interaction among these radicals results in a stable and robust carbon-based ferromagnetism at room temperature in these polymers. These are the first ever reports of observation of room-temperature ferromagnetism in pristine spider silks. Inducing defects in these nanocrystals by applying strain on dragline silk samples leads to an enhanced saturation magnetization. A direct effect of nanocrystallite size on the ferromagnetic properties of silk was also observed. Blending magnetism in a bioinspired and metal-free protein-based biomaterial can tremendously impact biomedical applications such as nanoscale drug delivery systems, magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, magnetic scaffolds, and artificial muscles. Our work will stimulate a new theoretical understanding of the origin of magnetism in peptide-based biomaterials with consequences in quantum biology and spintronics. Our work establishes a novel method to control the magnetic responsivity of proteins by engineering atomic defects.

TI Signal-to-noise-ratio and maximum-signal-to-noise-ratio detection
   statistics in template-bank searches for exotic physics transients with
   networks of quantum sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum sensor networks such as the existing networks of atomic clocks and magnetometers offer intriguing capabilities in searches for transient signals such as dark matter or fields sourced by powerful astrophysical events. The common matched-filter technique relies on the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) detection statistic to probe such transients. For macroscopic dark matter objects, the network would register a sweeping signal as the object propagates through at galactic velocities. A potential event is registered when the SNR from a specific template exceeds a threshold set by a desired false positive rate. Generically, to span the continuous parameter space for the network-exotic-physics encounter, one has to deal with multiple templates. In such template-bank searches, the natural generalization of the SNR statistic is the maximum-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR-max) statistic, defined as the maximum of the absolute values of SNRs determined from individual template matching. While individual SNR realizations are Gaussian distributed, SNR-max probability distribution is non-Gaussian. Moreover, as the individual template-bank SNRs are computed using the same network data streams, SNRs become correlated between the templates. Cross-template correlations have a sizable effect on the SNR-max probability and cumulative distributions, and on the threshold SNR-max values. Computing threshold SNR-max values for large template banks is computationally prohibitive and we develop analytic approaches to computing properties of the SNR-max statistic. This is done for cases when the template bank is nearly orthogonal (small cross-template correlations) and for banks with cross-template correlation coefficient distribution "squeezed" about the most probable cross-template correlation value. Since the cross-template correlation coefficients quantify the similarity of templates, increasing correlations tend to decrease SNR-max thresholds for specific values of false positive rates. Increasing the number of templates in the bank increases the SNR-max thresholds. Our derivations are carried out for networks that may exhibit colored noise and cross-node correlations. Specific applications are illustrated with a dark matter search with atomic clocks onboard satellites of a Global Positioning System and with a "toy" planar network with cyclic rotational symmetry.

TI The comparison of Canopeo and samplepoint for measurement of green
   canopy cover for forage crops in India
SO METHODSX
AB Canopy covers can be measured using destructive (visual) and non-destructive methods (spectral indices, photogrammetry, visual assessment, and quantum sensor). The precision of crop cover estimation, however, is dependent on the selection of appropriate methods. Studies were conducted at the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi to compare the forage crops canopy cover estimated using photogrammetry software (Canopeo and SamplePoint) and visual assessments. Assessments were performed in three summer crops (corn, cowpea, and sorghum), two winter crops (Egyptian clover, and oats), and bare ground condition. For each plot, three nadir images (directly above the canopy) were captured using digital cameras from a height of 1.5 m above the soil surface between 10 AM to 2 PM on bright sunny days. The results indicated that the relationships between visual assessment and Canopeo (regression coefficient, (R-2 = 0.96), visual assessment and SamplePoint (0.96), and Canopeo and SamplePoint (0.98) were linear when data were pooled across all the crops. SamplePoint and Canopeo is further, appropriate for cowpea (Pearson coefficient (R = 0.99 and 0.94), oats (0.92 and 0.97), and sorghum (0.46 and 0.51), respectively. SamplePoint and Canopeo are not suitable for berseem (-0.15) and corn (-0.61), respectively, due to dead residues after the first harvest in berseem and taller corn might have influenced the image quality. Therefore, the stage of the crop, the height of the crop, and dead residues around the plants can greatly influence the estimation of crop cover. In conclusion, the results indicated that this photogrammetry software can be used for non-destructive crop canopy measurement with the above-mentioned precautions in the forage crops tested.
   Forage canopy cover is estimated generally by visual scoring, and the outcome varies widely from person to person.
   Photogrammetry methods (Canopeo and SamplePoint) were positiviely correlated with visual scoring for cowpea, oats, and sorghum.
   However, Canopeo and SamplePoint may not suitable for taller crops like corn and ratoon crops like berseem. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

TI Cleaner processing techniques for rubidium extraction and recovery: A
   critical review
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Rubidium (Rb), an important strategic rare alkali metal, has received significant attention in the last few years due to its applications in biomedical research, solar cells, atomic clocks, electronics, aerospace, quantum computing, laser materials and chemical industry. However, the extraction and processing of this metal are complex, since mineral resources containing rubidium are very scarce and are characterised by low rubidium content. For this reason, several technologies have recently been put forward for cleaner recovery processes of rubidium from various resources. Rb compounds are typically co-produced from silicate minerals, such as pollucite or lepidolite, when they are processed for the production of Li and Cs by-products. Seawater and salt lakes have been identified as promising and more sustainable alternative sources This approach could avoid the highly chemical- and energy-intensive routes associated with the processing of minerals containing Rb. As can be observed from the published literature, researchers have employed various techniques such as solvent extraction, membrane sorption processes (hybrid mode), precipitation and adsorption to recover Rb. Very few reviews of Rb extraction have been published in peer-reviewed journals, meaning that Rb has received less attention than other alkali metals. In the last few years, hybrid processes involving membrane sorption have attracted attention, but this aspect has not been covered in previously published reviews. A more in-depth examination of membrane separation technology and other separation/recovery techniques is needed for selective Rb recovery from different resources, with a particular focus on the potential for recovery of Rb via membrane sorption, ion exchange and adsorption processes. Hence, this state-of the-art review covering the period 2010-2024 (up to December 2024) highlights the progress of Rb recovery technologies, addresses the challenges involved, and suggests future avenues for the extraction of rubidium. We also discuss the fact that these cleaner routes, based on the valorisation of waste streams (e.g. the mineral processing stages of lithium production from lake and seawater brines), face thermodynamic barriers due to low Rb concentrations, thus requiring the development of advanced materials (e.g. with high selectivity separation factors over other dominant monovalent ions such as Na or K). Such thermodynamic barriers currently limit both the technical and economical feasibility of these new, cleaner alternatives for Rb recovery.

TI Cooperative Beamforming With Artificial Noise Injection for
   Physical-Layer Security
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the sixth-generation (6G) communications, how to deploy and manage massively connected Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes will be one of the key technical challenges, because 6G is expected to provide 10 times higher connection, compared to 5G. At the same time, due to the sharp growth in connected devices and newly adopted technologies, learning-based attacks and big data breaches are expected to occur more frequently. With the advances of quantum computing in the future, conventional cryptography-based security protocols may be obsolete in the future wireless networks, which makes physical layer security (PLS) an attractive alternative or complement for secure communications. In this context, cooperative beamforming (CB)-based PLS schemes are known to be effective solutions to guarantee high secrecy rate with IoT devices, which have limited power and hardware complexity. However, the existing CB-based PLS algorithms suffer from extremely low secrecy rate, in case that eavesdroppers are close to the intended receiver. To overcome such critical issue, in this paper, we propose a CB-based PLS with artificial noise (AN) injection, which can be realized in a fully distributed manner to minimize the overhead in the IoT networks with a large number of devices. We analyze the array factor using the virtual antenna array (VAA) created by the proposed PLS algorithm. Then, the secrecy rate is derived in a closed-form expression, which can be used to optimize the performance for given system parameters in both the absence and presence of channel state information (CSI) error. The proposed scheme provides considerably higher secrecy rate compared to the conventional CB-based PLS schemes, when an eavesdropper exists near to the intended receiver. Furthermore, through simulation and numerical results, we show that the secrecy rate of the proposed scheme can be maximized by adjusting the ratio between the data beamformer and AN injection beamformer components. As a result, the proposed method shows a performance improvement of up to two times compared to the conventional CB-based PLS schemes, in terms of the secrecy rate. Such performance gain increases as the angular location of Eve becomes closer to that of Bob, which corresponds to the most vulnerable situation of the conventional CB-based PLS algorithms.

   preparation and experimental tests
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Power divider is a useful device that divides the power of signal into different subpowers at a certain ratio. The superconducting power divider plays an important role in various superconducting quantum computing circuits and superconducting microwave photon detectors. Therefore, in this paper we investigate how to design and prepare a typical coplanar waveguide superconducting microwave power divider. The parameters are designed by using the odd-even mode method to analyze the transport features of a three-port microwave network. Specifically, the microwave transport properties of the device with a center frequency of 5 GHz and 3 dB power division ratio are simulated. Then, the designed aluminum coplanar waveguide superconducting power divider on silicon is prepared by micro-processing technology and experimentally tested at low temperature. It is shown that the measurement results are consistent with the design parameters. It is noted that the center frequency of the actually prepared power divider is measured to be about 5.25 GHz, which is slightly different from the result of the design and simulation. This difference is probably due to the following main reasons. Firstly, the limited precision of the micromachining process is caused by the fact that the fabricated quarter-wave impedance matching line is etched incompletely, leading the length of the impedance matching line to be shortened. As a consequence, the frequency of the prepared power divider is slightly higher. Secondly, the simulation software is not designed specially for superconducting device simulations, thereby yielding the design parameters slightly different from those of the fabricated superconducting devices. Additionally, a series of attenuations has been used in the experimental test system of the superconducting microwave power dividers for reducing the various noises. This causes the input test signal to weaken, thus the reflected signal turns significantly small. Therefore, none of the S-11 parameters of the device can be effectively measured. Finally, neither of S-21 and S-31 parameters measured in the experiment is the predicted -3 dB, which is mainly due to the imperfections in the welding between SMA connectors and high-frequency transmission lines, and the spot welding between high-frequency transmission lines and power divider samples, and also due to the discontinuities of the high-frequency transmission line and the power divider and so on. All these factors can yield the tested insertion loss of the device. Hopefully, the method in this work can be extended to designing and preparing other passive superconducting microwave devices.

TI Non-Clifford and Parallelizable Fault-Tolerant Logical Gates on Constant
   and Almost-Constant Rate Homological Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check
   Codes via Higher Symmetries
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive a generic formula for a transversal T gate on color codes defined on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-X membranes having a Z2 triple intersection at a single point. The triple-intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory (TQFT): the Z3 2 gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal S gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry in TQFT supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. A construction of constant-depth circuits of the above logical gates via cup-product cohomology operation is also presented for three copies of identical toric codes on arbitrary 3-manifolds. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple-intersection invariants for 3-manifolds, with the structure encoded into an interaction hypergraph which determines the logical gate property and also corresponds to the hypergraph magic state that can be injected into the code without distillation ("magic-state fountain"). We also study the scaling of the Betti number and systoles with volume for various 3-manifolds, which translates to the encoding rate and distance. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate k/n = O(1/ log(n)) and O(log(n)) distance; (2) A homological fiber-bundle code from twisting the product by an isometry of the surface based on the construction by Freedman-Meyer-Luo, with O(1/ log distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping-torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-X measurements. 1 2 (n)) rate and O(log 1 2(n))

TI In silico design to enhance the barrier height for magnetization
   reversal in Dy(iii) sandwich complexes by stitching them under the
   umbrella of corannulene
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Lanthanide based single molecular magnets (SMMs), particularly dysprocenium based SIMs, are well known for their high energy barrier for spin reversal (U-eff) and blocking temperatures (T-B). Enhancing these two parameters and at the same time obtaining ambient stability is key to realising end-user applications such as compact storage or as qubits in quantum computing. In this work, by employing an array of theoretical tools (DFT, ab initio CASSCF and molecular dynamics), we have modelled six complexes [(eta(5)-corannulene)Dy(Cp)] (1), [(eta(5)-corannulene)Dy(C6H6)] (2), [(eta(6)-corannulene)Dy(Cp)] (3), [(eta(6)-corannulene)Dy(C6H6)] (4), [(exo-eta(5)-corannulene)Dy(endo-eta(5)-corannulene)] (5), and [(endo-eta(5)-corannulene)Dy(endo-eta(5)-corannulene)] (6) containing corannulene as a capping ligand to stabilise Dy(iii) half-sandwich complexes. Our calculations predict a strong axiality exerted by the Dy-C interactions in all complexes. Ab initio calculations predict a very large barrier height for all six molecules in the order 1 (919 cm(-1)) approximate to 3 (913 cm(-1)) > 2 (847 cm(-1)) > 4 (608 cm(-1)) approximate to 5 (603 cm(-1)) approximate to 6 (599 cm(-1)), suggesting larger barrier heights for Cp ring systems, followed by six-membered arene systems and then corannulene. DFT based molecular dynamics calculations were performed on complexes 3, 5 and 6. For complexes 3 and 5, the geometries that are dynamically accessible are far fewer. The range of U-eff computed for molecular dynamics snapshots is high, indicating a possibility of translating the large U-eff obtained into attractive blocking temperatures in these complexes, but the converse is found for 6. Furthermore, an in-depth C-H bond vibrational analysis performed on complex 3 suggests that the vibration responsible for reducing the blocking temperature in dysprocenium SIMs is absent here as the C-H bonds are stronger and corannulene steric strain prevents the C(Cp)-Dy-C(Cor) bending. As [(eta(6)-corannulene)TM(X)](+) (TM = Ru, Zr, Os, Rh, Ir and X = C5Me5, C6Me6) are known, the predictions made here have a higher prospect of yielding stability under ambient conditions, a very large U-eff value and a high blocking temperature - a life-giving combination to new generation SMMs.

TI Spectral Hole-Burning Studies of a Mononuclear Eu(III) Complex Reveal
   Narrow Optical Linewidths of the
   5D0→7F0 Transition and
   Seconds Long Nuclear Spin Lifetimes
SO CHEMPHYSCHEM
AB Coordination complexes of rare-earth ions (REI) show optical transitions with narrow linewidths enabling the creation of coherent light-matter interfaces for quantum information processing (QIP) applications. Among the REI-based complexes, Eu(III) complexes showing the D-5(0)-> F-7(0) transition are of interest for QIP applications due to the narrow linewidths associated with the transition. Herein, we report on the synthesis, structure, and optical properties of a novel Eu(III) complex and its Gd(III) analogue composed of 2,9-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (dpphen) and three nitrate (NO3) ligands. The Eu(III) complex-[Eu(dpphen)(NO3)(3)]-showed sensitized metal-centred emission (D-5(0)-> F-7(J); J=0,1,2,3, 4, 5, or 6) in the visible region, upon irradiation of the ligand-centred band at 369 nm, with the D-5(0)-> F-7(0) transition centred at 580.9 nm. Spectral hole-burning (SHB) studies of the complex with stoichiometric Eu(III) concentration revealed a narrow homogeneous linewidth (Gamma(h)) of 1.55 MHz corresponding to a 0.205 mu s long optical coherence lifetime (T-2opt). Remarkably, long nuclear spin lifetimes (T-1spin) of up to 41 s have been observed for the complex. The narrow optical linewidths and long T-1spin lifetimes obtained for the Eu(III) complex showcase the utility of Eu(III) complexes as tuneable, following molecular engineering principles, coherent light-matter interfaces for QIP applications.

TI Quantum State Smoothing Cannot Be Assumed Classical Even When the
   Filtering and Retrofiltering Are Classical
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB State smoothing is a technique to estimate a state at a particular time, conditioned on information obtained both before (past) and after (future) that time. For a classical system, the smoothed state is a normalized product of the filtered state (a state conditioned only on the past measurement information and the initial preparation) and the retrofiltered effect (depending only on the future measurement information). For the quantum case, while there are well-established analogues of the filtered state (rho F) and the retrofiltered effect (ER), their product does not, in general, provide a valid quantum state for smoothing. However, this procedure does seem to work when rho F and ER are mutually diagonalizable. This fact has been used to obtain smoothed quantum states-purer than the filtered states-in a number of experiments on continuously monitored quantum systems, in cavity QED and atomic systems. In this paper we show that there is an implicit assumption underlying this technique: that if all the information were known to the observer, the true system state would be one of the diagonal basis states. This assumption does not necessarily hold, as the missing information is quantum information. It could be known to the observer only if it were turned into a classical measurement record, but then its nature would depend on the choice of measurement. We show by a simple model that, depending on that measurement choice, the smoothed quantum state can: agree with that from the classical method, disagree with it but still be co-diagonal with it, or not even be co-diagonal with it. That is, just because filtering and retrofiltering appear classical does not mean classical smoothing theory is applicable in quantum experiments.

TI Optoelectronic properties of high pressure regulated transition metal
   chalcogenides and their heterostructures
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Semiconducting transition metal chalcogenides exhibit layer-dependent bandgaps, strong excitonic effects, and spin-valley coupling, positioning them as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. In heterostructures formed by van der Waals stacking, interlayer excitons and moir & eacute; superlattices have emerged as a unique platform for exploring quantum many-body physics and correlated electronic phases. Subjecting semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides and their heterostructures to high pressure enables precise, continuous tuning of optoelectronic properties through anisotropic lattice compression, particularly the dramatic reduction of interlayer distances, which greatly enhances interlayer orbital hybridization over traditional tuning methods. This review systematically presents diamond anvil cell techniques for in situ high-pressure characterization and analyzes the pressure-induced evolution in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides and their heterostructures. It focuses on four key aspects: 1) Atomic-scale structural phase transitions (e.g., layer sliding) and corresponding electronic band structure modifications, including direct-to-indirect bandgap transitions in monolayers (K-L crossover) and metallization/superconductivity; 2) Quantifiable enhancement of interlayer interactions revealed by layer-dependent phonon shifts and spin-orbit splitting amplification, along with the mechanisms of their influence on properties; 3) Modulation of exciton binding states and related mechanisms, covering intralayer excitons, trions and interlayer excitons; 4) Moir & eacute; potential modulation where high pressure significantly deepens potentials via interlayer compression. This review particularly highlights the unique capability of high pressure in enhancing interlayer orbital hybridization, thereby inducing exotic quantum phases. Finally, the future research directions in this field are outlined to advance quantum information device design, strongly correlated electron system simulation, and the novel excitonic state exploration.

TI Femtotesla atomic magnetometer for zero- and ultralow-field nuclear
   magnetic resonance
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE LETTERS
AB Zero- and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) has experienced rapid development and provides an excellent tool for diverse research fields ranging from materials science and quantum information processing to fundamental physics. The detection of ZULF NMR signals in samples with natural abundance remains a challenging endeavor, due to the limited sensitivity of NMR detectors and thermal polarization. In this work, we demonstrate a femtotesla (fT) Potassium spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer designed for ZULF NMR detection. A Potassium vapor cell with high buffer gas pressure and high atomic number density is used in the magnetometer. With absorption spectroscopy and SERF effect, the key parameters of the vapor cell are characterized and applied to optimize the magnetometer sensitivity. To combine our SERF magnetometer and ZULF NMR detection, a custom-made vacuum chamber is employed to keep NMR sample close to the magnetometer cell and protect the sample from undesired heating effects. Gradiometric measurement is performed to greatly reduce the magnetic noise. With the phase calibration applied, the gradiometric measurement achieves 7-fold enhancement in magnetic-field sensitivity compared to the single channel and has a magnetic noise floor of 1.2 fT/Hz1/2. Our SERF magnetometer exhibits high sensitivity and is promising to realize ZULF NMR detection of samples with natural abundance. (c) 2024 The Authors.

TI Ab Initio Wavefunction Analysis of Electron Removal
   Quasi-Particle State of NdNiO2 With Fully Correlated Quantum
   Chemical Methods
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped infinite-layer NdNiO2 - a transition metal (TM) oxide that is both isostructural and isoelectronic to cuprate superconductors-has lead to renewed enthusiasm in the hope of understanding the origin of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we investigate the electron-removal states in infinite-layered Ni1+ oxide, NdNiO2, which mimics hole doping, with the state-of-the-art many-body multireference quantum chemistry methods. From the analysis of the many-body wavefunction we find that the hole-doped d(8) ground state of NdNiO2 is very different from the d(8) ground state in isostructural cuprate analog CaCuO2, although the parent d(9) ground states are for the most part identical. We show that the doped hole in NdNiO2 mainly localizes on the Ni 3d(x2-y2) orbital to form a closed-shell singlet, and this singlet configuration contributes to-40% of the wavefunction. In contrast, in CaCuO2 the Zhang-Rice singlet configurations contribute to-65% of the wavefunction. With the help of the quantum information concept of entanglement entropy, we quantify the different types of electronic correlations in the nickelate and cuprate compounds, and find that the dynamic radial-type correlations within the Ni d manifold are persistent in hole-doped NdNiO2. As a result, the d8 multiplet effects are stronger and the additional hole foot-print is more three-dimensional in NdNiO2. Our analysis shows that the most commonly used three-band Hubbard model employed to express the doped scenario in cuprates represents-90% of the d8 wavefunction for CaCuO2, but such a model grossly approximates the d(8) wavefunction for NdNiO2 as it only stands for-60% of the wavefunction.

TI Information Scrambling with Conservation Laws
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The delocalization or scrambling of quantum information has emerged as a central ingredient in the understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems. Recently, significant progress has been made analytically by modeling non-integrable systems as periodically driven systems, lacking a Hamiltonian picture, while honest Hamiltonian dynamics are frequently limited to small system sizes due to computational constraints. In this paper, we address this by investigating the role of conservation laws (including energy conservation) in the thermalization process from an information-theoretic perspective. For general non-integrable models, we use the equilibrium approximation to show that the maximal amount of information is scrambled (as measured by the tripartite mutual information of the time-evolution operator) at late times even when a system conserves energy. In contrast, we explicate how when a system has additional symmetries that lead to degeneracies in the spectrum, the amount of information scrambled must decrease. This general theory is exemplified in case studies of holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Due to the large Virasoro symmetry in 1+1D CFTs, we argue that, in a sense, these holographic theories are not maximally chaotic, which is explicitly seen by the non-saturation of the second Renyi tripartite mutual information. The roles of particle-hole and U(1) symmetries in the SYK model are milder due to the degeneracies being only two-fold, which we confirm explicitly at both large- and small-N. We reinterpret the operator entanglement in terms of the growth of local operators, connecting our results with the information scrambling described by out-of-time-ordered correlators, identifying the mechanism for suppressed scrambling from the Heisenberg perspective.

TI Electron nuclear interactions in spin-3/2 color centers in silicon
   carbide: A high-field pulse EPR and ENDOR study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB High-frequency pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (EN-DOR) were used to determine electron nuclear interactions on remote ligand shells of silicon and carbon in spin-3/2 color centers with an optically induced high-temperature spin alignment in hexagonal 4H-, 6H-, and rhombic 15R-silicon carbide (SiC) polytypes. The EPR and ENDOR experimental data relate unambiguously to spin-3/2 centers in which the optically induced alignment of the spin-level populations occurs. The identification is based on resolved ligand hyperfine interactions with carbon and silicon nearest, next-nearest, and the more distant neighbors and on the determination of the unpaired electron spin densities. The hyperfine interactions with Si-29 and C-13 nuclei are unambiguously separated due to the selective population of the fine-structure levels with certain values of M-s. The signs of these interactions and, as a result, the signs of oscillating spin density at Si-29 and C-13 nuclei, are determined. On the basis of the EPR and optically induced ENDOR measurements, signs of the fine-structure splitting for all the centers were demonstrated, which made it possible to establish the character of optically induced spin alignment, including the inverse populations of the spin levels for these centers. The values of hyperfine interaction with Si-29 and C-13 nuclei, including those remote from the localization of the spin-3/2 center, are tabulated, which can be used by a number of algorithms in quantum information processing as long-term memory.

TI First-principles studies of substituent effects on squaraine dyes
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Dye molecules that absorb light in the visible region are key components in many applications, including organic photovoltaics, biological fluorescent labeling, super-resolution microscopy, and energy transport. One family of dyes, known as squaraines, has received considerable attention recently due to their favorable electronic and photophysical properties. In addition, these dyes have a strong propensity for aggregation, which results in emergent materials properties, such as exciton delocalization. This will be of benefit in charge separation and energy transport along with fundamental studies in quantum information. Given the high structural tunability of squaraine dyes, it is possible that exciton delocalization could be tailored by modifying the substituents attached to the pi-conjugated network. To date, limited theoretical studies have explored the role of substituent effects on the electronic and photophysical properties of squaraines in the context of DNA-templated dye aggregates and resultant excitonic behavior. We used ab initio theoretical methods to determine the effects of substituents on the electronic and photophysical properties for a series of nine different squaraine dyes. Solvation free energy was also investigated as an insight into changes in hydrophobic behavior from substituents. The role of molecular symmetry on these properties was also explored via conformation and substitution. We found that substituent effects are correlated with the empirical Hammett constant, which demonstrates their electron donating or electron withdrawing strength. Electron withdrawing groups were found to impact solvation free energy, transition dipole moment, static dipole difference, and absorbance more than electron donating groups. All substituents showed a redshift in absorption for the squaraine dye. In addition, solvation free energy increases with Hammett constant. This work represents a first step toward establishing design rules for dyes with desired properties for excitonic applications.

TI A nano-scale design of arithmetic and logic unit for energy-efficient
   signal processing devices based on a quantum-based technology
SO CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND
   APPLICATIONS
AB Signal processing had a significant impact on the development of many elements of modern life, including telecommunications, education, healthcare, industry, and security. The semiconductor industry is the primary driver of signal processing innovation, producing ever-more sophisticated electronic devices and circuits in response to global demand. In addition, the central processing unit (CPU) is described as the "brain" of a computer or all electronic devices and signal processing. CPU is a critical electronic device that includes vital components such as memory, multiplier, adder, etc. Also, one of the essential components of the CPU is the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), which executes the arithmetic and logical operations within all types of CPU operations, such as addition, multiplication, and subtraction. However, delay, occupied areas, and energy consumption are essential parameters in ALU circuits. Since the recent ALU designs experienced problems like high delay, high occupied area, and high energy consumption, implementing electronic circuits based on new technology can significantly boost the performance of entire signal processing devices, including microcontrollers, microprocessors, and printed devices, with high-speed and low occupied space. Quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) is an effective technology for implementing all electronic circuits and signal processing applications to solve these shortcomings. It is a transistor-less nanotechnology being explored as a successor to established technologies like CMOS and VLSI due to its ultra-low power dissipation, high device density, fast operating speed in THz, and reduced circuit complexity. This research proposes a ground-breaking ALU that upgrades electrical devices such as microcontrollers by applying cutting-edge QCA nanotechnology. The primary goal is to offer a novel ALU architecture that fully utilizes the potential of QCA nanotechnology. Using a new and efficient approach, the fundamental gates are skillfully utilized with a coplanar layout based on a single cell not rotated. Furthermore, this work presents an enhanced 1-bit and 2-bit arithmetic logic unit in quantum dot cellular automata. The recommended design includes logic, arithmetic operations, full adder (FA) design, and multiplexers. Using the powerful simulation tools QCADesigner, all proposed designs are evaluated and verified. The simulation outcomes indicates that the suggested ALU has 42.48 and 64.28% improvements concerning cell count and total occupied area in comparison to the best earlier single-layer and multi-layer designs.

TI Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information and Quantum Markov
   Structure at Arbitrary Temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. Here, conditional mutual information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay with respect to distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with respect to the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been believed to hold for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the "entanglement Hamiltonian" or "Hamiltonian of mean force." As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the positive-partial-transpose class.

TI Library of single-etch silicon nitride grating couplers for low-loss and
   fabrication-robust fiber-chip interconnection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides become an appealing choice to realize complex photonic integrated circuits for applications in telecom/datacom transceivers, sensing, and quantum information sciences. However, compared to high-index-contrast silicon-on-insulator platform, the index difference between the Si3N4 waveguide core and its claddings is more moderate, which adversely affects the development of vertical grating-coupled optical interfaces. Si3N4 grating couplers suffer from the reduced strength, therefore it is more challenging to radiate all the waveguide power out of the grating within a beam size that is comparable to the mode field diameter of standard optical fibers. In this work, we present, by design and experiments, a library of low-loss and fabrication-tolerant surface grating couplers, operating at 1.55 mu m wavelength range and standard SMF-28 fiber. Our designs are fabricated on 400 nm Si3N4 platform using single-etch fabrication and foundry-compatible low-pressure chemical vapor deposition wafers. Experimentally, the peak coupling loss of - 4.4 dB and - 3.9 dB are measured for uniform couplers, while apodized grating couplers yield fiber-chip coupling loss of - 2.9 dB, without the use of bottom mirrors, additional overlays, and multi-layered grating arrangements. Beside the single-hero demonstrations, over 130 grating couplers were realized and tested, showing an excellent agreement with finite difference time domain designs and fabrication-robust performance. Demonstrated grating couplers are promising for Si3N4 photonic chip prototyping by using standard optical fibers, leveraging low-cost and foundry-compatible fabrication technologies, essential for stable and reproducible large-volume device development.

TI Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Physical Properties, Hydride Vapor-Phase
   Epitaxy Growth of Large-Diameter Quasi-Bulk Wafers and Applications
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), with its ultrawide bandgap and 2D structure, holds an immense promise for advanced semiconductor applications. Scaling bulk crystals to large-diameter wafers, crucial for complex device fabrication, remains a challenge with high temperature, high pressure, and metal flux solution methods. To address this, recent efforts have focused on hydride vapor-phase epitaxy (HVPE) for producing large diameter thick h-BN quasi-bulk wafers, reaching hundreds of micrometers. These HVPE-grown quasi-bulk crystals exhibit excellent c-axis long-range order. Notably, the in-plane mobility-lifetime products for both electrons and holes surpass 10(-4) cm(2) V-1, which are two orders of magnitude greater than the out-of-plane (vertical) values, highlighting the potential for high-performance devices leveraging superior lateral transport. Lateral detectors fabricated from 100 mu m thick B-10 enriched h-BN wafers have achieved a record 60% thermal neutron detection efficiency. Based on its physical properties, h-BN appears to be an outstanding material of choice for light-triggered electronic power switches capable of supporting high-voltage and high-power operations. These recent advancements in large-diameter h-BN quasi-bulk crystal growth, enabled by HVPE, pave the way for applications spanning deep UV photonics, high-power electronics, high-efficiency neutron detection, and quantum information technologies, establishing h-BN as both a versatile active semiconductor and an ideal substrate.

TI Electronic Spin Relaxation and Clustering in High-Pressure
   High-Temperature Synthesized Microcrystalline Diamond Particles with
   Reduced Nitrogen Content
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) color center in diamonds is widely studied because of numerous applications of this unique quantum system in sensing and quantum information sciences. While substitutional nitrogen is required to form the NV- centers in diamond, it also yields other paramagnetic defects-primarily the neutrally charged substitutional nitrogen centers (P1)-that decrease NV- spin coherence, which in turn degrades performance in applications. Herein, we investigate high-pressure high-temperature synthesized diamond microparticles (ca. 140-185 mu m) having lower-ranging from 3 to 38 ppm-than the typical nitrogen content of type 1b diamond (ca. 100 ppm and higher) typically used for the production of fluorescent diamond particles with NV- centers. A suite of electron paramagnetic resonance, optically detected magnetic resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods are used to characterize spin properties of P1 and NV- centers in the particles. Upon decreasing the nitrogen content from 29 to 3 ppm, the ensemble NV-T2 relaxation time increased by about 3-fold as measured directly in the Hahn Echo experiment at magnetic field of 1.2 T. Analysis of electronic relaxation of P1 centers revealed the existence of at least two distinct populations of P1 centers, consisting of fast and slower relaxing spins and allowed for an estimation of local concentrations. Even with <10 ppm nitrogen contents, the analysis indicated a highly heterogeneous distribution of P1 centers, suggesting the possibility of P1 spin clustering even at low nitrogen concentrations. The combined data demonstrate that the particles prepared from HPHT diamond with a low nitrogen content offer improved spin properties that are beneficial for NV- sensing applications.

TI Endohedral metallofullerene molecular nanomagnets
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Magnetic lanthanide (Ln) metal complexes exhibiting magnetic bistability can behave as molecular nanomagnets, also known as single-molecule magnets (SMMs), suitable for storing magnetic information at the molecular level, thus attracting extensive interest in the quest for high-density information storage and quantum information technologies. Upon encapsulating Ln ion(s) into fullerene cages, endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) have been proven as a promising and versatile platform to realize chemically robust SMMs, in which the magnetic properties are able to be readily tailored by altering the configurations of the encapsulated species and the host cages. In this review, we present critical discussions on the molecular structures and magnetic characterizations of EMF-SMMs, with the focus on their peculiar molecular and electronic structures and on the intriguing molecular magnetism arising from such structural uniqueness. In this context, different families of magnetic EMFs are summarized, including mononuclear EMF-SMMs wherein single-ion anisotropy is decisive, dinuclear clusterfullerenes whose magnetism is governed by intramolecular magnetic interaction, and radical-bridged dimetallic EMFs with high-spin ground states that arise from the strong ferromagnetic coupling. We then discuss how molecular assemblies of SMMs can be constructed, in a way that the original SMM behavior is either retained or altered in a controlled manner, thanks to the chemical robustness of EMFs. Finally, on the basis of understanding the structure-magnetic property correlation, we propose design strategies for high-performance EMF-SMMs by engineering ligand fields, electronic structures, magnetic interactions, and molecular vibrations that can couple to the spin states.
   This review summarizes the significant advances in endohedral metallofullerene-based molecular nanomagnets, with a particular emphasis on their unique structures and intriguing magnetic properties arising from such structural peculiarity.

TI Miniaturized superconducting single-photon detection system for airborne
   platform
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Facing the demand for applications such as wide-area terrain mapping and space-based atmospheric measurements, there is an urgent need to develop miniaturized single-photon detection systems with low power consumption that can be adapted to airborne platforms. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have been applied to quantum information, bioimaging, deep space communication and long-range lidar with the advantages of high quantum efficiency, low dark count rate and fast detection rate. However, traditional SNSPD usually operates at 2.1 K or even lower, and the required cryogenic systems are large in size and weight, which are not easy to apply to airborne platforms. Up to now, there has been no report on SNSPD applied to airborne platforms. How to apply SNSPD to airborne platforms is an urgent problem to be solved.In this work, we design and make an SNSPD with an operating temperature of 4.2 K. The superconducting detector chip is a four-channel photon-number-resolving device with a photosensitive area of 60 gm x 60 gm, which is coupled to a 200-gm-diameter fiber by a beam compression system with a quantum efficiency of 50% at 1064 nm and a temperature of 4.2 K. Finally, the time characteristics of a single channel are tested in response to different photon numbers. The timing jitter of four-photon response is smallest, and the half-height width is 110 ps. This work not only supports airborne applications, but also has positive implications for promoting the development of general-purpose miniaturized SNSPD systems and their applications.

TI Subradiance and superradiant long-range excitation transport among
   quantum emitter ensembles in a waveguide
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB In contrast to free space, in waveguides the dispersive and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions among quantum emitters exhibit a periodic behavior over remarkably long distances. We propose a novel setup, to our knowledge, exploiting this long-range periodicity in order to create highly excited subradiant states and facilitate fast controlled collective energy transport among far-apart ensembles coupled to a waveguide. For sufficiently large ensembles, collective superradiant emission into the fiber modes dominates over its free space counterpart. We show that, for a large number of emitters, a fast transverse coherent pulse can create almost perfect subradiant states with up to 50 degrees lc excitation. On the other hand, for a coherent excitation of one sub-ensemble above an overall excitation fraction of 50 degrees lc we find a nearly lossless and fast energy transfer to the ground state sub-ensemble. This transport can be enhanced or suppressed by controlling the positions of the ensembles relative to each other, while it can also be realized with a random position distribution. In the optimally enhanced case this fast transfer appears as superradiant emission with subsequent superabsorption, yet, without a superradiant decay after the absorption. The highly excited subradiant states, as well as the superradiant excitation transfer, appear as suitable building blocks in applications such as active atomic clocks, quantum batteries, quantum information protocols, and quantum metrology procedures such as fiber-based Ramsey schemes.

TI Entanglement of edge modes in (very) strongly correlated topological
   insulators
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Identifying topological phases for a strongly correlated theory remains a non-trivial task, as defining order parameters, such as Berry phases, is not straightforward. Quantum information theory is capable of identifying topological phases for a theory that exhibits quantum phase transition with a suitable definition of order parameters that are related to different entanglement measures for the system. In this work, we study entanglement entropy for a coupled SSH model, both in the presence and absence of Hubbard interaction and at varying interaction strengths. For the free theory, edge entanglement acts as an order parameter, which is supported by analytic calculations and numerical (DMRG) studies. We calculate the symmetry-resolved entanglement and demonstrate the equipartition of entanglement for this model which itself acts as an order parameter when calculated for the edge modes. As the DMRG calculation allows one to go beyond the free theory, we study the entanglement structure of the edge modes in the presence of on-site Hubbard interaction for the same model. A sudden reduction of edge entanglement is obtained as interaction is switched on. The explanation for this lies in the change in the size of the degenerate subspaces in the presence and absence of interaction. We also study the signature of entanglement when the interaction strength becomes extremely strong and demonstrate that the edge entanglement remains protected. In this limit, the energy eigenstates essentially become a tensor product state, implying zero entanglement. However, a remnant entropy survives in the non-trivial topological phase, which is exactly due to the entanglement of the edge modes.

TI Enhancing Environmental DNA Sampling Efficiency for Cetacean Detection
   on Whale Watching Tours
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DNA
AB Monitoring cetaceans is essential for evaluating ecosystem health and informing the establishment of marine protected areas. Conventional cetacean monitoring techniques, such as photo-identification, acoustic surveys, and satellite tagging, are often resource-intensive, costly, and sometimes intrusive. Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based methods have emerged as non-invasive, cost-efficient complements based on the analysis of genetic material shed into the environment. However, eDNA research is still evolving, with ongoing efforts to optimize field sampling and laboratory protocols. Building on the challenges of conventional monitoring methods, this study sought to refine eDNA sampling parameters to offer a more efficient and scalable approach for cetacean research, leveraging citizen science platforms. From June to October 2023, eDNA samples were collected across three regions in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea aboard whale-watching vessels or monitoring platforms engaging citizen scientists. Samples were analyzed for total DNA concentration using Qubit fluorometry and target DNA concentration with quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). Key variables tested in the field included water volume (2, 5, and 10 L), sampling timing (immediately after a whale was present and at 5-, 10-, and 20-min intervals), and three filter types (pore sizes of 1.2, 0.8, and 0.45 mu m). Our results illustrate that larger water volumes (10 L), sampling immediately after a whale breach or fluking behavior, and Smith-Root eDNA filters (1.2 mu m pore size) significantly increased eDNA detection probability and signal strength. However, the combination of certain filter types with different water volumes had a significant impact on detection probability, with smaller pore sizes more effectively yielding detections with a lower water volume. These findings provide guidance for future cetacean research initiatives and highlight the potential of eDNA methods in enhancing research and conservation efforts through scalable citizen science-based initiatives.

TI Multi-Strategy Enhanced Slime Mould Algorithm for Optimization Problems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The slime mould algorithm (SMA) simulates the mechanism by which slime moulds optimize paths through chemical signaling and morphological changes, enabling efficient exploration and exploitation of the solution space. While SMA is simple and flexible, it faces challenges such as slow convergence and a tendency to become trapped in local optima. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an enhanced algorithm that integrates bloch sphere-based Elite Population Initialization with an adaptive search operator strategy based on cauchy inverse cumulative distribution(QCMSMA). The proposed algorithm employs a Bloch sphere-based elite population initialization strategy, which utilizes quantum state mapping to enhance diversity and incorporates elite selection to guarantee high-quality initial solutions, ultimately improving optimization performance. An adaptive search operator leveraging the Cauchy inverse cumulative distribution is employed to dynamically adjust step sizes, improving exploration and efficiency. Additionally, a local Gaussian perturbation mutation strategy is incorporated to mitigate the risk of premature convergence to local optima. The QCMSMA algorithm was rigorously evaluated using 23 benchmark functions and the CEC2017 test suite. Comparative analysis against several well-known optimization algorithms was performed, accompanied by statistical assessments using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Friedman ranking analysis. Specifically, QCMSMA ranked first in overall performance compared to the other algorithms. Experimental results indicate that QCMSMA consistently outperforms its counterparts in terms of optimization efficiency, convergence speed, and stability. Finally, the algorithm was applied to a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning problem, where QCMSMA achieved the best optimization performance compared to other algorithms, ranking first in terms of solution quality.

TI Two-dimensional superconductors with intrinsic p-wave pairing or
   nontrivial band topology
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Over the past fifteen years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to realizing topological superconductivity in realistic materials and systems, predominately propelled by their promising application potentials in fault-tolerant quantum information processing. In this article, we attempt to give an overview on some of the main developments in this field, focusing in particular on two-dimensional crystalline superconductors that possess either intrinsic p-wave pairing or nontrivial band topology. We first classify the three different conceptual schemes to achieve topological superconductor (TSC), enabled by real-space superconducting proximity effect, reciprocal-space superconducting proximity effect, and intrinsic TSC. Whereas the first scheme has so far been most extensively explored, the subtle difference between the other two remains to be fully substantiated. We then move on to candidate intrinsic or p-wave superconductors, including Sr2RuO4,UTe2,Pb3Bi, and graphene-based systems. For TSC systems that rely on proximity effects, the emphases are mainly on the coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial band topology, as exemplified by transition metal dichalcogenides, cobalt pnictides, and stanene, all in monolayer or few-layer regime. The review completes with discussions on the three dominant tuning schemes of strain, gating, and ferroelectricity in acquiring one or both essential ingredients of the TSC, and optimizations of such tuning capabilities may prove to be decisive in our drive towards braiding of Majorana zero modes and demonstration of topological qubits.

TI A new statistical thermodynamic mechanism for quantum mechanics
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB A new quantum mechanics mechanism theory based on statistical mechanics is introduced. This theory is based on corresponding changes in the number of states with associated energy changes at the observer and observed occurring at observer 1) reset and 2) observation. It is shown that a) the change in the number of states has different consequences than determining the "value " obtained at observation, where each state is a possible interaction between the system and the environment. The number of bits, as a measure of information content, is determined in discrete cell size increments. Two experiments are proposed to validate the introduced mechanism. The first experiment is to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of energy changes and how they are related to the observer and observed during the entire measurement process. The second experiment is designed to determine timing between changes in the number of states in the system at observer reset. It is anticipated that these experiments will demonstrate no time delay, an entangled process, and, hence, explain delayed choice observations. Moreover, they would demonstrate that bits not stored in the system are transferred to the environment at observer reset, so when the number of inputs is greater than the number of outputs, an energy change occurs and interference is observed (wave characteristics). Conversely, if the number of inputs equals the number of outputs, no energy change occurs and no interference is observed (particle characteristics). It is envisioned that upon validating this mechanism theory, it will further the understanding of the measurement process and entanglement's involvement in that process.

TI Sewing spacetime with Lorentzian threads: complexity and the emergence
   of time in quantum gravity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Holographic entanglement entropy was recently recast in terms of Riemannian flows or 'bit threads'. We consider the Lorentzian analog to reformulate the 'complexity-volume' conjecture using Lorentzian flows - timelike vector fields whose minimum flux through a boundary subregion is equal to the volume of the homologous maximal bulk Cauchy slice. By the nesting of Lorentzian flows, holographic complexity is shown to obey a number of properties. Particularly, the rate of complexity is bounded below by conditional complexity, describing a multi-step optimization with intermediate and final target states. We provide multiple explicit geometric realizations of Lorentzian flows in AdS backgrounds, including their time-dependence and behavior near the singularity in a black hole interior. Conceptually, discretized flows are interpreted as Lorentzian threads or tatelines'. Upon selecting a reference state, complexity thence counts the minimum number of gatelines needed to prepare a target state described by a tensor network discretizing the maximal volume slice, matching its quantum information theoretic definition. We point out that suboptimal tensor networks are important to fully characterize the state, leading us to propose a refined notion of complexity as an ensemble average. The bulk symplectic potential provides a specific 'canonical' thread configuration characterizing perturbations around arbitrary CFT states. Consistency of this solution requires the bulk satisfy the linearized Einstein's equations, which are shown to be equivalent to the holographic first law of complexity, thereby advocating for a principle of 'spacetime complexity'. Lastly, we argue Lorentzian threads provide a notion of emergent time. This article is an expanded and detailed version of [1], including several new results.

TI Influence of Water Polarization Caused by Phonon Resonance on Catalytic
   Activity of Enolase
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Enolase is a conservative protein. Its cellular enzymatic activity catalyzes the conversion of 2-phospho-D-glycerate (2-PGA) to a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) product in the glycolysis pathway. This enzyme also has a multifunctional nature participating in several biological processes. This work aims to determine the effect of water polarization on the catalytic activity of enolase. The experiments have been set based on the concept that water, a polar dielectric, may undergo the phenomenon of electric polarization, decreasing its configurational and vibrational entropy. Prior to the reaction, the 2-PGA substrate was incubated for 5 h in the glass cuvette with an attached chip-inductor. The latter device was designed to transfer quantum information about a given quantum state from the quantum state generator to water by a phonon resonance. Then, such substrate samples preincubated with the chip-inductor were removed every hour in a separate quartz cuvette with the enzyme to determine its catalytic activity. The influence of the chip-inductor on the preincubated substrate resulted in an increase in the catalytic activity of enolase by 30% compared to the control substrate, not preincubated with the chip-inductor. This suggests that the catalytic activity of the enzyme is augmented when the substrate was primed by chip-inductors. In another kind of experiment, wherein enolase was exposed to methylglyoxal modification, the catalytic activity of the enzyme dropped to 71.7%, while the same enzyme glycated with methylglyoxal primed by chip-inductors restored its activity by 8.4%. This shows the protective effect of chip-inductors on enolase activity despite the harmful effect of methylglyoxal on the protein.

TI Isolation of Elusive Fluoflavine Radicals in Two Differing Oxidation
   States
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Facile access and switchability between multiple oxidation states are key properties of many catalytic applications and spintronic devices yet poorly understood due to inherent complications arising from isolating a redox system in multiple oxidation states without drastic structural changes. Here, we present the first isolable, free fluoflavine (flv) radical flv((1-center dot)) as a bottleable potassium compound, [K(crypt-222)](flv(center dot)), and a new series of organometallic rare earth complexes [(Cp*Y-2)(2)(mu-flvz)]X, (where Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, X = [Al(OC{CF3}(3))(4)](-) (z = -1), 2; X = 0 (z = -2), 3; [K(crypt-222)](+) (z = -3), 4) comprising the flv ligand in three different oxidation states, two of which are paramagnetic flv(1-center dot) and flv(3-center dot). Excitingly, 1, 2, and 4 constitute the first isolable flv1(-center dot) and flv(3-center dot) radical complexes and, to date, the only isolated flv radicals of any oxidation state. All compounds are accessible in good crystalline yields and were unambiguously characterized via single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, cyclic voltammetry, IR-, UV-vis, and variable-temperature EPR spectroscopy. Remarkably, the EPR spectra for 1, 2, and 4 are distinct and a testament to stronger spin delocalization onto the metal centers as a function of higher charge on the flv radical. In-depth analysis of the electron- and spin density via density functional theory (DFT) calculations utilizing NLMO, QTAIM, and spin density topology analysis confirmed the fundamental interplay of metal coordination, ligand oxidation state, aromaticity, covalency, and spin density transfer, which may serve as blueprints for the development of future spintronic devices, single-molecule magnets, and quantum information science at large.

TI Determining the key vibrations for spin relaxation in ruffled Cu(II)
   porphyrins via resonance Raman spectroscopy
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Pinpointing vibrational mode contributions to electron spin relaxation (T-1) constitutes a key goal for developing molecular quantum bits (qubits) with long room-temperature coherence times. However, there remains no consensus to date as to the energy and symmetry of the relevant modes that drive relaxation. Here, we analyze a series of three geometrically-tunable S = 1/2 Cu(ii) porphyrins with varying degrees of ruffling distortion in the ground state. Theoretical calculations predict that increased distortion should activate low-energy ruffling modes (similar to 50 cm(-1)) for spin-phonon coupling, thereby causing faster spin relaxation in distorted porphyrins. However, experimental T-1 times do not follow the degree of ruffling, with the highly distorted copper tetraisopropylporphyrin (CuTiPP) even displaying room-temperature coherence. Local mode fitting indicates that the true vibrations dominating T-1 lie in the energy regime of bond stretches (similar to 200-300 cm(-1)), which are comparatively insensitive to the degree of ruffling. We employ resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy to determine vibrational modes possessing both the correct energy and symmetry to drive spin-phonon coupling. The rR spectra uncover a set of mixed symmetric stretch vibrations from 200-250 cm(-1) that explain the trends in temperature-dependent T-1. These results indicate that molecular spin-phonon coupling models systematically overestimate the contribution of ultra-low-energy distortion modes to T-1, pointing out a key deficiency of existing theory. Furthermore, this work highlights the untapped power of rR spectroscopy as a tool for building spin dynamics structure-property relationships in molecular quantum information science.

TI Nonlocal Finite-Depth Circuits for Constructing Symmetry-Protected
   Topological States and Quantum Cellular Automata
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Whether a given target state can be prepared by starting with a simple product state and acting with a finite-depth quantum circuit is a key question in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. It underpins classifications of topological phases, as well as the understanding of topological quantum codes, and has obvious relevance for device implementations. Traditionally, this question assumes that the quantum circuit is made up of unitary gates that are geometrically local. Inspired by the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we reconsider this question with k-local gates, i.e., gates that act on no more than k degrees of freedom but are not restricted to be geometrically local. First, we construct explicit finite-depth circuits of symmetric k-local gates that create symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states from an initial product state. Our construction applies to SPT states protected by global symmetries or subsystem symmetries but not to those with higher-form symmetries, which we conjecture remain nontrivial. Next, we show how to implement arbitrary translationally invariant quantum cellular automata in any dimension using finite-depth circuits of k-local gates. These results imply that the topological classifications of SPT phases and quantum cellular automata both collapse to a single trivial phase in the presence of k-local interactions. We furthermore argue that SPT phases are fragile to generic k-local symmetric perturbations. We conclude by discussing the implications for other phases, such as fracton phases, and surveying future directions. Our analysis opens a new experimentally motivated conceptual direction examining the stability of phases and the feasibility of state preparation without the assumption of geometric locality.

TI Effect of ultrathin layer of MoS2 on resonance mode coupling
   and hybridization of AlGaAs nanoscale Mie-resonator: a simulation study
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB light-matter interactions, specifically the interaction between Mie resonance modes originated from all-dielectric nano-resonators and exciton modes from the semiconducting transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDCs) recently become an important field of study due to its application in nanophotonic devices and quantum information processing. Here, we performed finite element method (FEM) based numerical simulations on isolated Al x Ga(1-x)As (x: alloy composition) core - MoS2 ultrathin nanoshell, to study the interaction between Optical Mie resonance modes and exciton modes. The interaction between magnetic dipole (MD) modes originated from the Mie-active dielectric core and excitonic response from the thin semiconductor nano-shell takes place and appears as resonance mode coupling and hybridization in the scattering efficiency spectra. The resultant spectrum was elucidated using a semi-classical coupled mode theoretical model (CMT) and the coupling constant value was estimated, followed by the evaluation of anti-crossing spectral behavior and Rabi splitting. Furthermore, we found that all the properties of the spectrum or the resonance coupling are sensitive to the core radius, alloy composition of the core, shell thickness, and the refractive index of the surrounding medium. By systematically tailoring these parameters, one can tune the quenching dip or line width of the resonance modes. The insights from these simulations not only provided the basis for fundamental research on strong nanoscale light-matter interaction but will also be quite beneficial in fabricating high-efficiency optoelectronic and smart nanophotonic devices related to photon-exciton interactions.

TI Laser wavelength extension beyond 1.1 μm in Nd:MgO:LiNbO3 crystal by
   utilizing the Stark splitting of multiple Nd3+-doping sites
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Lithium niobate crystal is an important multifunctional material and the miniaturization of the integrated on-chip LiNbO3 laser device has attracted the increased attention in optoelectronic systems. Especially in the field of quantum information, rare-earth doped LiNbO3 (e.g. Nd:LiNbO3) crystal become one of the optimal choice for the active devices and laser generation. However, at present, Nd:LiNbO3 crystal suffers from low conversion efficiency and the limited lasing wavelength due to the discrete Stark energy levels of Nd3+ ion. Herein, we proposed a multiple-site doping strategy to enrich the Stark splitting levels of Nd:LiNbO3 laser crystals. Benefitting from the strong inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening effect, a broad fluorescence emission beyond 1.1 mu m was realized in Nd:MgO:LiNbO3 crystal. Via a rational cavity design to suppress the lasing oscillation at 1.07-1.09 mu m and amplify the weak fluorescence at long wavelength, we successfully achieved the efficient continuous-wave lasing at 1104 nm, 1108 nm, 1111 nm, and 1114 nm, respectively, corresponding to the electronic transitions (R1 -> Y4, Y5, Y6) at two different Nd3+ sites. The highest laser power at 1.1 mu m was 1.41 W with a slope efficiency of 20.6%. Moreover, a tunable laser generation from 1103 to 1115 nm was also realized in Nd:MgO:LiNbO3 for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this result represents the first Nd:MgO:LiNbO3 laser operating beyond 1.1 mu m, indicating its great potential for optical applications in on-chip lithium niobate devices.

TI Non-uniform magnetic fields for single-electron control
SO NANOSCALE
AB Controlling single-electron states becomes increasingly important due to the wide-ranging advances in electron quantum optics. Single-electron control enables coherent manipulation of individual electrons and the ability to exploit the wave nature of electrons, which offers various opportunities for quantum information processing, sensing, and metrology. Here we explore non-uniform magnetic fields, which offer unique mechanisms for single-electron control. Considering the modeling perspective, conventional electron quantum transport theories are commonly based on gauge-dependent electromagnetic potentials. A direct formulation in terms of intuitive electromagnetic fields is thus not possible. In an effort to rectify this, a gauge-invariant formulation of the Wigner equation for general electromagnetic fields has been proposed [M. Nedjalkov et al., Phys. Rev. B, 2019, 99, 014423]. However, the complexity of this equation requires the derivation of a more convenient formulation for linear electromagnetic fields [M. Nedjalkov et al., Phys. Rev. A, 2022, 106, 052213]. This formulation directly includes the classical formulation of the Lorentz force and higher-order terms, depending on the magnetic field gradient, that are negligible for small variations of the magnetic field. In this work, we generalize this equation in order to include a general, non-uniform electric field and a linear, non-uniform magnetic field. The thus obtained formulation has been applied to investigate the capabilities of a linear, non-uniform magnetic field to control single-electron states in terms of trajectory, interference patterns, and dispersion. This has led to the exploration of a new type of transport inside electronic waveguides based on snake trajectories and the possibility of splitting wavepackets to realize edge states.
   Our work investigates mechanisms for single-electron control based on non-uniform magnetic fields. Such fields can give rise to specific patterns such as snake trajectories and edge states, which characterize the electron evolution.

TI A wideband, high-resolution vector spectrum analyzer for integrated
   photonics
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The analysis of optical spectra-emission or absorption-has been arguably the most powerful approach for discovering and understanding matter. The invention and development of many kinds of spectrometers have equipped us with versatile yet ultra-sensitive diagnostic tools for trace gas detection, isotope analysis, and resolving hyperfine structures of atoms and molecules. With proliferating data and information, urgent and demanding requirements have been placed today on spectrum analysis with ever-increasing spectral bandwidth and frequency resolution. These requirements are especially stringent for broadband laser sources that carry massive information and for dispersive devices used in information processing systems. In addition, spectrum analyzers are expected to probe the device's phase response where extra information is encoded. Here we demonstrate a novel vector spectrum analyzer (VSA) that is capable of characterizing passive devices and active laser sources in one setup. Such a dual-mode VSA can measure loss, phase response, and dispersion properties of passive devices. It also can coherently map a broadband laser spectrum into the RF domain. The VSA features a bandwidth of 55.1 THz (1260-1640 nm), a frequency resolution of 471 kHz, and a dynamic range of 56 dB. Meanwhile, our fiber-based VSA is compact and robust. It requires neither high-speed modulators and photodetectors nor any active feedback control. Finally, we employ our VSA for applications including characterization of integrated dispersive waveguides, mapping frequency comb spectra, and coherent light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Our VSA presents an innovative approach for device analysis and laser spectroscopy, and can play a critical role in future photonic systems and applications for sensing, communication, imaging, and quantum information processing.

TI Control of excitation selectivity in pulse EPR on spin-correlated
   radical pairs with shaped pulses
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Spin-correlated radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer are characterised by a distinctive spin polarisation and a unique behaviour in pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Under non-selective excitation, an out-of-phase echo signal modulated by the dipolar and exchange coupling interactions characterising the radical pair is observed and allows extraction of geometric information in the two-pulse out-of-phase electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiment. The investigation of the role of spin-correlated radical pairs in a variety of biological processes and in the fundamental mechanisms underlying device function in optoelectronics, as well as their potential use in quantum information science, relies on the ability to precisely address and manipulate the spins using microwave pulses. Here, we explore the use of shaped pulses for controlled narrowband selective and broadband non-selective excitation of spin-correlated radical pairs in two model donor-bridge-acceptor triads, characterised by different spectral widths, at X- and Q-band frequencies. We demonstrate selective excitation with close to rectangular excitation profiles using BURP (band-selective, uniform response, pure-phase) pulses and complete non-selective excitation of both spins of the radical pair using frequency-swept chirp pulses. The use of frequency-swept pulses in out-of-phase ESEEM experiments enables increased modulation depths and, combined with echo transient detection and Fourier transformation, correlation of the dipolar frequencies with the EPR spectrum and therefore the potential to extract additional information on the donor-acceptor pair geometry.
   This study explores the advantages and limitations of shaped narrowband and broadband excitation pulses in EPR spectroscopy on spin-correlated radical pairs, including chirp out-of-phase ESEEM.

TI Symmetry Breaking Charge Transfer in DNA-Templated Perylene Dimer
   Aggregates
SO MOLECULES
AB Molecular aggregates are of interest to a broad range of fields including light harvesting, organic optoelectronics, and nanoscale computing. In molecular aggregates, nonradiative decay pathways may emerge that were not present in the constituent molecules. Such nonradiative decay pathways may include singlet fission, excimer relaxation, and symmetry-breaking charge transfer. Singlet fission, sometimes referred to as excitation multiplication, is of great interest to the fields of energy conversion and quantum information. For example, endothermic singlet fission, which avoids energy loss, has been observed in covalently bound, linear perylene trimers and tetramers. In this work, the electronic structure and excited-state dynamics of dimers of a perylene derivative templated using DNA were investigated. Specifically, DNA Holliday junctions were used to template the aggregation of two perylene molecules covalently linked to a modified uracil nucleobase through an ethynyl group. The perylenes were templated in the form of monomer, transverse dimer, and adjacent dimer configurations. The electronic structure of the perylene monomers and dimers were characterized via steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Initial insights into their excited-state dynamics were gleaned from relative fluorescence intensity measurements, which indicated that a new nonradiative decay pathway emerges in the dimers. Femtosecond visible transient absorption spectroscopy was subsequently used to elucidate the excited-state dynamics. A new excited-state absorption feature grows in on the tens of picosecond timescale in the dimers, which is attributed to the formation of perylene anions and cations resulting from symmetry-breaking charge transfer. Given the close proximity required for symmetry-breaking charge transfer, the results shed promising light on the prospect of singlet fission in DNA-templated molecular aggregates.

TI Nested-sphere description of the N-level Chern number and the
   generalized Bloch hypersphere
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The geometric interpretation of (pseudo)spin-1/2 systems on the Bloch sphere has been appreciated across different areas ranging from condensed matter to quantum information and high-energy physics. Although similar notions for larger Hilbert spaces are established in mathematics, they have been so far less explored beyond the two-level case for practical usage in condensed matter settings, or have involved restrictions to sub manifolds within the full Hilbert space. We here employ a coherence vector description to theoretically characterize a general N-level system on the higher dimensional generalized Bloch (hyper)sphere by respecting the structure of the underlying SU(N) algebra and construct physically intuitive geometric pictures for topological concepts. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, we reveal a geometric interpretation for the Chern number in larger Hilbert spaces in terms of a nested structure comprising N - 1 two-spheres. We demonstrate that for the N-level case, there is an exterior two-sphere that provides a useful characterization of the system, notably by playing a primary role in determining the Chern number. The external sphere can be directly measured in ultracold atoms via well-established band mapping techniques, thereby imparting knowledge of the topological nature of state. We also investigate how the time evolution of the coherence vector defined on the generalized Bloch hypersphere can be utilized to extract the full state vector in experiments, allowing us to develop a tomography scheme involving quenches for three-level systems. Our geometric description opens up another avenue for the interpretation of the topological classification and the dynamical illustration of multilevel systems, which in turn is anticipated to help in the design of new experimental probes.

TI Advances in structured light lasers
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Structured light refers to light fields that are specially customized by manipulating their properties across multiple physical dimensions, demonstrating immense potential in applications such as optical communications, precision measurement, advanced imaging, and quantum information. Structured light lasers, capable of directly generating light fields with complex spatial distributions, polarization states, and topological structures, provide efficient and versatile tools for light field manipulation and its applications. Unlike structured light generation techniques that rely on external modulation, structured light lasers achieve compact and high-quality structured light output through direct intracavity control, significantly enhancing system integration and efficiency. This review summarizes the latest research progress in structured light lasers, exploring their fundamental principles, design methodologies, and applications. It introduces the basic concepts of structured light, including typical structured beams such as vortex beams, vector beams, and propagation-invariant beams, as well as more complex topological and quantum structures like optical skyrmions, non-separable states, and ray-wave duality. The review elaborates on the categories of high-dimensional structured light lasers, covering design schemes such as on-cavity structures and intracavity geometries, and provides insight into different architectures ranging from free-space and fiber-based systems to integrated devices. We also discuss the broad applications and future prospects of structured light lasers, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field. This review aims to serve as a resource for researchers who seek to design and develop structured light lasers, as well as for those looking to harness their potential to drive innovation in photonic techniques.

TI Influence of particle size and dielectric environment on radiative
   lifetimes of colloidal cadmium selenide single photon emitters
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB High repetition rate single-photon emitters are essential for all-optical quantum information processing, communications and metrology. The spontaneous emission lifetimes of colloidal cadmium selenide quantum dots are typically of the order of 10 ns, severely limiting their brightness and therefore their potential applications in quantum devices. Here we report on single-photon emission at room temperature with nanosecond lifetime from cadmium selenide quantum dots embedded in a polymer matrix. The study shows that the emission lifetime can be tuned by appropriately choosing the particle size and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. The quantum dots are synthesized using a green synthesis protocol and surface passivated using oleic acid. A Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup attached to an in-house constructed confocal microscope is used to efficiently couple and characterize the single-photon emission from an array of quantum dots. Detailed analysis of the second-order correlation function (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$g<^>{(2)}(\tau )$$\end{document}) of single-photon emission from cadmium selenide quantum dots reveals the particle-size dependence of emission lifetimes. The study also shows that the quality of single-photon emission, as revealed by \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$g<^>{(2)}(0)$$\end{document}, reduces with increasing particle-size in the strongly confined regime.

TI Efficient representation of Gaussian fermionic pure states in
   noncomputational bases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper introduces an innovative approach for representing Gaussian fermionic states, pivotal in quantum spin systems and fermionic models, within a range of alternative quantum bases. We focus on transitioning these states from the conventional computational sigma z basis to more complex bases, such as (phi, pi 2 , alpha), which are essential for accurately calculating critical quantities like formation probabilities and Shannon entropy. Our methodology can be advantageous in quantum quench studies and quantum tomography, where alternative basis representations significantly enhance optimization processes. We present an algorithm that not only simplifies the basis transformation, but also reduces computational complexity, making it feasible to calculate amplitudes of large systems efficiently. Our key contribution is a technique that translates amplitude calculations into the Pfaffian computation of submatrices from an antisymmetric matrix, a process facilitated by understanding domain wall relationships across different bases. As an application, we will determine the formation probabilities for various bases and configurations within the critical transverse field Ising chain, considering both periodic and open boundary conditions. We aim to categorize the configurations and bases by examining the universal constant term that characterizes the scaling of the logarithm of the formation probability in the periodic system, as well as the coefficient of the logarithmic term in the case of open systems. In the open system scenario, this coefficient is influenced by the central charge and the conformal weight of the boundary condition-changing operator. This work is set to expand the toolkit available for researchers in quantum information theory and many-body physics, providing a more efficient and elegant solution for exploring Gaussian fermionic states in nonstandard quantum bases.

TI Collective photon emission in solid state environments: Concatenating
   non-Markovian and Markovian dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Collective light emission and multiqubit dynamics of solid-state quantum emitters are affected both by their coupling to the light field and to lattice vibrations. The effect of phonons on quantum emitters is twofold: polaron formation is described by ultrafast non-Markovian dynamics, while slower dephasing is well described by exponential decay. Of the two temperature-dependent processes, the effect of the former on the collective emission and the entanglement decay of emitters is usually not modeled, and also the latter is sometimes neglected. Here we propose and compare two methods that are efficient also for several emitters: the first method concatenates the fast and slow phonon dynamics, and the second is the polaron method. For a single quantum emitter, we show that the dynamical equations are identical in both methods, while predictions for two or more emitters also agree very well. Both of our methods incorporate non-Markovian dynamics due to phonons demonstrating the temperature sensitivity of the collective photon emission. Utilizing a simplified Markovian model instead may not be accurate enough especially for quantum information applications: for example, we show how the Markovian model may considerably overestimate the two-emitter concurrence, except at very low temperatures. Our concatenation and polaron methods can be applied to an arbitrary number and type of quantum emitters, and beyond the bulk GaAs environment that we consider here. Especially the concatenation method can take phonon effects into account at the same computational cost as modeling the emitter-photon interaction alone. Finally, we present approximate analytical expressions for the collective emission spectrum for N emitters on a one-dimensional chain.

TI Unit-Cell-Thickness Electron Confinement by Geometrically Constrained
   Antipolar Ordering
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Achieving precise electron or spin confinement is essential for the progress of oxide electronics and emerging quantum information processing. While 2D electron confinement is commonly achieved with bare surfaces, heteroepitaxial interfaces, and charged domain walls, its practical application poses challenges, notably by diverse confinement widths, limited material selection, and the lack of freedom of positioning to a desired location within a given material system. Here, with scrutinizing a novel defect structure, the study suggests a new strategy with compelling evidence to trigger electron confinement down to single unit-cell-thickness, through geometrically constrained antipolar ordering facilitated by superlattice-like periodic planar faults in metallic SrFeO3. Employing atomic resolution electron microscopy and density functional theory, the results demonstrate that electrons are confined two-dimensionally to screen the positive bound charges on head-to-head antipolar state boundary, meanwhile oxygen vacancies segregated in the planar faults compensate the negative bound charges on the tail-to-tail one, leading to the stabilization of the antipolar ordering. Additionally, distinguished from traditional methods, this approach offers a potential programing capability for achieving precise charge and spin control by regulating planar fault structure at atomic scale.

TI Guanidinate Yttrium Complexes Containing Bipyridyl and
   Bis(benzimidazolyl) Radicals
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Ancillary ligand scaffolds that sufficiently stabilize a metal ion to allow its coordination to an open-shell ligand are scarce, yet their development is essential for next-generation spin-based materials with topical applications in quantum information science. To this end, a synthetic challenge must be met: devising molecules that enable the binding of a redox-active ligand through facile displacement and clean removal of a weakly coordinating anion. Here, we probe the accessibility of unprecedented radical-containing rare-earth guanidinate complexes by combining our recently discovered yttrium tetraphenylborate complex [{(Me3Si)(2)NC((NPr)-Pr-i)(2)}(2)Y][(mu-eta(6)-Ph)(BPh3)] with the redox-active ligands 2,2 '-bipyridine (bpy) and 2,2 '-bis(benzimidazole) (Bbim), respectively, under reductive conditions. Our endeavor resulted in the first evidence of guanidinate complexes that contain radicals, namely, a mononuclear bipyridyl radical complex, {(Me3Si)(2)NC((NPr)-Pr-i)(2)}(2)Y(bpy(center dot)) (1), and a dinuclear bis(benzimidazolyl) radical-bridged complex, [K(crypt-222)][{(Me3Si)(2)NC((NPr)-Pr-i)(2)}(2)Y](2)(mu-Bbim(center dot)) (2 '). The latter was achieved by an in situ reduction of [{(Me3Si)(2)NC((NPr)-Pr-i)(2)}(2)Y](2)(mu-Bbim) (2), which was isolated from a salt metathesis reaction. 1 and 2 were characterized by X-ray crystallography and IR and UV-vis spectroscopy. Variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was applied to gain insight into the distribution of unpaired spin density on 1 and 2 '. Density functional theory calculations were conducted on 1 and 2 ' to elucidate further their electronic structures. The redox activity of 1 and 2 ' was also probed by electrochemical methods.

TI Excited-state dynamics and optically detected magnetic resonance of
   solid-state spin defects from first principles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient and reliable method that enables initialization and readout of spin states through the spin-photon interface. In general, high quantum efficiency and large spin-dependent photoluminescence contrast are desirable for reliable quantum information readout. However, reliable prediction of the ODMR contrast from first-principles requires an accurate description of complex spin polarization mechanisms of spin defects. These mechanisms often include multiple radiative and nonradiative processes, in particular, intersystem crossing (ISC) among multiple excited electronic states. In this work, we present our implementation of the first-principles ODMR contrast by solving the kinetic master equation with calculated rates from ab initio electronic structure methods then benchmark the implementation on the case of the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We show the importance of the correct description of multireference electronic states and pseudo Jahn-Teller effect for quantitatively, even qualitatively correct prediction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the rate of ISC. We present the complete calculation of SOC for different ISC processes that align with both group theory and experimental observations. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive picture of excitation and relaxation dynamics, including previously unexplored internal conversion processes. We show good agreement between our first-principles calculations and the experimental ODMR contrast under magnetic field. We then demonstrate reliable predictions of magnetic field direction, pump power, and Rabi frequency as important parameters for ODMR experiments. Our work clarifies the important excited-state relaxation mechanisms determining ODMR contrast and provides a predictive computational platform for spin polarization and optical readout of solid-state quantum defects from first principles.

TI Simultaneous high Q/V-ratio and optimized far-field emission
   pattern in diamond slot-bridge nanobeam cavity
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We present a design for a slot-bridge nanobeam cavity that supports ultrahigh Q/V and optimized far-field emission pattern, and operates at the zero-phonon transition (637nm) of the nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond. The slot-bridge cavity is formed by introducing a diamond bridge at the center of the air region of a slotted cavity. As a result of the boundary condition on the parallel component of the electric field, the electric field in the bridge region is the same as that in the slot. This results in a further reduction of the mode volume. Optimized slot-bridge cavities with a calculated Q factor of 6 x 10(6) and mode volume of V-eff = 0.28(lambda/n)(3) have been realized. In comparison to nanobeam cavities, the mode volume is reduced by a factor of 139. The far-field pattern of a slot-bridge cavity is optimized by using the band folding method and by adding small air-slot extensions to the two closest air-holes surrounding the cavity. A high Q of 9.8 x 10(5) and a small mode volume of V-eff = 0.011(lambda/n)(3) is realized for this design. Therefore, this type of cavities would allow for the realization of efficient single-photon sources. Our results are important for fundamental studies, like cavity quantum electrodynamics, as well as applications in quantum information processing based on diamond where high qualityfactor and ultrasmall mode volume are required.

TI Segmented strings and holography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this paper we establish a connection between segmented strings propagating in AdSd thorn 1 and CFTd subsystems in Minkowski spacetime characterized by quantum information theoretic quantities calculated for the vacuum state. We show that the area of the world sheet of a string segment on the AdS side can be connected to fidelity susceptibility (the real part of the quantum geometric tensor) on the CFT side. This quantity has another interpretation as the computational complexity for infinitesimally separated states corresponding to causal diamonds that are displaced in a spacelike manner according to the metric of kinematic space. These displaced causal diamonds encode information for a unique reconstruction of the string world sheet segments in a holographic manner. Dually the bulk segments are representing causally ordered sets of consecutive boundary events in boosted inertial frames or in noninertial ones proceeding with constant acceleration. For the special case of AdS3 one can also see the segmented stringy area in units of 4GL (G is Newton's constant and L is the AdS length) as the conditional mutual information IoA; CAB thorn calculated for a trapezoid configuration arising from boosted spacelike intervals A, B and C. In this special case the variation of the discretized Nambu-Goto action leads to an equation for entanglement entropies in the boundary theory of the form of a Toda equation. For arbitrary d the string world sheet patches are living in the modular slices of the entanglement wedge. They seem to provide some sort of tomography of the entanglement wedge where the patches are linked together by the interpolation ansatz, i.e., the discretized version of the equations of motion for the Nambu-Goto action.

While the next generation of applications such as ultra-high speed optical transceivers, neuromorphic computing and terabit-scale communications demand further lower power consumption and higher operating frequency. Complementing the leading silicon-based material platforms, the third-generation semiconductor, silicon carbide (SiC), offers a significant opportunity toward the advanced development of PICs in terms of its broadest range of functionalities, including wide bandgap, high optical nonlinearities, high refractive index, controllable artificial spin defects and complementary metal oxide semiconductor-compatible fabrication process. The superior properties of SiC have enabled a plethora of nano-photonic explorations, such as waveguides, micro-cavities, nonlinear frequency converters and optically-active spin defects. This remarkable progress has prompted the rapid development of advanced SiC PICs for both classical and quantum applications. Here, we provide an overview of SiC-based integrated photonics, presenting the latest progress on investigating its basic optoelectronic properties, as well as the recent developments in the fabrication of several typical approaches for light confinement structures that form the basic building blocks for low-loss, multi-functional and industry-compatible integrated photonic platform. Moreover, recent works employing SiC as optically-readable spin hosts for quantum information applications are also summarized and highlighted. As a still-developing integrated photonic platform, prospects and challenges of utilizing SiC material platforms in the field of integrated photonics are also discussed.

TI Quantum Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered
   One-Dimensional Critical States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed quantum strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. This dual approach allows us to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phase structure and the nature of the transition. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is purely quantum in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.

TI Investigating high school and pre-high school teachers' perceptions and
   experiences introducing quantum concepts: a survey of QuanTime and other
   quantum-related activities
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This study investigates the experiences of pre-high and high school teachers in implementing QuanTime and other quantum-related activities aiming to promote quantum literacy and introduce foundational quantum concepts to K-12 students. The ultimate goal is to help prepare a diverse future workforce in quantum information science and technology (QIST). Teachers were divided into two groups: pre-high school (grades 4-8) and high school (grades 9-12). We used a survey featuring 12 Likert-scale questions and 14 open-ended responses to assess teachers' perceptions, engagement, and feedback about engaging in QuanTime and other quantum-related activities. Approximately two-thirds of the teachers responding to the survey implemented QuanTime activities in their classes. High school teachers who responded to the survey were most likely to use activities like Wave-Particle Duality and Electron Transitions while pre-high school teachers showed a strong interest in Art & Polarization. Open-ended feedback highlighted the ease of integrating these activities into existing curricula and the minimal preparation required, making them accessible for educators. The positive reception across both groups indicates that QuanTime and other quantum-related activities are valuable tools for early-age quantum education. By engaging students with quantum concepts from a young age, these activities have the potential to spark interest, which may contribute to their future engagement over time. It can inspire a diverse group of students and has the potential to get them interested in future opportunities in the growing field of QIST.

TI Large Hyperfine Coupling Arising from Pseudo-2S Ground States
   in a Series of Lutetium(II) Metallocene Complexes
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The synthesis of molecules with strong coupling between electronic and nuclear spins represents an important challenge in molecular quantum information science. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of the divalent lutetium metallocene complexes Lu(Cp-Me5)(Cp(iPr)5) (Cp-Me5 = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; Cp-iPr5 = pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyl), Lu(Cp-iPr4 Et)(2) (Cp-iPr4Et = ethyltetraisopropylcyclopentadienyl), and Lu(Cp-iPr 4)2 (Cp-iPr4 = tetraisopropylcyclopentadienyl). The molecular structures of these complexes, as determined through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, feature a common bent sandwich geometry, with average Cp-Lu-Cp angles ranging from 159.9 degrees to 152.6 degrees. Analysis of continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra for the complexes reveals nearly isotropic g tensors with only a slight deviation from that of a free electron. Moreover, an extremely large splitting of the eight-line spectra indicates the presence of strong hyperfine coupling, and simulations provide isotropic hyperfine coupling constants of A iso = 4.38, 4.30, and 4.17 GHz across the series, where the value of A iso is found to decrease as the Cp-Lu-Cp angle becomes more acute. Notably, these values are the largest yet observed for any lanthanide complex. Moreover, EPR and computational analysis show that the large values of A iso stem from large s-orbital character-up to 41.2%-in the corresponding singly occupied molecular orbitals. To our knowledge, this degree of s-character in a molecular orbital is the largest yet reported for an open-shell isolable complex. These results outline a general strategy toward the isolation of paramagnetic molecules with strong hyperfine coupling and highly isotropic doublet electronic ground states.

TI One-particle and two-particle visibilities in bipartite entangled
   Gaussian states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Complementarity between one-particle visibility and two-particle visibility in discrete systems can be extended to bipartite quantum-entangled Gaussian states implemented with continuous-variable quantum optics. The meaning of the two-particle visibility originally defined by Jaeger, Horne, Shimony, and Vaidman with the use of an indirect method that first corrects the two-particle probability distribution by adding and subtracting other distributions with varying degree of entanglement, however, deserves further analysis. Furthermore, the origin of complementarity between one-particle visibility and two-particle visibility is somewhat elusive and it is not entirely clear what is the best way to associate particular two-particle quantum observables with the two-particle visibility. Here, we develop a direct method for quantifying the two-particle visibility based on measurement of a pair of two-particle observables that are compatible with the measured pair of single-particle observables. For each of the two-particle observables from the pair is computed corresponding visibility, after which the absolute difference of the latter pair of visibilities is considered as a redefinition of the two-particle visibility. Our approach reveals an underlying mathematical symmetry as it treats the two pairs of one-particle or two-particle observables on equal footing by formally identifying all four observable distributions as rotated marginal distributions of the original two-particle probability distribution. The complementarity relation between one-particle visibility and two-particle visibility obtained with the direct method is exact in the limit of infinite Gaussian precision where the entangled Gaussian state approaches an ideal Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state. The presented results demonstrate the theoretical utility of rotated marginal distributions for elucidating the nature of two-particle visibility and provide tools for the development of quantum applications employing continuous variables.

TI Frequency-stable nanophotonic microcavities via integrated thermometry
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Field-deployable integrated photonic devices co-packaged with electronics will enable important applications such as optical interconnects, quantum information processing, precision measurements, spectroscopy and microwave generation. Significant progress has been made over the past two decades on increasing the functional complexity of photonic chips. However, a critical challenge that remains is the lack of scalable techniques to overcome thermal perturbations arising from the environment and co-packaged electronics. Here we demonstrate a fully integrated scheme to monitor and stabilize the temperature of a high-Q microresonator on a Si-based chip, which can serve as a photonic frequency reference. Our approach relies on a thin-film metallic resistor placed directly above the microcavity, acting as an integrated resistance thermometer, enabling unique mapping of the cavity's absolute resonance wavelength to the thermometer's electrical resistance. Following a one-time calibration, the microresonator can be accurately and repeatably tuned to any desired absolute resonance wavelength using thermometry alone with a root-mean-squared wavelength error of <0.8 pm over a time span of days. We frequency-lock a distributed feedback laser to the microresonator and demonstrate a 48x reduction in its frequency drift, resulting in its centre wavelength staying within +/- 0.5 pm of the mean over a duration of 50 h in the presence of substantial ambient fluctuations, outperforming many commercial distributed feedback and wavelength-locker-based laser systems. Finally, we stabilize a soliton mode-locked Kerr comb without the need for photodetection, paving the way for Kerr-comb-based photonic devices that can potentially operate in the desired mode-locked state indefinitely.

TI Structured light approaches in laser-based plasma diagnostics
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
AB There is a growing demand for plasma diagnostics suitable for industrial plasma reactors employed in semiconductor nanofabrication, especially relevant to microelectronics and quantum information systems. Such reactors typically have limited optical access and pose considerable diagnostic challenges, including intense background emission, significant thermal loads, and contamination of optical viewports. In this study, we outline research into structured light techniques (laser beams with tailored spatial, temporal, or phase characteristics) that effectively overcome these issues using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) as an example. The focus of presented diagnostics is on ion kinetics analysis within an industrial plasma source, although this approach is broadly applicable to other plasma systems and diagnostic contexts. We present a confocal LIF implementation using an axicon-generated Bessel annular beam, achieving spatial resolutions of approximately 5 mm at a focal distance of 300 mm, with potential improvements to about 1 mm. This approach matches conventional orthogonal LIF performance but requires only one optical port. Wavelength-modulation LIF employs nonlinear laser wavelength tuning to measure spectral line derivatives, suppressing background emission and enhancing details of spectral line shape. Additionally, we present new results on applying vortex beams (laser beams carrying orbital angular momentum, OAM) for LIF measurements in an industrial plasma device. These measurements enable simultaneous axial and tangential velocity determination using a single laser beam and have been tested with xenon ion transition. Initial quantification of results was performed. Together, these structured-light approaches provide robust, background-resilient, multi-dimensional diagnostics for complex plasma environments.

TI Chirality-Induced Magnet-Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in n-doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (alpha-helix l-polyalanine, AHPA-L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free SC spintronics.
   This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n-GaAs via the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n-GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. image

TI Search for an efficient entanglement witness operator for bound
   entangled states in bipartite quantum systems
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Entanglement detection problem is one of the important problem in quantum information theory. Gurvit (2014) showed that this problem is NP complete and thus this may be the possible reason that only one criterion is not sufficient to detect all entangled states. There are some powerful entanglement detection criterion such as partial transposition criterion, realignment criterion but it may not be possible to implement them successfully in the experiment. This situation can be avoided if the entanglement is detected through the construction of witness operator method. In this work, we take an analytical approach to construct a witness operator. To achieve this task, we first construct a linear map using partial transposition and realignment operation. Then we find some conditions on the parameters of the map for which the map represent a positive map. Further, we have constructed a Choi matrix corresponding to the map and have shown that it is not completely positive. We then construct an entanglement witness operator, which is based on the linear combination of the function of Choi matrix and the identity matrix and it can detect both NPTES and PPTES. Finally, we prove its efficiency by detecting several bipartite bound entangled states which were previously undetected by some well-known separability criteria. We also compared the detection power of our witness operator with three well-known powerful entanglement detection criteria, namely, dV criterion, CCNR criterion and the separability criteria based on correlation tensor (CT) proposed by Sarbicki et. al. and find that our witness operator detects more entangled states than these criterion.

TI Strong enhancement of Penning ionisation in cold Rydberg gases II: Tom
   and Jerry pairs for alkali-metal atoms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Penning ionisation (PI) processes involving pairs of Rydberg alkali-metal atoms, excited to different quantum states and experiencing dipole-dipole interactions, have a wide range of important properties in atomic physics. Within the framework of the semiclassical approximation, we have used both numerical and analytical approaches to examine the Penning autoionisation width dependence on the state quantum numbers in a quasi-molecule formed by the interacting partner atoms. We described the characteristics of optimal quantum numbers that lead to enhanced PI widths for the interacting Rydberg atom pairs of all alkali-metal atoms. The excited states of atoms in these pairs are asymmetric, resulting in a large atomic shell size difference: inspired by Efimov et al (2016 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 49 125302), we call such a pair 'Tom' and 'Jerry' (for 'big' and 'small'). Compared to symmetric pairs, the optimal asymmetric pairs display a significant (by several orders of magnitude) increase in the PI rate. This property makes PI a relevant source for producing charged particles in cold Rydberg systems that spontaneously evolve into cold plasma. Contrary to hydrogen atoms examined in (Efimov et al 2016 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 49 125302), the difference in quantum defects in alkali-metal atoms results in a strong Penning width dependence on the orbital quantum numbers l of the quasi-molecule. In particular, alkali-metal atoms exhibit two PI channels associated with bound-bound optical transitions showing Delta l = +/- 1-individual and closely spaced (doublet-like) configurations of optimal pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of Forster resonances can lead to a notable (up to five times) increase in the PI efficiency.

TI Ultrahigh Thermal Rectification at Small Temperature Difference Achieved
   by Near-Field Thermal Photon Manipulation
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Thermal diodes, which allow heat to flow in a preferential direction, are an essential component of thermal circuitry and will find applications in many fields ranging from thermal photon controls to quantum information. The quality of a thermal diode is defined by the thermal rectification ratio (TRR). Here, an ultrahigh TRR exceeding 105 at a small temperature difference (1-5 K) is presented based on near-field thermal photon (NFTP) manipulation, by utilizing asymmetric gap-variated dual terminals based on graphene/Si heterostructures and materials with contrasting thermal expansion coefficients. Analyses of the photon tunneling probability show that the colossal TRR comes from coupled and decoupled graphene surface plasmon polaritons under opposite temperature biases, remaining robust across a wide operating temperature range. Further enhancement can be achieved by tuning the Fermi level of graphene. This work demonstrates the significance of asymmetry in NFTP manipulation for thermal diode performance, achieving an ultrahigh TRR, which is at least three orders higher than the state-of-the-art structures at the same small temperature difference (1-5 K), and is comparable to state-of-the-art electronic diodes.

TI A DFT study of electron-phonon interactions for the C2CN
   and VNNB defects in hexagonal boron nitride: investigating the
   role of the transition dipole direction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have generated significant interest due to observations of ultra-bright emission made at room temperature. The expectation that solid-state emitters exhibit broad zero-phonon lines at elevated temperatures has been put in question by recent observations of Fourier transform (FT) limited photons emitted from h-BN flakes at room temperature. All decoupled emitters produce photons that are directed in-plane, suggesting that the dipoles are perpendicular to the h-BN plane. Motivated by the promise of an efficient and scalable source of indistinguishable photons that can operate at room temperature, we have developed an approach using density functional theory (DFT) to determine the electron-phonon coupling for defects that have in-and out-of-plane transition dipole moments. Our DFT calculations reveal that the transition dipole for the C2CN defect is parallel to the h-BN plane, and for the VNNB defect is perpendicular to the plane. We calculate both the phonon density of states and the electron-phonon matrix elements associated with the h-BN defective structures. We find no indication that an out-of-plane transition dipole by itself will result in the low electron-phonon coupling that is expected to produce FT-limited photons at room temperature. Our work provides direction to future DFT software developments and adds to the growing list of calculations relevant to researchers in the field of solid-state quantum information processing.

TI Utilising machine learning algorithms for high speed data processing of
   a single photon counting 256 channel PMT with a timing resolution of 60

AB Development of a 256 Micro-Channel Plate Photo-Multiplier Tube (MCP-PMT) to further increase the spatial resolution while maintaining the temporal resolution of 60 ps using charge sharing techniques would enable a novel commercial camera system. This would be designed so that each channel is an independent photon detector allowing for single photon counting possibilities which would advance fields such as LiDAR, particle physics, Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) in biology and quantum information systems. Electronic capabilities to measure increasing photon rates have introduced a bottleneck in the path of real time data processing using current algorithmic software.This research explores a potential solution of a machine learning (ML) algorithm for performing the data processing and imaging, with the objective of reconstructing the photon event in both spatial and temporal coordinates with a time constraint 10 mu s per single photon event. In this paper optimisation of the model is detailed with discussion on various hyper-parameters of the model architecture. The results demonstrate the ML model's success in reconstructing photon events from real detector data with a training set consisting of simulated data. The research details approaches to training with real detector data and introduces a generative model, which aims to generate realistic photon events. Further work aims to assess the variance in performance of the ML model when trained with a hybrid training set containing both generated photon events and photon events from the MCP-PMT.

TI Semi-empirical quantum optics for mid-infrared molecular nanophotonics
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Nanoscale infrared (IR) resonators with sub-diffraction limited mode volumes and open geometries have emerged as new platforms for implementing cavity quantum electrodynamics at room temperature. The use of IR nanoantennas and tip nanoprobes to study strong light-matter coupling of molecular vibrations with the vacuum field can be exploited for IR quantum control with nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. In order to advance the development of molecule-based quantum nanophotonics in the mid-IR, we propose a generally applicable semi-empirical methodology based on quantum optics to describe light-matter interaction in systems driven by mid-IR femtosecond laser pulses. The theory is shown to reproduce recent experiments on the acceleration of the vibrational relaxation rate in infrared nanostructures. It also provides physical insights on the implementation of coherent phase rotations of the near-field using broadband nanotips. We then apply the quantum framework to develop general tip-design rules for the experimental manipulation of vibrational strong coupling and Fano interference effects in open infrared resonators. We finally propose the possibility of transferring the natural anharmonicity of molecular vibrational levels to the resonator near-field in the weak coupling regime to implement intensity-dependent phase shifts of the coupled system response with strong pulses and develop a vibrational chirping model to understand the effect. The semi-empirical quantum theory is equivalent to first-principles techniques based on Maxwell's equations, but its lower computational cost suggests its use as a rapid design tool for the development of strongly coupled infrared nanophotonic hardware for applications ranging from quantum control of materials to quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Black Holes as Solvents
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB Almost all of the entropy in the universe is in the form of Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy of super-massive black holes. This entropy, if it satisfies Boltzmann's equation S=log N, hence represents almost all the accessible phase space of the Universe, somehow associated to objects which themselves fill out a very small fraction of ordinary three-dimensional space. Although time scales are very long, it is believed that black holes will eventually evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, which is thermal when counted mode by mode. A pure quantum state collapsing to a black hole will hence eventually re-emerge as a state with strictly positive entropy, which constitutes the famous black hole information paradox. Expanding on a remark by Hawking we posit that BH entropy is a thermodynamic entropy, which must be distinguished from information-theoretic entropy. The paradox can then be explained by information return in Hawking radiation. The novel perspective advanced here is that if BH entropy counts the number of accessible physical states in a quantum black hole, then the paradox can be seen as an instance of the fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. We suggest a specific analogy to the increase of the entropy in a solvation process. We further show that the huge phase volume (N), which must be made available to the universe in a gravitational collapse, cannot originate from the entanglement between ordinary matter and/or radiation inside and outside the black hole. We argue that, instead, the quantum degrees of freedom of the gravitational field must get activated near the singularity, resulting in a final state of the 'entangled entanglement' form involving both matter and gravity.

TI Pockels laser directly driving ultrafast optical metrology
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The invention of the laser unleashed the potential of optical metrology, leading to numerous advancements in modern science and technology. This reliance on lasers, however, also introduces a bottleneck for precision optical metrology, as it requires sophisticated photonic infrastructure for precise laser-wave control, leading to limited metrology performance and significant system complexity. Here, we take a key step toward overcoming this challenge by demonstrating a Pockels laser with multifunctional capabilities that elevate optical metrology to a new level. The chip-scale laser achieves a narrow intrinsic linewidth down to 167 Hz and a broad mode-hop-free tuning range up to 24 GHz. In particular, it delivers an unprecedented frequency chirping rate of up to 20 EHz/s and an exceptional modulation bandwidth exceeding 10 GHz, both of which are orders of magnitude greater than those of existing lasers. Leveraging this laser, we successfully achieve velocimetry at 40 m/s over a short distance of 0.4 m, and measurable velocities up to the first cosmic velocity at 1 m away-a feat unattainable with conventional ranging approaches. At the same time, we achieve distance metrology with a ranging resolution of <2 cm. Furthermore, for the first time to our knowledge, we implement a dramatically simplified architecture for laser frequency stabilization by directly locking the laser to an external reference gas cell without requiring additional external light control. This approach enables long-term laser stability with a frequency fluctuation of only +/- 6.5 MHz over 60 min. The demonstrated Pockels laser combines elegantly high laser coherence with ultrafast frequency reconfigurability and superior multifunctional capability. We envision its profound impact across diverse fields including communication, sensing, autonomous driving, quantum information processing, and beyond.

TI Modeling the effects of perturbations and steepest entropy ascent on the
   time evolution of entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB This work presents an analysis of the evolution of perturbed Bell diagonal states using the equation of motion of steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT), the Lindblad equation, and various measures of entanglement loss. The Bell diagonal states considered are those generated by the quantum optics study conducted by Liu et al (2016 Phys. Rev. A 94 062107). First, a brief derivation is provided, showing that Bell diagonal states are stationary but not stable equilibrium states within the SEAQT formalism. This highlights the need for perturbation methods to study the evolution of nearby states with, for example, similar values of the energy and entropy. In contrast, under the Lindblad equation of motion, only some Bell diagonal states remain stationary. Although SEAQT is a non-standard, nonlinear framework, it exhibits several unique features that other approaches do not. In particular, not only does it satisfy the postulates of quantum mechanics, but it, as well, is fully compatible with the second law of thermodynamics, providing a physically consistent description of non-equilibrium quantum systems. The perturbation methods used include a weighted-average method for perturbing bipartite system states and a general bipartite method based on a set of unitary operations constrained to maintain constant system energy and entropy. Sets of density operators are randomly generated using each method, and the resulting time-dependent characteristics of the entanglement are analyzed within the SEAQT and Lindblad frameworks. The findings reveal that the evolutions associated with constrained perturbations accurately predict the loss of non-locality and align well with measured concurrence. Additionally, within the SEAQT framework, the deep connection between the thermodynamic states of the evolution of the system and the loss of non-locality is quantitatively demonstrated.

TI Consistency of Relations over Monoids
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACM
AB The interplay between local consistency and global consistency has been the object of study in several different areas, including probability theory, relational databases, and quantum information. For relational databases, Beeri, Fagin, Maier, and Yannakakis showed that a database schema is acyclic if and only if it has the local-to-global consistency property for relations, which means that every collection of pairwise consistent relations over the schema is globally consistent. More recently, the same result has been shown under bag semantics. In this article, we carry out a systematic study of local versus global consistency for relations over positive commutative monoids, which is a common generalization of ordinary relations and bags. Let K be an arbitrary positive commutative monoid. We begin by showing that acyclicity of the schema is a necessary condition for the local-to-global consistency property for K-relations to hold. Unlike the case of ordinary relations and bags, however, we show that acyclicity is not always sufficient. Then, we characterize the positive commutative monoids for which acyclicity is both necessary and sufficient for the local-to-global consistency property to hold. This characterization involves a combinatorial property of monoids, which we call the transportation property. We then identify several different classes of monoids that possess the transportation property. As our final contribution, we introduce a modified notion of local consistency of K-relations, which we call pairwise consistency up to the free cover. We prove that, for all positive commutative monoids K, even those without the transportation property, acyclicity is both necessary and sufficient for every family of K-relations that is pairwise consistent up to the free cover to be globally consistent.

TI Encryption-decryption scheme in a single-pixel system based on
   polarization and Laguerre-Gaussian mode modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical cryptosystems are crucial for ensuring the security of optical information transmission and storage. The indirect measurement mechanism of single-pixel imaging (SPI) offers a feasible implementation channel for optical cryptosystems. Illumination patterns are encryption keys projected onto the plaintext object, while the intensity collected by the single- pixel detector forms the ciphertext. However, the variations in the object's angular position during SPI measurement generally introduce certain inaccuracies in image reconstruction. And due to SPI's input-output linear mapping relationship, the plaintext is vulnerable to exposure. This proposes an encryption-decryption scheme in a single-pixel system based on polarization and Laguer re-Gaussian (LG) mode modulation. The inherent circular symmetry of LG mode makes the angular position of the object information that can be encrypted, while the intrinsic properties of the object can be represented by polarization. Our system characterizes various polarization parameters of samples serving as reliable plaintext with an error of less than 4.2%, including depolarization, diattenuation, and retardance. For encryption demonstration, LG modes are randomly divided into 5 groups, corresponding to an object at different rotational states. This, combined with 16 polarization modulations, constructs pattern-angle-polarization joint keys, enabling high-security encryption as well as high-fidelity decryption of the mask image, optical axis orientation, and retardance of the test sample. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in enhancing the security and information complexity of optical cryptography, offering valuable insights for optical communication and quantum information security.

TI Valley Isospin Controlled Fractional Quantum Hall States in Bilayer
   Graphene
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A two-dimensional electron system placed in a magnetic field develops Landau levels, where strong Coulomb interactions lead to the appearance of many-body correlated ground states. Quantum numbers similar to the electron spin enable the understanding and control of complex ground state order and collective excitations. Owing to its spin, valley, and orbital degrees of freedom, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene offers a rich platform to pursue correlated phenomena in two dimensions. In this work, we fabricate dual-gated Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices and demonstrate unprecedented fine control over its valley isospin degrees of freedom using a perpendicular electric field. Higher sample quality enables us to probe regimes obscured by disorder in previous studies. We present evidence for a new even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor v = 5/2. The 5/2 state is found to be spontaneously valley polarized in the limit of vanishing valley Zeeman splitting, consistent with a theoretical prediction made regarding the spin polarization of the Moore-Read state. In the vicinity of the even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states, we observe the appearance of the predicted Levin-Halperin daughter states of the Moore-Read Pfaffian wave function at v = 3/2 and 7/2 and of the anti-Pfaffian at v = 5/2 and ???1/2. These observations suggest the breaking of particle-hole symmetry in bilayer graphene. We construct a comprehensive valley polarization phase diagram for the Jain sequence fractional states surrounding filling factor 3/2. These results are well explained by a two-component composite fermion model, further demonstrating the SU(2) nature of the valley isospin in bilayer graphene. Our experiment paves the path for future efforts of manipulating the valley isospin in bilayer graphene to engineer exotic topological orders and quantum information processes.

TI Multiphoton EP control with multidressing fields and linear-nonlinear
   competition in natural energy level systems
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB One-step generation of W-state entangled three-photons based on spontaneous six-wave mixing (SSWM) has been shown to have significant advantages over cascaded spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) methods and cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) methods. On this basis, this paper provides a theoretical insight into the optical response in non-Hermitian SSWM systems under linear and nonlinear coupling effects. Among them, the linear process is mainly controlled by group velocity and decay rate, and the nonlinear process is mainly controlled by Rabi oscillation and detuning. In the nonlinear-dominated optical response process, the higher-order EP coupling is more obviously controlled by the intensity of the dressing field, thus providing insights into the PT symmetry breaking in energy-level systems based on the EIT principle. Further, in this paper, the modulation of SSWM by single dressing field and two double dressing fields is theoretically analyzed. Compared with the single dressing field, the higher-order EP coupling effect of the cascaded double dressing field and the nested double dressing field is more obvious, and the Rabi oscillatory coupling order is higher, and more cycles can be observed, which generates a high-dimensional information coherence channel and improves the coupling efficiency and strength. In addition, the coherence time of SSWM induced under the weak dressing field increases continuously during the transition from the linear optical response dominant process to the nonlinear optical response process dominant process, and multi-dressing modulation with stronger interactions between the dressing fields then balances the lifetimes of strong dressing and weak dressing entangled states. Which is of great significance for quantum information storage and communication.

TI Weyl anomalies of four dimensional conformal boundaries and defects
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Motivated by questions about quantum information and classification of quantum field theories, we consider Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in spacetime dimension d >= 5 with a conformally-invariant spatial boundary (BCFTs) or 4-dimensional conformal defect (DCFTs). We determine the boundary or defect contribution to the Weyl anomaly using the standard algorithm, which includes imposing Wess-Zumino consistency and fixing finite counterterms. These boundary/defect contributions are built from the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures, as well as the pullback of the ambient CFT's Weyl tensor. For a co-dimension one boundary or defect (i.e. d = 5), we reproduce the 9 parity-even terms found by Astaneh and Solodukhin, and we discover 3 parity-odd terms. For larger co-dimension, we find 23 parity-even terms and 6 parity-odd terms. The coefficient of each term defines a "central charge" that characterizes the BCFT or DCFT. We show how several of the parity-even central charges enter physical observables, namely the displacement operator two-point function, the stress-tensor one-point function, and the universal part of the entanglement entropy. We compute several parity-even central charges in tractable examples: monodromy and conical defects of free, massless scalars and Dirac fermions in d >= 6; probe branes in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space dual to defects in CFTs with d >= 6; and Takayanagi's AdS/BCFT with d = 5. We demonstrate that several of our examples obey the boundary/defect a-theorem, as expected.

TI Ultrafast fs coherent excitonic dynamics in CdSe quantum dots assemblies
   addressed and probed by 2D electronic spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We show in a joint experimental and theoretical study that ultrafast femto-second (fs) electronic coherences can be characterized in semi-conducting colloidal quantum dot (QD) assemblies at room temperature. The dynamics of the electronic response of ensembles of CdSe QDs in the solution and of QD dimers in the solid state is probed by a sequence of 3 fs laser pulses as in two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy. The quantum dynamics is computed using an excitonic model Hamiltonian based on the effective mass approximation. The Hamiltonian includes the Coulomb, spin-orbit, and crystal field interactions that give rise to the fine structure splittings. In the dimers studied, the interdot distance is sufficiently small to allow for an efficient interdot coupling and delocalization of the excitons over the two QDs of the dimer. To account for the inherent few percent size dispersion of colloidal QDs, the optical response is modeled by averaging over an ensemble of 2000 dimers. The size dispersion is responsible for an inhomogeneous broadening that limits the lifetimes of the excitonic coherences that can be probed to about 150 fs-200 fs. Simulations and experimental measurements in the solid state and in the solution demonstrate that during that time scale, a very rich electronic coherent dynamics takes place that involves several types of intradot and interdot (in the case of dimers) coherences. These electronic coherences exhibit a wide range of beating periods and provide a versatile basis for a quantum information processing device on a fs time scale at room temperature.

TI Growth and characterization of high-quality Zr doped AlN epilayers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB AlN stands out for its remarkable figures of merit for electronic and photonic devices, attributed to its ultrawide bandgap of similar to 6.1 eV and an exceptionally high critical field of similar to 15 MV/cm. More recently, zirconium (Zr) doped AlN (AlN:Zr) has also been identified as a promising material platform for the exploration of solid-state qubits for quantum information and technology, high performance piezoelectric acoustic wave resonators, and optically triggered ultrafast power switching devices facilitated by optically activating Zr related impurities. Despite the significant potential, the ability for producing AlN:Zr epitaxial structures has yet to be established. In this study, we have achieved AlN:Zr epilayers with a high Zr doping level [N-Zr] of up to 10(20) cm(-3) using industrial standard metal-organic chemical vapor deposition growth technique. High crystalline quality of AlN:Zr was confirmed by x-ray diffraction, revealing a narrow full width at half maximum of the (002) rocking curve at 216 arcsec for 1.8 mu m thick epilayers deposited on sapphire at [N-Zr]=10(20) cm(-3). Zr doping was observed to slightly increase the c-lattice constant to 4.992 & Aring; for AlN:Zr (at [N-Zr]=10(20) cm(-3)) compared to 4.980 & Aring; for undoped AlN. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement results verified the substitution of Zr at the Al site (Zr-Al). The formation of (Zr-Al-V-N) complexes, which are predicted to possess all the desired properties required by quantum qubits, was confirmed through optical absorption studies. The realization of high-quality AlN:Zr epilayers significantly broadens the scope of technologically significant device applications for AlN.

TI Prolonged dephasing time of ensemble of moire-trapped interlayer
   excitons in WSe2-MoSe2 heterobilayers
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The moire superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers have a pronounced effect on the optical properties of interlayer excitons (IXs) and have been intensively studied in recent years. However, the impact of moire potentials on the temporal coherence of the IXs has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we systematically investigate the coherence properties of both the ensemble of delocalized and the ensemble of localized IXs trapped in moire potentials of the hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated WSe2-MoSe2 heterostructures. Our low-temperature first-order correlation measurements show that prolonged T-2 dephasing times with values up to 730 fs can be obtained from the ensemble of localized IXs under moderate pump powers. We observed up to almost a five-fold increase over the values we obtained from the delocalized IXs, while more than two-fold over the previously reported values of T-2 similar to 300 fs from the delocalized IXs. The prolonged values of T-2 dephasing times and narrow photoluminescence (PL) linewidths for the ensemble of moire-trapped IXs compared to delocalized one indicate that dephasing mechanisms caused by exciton-low energy acoustic phonon and exciton-exciton scattering are significantly suppressed due to the presence of localization potentials. Our pump power-dependent T-2 results show that ultra-long dephasing times can be expected if the dephasing time measurements are performed with the narrow photoluminescence emission line of a single moire-trapped IX at a low pump power regime. The prolonged values of IX dephasing times would be critical for the applications of quantum information science and the development of two-dimensional material-based nanolasers.

TI Deep learning of phase transitions for quantum spin chains from
   correlation aspects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Using machine learning (ML) to recognize different phases of matter and to infer the entire phase diagram has proven to be an effective tool given a large dataset. In our previous proposals, we have successfully explored phase transitions for topological phases of matter at low dimensions either in a supervised or an unsupervised learning protocol with the assistance of quantum-information-related quantities. In this work, we adopt our previous ML procedures to study quantum phase transitions of magnetism systems such as the XY and XXZ spin chains by using spin-spin correlation functions as the input data. We find that our proposed approach not only maps out the phase diagrams with accurate phase boundaries, but also indicates some features that have not been observed in the field of machine learning before. In particular, we define so-called relevant correlation functions to some corresponding phases that can always distinguish between those and their neighbors. Based on the unsupervised learning protocol we proposed [Phys. Rev. B 104, 165108 (2021)], the reduced latent representations of the inputs combined with the clustering algorithm show the connectedness or disconnectedness between neighboring clusters (phases) just corresponding to the continuous or disrupt quantum phase transition, respectively. This property reminds us of the behavior of order parameters. Moreover, in the silhouette analysis we show that the ferromagnetic states in the XXZ model with various anisotropy parameters correspond to almost the same silhouette value, while the critical or antiferromagnetic states behave quite differently. The analysis further indicates that the minima of silhouette values are close to the phase-transition points, showing strong positive correlation. These results again justify the usefulness of our proposed ML procedures, and they move us a step further toward understanding the relation between ML and quantum phase transitions from correlation function aspects.

TI RANK-DEFICIENT REPRESENTATIONS IN THE THETA CORRESPONDENCE OVER FINITE
   FIELDS ARISE FROM QUANTUM CODES
SO REPRESENTATION THEORY
AB Let V be a symplectic vector space and let mu be the oscillator representation of Sp(V). It is natural to ask how the tensor power representation mu(circle times t) decomposes. If V is a real vector space, then the theta correspondence asserts that there is a one-one correspondence between the irreducible sub-representations of Sp(V) and the irreps of an orthogonal group O(t). It is well-known that this duality fails over finite fields. Addressing this situation, Gurevich and Howe have recently assigned a notion of rank to each Sp(V) representation. They show that a variant of the Theta correspondence continues to hold over finite fields, if one restricts attention to subrepresentations of maximal rank. The nature of the rank-deficient components was left open. Here, we show that all rank-deficient Sp(V)-subrepresentations arise from embeddings of lower-order tensor products of mu and mu into mu(circle times t). The embeddings live on spaces that have been studied in quantum information theory as tensor powers of self-orthogonal Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) quantum codes. We then find that the irreducible Sp(V)-subrepresentations of mu(circle times t) are labelled by the irreps of orthogonal groups O(r) acting on certain r-dimensional spaces for r <= t. The results hold in odd charachteristic and the "stable range" t <= 1/2 dim V. Our work has implications for the representation theory of the Clifford group. It can be thought of as a generalization of the known characterization of the invariants of the Clifford group in terms of self-dual codes.

TI Entanglement, trace anomaly, and confinement in QCD
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We formulate confinement in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a transverse, entangling two-sphere of radius R-EE ; at this radius the QCD vacuum partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions-reaches its maximal entanglement entropy. Lattice-QCD determinations of the scalar (trace) gravita-tional form factors fix both R-EE and the transverse trace-anomaly density rho(h)(R-EE), yielding a parameter-free slope c = 8 pi R-2(EE) rho(2)(h)(R-EE ) and a mechanical entropy S-EE(y) c(h)y that grows linearly with rapidity y. The entropy gradient partial derivative S-R(EE) changes sign at R-EE ; it pushes colored degrees of freedom outward for r < R-EE and pulls them inward for r> RRE, thereby localizing them on the codimension-2 entangling two-sphere Sigma(perpendicular to) = (SREE)-R-2(which, in the infinite-momentum frame (IMF), projects onto the transverse plane) the "information wall." This provides a high-energy (large-y) entropic confinement diagnostic that complements rather than replaces Wilson's area-law criterion, which probes long-distance dynamics near the rest frame (y -> 0). Imposing unitarity on an entropic ansatz for the amplitude yields sigma (s) proportional to y(delta). World data favor delta= 2 for elastic pp(p (p) over bar) scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, whereas phi photoproduction favors a softer delta= 0.387 All extracted cross sections remain well below the Froissart-Martin bound. These results provide a confinement criterion quantified directly from nonperturbative QCD inputs, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.

TI Direct detection of spin polarization in photoinduced charge transfer
   through a chiral bridge
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB It is well assessed that the charge transport through a chiral potential barrier can result in spin-polarized charges. The possibility of driving this process through visible photons holds tremendous potential for several aspects of quantum information science, e.g., the optical control and readout of qubits. In this context, the direct observation of this phenomenon via spin-sensitive spectroscopies is of utmost importance to establish future guidelines to control photo-driven spin selectivity in chiral structures. Here, we provide direct proof that time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) can be used to detect long-lived spin polarization generated by photoinduced charge transfer through a chiral bridge. We propose a system comprising CdSe quantum dots (QDs), as a donor, and C-60, as an acceptor, covalently linked through a saturated oligopeptide helical bridge (chi) with a rigid structure of similar to 10 angstrom. Time-resolved EPR spectroscopy shows that the charge transfer in our system results in a C-60 radical anion, whose spin polarization maximum is observed at longer times with respect to that of the photogenerated C-60 triplet state. Notably, the theoretical modelling of the EPR spectra reveals that the observed features may be compatible with chirality-induced spin selectivity, but the electronic features of the QD do not allow the unambiguous identification of the CISS effect. Nevertheless, we identify which parameters need optimization for unambiguous detection and quantification of the phenomenon. This work lays the basis for the optical generation and direct manipulation of spin polarization induced by chirality.

TI Control of Morphology and Substrate Etching in InAs/InP Droplet Epitaxy
   Quantum Dots for Single and Entangled Photon Emitters
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB We present a detailed atomic-resolution study of morphology and substrate etching mechanism in InAs/InP droplet epitaxy quantum dots (QDs) grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy via cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (X-STM). Two different etching processes are observed depending on the crystallization temperature: local drilling and long-range etching. In local drilling occurring at temperatures of <= 500 degrees C, the In droplet locally liquefies the InP underneath and the P atoms can easily diffuse out of the droplet to the edges. During crystallization, the As atoms diffuse into the droplet and crystallize at the solid-liquid interface, forming an InAs etch pit underneath the QD. In long-range etching, occurring at higher temperatures of >500 degrees C, the InP layer is destabilized and the In atoms from the surroundings migrate toward the droplet. The P atoms can easily escape from the surface into the vacuum, forming trenches around the QD. We show for the first time the formation of trenches and long-range etching in InAs/InP QDs with atomic resolution. Both etching processes can be suppressed by growing a thin layer of InGaAs prior to the droplet deposition. The QD composition is estimated by finite element modeling in combination with X-STM. The change in the morphology of QDs due to etching can strongly influence the fine structure splitting. Therefore, the current atomic-resolution study sheds light on the morphology and etching behavior as a function of crystallization temperature and provides a valuable insight into the formation of InAs/InP droplet epitaxy QDs which have potential applications in quantum information technologies.

TI The baby universe is fine and the CFT knows it: on holography for closed
   universes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.A video abstract is available at https://youtu.be/s_9VqF-N8uQ.

TI Controlling exciton spontaneous emission of quantum dots by Au
   nanoparticles
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As an ideal single-photon source, quantum dots (QDs) can play a unique role in the field of quantum information. Controlling QD exciton spontaneous emission can be achieved by anti-phase coupling between QDexciton dipole field and Au dipole field after QD film has been transferred onto the Si substrate covered by Au nanoparticles. In experiment, the studied InAs/GaAs QDs are grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a(001) semi-insulation substrate. The films containing QDs with different GaAs thickness values are separatedfrom the GaAs substrate by etching away the AlAs sacrificial layer and transferring the QD film to the siliconwafer covered by Au nanoparticles with a diameter of 50 nm. The distance D (thickness of GaAs) from thesurface of the Au nanoparticles to the QD layer is 10, 15, 19, 25, and 35 nm, separately. A 640-nm pulsedsemiconductor laser with a 40-ps pulse length is used to excite the QD samples for measuring QD excitonphotoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra at 5 K. It is found that when the distance D is15-35 nm the spontaneous emission rate of exciton is suppressed. And when D is close to 19 nm, the QDspontaneous emission rate decreases to , which is consistent with the theoretical calculations. The physical mechanism of long-lived exciton luminescence observed in experiment lies in the fact that Au nanoparticlesscatter the light field of the exciton radiation in the QD wetting layer, and the phase of the scattered field is opposite to the phase of the exciton radiation field. Therefore, the destructive interference between the exciton radiation field and scattering field of Au nanoparticles results in long-lived exciton emission observed in experiment

TI Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystal Cavities in ZnSe Quantum Well
   Structures
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB ZnSe and related materials like ZnMgSe and ZnCdSe are promising II-VI host materials for optically mediated quantum information technology such as single photon sources (SPS) or spin qubits. Integrating these heterostructures into photonic crystal (PC) cavities enables further improvements, for example, realizing Purcell-enhanced SPS with increased quantum efficiency. Here, we report on the implementation of two-dimensional (2D) PC cavities in strained ZnSe quantum wells on top of a novel AlAs supporting layer. This approach overcomes typical obstacles associated with PC membrane fabrication in strained materials, such as cracks and strain relaxation in the corresponding devices. We demonstrate the attainment of the required mechanical stability in our PC devices, complete strain retainment, and effective vertical optical confinement. The structural analysis of our PC cavities reveals excellent etching anisotropy. Additionally, elemental mapping in a scanning transmission electron microscope confirms the transformation of AlAs into AlO x by postgrowth wet oxidation and reveals partial oxidation of ZnMgSe at the etched sidewalls in the PC. This knowledge is utilized to tailor finite domain time difference simulations and to extract the ZnMgSe dispersion relation with small oxygen content. Optical characterization of the PC cavities with cross-polarized resonance scattering verifies the presence of the cavity modes. The excellent agreement between simulation and measured cavity mode energies demonstrates the wide tunability of the PC cavity and proves the pertinence of our model. This implementation of 2D PC cavities in the ZnSe material system establishes a solid foundation for the future development of ZnSe quantum devices.

TI Probing the structure of vanadium tetracyanoethylene using electron
   energy-loss spectroscopy
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The molecule-based ferrimagnetic semiconductor vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE](x), x approximate to 2) has garnered interest from the quantum information community due to its excellent coherent magnonic properties and ease of on-chip integration. Despite these attractive properties, a detailed understanding of the electronic structure and mechanism for long-range magnetic ordering have remained elusive due to a lack of detailed atomic and electronic structural information. Previous studies via x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and the extended x-ray absorption fine structure have led to various proposed structures, and in general, V[TCNE](x) is believed to be a three-dimensional network of octahedrally coordinated V2+, each bonded to six TCNE molecules. Here, we elucidate the electronic structure, structural ordering, and degradation pathways of V[TCNE](x) films by correlating calculations of density functional theory (DFT) with scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) of V[TCNE](x) films. Low-loss EELS measurements reveal a bandgap and an excited state structure that agree quantitatively with DFT modeling, including an energy splitting between apical and equatorial TCNE ligands within the structure, providing experimental results directly backed by theoretical descriptions of the electronic structure driving the robust magnetic ordering in these films. Core-loss EELS confirms the presence of octahedrally coordinated V+2 atoms. Upon oxidation, changes in the C1s-pi* peak indicate that C=C of TCNE is preferentially attacked. Furthermore, we identify a relaxation of the structural ordering as the films age. These results lay the foundation for a more comprehensive and fundamental understanding of magnetic ordering and dynamics in these classes of metal-ligand compounds.

TI Quantum Field Thermal Machines
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent years have enjoyed an overwhelming interest in quantum thermodynamics, a field of research aimed at understanding thermodynamic tasks performed in the quantum regime. Further progress, however, seems to be obstructed by the lack of experimental implementations of thermal machines in which quantum effects play a decisive role. In this work, we introduce a blueprint of quantum field machines, which once experimentally realized would fill this gap. Even though the concept of the QFM presented here is very general and can be implemented in any many-body quantum system that can be described by a quantum field theory. We provide here a detailed proposal of how to realize a quantum machine in one-dimensional ultracold atomic gases, which consists of a set of modular operations giving rise to a piston. These can then be coupled sequentially to thermal baths, with the innovation that a quantum field takes up the role of the working fluid. In particular, we propose models for compression on the system to use it as a piston, and coupling to a bath that gives rise to a valve controlling heat flow. These models are derived within Bogoliubov theory, which allows us to study the operational primitives numerically in an efficient way. By composing the numerically modeled operational primitives we design complete quantum thermodynamic cycles that are shown to enable cooling and hence giving rise to a quantum field refrigerator. The active cooling achieved in this way can operate in regimes where existing cooling methods become ineffective. We describe the consequences of operating the machine at the quantum level and give an outlook of how this work serves as a road map to explore open questions in quantum information, quantum thermodynamic, and the study of non-Markovian quantum dynamics.

TI Nonlinear multimode photonics on-chip
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Nonlinear integrated photonics, which takes advantage of the strong field enhancement in integrated waveguides to boost the efficiency of nonlinear effects, has paved the way for the demonstration of cutting-edge applications. These achievements have also been made possible by the impressive progress in material engineering and fabrication processes, which have enabled a remarkable control of the nonlinear dynamics in the waveguides. While researchers initially focused their attention on single-mode devices, in recent years, the exploitation of nonlinear effects in integrated multimode waveguides has attracted significant interest. Indeed, the simultaneous use of different spatial modes of the same multimode waveguide has opened new avenues in the realization of integrated nonlinear processors, thanks to the ability to tune the dispersion profiles of the different modes. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in nonlinear multimode photonics on-chip. In the first part, we review the use of intermodal nonlinear effects for frequency generation. The use of intermodal nonlinear effects has been extensively reported, for example, for wavelength conversion for telecom applications, generation of photon pair sources for quantum optics and mid-infrared frequency generation. Then, we discuss several demonstrations of nonlinear multimode waveguides used to perform simultaneous multi-channel and multi-functional optical signal processing, such as nonlinear switching and logic operations. Next, supercontinuum generation in nonlinear multimode waveguides will be discussed. Finally, we report the use of high-quality-factor micro-resonators based on multimode waveguides for the realization of compact and widely-tunable integrated Raman lasers and optical frequency comb sources with record-low threshold power.

TI Orbital angular momentum splitter of light based on beam displacer
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, the high-dimensional properties of the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom of light have attracted extensive attention. This degree of freedom has been studied and used in many scientific fields, especially in optical communication and quantum information. In order to fully utilize the high-dimensional properties of orbital angular momentum, non-destructive separation of different orbital angular momentum states has become a fundamental requirement. However, the existing orbital angular momentum beam-splitting systems either lack stability and cascade expansibility, or the properties of the separated orbital angular momentum states are seriously damaged, thus failing to participate in further interaction processes. In this work, we construct a miniature Mach-Zehnder interferometer based on the beam displacer, and design an orbital angular momentum beam splitter, thereby realizing the non-destructive beam splitting of orbital angular momentum mode. In the orbital angular momentum splitter, the theoretical energy loss is zero because there exists only total reflection of the beam. The beam in the miniature Mach-Zehnder interferometer passes through the same optical element, and the spatial deviation of the beam is small, so the orbital angular momentum beam splitter has good stability. In addition, because the separated orbital angular momentum state has the same propagation direction as the incident orbital angular momentum state, the beam splitter has good extensibility and is easy to use in cascade. Our research result is of great significance in using the orbital angular momentum as a high-dimensional degree of freedom in optical communication and other related fields.

TI Controlling the helicity of light by electrical magnetization switching
SO NATURE
AB Controlling the intensity of emitted light and charge current is the basis of transferring and processing information1. By contrast, robust information storage and magnetic random-access memories are implemented using the spin of the carrier and the associated magnetization in ferromagnets2. The missing link between the respective disciplines of photonics, electronics and spintronics is to modulate the circular polarization of the emitted light, rather than its intensity, by electrically controlled magnetization. Here we demonstrate that this missing link is established at room temperature and zero applied magnetic field in light-emitting diodes2-7, through the transfer of angular momentum between photons, electrons and ferromagnets. With spin-orbit torque8-11, a charge current generates also a spin current to electrically switch the magnetization. This switching determines the spin orientation of injected carriers into semiconductors, in which the transfer of angular momentum from the electron spin to photon controls the circular polarization of the emitted light2. The spin-photon conversion with the nonvolatile control of magnetization opens paths to seamlessly integrate information transfer, processing and storage. Our results provide substantial advances towards electrically controlled ultrafast modulation of circular polarization and spin injection with magnetization dynamics for the next-generation information and communication technology12, including space-light data transfer. The same operating principle in scaled-down structures or using two-dimensional materials will enable transformative opportunities for quantum information processing with spin-controlled single-photon sources, as well as for implementing spin-dependent time-resolved spectroscopies.
   The helicity of light from a light-emitting diode can be electrically controlled by spin-orbit torque effects, enabling a seamless integration of magnetization dynamics with photonics.

TI Entanglement measures in a nonequilibrium steady state: Exact results in
   one dimension
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Entanglement plays a prominent role in the study of condensed matter many-body systems: Entanglement measures not only quantify the possible use of these systems in quantum information protocols, but also shed light on their physics. However, exact analytical results remain scarce, especially for systems out of equilibrium. In this work we examine a paradigmatic one-dimensional fermionic system that consists of a uniform tight-binding chain with an arbitrary scattering region near its center, which is subject to a DC bias voltage at zero temperature. The system is thus held in a current-carrying nonequilibrium steady state, which can nevertheless be described by a pure quantum state. Using a generalization of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture, we present an exact calculation of the bipartite entanglement entropy of a subsystem with its complement, and show that the scaling of entanglement with the length of the subsystem is highly unusual, containing both a volume-law linear term and a logarithmic term. The linear term is related to imperfect transmission due to scattering, and provides a generalization of the Levitov-Lesovik full counting statistics formula. The logarithmic term arises from the Fermi discontinuities in the distribution function. Our analysis also produces an exact expression for the particle-number-resolved entanglement. We find that although to leading order entanglement equipartition applies, the first term breaking it grows with the size of the subsystem, a novel behavior not observed in previously studied systems. We apply our general results to a concrete model of a tight-binding chain with a single impurity site, and show that the analytical expressions are in good agreement with numerical calculations. The analytical results are further generalized to accommodate the case of multiple scattering regions.

TI Pythonic Black-box Electronic Structure Tool (PyBEST). An open-source
   Python platform for electronic structure calculations at the interface
   between chemistry and physics
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Pythonic Black-box Electronic Structure Tool (PyBEST) represents a fully-fledged modern electronic structure software package developed at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun. The package provides an efficient and reliable platform for electronic structure calculations at the interface between chemistry and physics using unique electronic structure methods, analysis tools, and visualization. Examples are the (orbital-optimized) pCCD-based models for ground- and excited-states electronic structure calculations as well as the quantum entanglement analysis framework based on the single-orbital entropy and orbital-pair mutual information. PyBEST is written primarily in the Python programming language with additional parts written in C++, which are interfaced using Pybind11, a lightweight header-only library. By construction, PyBEST is easy to use, to code, and to interface with other software packages. Moreover, its modularity allows us to conveniently host additional Python packages and software libraries in future releases to enhance its performance. The electronic structure methods available in PyBEST are tested for the half-filled 1-D model Hamiltonian. The capability of PyBEST to perform large-scale electronic structure calculations is demonstrated for the model vitamin B-12 compound. The investigated molecule is composed of 190 electrons and 777 orbitals for which an orbital optimization within pCCD and an orbital entanglement and correlation analysis are performed for the first time.

   Nature of problem: Efficient and reliable modeling of electronic structures featuring both weakly- and strongly-correlated electrons. Small- and large-scale quantum-mechanical problems at the interface between chemistry and physics comprising both quantum chemical and model Hamiltonians. Specifically, modeling potential energy surfaces of complex electronic structures including bond breaking/formation, elucidating complex electronic structures through the picture of interacting orbitals, describing noncovalent interactions, ultra-cold trapped quantum gases, and a variety of applications in interdisciplinary quantum mechanical-based problems.
   Solution method: Modular implementation of a series of unconventional (and conventional) electronic structure models based on the pCCD ansatz to solve the electronic Schrodinger equation. These include the description of both ground- and excited-states, the determination of interaction energies, and the analysis and interpretation of electronic wavefunctions. All modules are implemented in the modern Python programming language, where bottleneck operations are handled by C++ code interfaced by the Pybind11 header-only library. The implemented (wavefunction) modules and modular code structure make PyBEST a very efficient alternative to existing electronic structure packages.
   Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: PyBEST features unconventional electronic structure methods (pCCD and post-pCCD methods) that are not available in any other quantum chemistry/physics software package. It also includes a general orbital entanglement and correlation module that supports both pCCD and selected post-pCCD methods. PyBEST is designed to be easy to use and code in. Due to its modularity (for instance of the tensor contraction engine), new Python modules and features can be straightforwardly imported and exploited without changing any wavefunction modules directly.

TI Femtosecond Laser Direct Writing of Bent Waveguides with High Curvature
   and Low Loss
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective Femtosecond laser direct writing (FLDW) has been widely used in material processing to improve material performance due to its high flexibility, true three-dimensional capability, and wide applicability to various materials. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) constructed by FLDW are advantageous in terms of high stability and strong resistance to interference, making them suitable for applications in optical interconnects, biosensing, quantum communication, and quantum simulation. With the continuous expansion and enrichment of these applications, miniaturization of photonic devices has become an inevitable trend. However, the integration density of PICs is significantly limited by the loss caused by large curvature waveguides (including 90 degrees bending, 180 degrees bending, and S-shaped bending) due to the low refractive index contrast of waveguides produced by single-shot FLDW. Although various methods have been reported to optimize the bending loss of large curvature waveguides, none of them can simultaneously meet the requirements of high integration density and wide applicability range. In this work, we employ a method of multiple laser modifications to enhance the refractive index contrast between the core and cladding of waveguides, optimize the cross-sectional refractive index distribution of the core, and achieve a bending loss as low as 0.64 dB/cm for S-shaped bent waveguides with a radius of 20 mm. Since the modification lines are written inside the waveguide and completely consistent with the bending shape and formation of the waveguide, this method possesses the characteristics of high integration density and wide applicability range, providing an important basis for the miniaturization of PICs.
   Methods This paper analyzes the causes of bending loss in waveguides and proposes a method of multiple laser modifications to enhance the refractive index contrast between the core and cladding of waveguides, optimizing the cross-sectional refractive index distribution of the core. Then, the mode field distribution within the bent waveguide and the bending loss of the bent waveguide before and after modification are simulated using professional optical waveguide simulation software, COMSOL and Rsoft, respectively. Finally, S-shaped bent waveguides and modification lines are written in alkaline-earth borosilicate glass using a 1030 nm femtosecond laser. By adjusting the scanning order, center spacing, writing power, angle, density, writing mode, and number of layers of both the waveguide and the modification lines, the mode conversion loss between the straight waveguide and the bent waveguide is effectively reduced, as well as the radiation loss of the bent waveguide. In addition, the central wavelength of the testing laser is set to 808 nm. After adjusting the laser to vertical polarization using a polarization controller, the laser is coupled into the waveguide through a polarization-maintaining fiber. The output light is received by a power meter after removing the scattered light using an iris filter.
   Results and Discussions In the simulation part, the bending loss of the modified bent waveguide is significantly reduced compared with the unmodified bent waveguide, as demonstrated by the comparison of bending losses before and after modification using Rsoft simulations (Fig.3). The waveguide parameters remain unchanged during the simulations. In the experimental section, cross-sectional microscope images of the bent waveguide before and after modification are compared (Fig.4), and it is observed that the dimensions of the two waveguides are similar, indicating that the added modification lines do not occupy any additional space outside the waveguide. In addition, we provide experimental and simulated mode field distributions before and after adding modification lines, and observe that after adding modification lines, the mode field of the bent waveguide is to some extent closer to the center of the waveguide. Subsequently, different writing orders for the modification lines and the waveguide are designed (Fig.5), and the minimum bending loss is achieved with the optimal writing order. Furthermore, considering the flexibility in writing the modification lines, experimental investigations are conducted on the center spacing between the modification lines and the waveguide, as well as the power of the modification lines (Fig.6), the density and angle of the modification lines (Fig.7), and the number of layers and writing mode of the modification lines (Fig.8). These parameters could alter the refractive index distribution of the bent waveguide cross section, thereby influencing the magnitude of bending loss. Therefore, by selecting appropriate parameter combinations, the bending loss can be minimized.
   Conclusions In this study, we employ a method of inscribing modification lines inside bent waveguides using femtosecond laser to reduce the bending loss. The power of 380 mW, the scanning speed of 40 mm/s, and the depth of 190 mu m are selected as writing parameters of the waveguide. Experimental results demonstrate that at a position of 20 mm, utilizing the optimal writing order and the side-writing approach, along with the innermost modification lines positioned at a center spacing of 0.3 mu m from the waveguide, a power of 300 mW , an encapsulation angle of 10 degrees, a density of 10 degrees, and a layer number of 2, the bending loss of the S-shaped bent waveguide could be reduced to 0.64 dB/cm. These experimental findings are consistent with the Rsoft simulation results . This method offers a more convenient and flexible option for integration in photonic chips, contributing to further improvements and advancements in their development and applications.</span>

TI Quantification of objective concentrations of DNA impurities in mRNA
   vaccines
SO VACCINE
AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the benefits and advantages of mRNA technologies in combination with lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems for vaccine development, revolutionizing the field. Vaccine mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription (IVT) is a cell-free process to produce plasmid-encoded mRNA by recombinant RNA polymerase activity. During mRNA vaccine manufacturing, the linearized plasmid DNA serving as template for IVT of vaccine mRNA, is enzymatically hydrolysed resulting in short digestion products that are removed, and residual amounts of template DNA remain as impurities in the vaccine product. These residual plasmid DNA quantities are defined as process- and product-related impurities and were subject of several discussions on various social media platforms. A recent study claimed to provide evidence for DNA impurities in mRNA vaccines exceeding permissible DNA concentrations by up to 534-fold. Due to the potential risk exceeding amounts of foreign DNA could pose for the safety of vaccinees as a consequence of an innate immune response, we set out to investigate the claims presented in this publication by attempting to reproduce the published data. Methods: We applied various methods including Qubit fluorimetric quantitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to accurately quantify RNA and DNA concentrations in several individual mRNA vaccine vials. Results: Our results reproducibly confirm DNA:RNA mass ratios of 1:1000 which is consistent with the specifications of the approved mRNA vaccine product. We demonstrate that earlier published claims of 534-fold higher amounts of DNA impurities in vaccine mRNA products are not correct and a consequence of extraordinary high RNA and lipid concentrations. According to our data, gathered by applying different, orthogonal methods, we provide evidence that the concentration of product-related DNA impurities in both approved mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax) coincide with the approved mRNA specifications.

TI NGS mutational status on first diagnostic tissue, liquid biopsy and
   mastectomy in G2-G3 breast cancer
SO ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY
AB Breast cancer is one of the more frequently diagnosed cancers leading to death in women, and, like other tumor types, it is heterogeneous in its immunophenotype. It harbors mutations that modify tumor aggressiveness, therapy responses, residual disease, drug resistance, and relapse rates in advanced stages. This study aims to assess the mutational status of G2 and G3 tumors using next-generation sequencing (NGS) on initial tissue biopsies, liquid biopsies, and mastectomy specimens. The histopathological (HP) diagnosis for the 32 selected cases was established via Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining by two observers. For the immunohistochemical (IHC) testing of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PGR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), we used the Ventana BenchMark Ultra. Ki67 testing was conducted using Bond-III from Leica. For cases with a score of 2+, gene amplification was assessed by silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (ISH) (SISH; Inform HER2 Dual ISH) on Ventana BenchMark Ultra. NGS analysis was initially performed on biopsies and plasma, and later on mastectomy specimens. After automated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, concentrations were measured using the Invitrogen Qubit system. Libraries were created using Oncomine systems, and sequencing and analysis were done with the Ion Torrent system. Most tumors were graded as G3 (19 cases), with Luminal A being the predominant molecular subtype, and a significant number displayed HER2/HER2-low characteristics (24 out of 32 cases). The NGS assessment showed that phosphatidylinositol4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutations were the most frequent across all sample types. A significant limitation was the high number of invalid plasma tests due to pre-analytical handling errors or transport issues. Nonetheless, plasma testing (liquid biopsy) proved useful for monitoring tumor evolution and assessing residual disease.

TI Pulsed blue light inactivates two strains of human coronavirus
SO JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY
AB Emerging evidence suggests that blue light has the potential to inactivate viruses. Therefore, we investigated the effect of 405 nm, 410 nm, 425 nm and 450 nm pulsed blue light (PBL) on human alpha coronavirus HCoV-229 E and human beta coronavirus HCoV-OC43, using Qubit fluorometry and RT-LAMP to quantitate the amount of nucleic acid in irradiated and control samples. Like SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are single stranded RNA viruses transmitted by air and direct contact; they have similar genomic sizes as SARS-CoV-2, and are used as surrogates for SARS-CoV-2. Irradiation was carried out either at 32.4 J cm(-2) using 3 mW cm(-2) irradiance or at 130 J cm(-2) using 12 mW cm(-2) irradiance. Results: (1) At each wavelength tested, PBL was antiviral against both coronavimses. (2) 405 nm light gave the best result, yielding 52.3% (2.37 log(10)) inactivation against HCoV-OC43 < .0001), and a significant 1.46 log(10) (44%) inactivation of HCoV-229E < .01). HCoV-OC43, which like SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, was more susceptible to PBL irradiation than alpha coronavirus HCoV-229E. The latter finding suggests that PBL is potentially antiviral against multiple coronavirus strains, and that, while its potency may vary from one virus to another, it seems more antiviral against beta coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43. (3) Further, the antiviral effect of PBL was better at a higher irradiance than a lower irradiance, and this indicates that with further refinement, a protocol capable of yielding 100% inactivation of viruses is attainable.

TI Modeling and mitigation of cross-talk effects in readout noise with
   applications to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
SO QUANTUM
AB Measurement noise is one of the main sources of errors in currently available quantum devices based on superconducting qubits. At the same time, the complexity of its characterization and mitigation often exhibits exponential scaling with the system size. In this work, we introduce a correlated measurement noise model that can be efficiently described and characterized, and which admits effective noise-mitigation on the level of marginal probability distributions. Noise mitigation can be performed up to some error for which we derive upper bounds. Characterization of the model is done efficiently using Diagonal Detector Overlapping Tomography - a generalization of the recently introduced Quantum Overlapping Tomography to the problem of reconstruction of readout noise with restricted locality. The procedure allows to characterize k-local measurement cross-talk on N-qubit device using O (k2(k) log (N)) circuits containing random combinations of X and identity gates. We perform experiments on 15 (23) qubits using IBM's (Rigetti's) devices to test both the noise model and the error-mitigation scheme, and obtain an average reduction of errors by a factor > 22 (> 5.5) compared to no mitigation. Interestingly, we find that correlations in the measurement noise do not correspond to the physical layout of the device. Furthermore, we study numerically the effects of readout noise on the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe in simulations that for numerous objective Hamiltonians, including random MAX-2-SAT instances and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the noisemitigation improves the quality of the optimization. Finally, we provide arguments why in the course of QAOA optimization the estimates of the local energy (or cost) terms often behave like uncorrelated variables, which greatly reduces sampling complexity of the energy estimation compared to the pessimistic error analysis. We also show that similar effects are expected for Haar-random quantum states and states generated by shallow-depth random circuits.

TI Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole
   evaporation with Page curve
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole (BH) evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (Alsing 2015 Class. Quantum Grav. 32 075010; Alsing and Fanto 2016 Class. Quantum Grav. 33 0150005) when the BH (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating BH internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the BH. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the BH modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number np0 of particles. For the final state of the system, the BH reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial BH. Inside the horizon there remains np0 Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the 'soft-hair' (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta et al (2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 181301), but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the BH, and in falling matter.

TI DFT simulations of photovoltaic parameters of dye-sensitized solar cells
   with new efficient sensitizer of indolo[3, 2-b]carbazole complexes
SO ENERGY SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB Developing economical and high-performing sensitizers is crucial in advancing dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and optoelectronics. This research paper explores the potential of novel red light-absorbing organic dyes based on Indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ) as the donor applied in co-sensitizer-free DSSCs for breakthroughs in photovoltaic (PV) applications. DFT and TD-DFT based computational methods were employed to calculate the conduction band levels, electron injection capabilities, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of metal-free organic dyes (ICZ1-ICZ9) having D-A-pi-A architecture. Comprehensive analyses included NBO, DOS, FMO, ICT, MEP, binding energy, and TDM analysis. Quantum chemical calculations of the structural, photochemical, and electrochemical properties, as well as the key parameters, reveals that all the designed dyes could be an excellent candidate for high-efficiency DSSCs due the small energy gap (2.130-1.947 eV), longer wavelength absorption (759.47-520.63 nm), longer lifetimes (15.65-6.67 ns), a lower Delta G(reg) (0.29-0.14 eV), a significant dipole moment changes (31.489-16.195D), LHE (0.95-0.46), the large q(CT) (0.962-0.689), small D-CT (7.657, 4.897 & Aring;), and V-OC (1.13-0.86 eV). This quantum simulation showed that, when compared to reference D8, the photovoltaic dyes ICZ8, ICZ2, and ICZ7 are recognized as being eye-catching. Furthermore, dye@(TiO2)(9) cluster model results demonstrate promising prospects for enhancing the photovoltaic (PV) performance of ICZ1-ICZ9 dyes by electron injection and conduction band (CB) engineering. This study will help the experimentalists for developing ICZ-based PVs as more efficient and sustainable energy solutions.

TI Exact dynamics of two holes in two-leg antiferromagnetic ladders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the motion of holes in a mixed-dimensional setup of an antiferromagnetic ladder, featuring nearest-neighbor hopping t along the ladders and Ising-type spin interactions along, J(parallel to), and across, J(perpendicular to), the ladder. We determine exact solutions for the low-energy one- and two-hole eigenstates. The presence of the trans-leg spin coupling, J(perpendicular to), leads to a linear confining potential between the holes. As a result, holes on separate legs feature a superlinear binding energy scaling as (J(perpendicular to)/t)(2/3) in the strongly correlated regime of J(perpendicular to),J(parallel to)<= t. This behavior is linked to an emergent length scale lambda proportional to(t/J(perpendicular to))1/3, stemming from the linear confining potential, and which describes how the size of the two-hole molecular state diverges for J(perpendicular to),J(parallel to)<< t. On the contrary, holes on the same leg unbind at sufficiently low spin couplings. This is a consequence of the altered short-range boundary condition for holes on the same leg, yielding an effective Pauli repulsion between them, limiting their kinetic energy and making binding unfavorable. Finally, we determine the exact nonequilibrium quench dynamics following the sudden immersion of initially localized nearest-neighbor holes. The dynamics is characterized by a crossover from an initial ballistic quantum walk to an aperiodic oscillatory motion around a finite average distance between the holes due to the confining potential between them. In the strongly correlated regime of low spin couplings, J(perpendicular to),J(parallel to)<= t, we find this asymptotic distance to diverge as t/J(perpendicular to), showing a much stronger scaling than the eigenstates. The predicted results should be amenable to state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments using currently implemented experimental techniques.

TI Illumina Sequencing in Conjunction with Propidium Monoazide to Identify
   Live Bacteria After Antiseptic Treatment in a Complex Oral Biofilm: A
   Study Using an Ex Vivo Supragingival Biofilm Model
SO ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB Background/Objectives: The evaluation of the efficacy of antibacterial treatments in complex oral ecosystems is limited by the inability to differentiate live from dead bacteria using omic techniques. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the ability of the combination of the 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing methodology and the action of propidium monoazide (PMA) to study viable bacterial profiles in oral biofilms after exposure to an antiseptic compound. Methods: Cariogenic supragingival biofilms were developed in an ex vivo model for 96 h, using saliva from healthy volunteers. The biofilms were treated with 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) combined with 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), for 60 s, using phosphate buffered saline as a control. After exposure, each biofilm was treated or not with PMA to then extract the bacterial DNA, quantify it by Qubit, quantify the bacterial population using qPCR, and perform the metataxonomic study of the samples using Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: A significantly lower DNA concentration in the PMA-treated biofilms (p < 0.05 compared with those not exposed to PMA) was observed. The viable bacterial count obtained by qPCR differed significantly from the total bacterial count in the biofilm samples exposed to the antiseptic (p < 0.05). The viable microbiome differed significantly from the total bacterial profile of the samples treated with CHX/CPC after exposure to PMA (p < 0.05 at the alpha- and beta-diversity levels). Conclusions: The combination of Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing and PMA helps solve the inability to evaluate the efficacy of antibacterial treatments in the bacterial profile of complex ecosystems such as oral biofilms.

TI The Challenge to Stabilize, Extract and Analyze Urinary Cell-Free DNA
   (ucfDNA) during Clinical Routine
SO DIAGNOSTICS
AB Background: The "Liquid Biopsy" has become a powerful tool for cancer research during the last decade. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that originates from tumors has emerged as one of the most promising analytes. In contrast to plasma-derived cfDNA, only a few studies have investigated urinary cfDNA. One reason might be rapid degradation and hence inadequate concentrations for downstream analysis. In this study, we examined the stability of cfDNA in urine using different methods of preservation under various storage conditions. Methodology: To mimic patient samples, a pool of healthy male and female urine donors was spiked with a synthetic cfDNA reference standard (fragment size 170 bp) containing the T790M mutation in the EGFR gene. Spiked samples were preserved with three different buffers and with no buffer over four different storage periods (0 h; 4 h; 12 h; 24 h) at room temperature vs. 4 degrees C. The preservatives used were Urinary Analyte Stabilizer (UAS, Novosanis, Wijnegem, Belgium), Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB, Zymo, Freiburg, Germany) and a self-prepared buffer called "AlloU". CfDNA was extracted using the QIAamp MinElute ccfDNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). CfDNA concentration was measured using the Qubit (TM) 4 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection and quantification of the T790M mutation. Results: Almost no spiked cfDNA was recoverable from samples with no preservation buffer and the T790M variant was not detectable in these samples. These findings indicate that cfDNA was degraded below the detection limit by urinary nucleases. Stabilizing buffers showed varying efficiency in preventing this degradation. The most effective stabilizing buffer under all storage conditions was the UAS, enabling adequate recovery of the T790M variant using ddPCR. Conclusion: From a technical point of view, stabilizing buffers and adequate storage conditions are a prerequisite for translation of urinary cfDNA diagnostics into clinical routine.

TI Entanglement Barrier and its Symmetry Resolution: Theory and
   Experimental Observation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The operator entanglement (OE) is a key quantifier of the complexity of a reduced density matrix. In out-of-equilibrium situations, e.g., after a quantum quench of a product state, it is expected to exhibit an entanglement barrier. The OE of a reduced density matrix initially grows linearly as entanglement builds up between the local degrees of freedom; it then reaches a maximum and ultimately decays to a small finite value as the reduced density matrix converges to a simple stationary state through standard thermalization mechanisms. Here, by performing a new data analysis of the published experimental results of Brydges et al. [Science 364, 260 (2019)], we obtain the first experimental estimation of the OE of a subsystem reduced density matrix in a quantum many-body system. We employ the randomized-measurements toolbox and we introduce and develop a new efficient method to postprocess experimental data in order to extract higher-order density-matrix functionals and access the OE. The OE thus obtained displays the expected barrier as long as the experimental system is large enough. For smaller systems, we observe a barrier with a double-peak structure, the origin of which can be interpreted in terms of pairs of quasiparticles being reflected at the boundary of the qubit chain. As U(1) symmetry plays a key role in our analysis, we introduce the notion of symmetry-resolved operator entanglement (SROE), in addition to the total OE. To gain further insights into the SROE, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of this new quantity in chains of noninteracting fermions, which, in spite of their simplicity, capture most of the main features of OE and SROE. In particular, we uncover three main physical effects: the presence of a barrier in any charge sector, a time delay for the onset of the growth of SROE, and an effective equipartition between charge sectors.

TI Molecular diagnostics of Salmonella and Campylobacter in
   human/animal fecal samples remain feasible after long-term sample
   storage without specific requirements
SO AIMS MICROBIOLOGY
AB Rapid advances in the development of sequencing technologies, numbers of commercial providers and diminishing costs have made DNA-based identification and diagnostics increasingly accessible to doctors and laboratories, eliminating the need for local investments in expensive technology and training or hiring of skilled technicians. However, reliable and comparable molecular analyses of bacteria in stool samples are dependent on storage and workflow conditions that do not introduce post-sampling bias, the most important factor being the need to keep the DNA at a stable detectable level. For that reason, there may remain other prohibitively costly requirements for cooling or freezing equipment or special chemical additives.
   This study investigates the diagnostic detectability of Salmonella and Campylobacter DNA in human, pig and chicken stool samples, stored at different temperatures and with different preservation methods. Stool samples were spiked with 106 CFU/mL of both Salmonella and Campylobacter strains stored at -20 degrees C, 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C (Room temperature, RT) and treated with either RNAlater, EDTA or Silica/ethanol. DNA was extracted at 9 different time points within 30 days and quantified by Qubit (total DNA) and qPCR (Salmonella and Campylobacter DNA). We found no statistically significant differences among the different preservation methods, and DNA from both species was easily detected at all time points and at all temperatures, both with and without preservation. This suggests that infections by these bacteria can be diagnosed and possibly also analysed in further detail simply by taking a stool sample in any suitable sealed container that can be transported to laboratory analysis without special storage or preservation requirements. We briefly discuss how this finding can benefit infection control in both developed and developing countries.

TI A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime
SO NATURE
AB Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models1, which are fundamental to modern condensed-matter physics2,3. Despite notable advancements4, 5-6, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogues are still too high to address many open problems7, 8, 9-10. Here we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature6,11, 12-13, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low-entropy product state into strongly correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters14,15, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically10. At half-filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturation, leading to a temperature of T/t=0.05-0.05+0.06\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$T/t=0.0{5}_{-0.05}<^>{+0.06}$$\end{document} based on comparisons with numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations9. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations16, 17-18. Compared with the cuprates2,19,20, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, at which physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected3,19,21, 22, 23-24. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics8,10.

TI Squeezing the angular momentum of an ensemble of complex multilevel
   atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Squeezing of collective atomic spins has been shown to improve the sensitivity of atomic clocks and magnetometers to levels significantly below the standard quantum limit. In most cases the requisite atom-atom entanglement has been generated by dispersive interaction with a quantized probe field or by state-dependent collisions in a quantum gas. Such experiments typically use complex multilevel atoms like Rb or Cs, with the relevant interactions designed so that atoms behave like pseudospin-1/2 particles. We demonstrate the viability of spin squeezing for collective spins composed of the physical angular momenta of 10(6) Cs atoms, each in an internal spin-4 hyperfine state. A peak metrological squeezing of at least 5dB is generated by quantum backaction from a dispersive quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement, implemented using a two-color optical probe that minimizes tensor light shifts without sacrificing measurement strength. Other significant developments include the successful application of composite pulse techniques for accurate dynamical control of the collective spin, enabled by broadband suppression of background magnetic fields inside a state-of-the-art magnetic shield. The absence of classical noise allows us to compare the observed quantum projection noise and squeezing to a theoretical model that properly accounts for both the relevant atomic physics and the spatial mode of the collective spin, finding good quantitative agreement and thereby validating its use in other contexts. Our work sets the stage for experiments on quantum feedback, deterministic squeezing, and closed-loop magnetometry. The implementation of real-time feedback may also create an opportunity for new types of quantum simulation, wherein the evolution of a quantum system is conditioned on the outcome of a time-continuous QND measurement. Such a scheme has the potential to access new regimes near the quantum-classical boundary, with opportunities to study long-standing issues related to quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems.

TI Experimental study of coherent manipulation in 87Rb
   Bose-Einstein condensate with phase difference of double stimulated
   Raman adiabatic passage
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In this paper, we develop a new method to adjust the Raman coupling strength by using the relative phase between two pairs of Raman lasers. The stimulated Raman transition process is highly controllable and has the characteristics of multiple degrees of freedom. In experiments on ultracold atoms, the populations of atomic energy levels can be adjusted by taking an appropriate Raman light intensity and interaction time, and by detuning the two-photon frequency. The intensity of the Raman laser is usually changed to adjust the Raman coupling strength. Based on two-level atoms, a new method of accurately controlling the Raman coupling strength by using the relative phase between two pairs of Raman light beams is developed. This technology can achieve coherent manipulation of atomic quantum states, which greatly broadens the ability of ultracold atoms to perform quantum simulations. First, the Rb-87 Bose-Einstein condensate is realized by using an optical dipole trap. Then, the two pairs of Raman lasers are designed with a special optical path to keep the relative phase of the two pairs of Raman lasers stable in the transmission process, and can be controlled accurately. Then the two pairs of Raman light beams act on the two ground state hyperfine energy levels vertical bar 1,1 > and vertical bar 1, 0 > of the Rb-87 atom. In the experiment, we observe the relation between the percentage of atoms in the two quantum states and the relative phase between the two pairs of Raman light beams. This method provides a unique control parameter for ultracold atom quantum simulation experiments, which is the laser phase. It is hoped that this technology can be used to manipulate the interaction between light and atoms in the future to achieve more abundant physical phenomena.

TI CHARACTERISATION OF IGF-1 (RS7136446) AND IL-6
   (RS1800795) POLYMORPHISMS AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS IN WESTERN
   ALGERIA
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide, including Algeria. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been linked to higher risk of BC. Several studies have been performed on the insulin- like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) T > C (rs7136446) and the interleukin 6 (IL-6 ) 174 G > C (rs1800795) SNPs to explore their role in BC. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the 2 SNPs, IL-6 (rs1800795) and IGF-1 (rs7136446) with BC in the population of western Algeria. This study was carried out for the first time among the Algerian population. This case-control study included 109 BC patients and 112 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. DNA concentration was determined using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. The genotyping of selected SNPs was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by statistical analysis to assess genotypic frequencies and genetic association with BC. The results showed that IGF-1 rs7136446 was positively associated with BC (p = 0.00001) and that the distribution of genotype frequencies of rs7136446 showed a statistically difference between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive and HER-2 negative BC (p = 0.04), but this association did not last after the correction of Bonferroni. No association was found in genotype distribution of the IL-6 (rs1800795) among controls and BC patients or with clinicopathological parameters including HER-2 status in BC (p > 0.05). In summary, our findings indicate that IGF-1 rs7136446 is associated with BC in our population of western Algeria.

TI Evolution of flat bands in MoSe2/WSe2 moiré lattices: A study combining
   machine learning and band unfolding methods
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Moir & eacute; lattices have served as the ideal quantum simulation platform for exploring novel physics due to the flat electronic bands resulting from the long-wavelength moir & eacute; potentials. However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir & eacute; patterns of MoSe2/WSe2 by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H stacking at a twist angle of 3.89 degrees without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15 degrees. Multiple ultraflat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7 degrees. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultraflat bands formed by the F and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The F-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13 degrees) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.

TI A detailed investigation of dielectric-modulated dual-gate TMD FET based
   label-free biosensor via analytical modelling
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this work, an analytical model is developed for DM-DG-TMD-FET- based Biosensor including Fringing-field effects. The Analytical model has been developed for two different Device structures, namely Device structure-1 (without a gate above the nano-cavity) and Device structure-2 (with a gate above the nano-cavity) based on modulation of the dielectric constant of biomolecules in the nano-cavity region. The proposed model has been validated against both numerical quantum simulation results with the help of a few fitting parameters and it also agrees with the 2-dimensional numeric simulator SILVACO TCAD used in this work. The presence/absence of biomolecules has been detected by the metric of threshold voltage sensitivity SVth and drain current Id for the neutral as well as charged biomolecules. Sensitivities of partially filled nano-cavities arising out of steric hindrance in both the biosensors are compared. Optimization of device dimensions has also been included in this work to enhance the sensitivity of the biosensors. It has been witnessed that the sensitivity of the proposed biosensor is similar to 100% higher in Device structure-1 for neutral biomolecules with dielectric constant kappa = 12, when compared to Device structure-2 for fully filled cavities. Whereas for the charged biomolecules, Device structure-1 shows similar to 50% enhanced sensitivity than Device structure-2 for Nf=-1x10-12C/cm2. Device structure-1 demonstrates similar to 120% higher sensitivity than Device structure-2 with partially filled cavities (i.e. 66% filled cavity). Finally, benchmarking of the proposed biosensor is presented with contemporary, state-of-the-art biosensors and it is highlighted that MoS2 FET-based biosensor emerges with a superior sensitivity of SVth = 0.81 V for kappa=12.

TI Resource Theory of Heat and Work with Non-commuting Charges
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We consider a theory of quantum thermodynamics with multiple conserved quantities (or charges). To this end, we generalize the seminal results of Sparaciari et al. (Phys. Rev. A 96:052112, 2017) to the case of multiple, in general non-commuting charges, for which we formulate a resource theory of thermodynamics of asymptotically many non-interacting systems. To every state we associate the vector of its expected charge values and its entropy, forming the phase diagram of the system. Our fundamental result is the Asymptotic Equivalence Theorem, which allows us to identify the equivalence classes of states under asymptotic approximately charge-conserving unitaries with the points of the phase diagram. Using the phase diagram of a system and its bath, we analyze the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. In particular, we show that to attain the second law, an asymptotically large bath is necessary. In the case that the bath is composed of several identical copies of the same elementary bath, we quantify exactly how large the bath has to be to permit a specified work transformation of a given system, in terms of the number of copies of the "elementary bath " systems per work system (bath rate). If the bath is relatively small, we show that the analysis requires an extended phase diagram exhibiting negative entropies. This corresponds to the purely quantum effect that at the end of the process, system and bath are entangled, thus permitting classically impossible transformations (unless the bath is enlarged). For a large bath, or many copies of the same elementary bath, system and bath may be left uncorrelated and we show that the optimal bath rate, as a function of how tightly the second law is attained, can be expressed in terms of the heat capacity of the bath. Our approach solves a problem from earlier investigations about how to store the different charges under optimal work extraction protocols in physically separate batteries.

TI Spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal-organic frameworks above
   microsecond phase memory time
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB With the aim of creating Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal-organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5 %, 2 %, 1 %, and 0.1 % mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite-type MOF [CH6N3][ZnII(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g-factors (gx=2.07, gy=2.12, and gz=2.44) in the S=1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (tau) of 3.5 ms (5 % Cu), 9.2 ms (2 % Cu), and 15 ms (1 % Cu) at 1.8 K. Furthermore, pulse-ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin-spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21 mu s (2 %Cu), 0.39 mu s (1 %Cu), and 3.0 mu s (0.1 %Cu) at 10 K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS=+/- 1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)-doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50 K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the magnetic dipole interactions relating with cross-relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.
   This work demonstrates the occurrence of both magnetic relaxation and spin coherence on single-ion Cu(II) centers in the three-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) having phase memory time above microsecond. It provides a new platform for the application of MOFs as spin quantum materials having fine-tuning ability.image

TI Macroproperties vs. microstates in the classical simulation of critical
   phenomena in quench dynamics of 1D Ising models
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the tractability of classically simulating critical phenomena in the quench dynamics of one-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) using highly truncated matrix product states (MPSs). We focus on two paradigmatic examples: a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that occurs in nonintegrable long-range TFIMs, and the infinite-time correlation length of the integrable nearest-neighbor TFIM when quenched to the critical point, where the quantities of interest involve equal time one- and two- point correlation functions, which we associate with macroproperties. For the DQPT, we show that the order parameters can be efficiently simulated with heavy truncation of the MPS bond dimension. This can be used to reliably extract critical properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, even when the full many-body state is not simulated with high fidelity. The long-time correlation length near the critical point is more sensitive to the full many-body state fidelity, and generally requires a large bond dimension MPS. Nonetheless, this can still be efficiently simulated with strongly truncated MPS because it can be extracted from the short-time behavior of the dynamics where entanglement is low. Our results provide illustrations of scenarios where accurate calculation of the full many-body state (microstate) is intractable due to the volume-law growth of entanglement, yet a precise specification of an exact microstate may not be required when simulating macroproperties that play a role in phases of matter of many-body systems. We also study the tractability of simulation using truncated MPS based on quantum chaos and equilibration in the models. We find a counterintuitive inverse relationship, whereby local expectation values are most easily approximated for chaotic systems whose exact many-body state is most intractable.

TI Results and lessons from dual extraction of DNA and RNA from
   formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissues for a large Cancer
   epidemiologic study
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background The use of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues has become a common practice in clinical and epidemiologic genetic research. Simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from FFPE tissues is appealing but can be practically challenging. Here we report our results and lessons learned from processing FFPE breast tumor tissues for a large epidemiologic study. Methods Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit was adapted for dual extraction using tissue punches or sections from breast tumor tissues. The yield was quantified using Qubit and fragmentation analysis by Agilent Bioanalyzer. A subset of the DNA samples were used for genome-wide DNA methylation assays and RNA samples for sequencing. The QC metrices and performance of the assays were analyzed with pre-analytical variables. Results A total of 1859 FFPE breast tumor tissues were processed. We found it critical to adjust proteinase K digestion time based on tissue volume to achieve balanced yields of DNA and RNA. Tissue punches taken from tumor-enriched regions provided the most reliable output. A median of 1475 ng DNA and 1786 ng RNA per sample was generated. The median DNA integrity number (DIN) was 3.8 and median DV200 for RNA was 33.2. Of 1294 DNA samples used in DNA methylation assays, 97% passed quality check by qPCR and 92% generated data deemed high quality. Of the 130 RNA samples with DV200 >= 20% used in RNA-sequencing, all but 5 generated usable transcriptomic data with a mapping rate >= 60%. Conclusions Dual DNA/RNA purification using Qiagen AllPrep FFPE extraction protocol is feasible for clinical and epidemiologic studies. We recommend tissue punches as a reliable source material and fine tuning of proteinase K digestion time based on tissue volume. Impact Our protocol and recommendations may be adapted by future studies for successful extraction of archived tumor tissues.

TI Dirac Cones and Room Temperature Polariton Lasing Evidenced in an
   Organic Honeycomb Lattice
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Artificial 1D and 2D lattices have emerged as a powerful platform for the emulation of lattice Hamiltonians, the fundamental study of collective many-body effects, and phenomena arising from non-trivial topology. Exciton-polaritons, bosonic part-light and part-matter quasiparticles, combine pronounced nonlinearities with the possibility of on-chip implementation. In this context, organic semiconductors embedded in microcavities have proven to be versatile candidates to study nonlinear many-body physics and bosonic condensation, and in contrast to most inorganic systems, they allow the use at ambient conditions since they host ultra-stable Frenkel excitons. A well-controlled, high-quality optical lattice is implemented that accommodates light-matter quasiparticles. The realized polariton graphene presents with excellent cavity quality factors, showing distinct signatures of Dirac cone and flatband dispersions as well as polariton lasing at room temperature. This is realized by filling coupled dielectric microcavities with the fluorescent protein mCherry. The emergence of a coherent polariton condensate at ambient conditions are demonstrated, taking advantage of coupling conditions as precise and controllable as in state-of-the-art inorganic semiconductor-based systems, without the limitations of e.g. lattice matching in epitaxial growth. This progress allows straightforward extension to more complex systems, such as the study of topological phenomena in 2D lattices including topological lasers and non-Hermitian optics.
   This study presents a precisely controlled 2D optical lattice for the study of exciton-polaritons at room-temperature, using a fluorescent protein in a microcavity to achieve excellent cavity quality and showcase polariton lasing. Providing insights into nonlinear many-body physics and bosonic condensation, with potential applications e.g. in topological lasers, this work marks a notable step forward in the advancement of room temperature photonic and polaritonic lattice physics, opening avenues for diverse optoelectronic devices. image

TI Selective active resonance tuning for multi-mode nonlinear photonic
   cavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Resonant enhancement of nonlinear photonic processes is critical for the scalability of applications such as long-distance entanglement generation. To implement nonlinear resonant enhancement, multiple resonator modes must be individually tuned onto a precise set of process wavelengths, which requires multiple linearly -independent tuning methods. Using coupled auxiliary resonators to indirectly tune modes in a multi -resonant nonlinear cavity is particularly attractive because it allows the extension of a single physical tuning mechanism, such as thermal tuning, to provide the required independent controls. Here we model and simulate the performance and tradeoffs of a coupled -resonator tuning scheme which uses auxiliary resonators to tune specific modes of a multi -resonant nonlinear process. Our analysis determines the tuning bandwidth for steady-state mode field intensity can significantly exceed the inter -cavity coupling rate g if the total quality factor of the auxiliary resonator is higher than the multi -mode main resonator. Consequently, over -coupling a nonlinear resonator mode to improve the maximum efficiency of a frequency conversion process will simultaneously expand the auxiliary resonator tuning bandwidth for that mode, indicating a natural compatibility with this tuning scheme. We apply the model to an existing small -diameter triply -resonant ring resonator design and find that a tuning bandwidth of 136 GHz approximate to 1.1 nm can be attained for a mode in the telecom band while limiting excess scattering losses to a quality factor of 10 6 . Such range would span the distribution of inhomogeneously broadened quantum emitter ensembles as well as resonator fabrication variations, indicating the potential for the auxiliary resonators to enable not only low -loss telecom conversion but also the generation of indistinguishable photons in a quantum network.

TI Ab initio modeling of nonequilibrium dynamics in
   superconducting detectors and qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics are central to the operation of superconducting devices. Superconducting detectors, such as superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, transition-edge sensors, or microwave kinetic inductance detectors, perform best when a large quasiparticle population is generated in response to small perturbations. Conversely, for superconducting qubits and topologically protected Majorana fermions, even relatively small quasiparticle densities can lead to significant performance degradation. Hence, ideal materials for these devices would be less susceptible to quasiparticle poisoning. However, existing models of these devices often rely on approximations and phenomenology. Therefore, they lack a rigorous description of the underlying quasiparticle and phonon dynamics that are responsible for device performance. In this article, we combine kinetic equations with density functional theory to model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film ab initio. To demonstrate the universality of our model, we illustrate two independent example applications: (1) we develop a theoretical model describing the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires, and (2) we calculate the energy-relaxation rate of a transmon qubit due to the presence of excess quasiparticles. Our examples demonstrate from first principles that niobium nitride is well suited to be used for single-photon detection and that tantalum transmon qubits possess reduced sensitivity to quasiparticle poisoning relative to other materials, which is likely in part responsible for their longer coherence times. In contrast to previous models of superconducting devices, our ab initio approach makes predictions of device performance without experimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device development. Moreover, by considering the full-bandwidth electron-phonon coupling, our approach can incorporate strong-coupling effects. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications.

TI Probing Hundreds of Individual Quantum Defects in Polycrystalline and
   Amorphous Alumina
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) are present in the materials of qubits and are considered defects because they limit qubit coherence. For superconducting qubits, the quintessential Josephson junction barrier is made of amorphous alumina, which hosts TLSs. However, TLSs are not generally understood, either structurally or in atomic composition. In this study, we greatly extend the quantitative data available on TLSs by reporting on the physical dipole moment in two alumina types: polycrystalline gamma-Al2O3 and amorphous a-AlOx. To obtain the dipole moments p(z), rather than the less-structural coupling parameter g, we tune individual TLSs with a known external electric field in a cavity quantum electrodynamic system. We find a clear difference in the dipole moment distribution from the film types, indicating a difference in TLS structures. A large sample of approximately 400 individual TLSs are analyzed from the polycrystalline film type. Their dipoles along the growth direction p(z) have a mean value of 2.6 +/- 0.3 debye (D) (0.54 +/- 0.06 e angstrom) and standard deviation sigma = 1.6 +/- 0.2 D (0.33 +/- 0.03 e angstrom). The material distribution fits well to a single Gaussian function. Approximately 200 individual TLSs are analyzed from amorphous films. Both the mean p(z) = 4.6 +/- 0.5 D (0.96 +/- 0.1 e angstrom) and sigma = 2.5 +/- 0.3 D (0.52 +/- 0.05 e angstrom) are larger. Amorphous alumina also has very large p(z), greater than 8.6 D (1.8 e angstrom), in contrast to polycrystalline which has none of this moment. These large moments agree only with oxygen-based TLS models. Based on data and the candidate models (delocalized O and hydrogen-based TLSs), we find polycrystalline alumina has smaller ratio of O-based to H-based TLS than amorphous alumina.

TI Complexity-Constrained Quantum Thermodynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of realizing a quantum process, such as preparing a state or implementing a unitary. We present an approach to quantifying the thermodynamic resources required to implement a process if the process's complexity is restricted. We focus on the prototypical task of information erasure, or Landauer erasure, wherein an n-qubit memory is reset to the all-zero state. We show that the minimum thermodynamic work required to reset an arbitrary state in our model, via a complexity-constrained process, is quantified by the state's complexity entropy. The complexity entropy therefore quantifies a trade-off between the work cost and complexity cost of resetting a state. If the qubits have a nontrivial (but product) Hamiltonian, the optimal work cost is determined by the complexity relative entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the amount of randomness a system appears to have to a computationally limited observer. Similarly, the complexity relative entropy quantifies such an observer's ability to distinguish two states. We prove elementary properties of the complexity (relative) entropy. In a random circuit-a simple model for quantum chaotic dynamics-the complexity entropy transitions from zero to its maximal value around the time corresponding to the observer's computational-power limit. Also, we identify information-theoretic applications of the complexity entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the resources required for data compression if the compression algorithm must use a restricted number of gates. We further introduce a complexity conditional entropy, which arises naturally in a complexity-constrained variant of information-theoretic decoupling. Assuming that this entropy obeys a conjectured chain rule, we show that the entropy bounds the number of qubits that one can decouple from a reference system, as judged by a computationally bounded referee. Overall, our framework extends the resource-theoretic approach to thermodynamics to integrate a notion of time, as quantified by complexity.

TI A Novel Blockchain and Bi-Linear Polynomial-Based QCP-ABE Framework for
   Privacy and Security over the Complex Cloud Data
SO SENSORS
AB As a result of the limited resources available in IoT local devices, the large scale cloud consumer's data that are produced by IoT related machines are contracted out to the cloud. Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud-data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large-data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non-linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non- polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding. Compared to existing models, the real-time simulation results demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90% in terms of bit change and more precise than 95% in terms of dynamic key generation, encipherment, and decipherment time.

TI 100Gb/s dynamically programmable SDN-enabled hardware encryptor for
   optical networks
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB We have successfully demonstrated an on-demand programmable hardware encryptor for optical networks enabled by the software-defined network (SDN) and tested its application in a quantum key distribution (QKD) use case. We believe our proposed encryptor is unique in the way that it combines on-demand programmable encryption algorithms with a 100G Ethernet network interface to provide a high-transmission capacity with flexible security. We have successfully formed an on-demand encryption library consisting of AES-256, AES-192, AES-128, Camellia-256, XOR, and no-encryption configurations. Our system has shown a network throughput of 91.3 Gb/s for AES variations and 90.2 Gb/s for Camellia-256, while theoretical encryption throughputs were 160 Gb/s. In addition, the goodputs of all the encryption schemes were measured as at least 90.4 Gb/s. For a faster reconfiguration of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA), partial reconfiguration technology has been used, and reconfiguration times of 2.6 s for encryption and 2 s for decryption have been achieved. The FPGA configuration rate was 3.35 MB/s. When our proposed design was tested in a QKD use case with 256-bit keys, the highest achieved key consumption rate was 27 keys/s, which corresponded to the minimum granularity of 474 MB per key. Thus, with a 256-bit key, up to a 6912 b/s key consumption rate was achieved. In addition, the encryptor's end-to-end network latency has been tested using 300k standard Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) pings. For all encryption schemes, the latency was measured as 0.093 ms +/- 0.028 ms on average, but the encryption/decryption processes did not have a meaningful latency impact with microsecond precision.

TI A noise-robust post-processing pipeline for accelerated phase-cycled
   23Na Multi-Quantum Coherences MRI
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR MEDIZINISCHE PHYSIK
AB Purpose: To develop an improved post-processing pipeline for noise-robust accelerated phase-cycled Cartesian Single (SQ) and Triple Quantum (TQ) sodium (23Na) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of in vivo human brain at 7 T. Theory and Methods: Our pipeline aims to tackle the challenges of 23Na Multi-Quantum Coherences (MQC) MRI including low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and time-consuming Radiofrequency (RF) phase-cycling. Our method combines low- rank k-space denoising for SNR enhancement with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to robustly separate SQ and TQ signal components. This separation is crucial for computing the TQ/SQ ratio, a key parameter of 23Na MQC MRI. We validated our pipeline in silico, in vitro and in vivo in healthy volunteers, comparing it with conventional denoising and Fourier transform (FT) methods. Additionally, we assessed its robustness through ablation experiments simulating a corrupted RF phase-cycle step. Results: Our denoising algorithm doubled SNR compared to non-denoised images and enhanced SNR by up to 29% compared to Wavelet denoising. The low-rank approach produced high-quality images even at later echo times, allowing reduced signal averaging. DMD effectively separated the SQ and TQ signals, even with missing RF phase cycle steps, resulting in superior Structural Similarity (SSIM) of 0 89 0 024 and lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0 055 0 008 compared to conventional FT methods (SSIM=0 71 0 061, RMSE=0 144 0 036). This pipeline enabled high-quality 8x8x15mm3 in vivo 23Na MQC MRI, with a reduction in acquisition time from 48 to 10 min at 7 T. Conclusion: The proposed pipeline improves robustness in 23Na MQC MRI by exploiting low-rank properties to denoise signals and DMD to effectively separate SQ and TQ signals. This approach ensures high-quality MR images of both SQ and TQ components, even in accelerated and incomplete RF phase-cycling cases.

TI A hybrid encryption framework leveraging quantum and classical
   cryptography for secure transmission of medical images in IoT-based
   telemedicine networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the transmission of medical reports in the form of scan images for collaborative diagnosis is vital for any telemedicine network. In this context, ensuring secure transmission and communication is necessary to protect medical data to maintain privacy. To address such privacy concerns and secure medical images against cyberattacks, this research presents a robust hybrid encryption framework that integrates quantum, and classical cryptographic methods. The proposed framework not only secure medical data against cyber threats but also protects the secret security keys. Initially, a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is employed to generate a shared key, which is then used to secure the symmetric keys via One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption. Next, bit-planes are extracted from each color component. The rows and columns of the extracted bit-planes are scrambled using random sequences which are generated by a 6D hyperchaotic Chen system and the Ikeda map. To further increase confusion in the original data, multiple-step pixel scrambling operations such as pixel shuffling, pixel value shuffling, and rotational and flipping operations are implemented. After the confusion phase, a combination of affine transformations with non-linear functions, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with complex modulation, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with random phase modulation, bilinear transformation, and nonlinear polynomial mapping are employed to create diffusion in the scrambled components. These multiple encryption operations aim to maximize randomness in the final ciphertext image. Additionally, to reduce computational complexity, only the Most Significant Bit-Planes (MSBs) are encrypted, as they contain more than 94% of the plaintext information. Several experimental results and analyses are conducted to assess the proposed encryption framework, including entropy analysis, key sensitivity analysis, correlation analysis lossless analysis, and histogram analysis. Furthermore, the framework is tested against various cyberattacks such as brute-force attacks, clipping attacks, and noise attacks on the ciphertext images, to demonstrate its resilience against such threats.

TI Demonstration of Quantum Polarized Microscopy Using an Entangled-Photon
   Source
SO PHOTONICS
AB With the advancement of non-classical light sources such as single-photon and entangled-photon sources, innovative microscopy based on quantum principles has been proposed for traditional microscopy. This paper introduces the experimental demonstration of a quantum polarization microscopic technique that incorporates a quantum-entangled photon source. Although the point that employs the variation in polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the sample is similar to classical polarization microscopy, the method for constructing the image contrast is significantly different. The image contrast is constructed by the coincidence count of signal and idler photons. In the case that the coincidence count is recorded from both the signal and idler photons, the photon statistics resemble a thermal state, similar to the blackbody radiation, but with a significantly higher peak intensity in the second-order autocorrelation function at zero delay that is derived from the coincidence count, while, when the coincidence count is taken from either the signal or idler photon only, although the photon state exhibits a thermal state again, the photon statistics become more dispersive and result in a lower peak intensity of the autocorrelation function. These different thermal states can be switched by slightly changing the photon polarization, which is suddenly aroused within a narrow range of the analyzer angle. The autocorrelation function g2(0) at the thermal state exhibits a sensitivity that is three times higher compared to the classical coincidence count rate, and this concept can be effectively utilized to enhance the contrast of the image. One of the key achievements of our proposed method is ensuring a low power of illumination (in the order of Pico-joules) for constructing the image. In addition, the robustness without any precise setup is also favorable for practical use. This polarization microscopic technique can provide a superior imaging technique compared to the classical method, opening a new frontier for research in material sciences, biology, and other fields requiring high-resolution imaging.

TI Phase-Slip Lines and Anomalous Josephson Effects in Tungsten Nanoscale
   Cluster-Based Topological Insulator Nanobridges: Implications for
   Topologically Protected Qubits and Quantum Sensors
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Superconducting topological systems formed by a strong 3D topological insulator (TI) in proximity to a conventional s-wave superconductor (SC) have been intensely studied, as they may host Majorana zero modes. However, there are limited experimental realizations of TI-SC systems in which robust superconducting pairing is induced on the surface states of the TI and a topological superconducting state is established. Here, we fabricate a TI-SC system by depositing, via a focused ion beam, tungsten (W) nanoscale clusters on the surface of TI Bi0.91Sb0.09. We find that the resulting heterostructure supports phase-slip lines (PSLs) that act as effective Josephson junctions (JJs). We probe the response of the system to microwave radiation. We find that for some ac frequencies, and powers, the resulting Shapiro steps' structure of the voltage-current characteristic exhibits a missing first step and an unexpectedly wide second Shapiro step. The theoretical analysis of the measurements shows that the unusual Shapiro response arises from the interplay between a static JJ and a dynamic one and allows us to identify the conditions under which the missing first step can be attributed to the topological nature of the JJs formed by the PSLs. Our results suggest an approach to induce superconductivity in a TI, a route to realizing highly transparent topological JJs, and show how the response of superconducting systems to microwave radiation can be used to infer the dynamics of PSLs. Highly transparent topological junctions are promising candidates to realize vector field sensors with very high sensitivity. In addition, due to the nontrivial Berry phase of the TI's surface states such junctions can be in a topological state which is ideal to create topologically protected qubits.

TI Serological, fragmentomic, and epigenetic characteristics of cell-free
   DNA in patients with lupus nephritis
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB ObjectivesThe biological characteristics of plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are related to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of this study was to explore the biological characteristics of cfDNA in patients with LN in terms of serology, fragment omics, and epigenetics, and to discuss the possibility of liquid biopsy for cfDNA as an alternative to conventional tissue biopsy. MethodscfDNA was extracted from plasma samples of 127 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (64 with LN, 63 without LN). The cfDNA concentration was determined using the Qubit method. Next-generation sequencing cfDNA methylation profiling was performed for three LN patients and six non-LN patients. The methylation panel was designed based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. The fragmentation index, motif score, and DELFI score were calculated to explore the fragmentation profile of cfDNA in patients with LN. Statistical and machine learning methods were used to select features to calculate the methylation scores of the samples. ResultsPatients with LN had significantly lower cfDNA concentrations (P = 0.0347) than those without LN. This may be associated with the presence of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (r = -0.4189; P = 0.0296). The mean DELFI score (proportion of short fragments of cfDNA) in patients with LN was significantly higher than that in patients without LN (P = 0.0238). Based on the pan-cancer data, 73, 66, 8, and 10 features were selected and used to calculate the methylation scores. The mean methylation scores of these features in patients with LN differed significantly from those in patients without LN (P = 0.0238). ConclusionsThe specificity of cfDNA in patients with LN was identified using serological, fragmentomic, and epigenetic analyses. The findings may have implications for the development of new molecular markers of LN.

TI Cell-free DNA concentration and fragment size as a biomarker for
   prostate cancer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasm in American men. Although existing biomarkers may detect localized prostate cancer, additional strategies are necessary for improving detection and identifying aggressive disease that may require further intervention. One promising, minimally invasive biomarker is cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which consist of short DNA fragments released into circulation by dying or lysed cells that may reflect underlying cancer. Here we investigated whether differences in cfDNA concentration and cfDNA fragment size could improve the sensitivity for detecting more advanced and aggressive prostate cancer. This study included 268 individuals: 34 healthy controls, 112 men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), and 122 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Plasma cfDNA concentration and fragment size were quantified with the Qubit 3.0 and the 2100 Bioanalyzer. The potential relationship between cfDNA concentration or fragment size and localized or mCRPC prostate cancer was evaluated with descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and area under the curve analysis with cross-validation. Plasma cfDNA concentrations were elevated in mCRPC patients in comparison to localized disease (OR5ng/mL=1.34, P=0.027) or to being a control (OR5ng/mL=1.69, P=0.034). Decreased average fragment size was associated with an increased risk of localized disease compared to controls (OR5bp=0.77, P=0.0008). This study suggests that while cfDNA concentration can identify mCRPC patients, it is unable to distinguish between healthy individuals and patients with localized prostate cancer. In addition to PSA, average cfDNA fragment size may be an alternative that can differentiate between healthy individuals and those with localized disease, but the low sensitivity and specificity results in an imperfect diagnostic marker. While quantification of cfDNA may provide a quick, cost-effective approach to help guide treatment decisions in advanced disease, its use is limited in the setting of localized prostate cancer.

TI Maximally Entangled Mixed States for a Fixed Spectrum Do Not Always
   Exist
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement is a resource under local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC). Given a set of states S , if there is one state in S that can be transformed by LOCC into all other states in S , then this state is maximally entangled in S . It is a well-known result that the d-dimensional Bell state is the maximally entangled state in the set of all bipartite states of local dimension d . Since in practical applications noise renders every state mixed, it is interesting to study whether sets of mixed states of relevance enable the notion of a maximally entangled state. A natural choice is the set of all states with the same spectrum. In fact, for any given spectrum distribution on two-qubit states, previous work has shown that several entanglement measures are all maximized by one particular state in this set. This has led us to consider the possibility that this family of states could be the maximally entangled states in the set of all states with the same spectrum, which should then maximize all entanglement measures. In this work, I answer this question in the negative: There are no maximally entangled states for a fixed spectrum in general, i.e., for every possible choice of the spectrum. In order to do so, I consider the case of rank-2 states and show that for particular values of the eigenvalues there exists no state that can be transformed to all other isospectral states not only under LOCC but also under the larger class of nonentangling operations. This in particular implies that in these cases the state that maximizes a given entanglement measure among all states with the same spectrum depends on the choice of entanglement measure; i.e., it cannot be that the aforementioned family of states maximizes all entanglement measures.

TI Evolution of a solitary wave: optical soliton, soliton molecule and
   soliton crystal
SO DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES
AB This review embarks on a captivating odyssey of tracing the birth of light from the Big Bang to its intricate interplay with materials. It delves into the fundamental truth that nonlinearity is ubiquitous, and induces fascinating spatiotemporal structures, chaos, and complexity in the medium. After a brief exploration of waves and the effect of nonlinearity in diverse domains, the review article focuses on the field of photonics. This comprehensive review dives into the captivating physics of solitons. This study explores the formation of solitons in optical fibers due to specific nonlinear effects within the material, such as the Kerr effect, the fundamental behaviour of solitons in integrable models, diverse interactions, and the formation of intricate soliton molecules, soliton complexes, and soliton crystals within the dissipative optical systems. We analyse key research on optical solitons and highlight the control of optical solitons for advancements in communication systems, signal processing, optical computing, quantum technologies, etc. Through a meticulous research survey, we find that there is a limited understanding of weak soliton interactions. Further, more theoretical models to be investigated for exploring anisotropy of material and optomechanical interplay. Bridging these gaps will definitely propel future soliton research.
   Dance of Light and Matter: This review explores how light and matter interact, from their origins in the Big Bang to how they form special light waves called solitons in fibers. Solitons: Beyond Light Waves: We delve into solitons, self-reinforcing light waves, and their unique behaviors in different models. Along with studies on several temporal and spatial solitons it also includes recent studies on soliton molecules, soliton complexes, and soliton crystals with potential applications. Taming Light's Potential: The review highlights key areas for future research to unlock the full potential of solitons. Highlights the need to study the effect of weak interactions in multi-soliton dynamics in complex systems, tells the importance of exploring their behavior in new materials, and integrating them with nanophotonic devices. This work proposes the concept of 'photobot,' intelligent soliton molecules that we believe will be achievable in the near future.

TI Longitudinal and transversal resonant tunneling of interacting bosons in
   a two-dimensional Josephson junction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We unravel the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of a few interacting bosonic clouds in a two-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential at the resonant tunneling scenario. At the single-particle level of resonant tunneling, particles tunnel under the barrier from, typically, the ground-state in the left well to an excited state in the right well, i.e., states of different shapes and properties are coupled when their one-particle energies coincide. In two spatial dimensions, two types of resonant tunneling processes are possible, to which we refer to as longitudinal and transversal resonant tunneling. Longitudinal resonant tunneling implies that the state in the right well is longitudinally-excited with respect to the state in the left well, whereas transversal resonant tunneling implies that the former is transversely-excited with respect to the latter. We show that interaction between bosons makes resonant tunneling phenomena in two spatial dimensions profoundly rich, and analyze these phenomena in terms of the loss of coherence of the junction and development of fragmentation, and coupling between transverse and longitudinal degrees-of-freedom and excitations. To this end, a detailed analysis of the tunneling dynamics is performed by exploring the time evolution of a few physical quantities, namely, the survival probability, occupation numbers of the reduced one-particle density matrix, and the many-particle position, momentum, and angular-momentum variances. To accurately calculate these physical quantities from the time-dependent many-boson wavefunction, we apply a well-established many-body method, the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB), which incorporates quantum correlations exhaustively. By comparing the survival probabilities and variances at the mean-field and many-body levels of theory and investigating the development of fragmentation, we identify the detailed mechanisms of many-body longitudinal and transversal resonant tunneling in two dimensional asymmetric double-wells. In particular, we find that the position and momentum variances along the transversal direction are almost negligible at the longitudinal resonant tunneling, whereas they are substantial at the transversal resonant tunneling which is caused by the combination of the density and breathing mode oscillations. We show that the width of the interparticle interaction potential does not affect the qualitative physics of resonant tunneling dynamics, both at the mean-field and many-body levels. In general, we characterize the impact of the transversal and longitudinal degrees-of-freedom in the many-boson tunneling dynamics at the resonant tunneling scenarios.

TI Thermal Lens Effect in Experimental Preparation of 1064 nm High-Power
   Bright Squeezed State
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective As an important quantum resource, the squeezed state can not only be employed for quantum teleportation in quantum information technology but also can be adopted to improve the detection sensitivity of laser interferometer in quantum precision measurement. In the above applications, the quantum state fidelity and interferometer sensitivity are directly determined by the noise level of the squeezed state. Therefore, previous research focuses on improving the squeezing degree of squeezed state. However, with the deepening research, the optical power of the squeezed state is another factor limiting its application, and thus it is important to improve the optical power of the squeezed state.
   Methods The experimental preparation system is built as shown in Fig. 1. The most important part of the experimental system is the optical parametric amplifier ( OPA), which generates the high-power bright squeezed state. The OPA is a semi-monolithic standing cavity composed of periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal and concave cavity mirror. Then the balanced homodyne detection device can divide the high- power bright squeezed state and the local oscillator into two parts with equal power, and inject the balanced homodyne detector respectively after interference. The squeezing degree is measured by scanning the relative phase of the high-power bright squeezed state and the local oscillator. The thermal lens effect of PPKTP crystal exerts a very adverse effect on the parametric conversion. The method of simultaneously injecting high-power seed light and pump light into OPA is adopted especially in the experimental system of preparing high-power bright squeezed state. This method will increase the nonlinear absorption of high- power seed light and pump light, resulting in thermal deposition and then a thermal lens effect in the PPKTP crystal. Finally, the mode matching efficiency of the seed light and pump light with OPA is decreased. To improve the mode matching efficiency of seed light and pump light with OPA and enhance the squeezing degree, we should quantitatively analyze the thermal lens focal length of PPKTP crystal under OPA working state and then adjust the lens group in the optical path of seed light and pump light to realize the rematch of seed light and pump light with the intrinsic mode of OPA with thermal lens effect.
   Results and Discussions According to the experimental parameters and theoretical calculation, under the OPA without thermal lens effect, the waist radii corresponding to the seed light and pump light in the OPA cavity are omega(1)= 31. 3 mu m and omega(2)=19. 9 mu m respectively. The distance between the waist and the front convex surface of PPKTP crystal is L-1= 0. 75 mm and L-1'=0. 47 mm respectively. When the pump light power is 145 mW and the seed light power is 500 mW, the equivalent focal length of the thermal lens in the PPKTP crystal can be calculated to be about 182 mm. Under the OPA with thermal lens effect, the waist radii corresponding to seed light and pump light in OPA are omega(1)' =30. 6 mu m and omega(2)' = 19. 4 mu m respectively. The distance between the waist and the front convex surface of PPKTP crystal corresponding to seed light and pump light is L-1= 0. 68 mm and L-1'= 0. 43 mm respectively. The above calculation results show that the thermal lens changes the intrinsic mode waist of OPA. The theoretical calculation results confirm that the mode matching efficiency of seed light and pump light with OPA decreases to 99. 8% and 99. 9% respectively, while the OPA produces bright squeezed light with high power.
   When the powers of seed light and pump light are further increased, the high-power seed light and pump light will cause more intense and complex thermal deposition in the PPKTP crystal ( such as the green light- induced infrared absorption effect). This is because the intensification trend of the thermal lens effect is not linear, but may be an approximate exponential increase. Therefore, the thermal lens effect will cause sharply decreased mode matching efficiency between the seed light ( the pump light) and the OPA. Thus, the thermal lens effect will significantly affect the squeezing degree. The mode matching efficiency of seed light and pump light with OPA is reduced by the thermal lens effect, which mainly affects the power of seed light and pump light injected into OPA. Theoretically, the change of seed light power has no effect on the squeezing degree. Therefore, it is only necessary to consider the influence of pump light power in OPA on the squeezing degree of the bright squeezed state. Finally, according to Eqs. (4)- (12), the quantitative relationship between the focal length of the thermal lens and the squeezing degree can be derived.
   According to the working conditions of the experimental system in Ref. [ 20], there is a thermal lens in the OPA, and the high- power bright squeezed state of - 10. 7 dB +/- 0. 2 dB is measured without optimizing the mode matching of seed light and pump light with the OPA. The squeezing degree comparison reveals that with the thermal lens effect, the mode matching efficiency reduction of seed light and pump light with the OPA has little effect on the squeezing degree. This means the thermal lens effect in OPA has little effect on the squeezing degree of the high-power bright squeezed state. Additionally, the different effects of thermal lens effect on the squeezing degree of high-power bright squeezed state and squeezed vacuum state are compared and analyzed. Meanwhile, the following conclusions are drawn. In the same experimental conditions, the squeezing degree of the squeezed vacuum state generated by optical parametric oscillator (OPO) will be higher than that of the high-power bright squeezed state generated by OPA if other effects between the high-power seed light and pump light in PPKTP crystal are not considered, with the thermal lens effect only considered.
   Conclusions In the high-power bright squeezed state experiment system, the thermal lens effect of high-power seed light and pump light in PPKTP crystal is studied experimentally and theoretically. The equivalent focal length of the thermal lens and the mode mismatch between seed light and OPA, and between pump light and OPA are quantitatively analyzed by the theoretical model of thermal lens and mode matching. The equivalent focal length of the thermal lens in the PPKTP crystal can be calculated as 182 mm by theoretical analysis and calculation. In the working condition of the experimental system, due to the thermal lens generated in the PPKTP crystal, the mode matching efficiency of the high- power seed light and pump light with the OPA decreases to 99. 8% and 99. 9% respectively. Then the mode matching of high- power seed light and pump light with the OPA cavity is re- optimized. Finally, under the seed light power of 500 mW and pump light power of 145 mW, a bright squeezed state with power of 200 mu W and squeezing degree of - 10. 8 dB +/- 0. 2 dB is obtained at the analysis frequency of 3 MHz. The results show that during the preparation of a high-power bright squeezed state, the squeezing degree of the high-power bright squeezed state is basically unaffected, since the thermal lens effect in PPKTP crystal caused by the high- power seed light and pump light does not significantly reduce the mode matching efficiency of the high-power seed light and pump light with OPA.

TI Entanglement rearrangement in self-consistent nuclear structure
   calculations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Background: Entanglement plays a central role in a diverse array of increasingly important research areas, including quantum computation, simulation, measurement, sensing, and communication. Extensive suites of investigations have been performed to better understand entanglement in atomic and molecular quantum many-body systems, while the exploration of entanglement in the structure of nuclei and their reactions is presently in its infancy.
   Purpose: The goal of this work is to begin investigating the entanglement properties of nuclei from first-principles nuclear many-body calculations. We attempt to identify common features and emergent structures of entanglement that could ultimately lead to new and natural many-body schemes. With an eye toward quantum accelerators in future hybrid-supercomputers, criteria for partitioning nuclear many-body calculations into quantum and classical components may provide advantages in future large-scale computations. Along the way we look for explanations of the relative success of phenomenological models such as the nuclear shell model, and for better ways to match to low-energy nuclear effective field theories and lattice QCD calculations to nuclear many-body techniques that are based upon entanglement.
   Method: We explore the entanglement between single-particle states in He-4 and He-6. The patterns of entanglement emerging from different single-particle bases are compared, and possible links with the convergence of observables are explored, in particular, ground-state energies. The nuclear wave functions are obtained by performing active-space no-core configuration-interaction calculations using a two-body nucleon-nucleon interaction derived from chiral effective field theory. Entanglement measures within single-particle bases exhibiting different degrees of complexity are determined, in particular, harmonic oscillator (HO), Hartree-Fock (HF), natural (NAT) and variational natural (VNAT) bases. Specifically, single-orbital entanglement entropy, two-orbital mutual information, and negativity are studied.
   Results: The entanglement structures in He-4 and He-6 are found to be more localized within NAT and VNAT bases than within a HO basis for the optimal HO parameters we have worked with. In particular a core-valence structure clearly emerges from the full no-core calculation of He-6. The two-nucleon mutual information shows that the VNAT basis, which typically exhibits good convergence properties, effectively decouples the active and inactive spaces.
   Conclusions: Measures of one- and two-nucleon entanglement are found to be useful in analyzing the structure of nuclear wave functions, in particular the efficacy of basis states, and may provide useful metrics toward developing more efficient schemes for ab initio computations of the structure and reactions of nuclei, and quantum many-body systems more generally.

TI Rotational dynamics of ATP synthase: mechanical constraints and energy
   dissipative channels
SO PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB The proton motive force (PMF) across the inner mitochondrial membrane delivers approximately 0.2 eV of energy per proton, powering the FoF1-ATP synthase molecular motor. Here, we provide a detailed accounting of how this energy is utilized: Approximately 75-83 % is transduced into the chemical free energy of ATP synthesis, while the remaining 17-25 % is dissipated through internal friction, viscous drag, proton leakage, electroviscous effects, elastic deformations, and information-theoretic costs. Each dissipation channel is quantitatively evaluated, revealing that internal friction in the F-1 motor is the dominant loss mechanism. In this work, we did not account for the possible energy contribution due to the intrinsic electrostatic potential of the enzyme itself. In addition to this energy bookkeeping, we also examine the quantum mechanical constraints on the F-o unit's rotation. We find that, as can be expected, the energy spacing between quantized rotational states is several orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energies at physiological temperature, and that the tunneling probability through rotational barriers is practically zero. Furthermore, the biological rotation speed (similar to 100-650 revolutions per second (rps)) is between one and three orders of magnitude below the quantum limit implied by quantization of angular momentum of the c-ring (which would have been ca. 13,000 to 62,000 rps (depending on the size of the c-ring (17-8 subunits, respectively)) in the first rotational energy level of the c-ring). Nevertheless, experimental estimates of the rotation rates in isolated c-rings suggest rates in the vicinity of 43,000 rps, right within our theoretical quantum estimates. However, ATP synthase as a whole operates firmly within the classical regime, despite its nanoscale dimensions, which highlights its evolutionary optimization for robust and efficient energy conversion at the quantum-classical boundary. This is the result of the rotatory coupling between the Fo and the much slower F-1 unit. ATP synthase's purely classical behavior showcases a remarkable evolutionary optimization of one of life's most essential rotary motor engineered so as to thrive far from the quantum limit, securing its function against the uncertainties of the quantum world. As Schrodinger stated in What is Life? (1944): "The submicroscopic world is full of fluctuations. But in large aggregates of atoms, the law of large numbers ensures that these fluctuations become negligible" a prediction directly confirmed here in the context of the rotational stability of the F-o unit.

TI Electronic properties of semiconductor quantum wires for shallow
   symmetric and asymmetric confinements
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Quantum wires (QWs) and quantum point contacts (QPCs) have been realized in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures in which a two-dimensional electron gas resides at the interface between GaAs and AlGaAs layered semiconductors. The electron transport in these structures has previously been studied experimentally and theoretically, and a 0.7 conductance anomaly has been discovered. The present paper is motivated by experiments with a QW in shallow symmetric and asymmetric confinements that have shown additional conductance anomalies at zero magnetic field. The proposed device consists of a QPC that is formed by split gates and a top gate between two large electron reservoirs. This paper is focussed on the theoretical study of electron transport through a wide top-gated QPC in a low-density regime and is based on density functional theory. The electron-electron interaction and shallow confinement make the splitting of the conduction channel into two channels possible. Each of them becomes spin-polarized at certain split and top gates voltages and may contribute to conductance giving rise to additional conductance anomalies. For symmetrically loaded split gates two conduction channels contribute equally to conductance. For the case of asymmetrically applied voltage between split gates conductance anomalies may occur between values of 0.25(2e (2)/h) and 0.7(2e (2)/h) depending on the increased asymmetry in split gates voltages. This corresponds to different degrees of spin-polarization in the two conduction channels that contribute differently to conductance. In the case of a strong asymmetry in split gates voltages one channel of conduction is pinched off and just the one remaining channel contributes to conductance. We have found that on the perimeter of the anti-dot there are spin-polarized states. These states may also contribute to conductance if the radius of the anti-dot is small enough and tunneling between these states may occur. The spin-polarized states in the QPC with shallow confinement tuned by electric means may be used for the purposes of quantum technology.

TI Finite Time Path Field Theory and a New Type of Universal Quantum Spin
   Chain Quench Behavior
SO UNIVERSE
AB We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory (FTPFT) perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time t = 0 are as follows: (1) their Fourier transform f (p) is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p = 0 and possibly others with I(p) < 0; and (2) f (p)/p converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. A prototypical function of this class is tanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching at time t = 0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behavior of Loschmidt echo (LE) that emerges in an exponentially short time scale, our previous results for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by the resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long-time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behavior exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones. LE is directly connected to the work probability distribution, and the described universal behavior is therefore appropriate in potential concepts of quantum technology related to spin chains.

TI Experimental research on a 50 mK multi-stage adiabatic demagnetization
   refrigerator
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB With the development of condensed matter physics, space observation, and quantum technology in recent years, the demand for ultra-low temperature refrigeration has increased. The adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) has the advantages of being unaffected by gravity, compact structure, and relatively low cost, which can meet the needs of space and ground applications.In this paper, a 50 mK multi-stage ADR is designed and developed which comprises a GM-type pulse tube cryocooler for precooling and three ADR stages connected in series. For easy installation and maintenance, the three ADR stages are placed on a separate cold plate which is connected to the 4 K cold plate via copper columns. The Dy3Ga5O12 (GGG) is employed as the refrigerant in the first stage, whereas CrK(SO4)(2) center dot 12H(2)O (CPA) is utilized for the second stage and third stage. To control heat transfer between stages and the 4 K heat sink, active gas-gap heat switch and passive gas-gap heat switch are developed, with the latter having a switching ratio over 1000.The 4 T, 2 T and 1 T superconducting magnets are utilized in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd stage, respectively, and a numerical model is used to optimize the design of magnetic shielding. In addition, an ADR simulation model with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is constructed to assist in tuning the controller parameters in the experiment. The lowest temperature achieved in the experiment is 38 mK, with a temperature fluctuation of 10.6 mu K. The durations of different cooling power (1, 2 and 3 mu W) at 100 mK are also measured. It is calculated that the no-load maintenance time is about 4.3 h, the leakage heat power is about 4.5 mu W, and the total cooling capacity is about 71 mJ. This refrigerator is the first Chinese multi-stage ADR that can reach a temperature under 50 mK, which lays an important foundation for subsequent research on continuous adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration.

TI Dispersion control based on gradient refractive index microresonators
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Kerr optical frequency combs based on whispering-gallery mode (WGM) microresonators have great potential for applications in various fields, such as precision measurement, spectral analysis, optical communication, and quantum technology. The interaction between dispersion and nonlinearity is crucial for determining the stability and bandwidth performance of optical frequency combs. In particular, the Kerr bright soliton optical frequency comb requires a suitable anomalous group velocity dispersion (GVD) to maintain the dissipative system. Therefore, designing the dispersion of the WGM microresonator is essential for generating the Kerr optical frequency comb. However, WGM microresonators typically have normal and fixed material dispersion, and their dispersion design is mainly based on modulating the mode field distribution by changing the microresonator structure to achieve anomalous dispersion, which limits their flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a radially distributed gradient refractive index n(r) into WGM microresonators and propose to use the refractive index profile for controlling the dispersion of gradient-index (GRIN) microresonators. Numerical simulations and finite element analysis demonstrate that the refractive index gradient constrains the mode field and pushes it away from the cavity edge, resulting in near-zero geometric dispersion in the GRIN microresonator. Two dispersion modulation methods are explored: modifying the microresonator's geometric shape and constructing a dual potential well. The effects of microresonator radius, wedge angle, ion diffusion sequence, and potential well width and spacing on dispersion are systematically investigated. Simulation results show that both methods can achieve a wide range of anomalous dispersion within the communication band. In the first method, mode field leakage in the bilateral wedge-shaped GRIN microresonator produces anomalous dispersion, while no leakage results in normal dispersion. When the mode field is pushed away from the edge, near-zero dispersion is achieved. In the second method, energy coupling between the inner mode and the outer mode in the dual potential well structure leads to anomalous dispersion in the inner mode and normal dispersion in the outer mode. Our findings highlight the flexibility of GRIN microresonator dispersion control and indicate great potential for nonlinear optical applications.

TI Research of spinterface in organic spintronic devices
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Spintronics are attractive to the utilization in next-generation quantum-computing and memory. Comparedwith inorganic spintronics, organic spintronics not only controls the spin degree-of-freedom but also possessesadvantages such as chemical tailorability, flexibility, and low-cost fabrication process. Besides, the organic spinvalve with a sandwich configuration that is composed of two ferromagnetic electrodes and an organic spacelayer is one of the classical devices in organic spintronics. Greatly enhanced or inversed magnetoresistance (MR)sign appearing in organic spin valve is induced by the unique interfacial effect an organic semiconductor/ferromagnetic interface. The significant enhancement or inversion of MR is later proved to be caused by thespin-dependent hybridization between molecular and ferromagnetic interface, i.e., the spinterface. Thehybridization is ascribed to spin-dependent broadening and shifting of molecular orbitals. The spinterface takesplace at one molecular layer when attaching to the surface of ferromagnetic metal. It indicates that the MRresponse can be modulated artificially in a specific device by converting the nature of spinterface. Despite lots ofresearches aiming at exploring the mechanism of spinterface, several questions need urgently to be resolved. Forinstance, the spin polarization, which is difficult to identify and observe with the surface sensitive technique and the inversion or enhancement of MR signal, which is also hard to explain accurately. The solid evidence of spinterface existing in real spintronic device also needs to be further testified. Besides, the precise manipulation of the MR sign by changing the nature of spinterface is quite difficult. According to the above background, this review summarizes the advance in spinterface and prospects future controllable utilization of spinterface. InSection 2, we introduce the basic principle of spintronic device and spinterface. The formation of uniquespinterface in organic spin valve is clarified by using the difference in energy level alignment between inorganicand organic materials. Enhancement and inversion of MR sign are related to the broadening and shifting of themolecular level. In Section 3, several examples about identification of spinterface are listed, containingcharacterization by surface sensitive techniques and identification in real working devices. In Section 4 somemethods about the manipulation of spinterface are exhibited, including modulation of ferroelectric organicbarrier, interface engineering, regulation of electronic phase separation in ferromagnetic electrodes, etc. Finally, in this review some unresolved questions in spintronics are given, such as multi-functional and room-temperature organic spin valve and improvement of the spin injection efficiency. Spinterface is of great importance for both scientific research and future industrial interest in organic spintronics. The present study paves the way for the further development of novel excellent organic spin valves

TI Realizations and Applications of Non-Hermitian Quantum Optics Based on
   Coherent Atomic Gases (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Investigations on non-Hermitian physics have witnessed remarkable development over the past two decades and the earliest work can be traced back to 1998. In that year, Bender and Boettcher discovered that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with parity-time (PT) symmetry may possess spectra of positive-definite eigenvalues under appropriate conditions and lead to a series of unusual quantum properties. Given that such non-Hermitian quantum mechanical systems are usually difficult to construct and manipulate, relevant research has been soon extended to the optical regime, with significant experimental breakthroughs achieved, by considering the isomorphism between the Schr & ouml;dinger equation and paraxial wave equation. Typically, the spatially-modulated part of a complex refractive index plays the role of an optical potential and one can realize the optical PT symmetry and hence various unusual optical phenomena by making its real and imaginary parts, respectively, even and odd functions in space. For example, unilateral signal output behavior independent of the input port is observed in a PT symmetric system of two coupled waveguides; unidirectional reflectionless and invisibility are realized in a PT symmetric system of complex photonic crystals. It is worth noting that similar unusual phenomena can also be realized in PT antisymmetric optical systems where the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index modulated in space are odd and even functions, respectively. So far, the research on non-Hermitian optics and photonics cover many platforms such as silicon-based waveguides, optomechanical systems, superconducting circuits, and coupled microcavities. Relevant results may find important applications in constructing all-optical networks and promoting the development of quantum information processing and quantum precision measurement. Progress This article reviews the latest research progress on constructing PT symmetric and PT antisymmetric optical structures together with their applications in seeking novel non-Hermitian optical phenomena via quantum coherence control and correlated spatial modulation of finite atomic ensembles. By summarizing a few pioneering theoretical and experimental works, it clarifies that the key to implementing non-Hermitian optical research with dressed multilevel atoms in the regime of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) lies in: how to realize complex probe susceptibilities describing spatially mismatched absorption and dispersion profiles or non-Hermitian scattering matrices describing spatially asymmetric multimode coupled transmission. Meanwhile, it introduces dynamic control strategies of exceptional points denoting PT symmetric and PT antisymmetric phase transitions as well as unusual nonreciprocal behaviors like unidirectional reflection in atomic lattices and unilateral transport in atomic waveguides.
   Experimentally verified proposals include tunable PT symmetric optical lattices realized in a sample of mixed isotopes 85Rb and 87Rb both exhibiting the three-level Lambda configuration yet providing gain and loss, respectively, to the probe field in the presence of different driving parameters; tunable PT symmetric dual waveguides realized in a sample of 87Rb atoms driven into the four-level N configuration with different pump fields applied to generate gain and loss, respectively, in two coupled transmission channels of the probe field; tunable PT antisymmetric optical lattices realized with 87Rb atoms trapped in periodic potentials and driven into the four-level N configuration involving no gain but exhibiting two absorption channels with an in-between EIT valley in each dipole trap. Last but not least, it points out that there exists extensive room for expanding previous research on non-Hermitian quantum optics by leveraging atomic gases with rich energy-level structures and flexible driving schemes. In fact, it is viable to achieve tailored asymmetric light diffraction by considering orthogonal transmission of probe and driving beams in PT symmetric and PT antisymmetric EIT systems, or to realize phase transition between coherent oscillation and parametric amplification by incorporating coherent four-wave mixing into PT antisymmetric studies. Conclusions and Prospects A significant drawback of solid non-Hermitian optical structures is the lack of coherent control and dynamic tunability. That means, once fabricated, it is difficult or impossible to adjust the intrinsic properties of such non-Hermitian optical structures according to specific requirements in practical applications. In addition, if there are inevitable errors or defects during the fabrication process, no remedial measures can be taken so that one or more new samples have to be fabricated to replace the flawed ones. To overcome these difficulties, one needs to seek alternative solutions that can yield dynamically tunable optical responses. This has inspired us to consider multilevel atomic gases that can be driven by coherent laser fields of different frequencies in various ways. In particular, EIT, a well known quantum optical phenomenon based on atomic coherence effects, allows us to suppress the linear absorption of a weak probe field and meanwhile enhance its refractive-index dispersion. In this regard, the EIT technique has been explored for realizing non-Hermitian optics with the advantages of flexible design and dynamical tunability by engineering standing-wave laser fields applied upon multilevel atoms, which is exactly what we have reviewed in this article. Attention in the near future may shift from linear to nonlinear optical media and from classical to quantum nonreciprocal properties, and may be paid to realizing relevant schemes in semiconductor quantum dots and rare-earth-doped solids exhibiting also multi levels. This helps to obtain miniaturized and integrated photonic devices providing versatile nonreciprocal manipulation functions, which are essential for building powerful all-optical quantum networks.

TI Superstrength permanent magnets with iron-based superconductors by data-
   and researcher-driven process design
SO NPG ASIA MATERIALS
AB Iron-based high-temperature (high-T c) superconductors have good potential to serve as materials in next-generation superstrength quasipermanent magnets owing to their distinctive topological and superconducting properties. However, their unconventional high-T c superconductivity paradoxically associates with anisotropic pairing and short coherence lengths, causing challenges by inhibiting supercurrent transport at grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials. In this study, we employ machine learning to manipulate intricate polycrystalline microstructures through a process design that integrates researcher- and data-driven approaches via tailored software. Our approach results in a bulk Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 permanent magnet with a magnetic field that is 2.7 times stronger than that previously reported. Additionally, we demonstrate magnetic field stability exceeding 0.1 ppm/h for a practical 1.5 T permanent magnet, which is a vital aspect of medical magnetic resonance imaging. Nanostructural analysis reveals contrasting outcomes from data- and researcher-driven processes, showing that high-density defects and bipolarized grain boundary spacing distributions are primary contributors to the magnet's exceptional strength and stability.
   Iron-based superconductors are promising for uses like quantum computing and superstrong magnets. However, improving their superconducting properties is challenging. This study aimed to improve these properties in a specific superconductor, K-doped Ba122, using Bayesian optimization. The researchers made samples under different conditions and measured their superconducting properties to refine the process. Two large disk-shaped samples were made using the best processing conditions found from data-driven and researcher-driven methods. The superconducting properties of these samples, and their ability to act as magnets, were tested at low temperatures. The results showed significant improvements, proving the optimization process's effectiveness and resulting in an iron-based superconducting magnet with unprecedented strength. The study concludes that machine learning, especially Bayesian optimization, can significantly advance high-performance superconducting materials development. This could lead to more efficient and powerful superconducting magnets for various uses. This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the authors.
   The world's strongest iron-based superconducting magnet has been manufactured. Machine learning using Bayesian optimization was employed to improve the superconducting properties of potassium-doped barium iron arsenide (Ba,K)Fe2As2. Two large disk-shaped samples were fabricated using common industrial processing techniques under the best conditions deduced from data- and researcher-driven methods. After magnetizing the samples, they could retain a magnetic field of 2.83 T as a quasi-permanent magnet, around 2.7 times the previous record, with decay rates less than -0.1 ppm/h, crucial for MRI scanners. The two approaches produced divergent microstructures, opening the door to redefining what makes for a superior superconducting material.

TI Precise preparation of two-dimensional heterostructures via chemical
   vapor deposition: Current status and future prospects
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-based synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures, which have emerged as an ideal platform for next-generation optoelectronic and microelectronic devices due to their ability to integrate diverse material components and induce novel physical phenomena. The review begins by introducing the classification of 2D heterostructures, such as vertical (VHS), lateral (LHS), and hybrid heterostructures (HHS). We further highlight the unique advantages of CVD as a key route for achieving large-area, high-quality, and controllable preparation, thereby effectively avoiding interface contamination and issues such as interfacial states and Fermi-level pinning caused by lattice mismatch in traditional semiconductor heterostructures.<br /> We focus on four core strategies for precise growth control: precursor design, temperature field modulation, vapor composition control, and substrate engineering. In the precursor design, by constructing core-shell structures, introducing auxiliary agents, or modulating precursor proportions and physical forms, the sequential supply and reaction pathways of different components can be precisely regulated to guide oriented growth and suppress alloy formation. In temperature field modulation, utilizing differences in the growth windows between various materials and precisely controlling heating rates, temperature uniformity, and gradients can achieve selective growth modes (lateral or vertical), effective suppression of alloying, and protection of pre-deposited layers. In vapor composition control, by switching carrier gas atmospheres, the nucleation and growth of specific materials can be selectively initiated or halted, providing a one-pot strategy for fabricating multi-junction lateral heterostructures and superlattices with atomically sharp interfaces. In substrate engineering, the surface energy, lattice matching, catalytic activity, and pretreatment processes of different substrates are used to actively guide nucleation sites, growth modes, and crystalline quality. Although significant progress has been made in the CVD synthesis of various 2D heterostructures, such as MX2/MY2, graphene/h-BN, and mixed-dimensional heterojunctions, considerable challenges remain in achieving large-area uniformity, reproducible processes, precise control of complex heterostructures (e.g., multi-interface, moire superlattices, and patterned growth), and compatibility with current semiconductor technology. Future development should focus on integrating in situ characterization, multi-scale simulations, and artificial intelligence-assisted optimization to facilitate a transition from empirical trial-and-error to precision design. The introduction of novel growth techniques, such as laser-induced or microwave-assisted CVD, roll-to-roll processes, and substrate interface engineering, is expected to accelerate the practical application of 2D heterostructures in cutting-edge fields such as quantum computing and flexible electronics.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Predictive Degradation Pathway Optimization for PV
   Storage Systems: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach for Maximizing
   Longevity and Efficiency
SO ENERGIES
AB The increasing deployment of photovoltaic and energy storage systems (ESSs) in modern power grids has highlighted the critical challenge of component degradation, which significantly impacts system efficiency, operational costs, and long-term reliability. Conventional energy dispatch and optimization approaches fail to adequately mitigate the progressive efficiency loss in PV modules and battery storage, leading to suboptimal performance and reduced system longevity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a quantum-enhanced degradation pathway optimization framework that dynamically adjusts operational strategies to extend the lifespan of PV storage systems while maintaining high efficiency. By leveraging quantum-assisted Monte Carlo simulations and hybrid quantum-classical optimization, the proposed model evaluates degradation pathways in real time and proactively optimizes energy dispatch to minimize efficiency losses due to aging effects. The framework integrates a quantum-inspired predictive maintenance algorithm, which utilizes probabilistic modeling to forecast degradation states and dynamically adjust charge-discharge cycles in storage systems. Unlike conventional optimization methods, which struggle with the complexity and stochastic nature of degradation mechanisms, the proposed approach capitalizes on quantum parallelism to assess multiple degradation scenarios simultaneously, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. A three-layer hierarchical optimization structure is introduced, ensuring real-time degradation risk assessment, periodic dispatch optimization, and long-term predictive adjustments based on PV and battery aging trends. The framework is tested on a 5 MW PV array coupled with a 2.5 MWh lithium-ion battery system, with real-world degradation models applied to reflect light-induced PV degradation (0.7% annual efficiency loss) and battery state-of-health deterioration (1.2% per 100 cycles). A hybrid quantum-classical computing environment, utilizing D-Wave's Advantage quantum annealer alongside a classical reinforcement learning-based optimization engine, enables large-scale scenario evaluation and real-time operational adjustments. The simulation results demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced degradation optimization framework significantly reduces efficiency losses, extending the PV module's lifespan by approximately 2.5 years and reducing battery-degradation-induced wear by 25% compared to conventional methods.

AB Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) superconducting technology has a considerable advantage over CMOS in power and performance. SFQ CPUs can also help scale quantum computing technologies, as SFQ circuits can be integrated with qubits due to their amenability to a cryogenic environment. Recently, there have been significant developments in VLSI design automation tools, making it feasible to design pipelined SFQ CPUs. SFQ technology, however, is constrained by the number of Josephson Junctions ( JJs) integrated into a single chip. Prior works focused on JJ-efficient SFQ datapath designs. Pipelined SFQ CPUs also require branch predictors that provide the best prediction accuracy for a given JJ budget. In this paper, we design and evaluate the original Perceptron branch predictor and a later variant named the Hashed Perceptron predictor in terms of their accuracy and JJ usage. Since branch predictors, to date, have not been designed for SFQ CPUs, we first design a baseline predictor built using nondestructive readout (NDRO) cells for storing the perceptron weights. Given that NDRO cells are JJ intensive, we propose an enhanced JJefficient design, called SuperBP, that uses high-capacity destructive readout (HC-DRO) cells to store perceptron weights. HC-DRO is a recently introduced multi-bit fluxon storage cell that stores 2 bits per cell. HC-DRO cells double the weight storage density over basic DRO cells to improve prediction accuracy for a given JJ count. However, naive integration of HC-DRO with SFQ logic is inefficient as HC-DRO cells store multiple fluxons in a single cell, which needs a decoding step on a read and an encoding step on a write. SuperBP presents novel inference and prediction update circuits for the Perceptron predictor that can directly operate on the native 2-bit HC-DRO weights without decoding and encoding, thereby reducing the JJ use. SuperBP reduces the JJ count by 39% compared to the NDRO-based design. We evaluate the performance of Perceptron and its hashed variants with the HC-DRO cell design using a range of benchmarks, including several SPEC CPU 2017, mobile, and server traces from the 5th Championship Branch Predictor competition. Our evaluation shows that for a given JJ count, the basic Perceptron variant of SuperBP provides better accuracy than the hashed variant. The hashed variant uses multiple weight tables, each of which needs its own access decoder, and decoder designs in SFQ consume a significant number of JJs. Thus, the hashed variant of SuperBP wastes the JJ budget for accessing multiple tables, leaving a smaller weight storage capacity, which compromises prediction accuracy. The basic Perceptron variant of SuperBP improves prediction accuracy by 13.6% over the hashed perceptron variant for an exemplar 30K JJ budget.

TI Quantum aided efficient resource control for connected support in IRS
   assisted networks
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: To achieve the vision of all connected world with uninterrupted communication support, 6G technology plays an important role. But the scarce radio spectrum and limited network resources is the main challenge in delivering its promised performance. Objectives: This paper presents an IRS -aided cell free NOMA network model that aims to provide uniform network coverage. The future 6G technology envisions for serving billions of interconnected devices with seamless communication support, data handling capabilities and computational accuracy. But the scarcity of network resources is the main limitation. Thus, the need is to design quantum enabled intelligent and dynamic networks capable of offering extended network capabilities. Proposed work is on intelligent network framework that provides uniform network coverage through efficient resource management for a 6G enabled expanded IoT network. Methods: To enable efficient resource management, a quantum enabled resource control algorithm is proposed that creates user clusters and associates each AP -IRS pair to each cluster. Each AP transmits the superimposed signals of its intended cluster against all the user clusters as in conventional NOMA system. The nodes in each cluster have been assigned unique pilots so as to avoid intracluster interference. The use of IRS enables desired NOMA beamforming such that the effect of unfavourable wireless environment is mitigated. Results: The performance of the IRS -aided cell -free NOMA network is evaluated for average sum rate with different AP transmit power, cluster sizes, IRS reflecting elements and IRS phase shifts. It is shown that at transmit power per AP of 30dBm, the average sum rate of the system improves by 7.52% with the proposed algorithm using equal power allocation scheme. Further, the comparative performance analysis of three different communication systems is carried out to validate the proposed communication model. Conclusion: It is observed that with more number of users per cluster, the average sum rate of the system initially increases for small cluster sizes and then it becomes constant for large cluster sizes. The proposed clustering method outperforms the random clustering approach achieving sum rate of 12.9 bits/s/Hz with N =300 and M = 8. The comparison of different communication scenarios reveals that the maximum sum rate of 12.2 bits/s/Hz is achieved with the proposed model incorporating proposed clustering mechanism. Further, the energy efficiency analysis suggests that energy efficiency improves with N and P c with proposed clustering approach. The use case scenarios for the integration of quantum computing with IRS technology are also presented.

TI Bulk Tungsten Fiber-Reinforced Tungsten (Wf/W) Composites
   Using Yarn-Based Textile Preforms
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR ENGINEERING
AB The use of tungsten fiber-reinforced tungsten composites (Wf/W) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the mechanical properties of tungsten (W) by incorporating W-fibers into the W-matrix. However, prior research has been restricted by the usage of single fiber-based textile fabrics, consisting of 150 mu m warp and 50 mu m weft filaments, with limited homogeneity, reproducibility, and mechanical properties in bulk structures due to the rigidity of the 150 mu m W-fibers. To overcome this limitation, two novel textile preforms were developed utilizing radial braided W-yarns with 7 core and 16 sleeve filaments (R.B. 16 + 7), with a diameter of 25 mu m each, as the warp material. In this study, bulk composites of two different fabric types were produced via a layer-by-layer CVD process, utilizing single 50 mu m filaments (type 1) and R.B. 16 + 7 yarns (type 2) as weft materials. The produced composites were sectioned into KLST-type specimens based on DIN EN ISO 179-1:2000 using electrical discharge machining (EDM) and subjected to three-point bending tests. Both composites demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties with pseudo-ductile behavior at room temperature and withstood over 10,000 load cycles between 50-90% of their respective maximum load without sample fracture in three-point cyclic loading tests. Furthermore, a novel approach to predict the fatigue behavior of the material under cyclic loading was developed based on the high reproducibility of the composites produced, especially for the composite based on type 1. This approach provides a new benchmark for upscaling endeavors and may enable a better prediction of the service life of the produced components made of Wf/W in the future. In comparison, the composite based on fabric type 1 demonstrated superior results in manufacturing performance and mechanical properties. With a high relative average density (>97%), a high fiber volume fraction (14-17%), and a very homogeneous fiber distribution in the CVD-W matrix, type 1 shows a promising option to be further tested in high heat flux tests and to be potentially used as an alternative to currently used materials for the most stressed components of nuclear fusion reactors or other potential application fields such as concentrated solar power (CSP), aircraft turbines, the steel industry, quantum computing, or welding tools. Type 2 composites have a higher layer spacing compared to type 1, resulting in gaps within the matrix and less homogeneous material properties. While type 2 composites have demonstrated a notable enhancement over 150 mu m fiber-based composites, they are not viable for industrial scale-up unlike type 1 composites.

TI Exact k-body representation of the Jaynes-Cummings interaction in
   the dressed basis: Insight into many-body phenomena with light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Analog quantum simulation-the technique of using one experimentally well-controlled physical system to mimic the behavior of another-has quickly emerged as one of the most promising near-term strategies for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In particular, systems of interacting photons, realizable in solid-state cavity and circuit QED frameworks, for example, hold tremendous promise for the study of nonequilibrium many-body phenomena, in part due to the capability to locally create and destroy photons. These systems are typically modeled using a Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) Hamiltonian, named due to similarities with the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. While comparisons between the two are often made in literature, the JCH Hamiltonian comprises both bosonic and psuedospin operators, leading to physical deviations from the Bose-Hubbard model for particular parameter regimes. Here, we present a nonperturbative procedure for transforming the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian into a dressed operator representation that, in its most general form, admits an infinite sum of bosonic k-body terms where k is bound only by the number of excitations in the system. We closely examine this result in both the dispersive and resonant coupling regimes, finding rapid convergence of this sum in the former and contributions from k >> 1 in the latter. Through extension to the simple case of a two-site JCH system, we demonstrate that this approach facilitates close inspection of the analogy between the JCH and Bose-Hubbard models and its breakdown for resonant light-matter coupling. Finally, we use this framework to survey the many-body character of a two-site JCH for general system parameters, identifying four unique quantum phases and the parameter regimes in which they are realized, thus highlighting phenomena realizable with finite JCH-based quantum simulators beyond the Bose-Hubbard model. More broadly, this paper is intended to serve as a clear mathematical exposition of bosonic many-body interactions underlying Jaynes-Cummings-type systems, often postulated either through analogy to Kerr-like nonlinear susceptibilities or by matching coefficients to obtain the appropriate eigenvalue spectrum.

TI Clinical Potential of Circulating Cell-Free DNA (cfDNA) for
   Longitudinally Monitoring Clinical Outcomes in the First-Line Setting of
   Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): A Real-World Prospective Study
SO CANCERS
AB Background: Despite the increasing implementation of targeted and immunotherapy-based treatments, the prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC remains dismal. We prospectively evaluated longitudinal plasma cfDNA kinetics as an early marker of therapeutic efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing standard first-line treatments. Methods: From February 2020 to May 2022, treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC were consecutively enrolled at the Medical Oncology Unit of the Paolo Giaccone University Hospital, Palermo (Italy). We quantified cfDNA in terms of ng/mu L using a Qubit (TM) dsDNA HS Assay Kit. The agreement between the cfDNA and radiologic response was evaluated from baseline (T0) to the radiologic evaluation (T1). Results: A total of 315 liquid biopsy samples were collected from 63 patients at baseline, with a total of 235 paired plasma samples from 47 patients at disease re-evaluation. A fair concordance was observed between early and durable radiographic and cfDNA response (Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.001); 11 and 18 patients receiving TKI (Pearson's chi-squared test = 4.278; Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.039) and IO treatments (Pearson's chi-squared test = 7.481; Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.006) showed a significant and durable association between cfDNA dynamics and the first radiologic evaluation, whereas among the 18 patients undergoing CT, no significant correlation was observed (Pearson's chi-squared test = 0.720; Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.396). The ECOG-PS 2 patients presented with the mean baseline cfDNA levels 2.6-fold higher than those with ECOG-PS 0-1 (1.71 vs. 0.65 ng/mu L; p = 0.105). Conclusions: Our real-world study demonstrates that quantitative changes in cfDNA values correlated with responses to therapy and relapse of disease in treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing TKI- and IO-based treatments.

TI Assessing the impact of storage conditions on RNA from human saliva and
   its application to the identification of mRNA biomarkers for asthma
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB Introduction: Human saliva was used to develop non-invasive liquid biopsy biomarkers to establish saliva as an alternate to blood and plasma in translational research. The present study focused on understanding the impact of sample storage conditions on the extraction of RNA from saliva and the RNA yield, to be applied in clinical diagnosis. In this study, genes related to asthma were used to test the method developed.Methods: Salivary RNA was extracted from three subjects using the Qiazol (R) based method and quantified by both spectrophotometric (NanoDrop) and fluorometric (Qubit (R)) methods. RNA integrity was measured using a bioanalyzer. Quantitative PCR was used to monitor the impact of storage conditions on the expression of housekeeping genes: GAPDH and beta-actin, and the asthma related genes: POSTN and FBN2. In addition, an independent cohort of 38 asthmatics and 10 healthy controls were used to validate the expression of POSTN and FBN2 as mRNA salivary biomarkers.Results: Approximately 2 mu g of total RNA was obtained from the saliva stored at 40 degrees C without any preservative for 2 weeks showing consistent gene expression with RNA stored at room temperature (RT) for 48 h with RNAlater. Although saliva stored with RNAlater showed a substantial increase in the yield (110 to 234 ng/mu L), a similar Cq (15.6 +/- 1.4) for the 18s rRNA gene from saliva without preservative showed that the RNA was stable enough. Gene expression analysis from the degraded RNA can be performed by designing the assay using a smaller fragment size spanning a single exon as described below in the case of the POSTN and FBN2 genes in the asthma cohort.Conclusion: This study showed that samples stored at room temperature up to a temperature of 40 degrees C without any preservative for 2 weeks yielded relatively stable RNA. The methodology developed can be employed to transport samples from the point of collection to the laboratory, under non-stringent storage conditions enabling the execution of gene expression studies in a cost effective and efficient manner.

TI Information, Thermodynamics and Life: A Narrative Review
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application
   The understanding of the connection between information and life could be proven crucial in our understanding of the brain and how it functions. Information processing takes place probably on all levels of living processes, that is, from the molecular to the macroscopical levels. Therefore, we have attempted to present some considerations and controversies on the topics of information and life along with some applications on how this can be applied to brain-related or brain-similar systems.
   Information is probably one of the most difficult physical quantities to comprehend. This applies not only to the very definition of information, but also to the physical entity of information, meaning how can it be quantified and measured. In recent years, information theory and its function in systems has been an intense field of study, due to the large increase of available information technology, where the notion of bit dominated the information discipline. Information theory also expanded from the "simple" "bit" to the quantal "qubit", which added more variables for consideration. One of the main applications of information theory could be considered the field of "autonomy", which is the main characteristic of living organisms in nature since they all have self-sustainability, motion and self-protection. These traits, along with the ability to be aware of existence, make it difficult and complex to simulate in artificial constructs. There are many approaches to the concept of simulating autonomous behavior, yet there is no conclusive approach to a definite solution to this problem. Recent experimental results have shown that the interaction between machines and neural cells is possible and it consists of a significant tool for the study of complex systems. The present work tries to review the question on the interactions between information and life. It attempts to build a connection between information and thermodynamics in terms of energy consumption and work production, as well as present some possible applications of these physical quantities.

TI Fast Fourier transforms and fast Wigner and Weyl functions in large
   quantum systems
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Two methods for fast Fourier transforms are used in a quantum context. The first method is for systems with dimension of the Hilbert space D = d n \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$D=d<^>n$$\end{document} with d an odd integer, and is inspired by the Cooley-Tukey formalism. The 'large Fourier transform' is expressed as a sequence of n 'small Fourier transforms' (together with some other transforms) in quantum systems with d-dimensional Hilbert space. Limitations of the method are discussed. In some special cases, the n Fourier transforms can be performed in parallel. The second method is for systems with dimension of the Hilbert space D = d 0 . . . d n - 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$D=d_0...d_{n-1}$$\end{document} with d 0 , . . . , d n - 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$d_0,...,d_{n-1}$$\end{document} odd integers coprime to each other. It is inspired by the Good formalism, which in turn is based on the Chinese reminder theorem. In this case also the 'large Fourier transform' is expressed as a sequence of n 'small Fourier transforms' (that involve some constants related to the number theory that describes the formalism). The 'small Fourier transforms' can be performed in a classical computer or in a quantum computer (in which case we have the additional well known advantages of quantum Fourier transform circuits). In the case that the small Fourier transforms are performed with a classical computer, complexity arguments for both methods show the reduction in computational time from O ( D 2 ) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathcal{O}(D<^>2)$$\end{document} to O ( D log D ) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathcal{O}(D\log D)$$\end{document} . The second method is also used for the fast calculation of Wigner and Weyl functions, in quantum systems with large finite dimension of the Hilbert space.

TI Segmentation of epithelial human type 2 cell images for the indirect
   immune fluorescence based on modified quantum entropy
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
AB The autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid, arthritis, and scleroderma are connective tissue diseases (CTD). Autoimmune diseases are generally diagnosed using the antinuclear antibody (ANA) blood test. This test uses indirect immune fluorescence (IIf) image analysis to detect the presence of liquid substance antibodies at intervals the blood, which is responsible for CTDs. Typically human alveolar epithelial cells type 2 (HEp2) are utilized as the substrate for the microscope slides. The various fluorescence antibody patterns on HEp-2 cells permits the differential designation-diagnosis. The segmentation of HEp-2 cells of IIf images is therefore a crucial step in the ANA test. However, not only this task is extremely challenging, but physicians also often have a considerable number of IIf images to examine.In this study, we propose a new methodology for HEp2 segmentation from IIf images by maximum modified quantum entropy. Besides, we have used a new criterion with a flexible representation of the quantum image(FRQI). The proposed methodology determines the optimum threshold based on the quantum entropy measure, by maximizing the measure of class separability for the obtained classes over all the gray levels. We tested the suggested algorithm over all images of the MIVIA HEp 2 image data set.To objectively assess the proposed methodology, segmentation accuracy (SA), Jaccard similarity (JS), the F1-measure,the Matthews correlation coefficient(MCC), and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used to evaluate performance. We have compared the proposed methodology with quantum entropy, Kapur and Otsu algorithms, respectively.The results show that the proposed algorithm is better than quantum entropy and Kapur methods. In addition, it overcomes the limitations of the Otsu method concerning the images which has positive skew histogram.This study can contribute to create a computer-aided decision (CAD) framework for the diagnosis of immune system diseases

TI AN EXPONENTIAL SEPARATION BETWEEN MA AND AM PROOFS OF PROXIMITY
SO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
AB Interactive proofs of proximity allow a sublinear-time verifier to check that a given input is close to the language, using a small amount of communication with a powerful (but untrusted) prover. In this work, we consider two natural minimally interactive variants of such proofs systems, in which the prover only sends a single message, referred to as the proof.
   The first variant, known as MA-proofs of Proximity (MAP), is fully non-interactive, meaning that the proof is a function of the input only. The second variant, known as AM-proofs of Proximity (AMP), allows the proof to additionally depend on the verifier's (entire) random string. The complexity of both MAPs and AMPs is the total number of bits that the verifier observes-namely, the sum of the proof length and query complexity.
   Our main result is an exponential separation between the power of MAPs and AMPs. Specifically, we exhibit an explicit and natural property Pi that admits an AMP with complexity O(log n), whereas any MAP for Pi has complexity (Omega) over bar (n(1/4)), where n denotes the length of the input in bits. Our MAP lower bound also yields an alternate proof, which is more general and arguably much simpler, for a recent result of Fischer et al. (ITCS, 2014). Also, Aaronson (Quantum Information & Computation 2012) has shown a Omega(n(1/6)) QMA lower bound for the same property Pi.
   Lastly, we also consider the notion of oblivious proofs of proximity, in which the verifier's queries are oblivious to the proof. In this setting, we show that AMPs can only be quadratically stronger than MAPs. As an application of this result, we show an exponential separation between the power of public and private coin for oblivious interactive proofs of proximity.

   of atom chips
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The laser cooling, trapping and manipulating of neutral atoms has become a valuable tool for scientists, providing innovative ways to probe the nature of reality and giving rise to transformative devices in the fields of precise measurement and quantum information processing. Unlike traditional complex and bulky atomic experimental facilities, atom chips, through the design, fabrication of surface-patterned microstructures, and the integration of devices on the substrates, can precisely control the magnetic, electric or optical fields on a micronano scale with low power consumption. It can realize strong trapping as well as coherent atomic manipulation. Since atom chip was first proposed twenty years ago, it has built a robust quantum platform for miniaturizing and integrating quantum optics and atomic physics tools on a chip. In this paper, first, we briefly review the development history of atom chips, then introduce the basic knowledge of micro potential traps and micro guides based on on-chip current-carrying wires. Afterwards, the key technologies about the chip material, design, fabrication, characterization and integration of atom chips are discussed in detail. We not only focus on the currently most active and successful areas - current carrying wires, but also look at more visionary approaches such as to the manipulation of atoms with real nano structures, say, carbon nano tubes. The design and fabrication principles of ideal atom chips are discussed as well. In the forth part, the worldwide plans and research projects involving with atom chip technologies are summarized, showing that many countries see this as an important foundational technology. Following that, the major developments in the application fields including atom clocks, atom interferometer gyroscope, cold atom gravimeter, etc are described. Finally, the challenges faced by atom chips towards practical application are pointed out and the prospects for their subsequent development are depicted.

TI Single-photon scattering in a two-level giant atom-dual waveguide
   coupled system based on local coupling phase regulation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB This work is to investigate the single-photon scattering in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics system consisting of two dipole-coupled giant atoms, each interacting with a separate one-dimensional infinite waveguide at two distinct coupling points. Our primary objective is to establish a theoretical framework for manipulating photon propagation paths via quantum interference induced by multiple coupling points and local phase engineering. Unlike traditional chiral coupling schemes, an innovative method, in which the coupling phases are designed locally at each atom-waveguide interface, is used to achieve effective chiral coupling, thereby introducing novel quantum interference mechanisms. Using a real-space approach, we derive analytical expressions for four-port scattering amplitudes. We establish the conditions for achieving perfect directional routing to any output port and demonstrate the coherent control mechanisms implemented by geometric and local coupled phases. Continuous frequency tunability is primarily achieved through dipole-dipole interaction, and finely tuned through the accumulated phase and local coupling phases. Local phase differences precisely regulate port-specific probability distributions within the waveguides while preserving total routing efficiency. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanisms of nonreciprocal transport and chiral scattering. The analysis reveals different governing principles: perfect nonreciprocity arises from the interplay of the accumulated phase, local coupling phases, photon-atom detuning, and dipole-dipole interaction. In contrast, perfect chiral scattering depends entirely on the accumulated phase and local coupling phases, and is independent of detuning. Notably, under the phase-matching conditions, the system achieves both perfect chiral and directional routing, and realizes frequency-selective path-asymmetric photon control. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for manipulating quantum interference in multi-atom waveguide systems, highlighting applications in quantum information processing, including tunable single-photon routers, isolators, and chiral quantum nodes. By implementing superconducting circuits, the local phase can be dynamically adjusted, thus proving the feasibility of the experiment.

TI Investigating machine learning solutions for a 256 channel TCSPC camera
   with sub-70 ps single photon timing per channel at data rates &gt;10
   Gbps
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB The development of a Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) camera with 256 channels has enabled several applications where single photon sensitivity is crucial, such as LiDAR, Fluorescent Lifetime IMaging (FLIM) and quantum information systems. The microchannel plate-based Multi-Anode Photo-Multiplier Tube (MAPMT) is a 16 x 16 array of 1.656mm pitch pixels with an active anode area of 26.5 x 26.5mm(2). Each pixel can time single photons with an accuracy of 60 ps rms at a maximum photon rate of 480 KHz.
   The timing electronics are capable of measuring 120 Mcps, producing huge volumes of data for processing, in the region of 10 Gbps per detector. Limitations in algorithmic data analysis techniques are critical for this application, hence this paper demonstrates a machine learning (ML) model which can determine the photon event coordinates with the objective of processing each one photon per 10 mu s. Themodel applies calibrations for the detector and electronics such as amplitude walk, and charge measurement and channel to channel threshold variation. Optimisation of the model is detailed within the paper, including training hyperparameters, the clustering of coincident events and compression of the model through pruning techniques.
   The ML model is trained and tested on a simulation of the microchannel plate (MCP) PMT with timing electronics configured for use as a TCSPC camera, utilising charge sharing techniques to further improve the spatial resolution of the detector. Further objectives of the research are to test the model on detector data, allowing assessment on the variance of accuracy between simulated and real data. Beyond this, assessment of the performance of this approach compared to algorithmic approaches and introduction of statistical reasoning of the robustness of the model will be completed.

AB A core goal of the NIST PQC competition is to produce PKE schemes which, even if attacked with a large-scale quantum computer, maintain the security guarantees needed by applications. The main security focus in the NIST PQC context has been IND-CCA security, but other applications demand that PKE schemes provide anonymity (Bellare et al., ASIACRYPT 2001), and robustness (Abdalla et al., TCC 2010). Examples of such applications include anonymous cryptocurrencies, searchable encryption, and auction protocols. However, almost nothing is known about how to build post-quantum PKE schemes offering these security properties. In particular, the status of the NIST PQC candidates with respect to anonymity and robustness is unknown.
   This paper initiates a systematic study of anonymity and robustness for post-quantum PKE schemes. Firstly, we identify implicit rejection as a crucial design choice shared by most post-quantum KEMs, show that implicit rejection renders prior results on anonymity and robustness for KEM-DEM PKEs inapplicable, and transfer prior results to the implicit-rejection setting where possible. Secondly, since they are widely used to build post-quantum PKEs, we examine how the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transforms (Fujisaki and Okamoto, Journal of Cryptology 2013) confer robustness and enhance weak anonymity of a base PKE.
   We then leverage our theoretical results to study the anonymity and robustness of three NIST KEM finalists-Saber, Kyber, and Classic McEliece-and one alternate, FrodoKEM. Overall, our findings for robustness are definitive: we provide positive robustness results for Saber, Kyber, and FrodoKEM, and a negative result for Classic McEliece. Our negative result stems from a striking property of KEM-DEM PKE schemes built with the Classic McEliece KEM: for any message m, we can construct a single hybrid ciphertext c which decrypts to the chosen m under any Classic McEliece private key.
   Our findings for anonymity are more mixed: we identify barriers to proving anonymity for Saber, Kyber, and Classic McEliece. We also found that in the case of Saber and Kyber, these barriers lead to issues with their IND-CCA security claims. We have worked with the Saber and Kyber teams to fix these issues, but they remain unresolved. On the positive side, we were able to prove anonymity for FrodoKEM and a variant of Saber introduced by D'Anvers et al. (AFRICACRYPT 2018). Our analyses of these two schemes also identified technical gaps in their IND-CCA security claims, but we were able to fix them.

TI Decoupling and Integrability of Nonassociative Vacuum Phase Space
   Gravitational Equations With Star and R-flux Parametric Deformations
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB We prove that nonassociative star deformed vacuum Einstein equations can be decoupled and integrated in certain general forms on phase spaces involving real R-flux terms induced as parametric corrections on base Lorentz manifold spacetimes. The geometric constructions are elaborated with parametric (on respective Planck, PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI, and string, kappa:=ls3/6PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI, constants) and nonholonomic dyadic decompositions of fundamental geometric and physical objects. This is our second partner work on elaborating nonassociative geometric and gravity theories with symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics, (non) linear connections, star deformations defined by generalized Moyal-Weyl products, endowed with quasi-Hopf algebra, or other type algebraic and geometric structures, and all adapted to nonholonomic distributions and frames. We construct exact and parametric solutions for nonassociative vacuum configurations (with nontrivial or effective cosmological constants) defined by star deformed generic off-diagonal (non) symmetric metrics and (generalized) nonlinear and linear connections. The coefficients of geometric objects defining such solutions are determined by respective classes of generating and integration functions and constants and may depend on all phase space coordinates [spacetime ones, (xi,t); and momentum like variables, (pa,E)]. Quasi-stationary configurations are stated by solutions with spacetime Killing symmetry on a time like vector partial differential t but with possible dependencies on momentum like coordinates on star deformed phase spaces. This geometric techniques of decoupling and integrating nonlinear systems of physically important partial differential equations (the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, AFCDM) is applied in our partner works for constructing nonassociative and locally anisotropic generalizations of black hole and cosmological solutions and elaborating geometric flow evolution and classical and quantum information theories.

TI Molasses-and Sideband-Cooling of Atoms in One-Dimensional Optical
   Lattice
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective We aim to reduce the temperature of cold atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice, as this can remarkably enhance atomic coherence time and thereby improve the performance of applications like quantum simulation, optical lattice clocks, and quantum computing. In a one-dimensional optical lattice clock, atoms that have undergone two-stage Doppler cooling are confined within the lattice. The lattice has strong confinement only in the polarization direction and weaker confinement in the other two directions, which leads to radial heating effects. Moreover, since cold atoms occupy different motional states within the lattice and follow a Boltzmann thermal distribution, using a clock laser to probe the atoms confined in the optical lattice can result in inhomogenous excitation due to the dependence of motional states on Rabi frequency. This inhomogeneity reduces the indistinguishability of fermions, introduces additional collision frequency shifts, and weakens the coherence between the laser and the atoms, ultimately decreasing the detection time. Consequently, it becomes impossible to obtain narrow linewidth clock transition spectra with high signal-to-noise ratios, further affecting the stability of the optical lattice clock and the level of quantum control. Even at mu K temperatures, the Doppler broadening can still reach tens of kHz. Cooling the atom ensemble using the damping force generated by standing wave fields can effectively reduce the temperature. To further lower the temperature of the atoms, various sub-Doppler cooling techniques are employed to cool the trapped atoms to their vibrational ground state, such as evaporative cooling and Raman sideband cooling. However, evaporative cooling requires long evaporation times and significant atomic loss, making it unsuitable for many applications. In contrast, the effectiveness of Raman sideband cooling can rival that of ion traps, making this cooling method widely applicable in optical clocks and optical tweezers. In this work, we apply optical molasses cooling and longitudinal Raman sideband cooling in a one-dimensional optical lattice to effectively lower the temperature of the cold atom ensemble and enhance coherence. Methods Based on the 87Sr optical lattice clock, the atomic temperature is cooled to the mu K level after two-stage laser cooling and is confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice with a trap depth of U=182Er. Using three pairs of orthogonal 689 nm lasers, a standing wave field is formed. By adjusting the frequency and power, the optical molasses cooling further lowers the temperature under the influence of three-dimensional damping forces. For the prepared quantum reference system, an appropriate bias magnetic field is applied, making the energy level shift of 1S0 indistinguishable, while the energy level shift of 3P1 is highly resolvable. At this point, a 698 nm cooling laser is applied along the polarization direction of the lattice light (+Z direction), with its frequency set to the red-detuned resonance frequency of the clock transition. This excites the atoms from the |1S0, | n ) state to the |3P0, | n-1) state. Due to the long lifetime of the excited state 3P0 [151.4(48) s], atoms cannot spontaneously return to the ground state quickly enough for effective cooling. Therefore, a 679 nm repumping laser is used to pump the atoms from the 3P0 state to the 3S1 state, allowing spontaneous relaxation to 3P2, 3P1, and 3P0 states. Only the 3P1 state can spontaneously relax back to |1S0,|n-1).
   Thus, a 707 nm repumping laser is applied to pump the atoms from the 3P2 state to the 3S1 state, ensuring that all populations return to the ground state |1S0,|n-1 ) via the 3P1 state. The entire cooling process lasts about 30 ms, with the sideband cooling light circulating 5 times to improve cooling efficiency. Finally, two 698 nm clock lasers probe the atoms, achieving the axial and radial clock laser resonant transitions between (5s2) 1S0(F=9/2)-(5s5p) 3P0(F=9/2), with the radial clock laser acting for 5 ms. Results and Discussions Through the optimization of the frequency and power of the 689 nm laser, optical lattice cooling successfully reduce the radial temperature of the atoms from 14.6 mu K to 8 mu K (Fig. 2). Longitudinal sideband cooling further lowers the axial temperature of the atoms from 5.6 mu K to 1.2 mu K (Fig. 2), decreasing the average external vibrational quantum number from 0.82 to 0.02. By observing Rabi oscillations (Fig. 3), the combination of optical molasses cooling and sideband cooling improves the maximum excitation fraction from 0.85 to 0.95, reduces inhomogeneous excitation, and increases the coherence time of the laser and atoms. Additionally, by measuring the atom fractions under different trap depths (Fig. 4), we demonstrate that our method increases low-temperature atom number in the lattice. This effect contributes to achieving higher stability for optical lattice clocks under lower quantum projection noise (QPN), particularly for shallow lattice clocks. Conclusions Optical molasses cooling and longitudinal sideband cooling effectively reduce the axial temperature of 87Sr atoms to 1/5 of the temperature without cooling while also lowering the radial temperature. After cooling, the average vibrational state of the atoms is 0.02, with over 98.4% of the atoms in the vibrational ground state. The maximum excitation fraction increases from 0.85 to 0.95, indicating that this cooling method enhances coherence. Moreover, remaining atom fraction under different trap depths also show that cooling increases the atomic population. This research helps improve coherence time and the atom number in shallow optical lattices, thus enhancing the performance of quantum applications such as optical lattice atomic clocks. This cooling method can also be extended to other atoms, including 171Yb, 199Hg, and 111Cd. In future work, high-power lasers and three-dimensional sideband cooling can be utilized to cool atomic temperatures to the tens of nK, enhancing atomic coherence and increasing the atom number in shallow lattices, thereby improving the level of quantum control.

TI Dynamic Disorder Drives Exciton Dynamics in
   Diketopyrrolopyrrole-Thiophene-Containing Molecular Crystals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB There is a growing interest in controllable molecular materials for potential nanophotonic and quantum information applications where excitons move beyond the incoherent transport regime. Thus, the ability to identify the key parameters that correlate with the efficiency of the transport of the excitation energy is highly desirable. In this work, we investigate the effects of the dynamic disorder on the transport of the exciton in molecular crystals of several mono-and dialkylated 1,4-diketo-3,6-dithiophenylpyrrolo[3-4-c]pyrrole derivatives. These systems exhibit great potential for photovoltaic applications due to their broad optical absorption and efficient charge transport. The exciton dynamics are studied using a model Hamiltonian, in which the thermal fluctuations of the excitonic coupling (nonlocal electron-phonon coupling), as well as the local exciton-phonon couplings, have been appropriately taken into account. The computed reorganization energies for the most feasible transport pathway (pi-pi stacking) for the excitons in UBEQUQ and UBEQOK molecular crystals are 0.366 and 0.357 eV, respectively. These values are comparable with the magnitude of the average excitonic coupling ⟨J⟩ (approximate to 0.1 eV) for these two molecular crystals. In this instance, the local exciton-phonon coupling is not large enough to form a small exciton-polaron. In addition, substantial coherences are observed on a time scale of less than 100 fs, which indicates that the dynamic disorder is sufficient to overcome quantum dephasing and help drive exciton transport in this class of organic semiconductors. On the other hand, the diffusion of the excitons reduces significantly when the thermal fluctuations of the excitonic coupling are omitted. Thus, dynamic disorder plays a vital role in the transport of the exciton, and the ability to control this inherent property in molecular aggregates will provide valuable tools for the design and development of efficient organic semiconductors.

TI Belief-invariant and quantum equilibria in games of incomplete
   information
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Drawing on ideas from game theory and quantum physics, we investigate nonlocal correlations from the point of view of equilibria in games of incomplete information. These equilibria can be classified in decreasing power as general communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria and correlated equilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of belief-invariant equilibrium appeared in game theory in the 90s. However, the class of non-signalling correlations associated to belief-invariance arose naturally already in the 80s in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
   In the present work, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and study the above classes of equilibria, together with quantum correlated equilibria, using tools from quantum information but the language of (algorithmic) game theory. We present a general framework of belief-invariant communication equilibria, which contains correlated equilibria and quantum correlated equilibria as special cases. Our framework also contains the theory of Bell inequalities and their violations due to non-locality, which is a question of intense interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and it was indeed the original motivation for the aforementioned studies. Moreover, in our framework we can also model quantum games where players have conflicting interests, a recent developing topic in physics.
   We then use our framework to show new results related to the social welfare of equilibria. Namely, we exhibit a game where belief-invariance is socially better than any correlated equilibrium, and a game where all non-belief-invariant communication equilibria have a suboptimal social welfare. We also show that optimal social welfare can in certain cases be achieved by quantum mechanical correlations, which do not need an informed mediator to be implemented, and go beyond the classical "sunspot" or shared randomness approach.

TI Laser cooling of antihydrogen atoms
SO NATURE
AB The photon-the quantum excitation of the electromagnetic field-is massless but carries momentum. A photon can therefore exert a force on an object upon collision(1). Slowing the translational motion of atoms and ions by application of such a force(2,3), known as laser cooling, was first demonstrated 40 years ago(4,5). It revolutionized atomic physics over the following decades(6-8), and it is now a workhorse in many fields, including studies on quantum degenerate gases, quantum information, atomic clocks and tests of fundamental physics. However, this technique has not yet been applied to antimatter. Here we demonstrate laser cooling of antihydrogen(9), the antimatter atom consisting of an antiproton and a positron. By exciting the 1S-2P transition in antihydrogen with pulsed, narrow-linewidth, Lyman-alpha laser radiation(10,11), we Doppler-cool a sample of magnetically trapped antihydrogen. Although we apply laser cooling in only one dimension, the trap couples the longitudinal and transverse motions of the anti-atoms, leading to cooling in all three dimensions. We observe a reduction in the median transverse energy by more than an order of magnitude-with a substantial fraction of the anti-atoms attaining submicroelectronvolt transverse kinetic energies. We also report the observation of the laser-driven 1S-2S transition in samples of laser-cooled antihydrogen atoms. The observed spectral line is approximately four times narrower than that obtained without laser cooling. The demonstration of laser cooling and its immediate application has far-reaching implications for antimatter studies. A more localized, denser and colder sample of antihydrogen will drastically improve spectroscopic(11-13) and gravitational(14) studies of antihydrogen in ongoing experiments. Furthermore, the demonstrated ability to manipulate the motion of antimatter atoms by laser light will potentially provide ground-breaking opportunities for future experiments, such as anti-atomic fountains, anti-atom interferometry and the creation of antimatter molecules.

TI Spatiotemporal optical vortices with controllable radial and azimuthal

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optical spatiotemporal vortices with transverse photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) have recently become a focal point of research. In this work we theoretically and experimentally investigate optical spatiotemporal vortices with radial and azimuthal quantum numbers, known as spatiotemporal Laguerre-Gaussian (STLG) wavepackets. These 3D wavepackets exhibit phase singularities and cylinder-shaped edge dislocations, resulting in a multi-ring topology in its spatiotemporal profile. Unlike conventional ST optical vortices, STLG wavepackets with non-zero p\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{{\boldsymbol{p}}}}}}$$\end{document} and l\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{{\boldsymbol{l}}}}}}$$\end{document} values carry a composite transverse OAM consisting of two directionally opposite components. We further demonstrate mode conversion between an STLG wavepacket and an ST Hermite-Gaussian (STHG) wavepacket through the application of strong spatiotemporal astigmatism. The converted STHG wavepacket is de-coupled in intensity in space-time domain that can be utilized to implement the efficient and accurate recognition of ultrafast STLG wavepackets carried various p\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{{\boldsymbol{p}}}}}}$$\end{document} and l.\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{{\boldsymbol{l}}}}}}.$$\end{document} This study may offer new insights into high-dimensional quantum information, photonic topology, and nonlinear optics, while promising potential applications in other wave phenomena such as acoustics and electron waves.
   The authors demonstrate the experimental generation and mode conversion of spatiotemporal Laguerre/Hermite-Gaussian wavepackets with controllable dual quantum numbers by imprinting two-dimensional complex modulation onto the spectrum of ultrashort laser pulses, opening new possibilities for spatiotemporally sculpturing of light.

TI Fractional Statistics
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB The quantum-mechanical description of assemblies of particles whose motion is confined to two (or one) spatial dimensions offers many possibilities that are distinct from bosons and fermions. We call such particles anyons. The simplest anyons are parameterized by an angular phase parameter theta. theta = 0,pi correspond to bosons and fermions, respectively; at intermediate values, we say that we have fractional statistics. In two dimensions, theta describes the phase acquired by the wave function as two anyons wind around one another counterclockwise. It generates a shift in the allowed values for the relative angular momentum. Composites of localized electric charge and magnetic flux associated with an abelian U(1) gauge group realize this behavior. More complex charge-flux constructions can involve nonabelian and product groups acting on a spectrum of allowed charges and fluxes, giving rise to nonabelian and mutual statistics. Interchanges of nonabelian anyons implement unitary transformations of the wave function within an emergent space of internal states. Anyons of all kinds are described by quantum field theories that include Chern-Simons terms. The crossings of one-dimensional anyons on a ring are unidirectional, such that a fractional phase theta acquired upon interchange gives rise to fractional shifts in the relative momenta between the anyons.The quasiparticle excitations of fractional quantum Hall states have long been predicted to include anyons. Recently, the anyon behavior predicted for quasiparticles in the v = 1/3 fractional quantum Hall state has been observed in both scattering and interferometric experiments. Excitations within designed systems, notably including superconducting circuits, can exhibit anyon behavior. Such systems are being developed for possible use in quantum information processing.

TI Thermal state structure in the Tavis-Cummings model and rapid
   simulations in mesoscopic quantum ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid quantum systems consisting of a collection of N spin-1/2 particles uniformly interacting with an electromagnetic field, such as one confined in a cavity, are important for the development of quantum information processors and will be useful for metrology, as well as tests of collective behavior. Such systems are often modeled by the Tavis-Cummings model, and having an accurate understanding of the thermal behaviors of this system is needed to understand their behavior in realistic environments. We quantitatively show in this work that the Dicke subspace approximation is at times invoked too readily. Specifically, we show that there is a temperature above which the degeneracies in the system become dominant and the Dicke subspace is minimally populated. This transition occurs at a lower temperature than previously considered. In such a temperature regime, the key constants of the motion are the total excitation count between the spin system and cavity and the collective angular momentum of the spin system. These enable perturbative expansions for thermal properties in terms of the energy shifts of dressed states, called Lamb shifts herein. They enable efficient numeric methods that scale in terms of the size of the spin system. Notably the runtime to obtain certain parameters of the system scales as O(root N), and is thus highly efficient. These provide methods for approximating, and bounding, properties of these systems as well as characterizing the dominant population regions, including under perturbative noise. In the regime of stronger spin-spin coupling, the perturbations outweigh the expansion series terms, and inefficient methods must likely be employed, removing the computational efficiency of simulating such systems. The results in this work can also be used for related systems such as coupled-cavity arrays, cavity-mediated coupling of collective spin ensembles, and collective spin systems.

TI Sub-megahertz compact self-pulsed Raman laser
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Broadband self-pulsed Raman laser operating at sub-megahertz (sub-MHz) has been widely used in optical sensing, high-spectral-resolution lidar, frequency-division multiplexing, and optical communication. However, it is a big challenge for achieving stable self-pulsed Raman laser oscillation in a wide pump power range. Here, we construct a compact Yb:YAG/YVO4 Raman laser for generating broadband self-pulsed laser operating at high repetition rate. The effects of cavity length (LC) and Raman crystal length (LR) on the performance of self-pulsed Raman laser have been investigated. By utilizing a 1.5 mm-thick YVO4 crystal as a Raman crystal, the repetition rate increases dramatically from 62 to 280 kHz when the LC decreases from 10 to 4 mm. Meanwhile, the pulse width of 0.66 mu s and peak power of 1.1 W are achieved for the self-pulsed Raman laser with LC = 4 mm. For the 4 mm-long Raman laser cavity constructed with a 2 mm-thick YVO4 crystal, the pump power range enable for self-pulsed Raman laser oscillation extends from 1.8 to 3.9 W, the repetition rate has been further increased from 258 to 467 kHz. While the peak power and pulse width are 0.6 W and 0.98 mu s, respectively. The Yb:YAG/YVO4 self-pulsed Raman laser oscillates in broadband multi-longitudinal-mode, the spectral bandwidth is 27.4 nm covering from 1051.1 to 1078.5 nm. Utilization of a tilted 2 mm-thick YVO4 crystal as output coupler to construct compact Yb:YAG/YVO4 self-pulsed Raman laser dramatically expands the pump power range for generating high repetition rate self-pulsed Raman laser. Sub-MHz self-pulsed Raman lasers with a wide spectral bandwidth have potential applications in materials processing, quantum information processing, and optical communications.

TI Duality of averaging of quantum states over arbitrary symmetry groups
   revealing Schur-Weyl duality
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB It is a well-established fact in quantum information theory, that uniform averaging over the collective action of a unitary group on a multipartite quantum state projects the state to a form equivalent to a permutation operator of the subsystems. Hence states equivalent to permutation operators are untouched by collective unitary noise. A trivial observation shows that uniform averaging over permutation operators projects the state into a form with block-diagonal structure equivalent to the one of the collective action of the unitary group. We introduce a name for this property: duality of averaging. The mathematical reason behind this duality is the fact that the collective action of the unitary group on the tensor product state space of a multipartite quantum system and the action of the permutation operations are mutual commutants when treated as matrix algebras. Such pairs of matrix algebras are known as dual reductive pairs. In this work we show, that in the case of finite dimensional quantum systems such duality of averaging holds for any pairs of symmetry groups being dual reductive pairs, regardless of whether they are compact or not, as long as the averaging operation is defined via iterated integral over the Cartan decomposition of the group action. Although our result is very general, we focus much attention on the concrete example of a dual reductive pair consisting of collective action of special linear matrices and permutation operations, which physically corresponds to averaging multipartite quantum states over non-unitary SLOCC-type (Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication) operations. In this context we show, that noiseless subsystems known from collective unitary averaging persist in the case of SLOCC averaging in a conditional way: upon postselection to specific invariant subspaces.

TI Theoretical investigation of preparation pathways that enhance the
   equilibrium yield of negatively ionized tin-vacancy centers in N-doped
   diamond
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The elucidation of the mechanism of Sn V- formation in diamond is especially important as the Sn V- color center has the potential to be a superior single-photon emitter when compared to the N V and to other Group IV impurity-vacancy color centers in diamond. The typical formation of Sn V involves placing Sn in diamond by ion implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn V species requires an additional complication. This complication is related to the energy cost associated with electronic transitions within the host diamond. Effectively, producing the Sn V- charge state using an electron obtained from a band edge of the host diamond is less energetically favorable than having the Sn V- receive an electron from a neighboring donor dopant. Among donor dopants, substitutional N (N C) is always present in even the purest synthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron donation by N C has been proposed by Collins for charging the N V in diamond and it has been used to interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this paper, we use density functional theory (DFT) to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn V- charge state due to electron donation arising from the presence of N C in the host diamond. Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in equilibrium in each of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the Sn V- throughout each of the pathways. The importance of our work is to suggest experimental ways of enhancing the yield of charged states like the Sn V- in diamond for transformative applications in optoelectronics and quantum information.

TI Towards tunable exciton delocalization in DNA Holliday
   junction-templated indodicarbocyanine 5 (Cy5) dye derivative
   heterodimers
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB We studied the exciton delocalization of indodicarbocyanine 5 dye derivative (Cy5-R) heterodimers templated by a DNA Holliday junction (HJ), which was quantified by the exciton hopping parameter Jm,n. These dyes were modified at the 5 and 5 ' positions of indole rings with substituent (R) H, Cl, tBu, Peg, and hexyloxy (Hex) groups that exhibit different bulkiness and electron-withdrawing/donating capacities. The substituents tune the physical properties of the dyes, such as hydrophobicity (log P) and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). We tuned the Jm,n of heterodimers by attaching two Cy5-Rs in adjacent and transverse positions along the DNA-HJ. Adjacent heterodimers exhibited smaller Jm,n compared to transverse heterodimers, and some adjacent heterodimers displayed a mixture of H- and J-like aggregates. Most heterodimers exhibited Jm,n values within the ranges of the corresponding homodimers, but some heterodimers displayed synergistic exciton delocalization that resulted in larger Jm,n compared to their homodimers. We then investigated how chemically distinct Cy5-R conjugated to DNA can interact to create delocalized excitons. We determined that heterodimers involving Cy5-H and Cy5-Cl and a dye with larger substituents (bulky substituents and large SASA) such as Cy5-Peg, Cy5-Hex, and Cy5-tBu resulted in larger Jm,n. The combination provides steric hindrance that optimizes co-facial packing (bulky Cy5-R) with a smaller footprint (small SASA) that maximizes proximity. The results of this study lay a groundwork for rationally optimizing the exciton delocalization in dye aggregates for developing next-generation technologies based on optimized exciton transfer efficiency such as quantum information systems and biomedicine.

TI Growth temperature induced changes of luminescence in epitaxial BN: from
   colour centres to donor-acceptor recombination
SO NANOSCALE
AB Defects play a very important role in semiconductors and only the control over the defect properties allows the implementation of materials in dedicated applications. We present an investigation of the UV luminescence of defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) grown by Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE). Such intentionally introduced defects are important for applications like deep UV emission and quantum information. In this work, we performed photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence experiments on a set of h-BN layers grown by MOVPE at different growth temperatures (t(gr)). The obtained defect-related spectra in the ultraviolet range include well-known lines at about 230 nm (X230, h nu = 5.4 eV) and 300 nm (C300 - the brightest one, h nu = 4.14 eV) as well as a rarely observed band with a zero-phonon line at 380 nm (C380, h nu = 3.24 eV). The C300 and C380 bands have the characteristic of a color centre showing sharp lines (0.6 nm width) at 5 K. These lines are most probably an internal transition of carbon-related defects. We show that for samples grown at high temperatures (t(gr) > 1200 degrees C), the lines related to the color centres C are replaced by broad bands at 330 nm and 400 nm, which we marked as D330 and D400, respectively. The D bands have similar central energies to the C bands but extend over a large energy range, so we propose that the D emission is due to a shallow donor to deep acceptor recombination. Time-resolved photoluminescence analysis determined the lifetimes of the individual lines in the range from 0.9 ns (C300), 1.8 ns (C380) to 4 ns (D400). The C300 and C380 color centre bands are composed of a series of characteristic lines that are due to the interaction with phonons. The E-1u (198 meV) and A(2u) (93 meV) phonon replicas have been identified.

TI Circulating tumour DNA as a predictive biomarker for tumour response and
   prolonged clinical benefit with nivolumab in advanced non-small cell
   lung cancer
SO LUNG INDIA
AB Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionised the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Quantitative monitoring of disease burden may prove predictive in these cases. We hypothesised that serial ctDNA molecular response assessment may be predictive of response to nivolumab. Materials and Methods: 44 NSCLC patients who received nivolumab were included. All the patients underwent response assessment by RECIST every four cycles. Peripheral blood samples were obtained at baseline and after four cycles of therapy, and the quantification of ctDNA was performed by qubit dsDNA HS assay. A variant allele fraction (VAF) of >0.3% was considered to be used for tracking. A cut-off change of 50% in VAF and ctDNA was considered for molecular response. Radiological evaluations were performed at baseline and every four cycles as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Results: The median ctDNA concentration was higher in patients with time to progression (TTP) of <4 months (P = 0.05). Detectable alterations with >0.3% VAF were detected in 31 patients, and a molecular response of >50% was observed in patients with PR, stable disease (SD) and two patients with PD. The patients with <50%molecular response had a median PFS of 3.9 months vs. those with >50% had a median of 5.8 months (P = 0.06). A cut of 0.3 ng/microlitre baseline ctDNA concentration was predictive of PFS. Conclusion: This is an initial experience from India using liquid biopsy next-generation sequencing (NGS) for dynamic monitoring in immunotherapy-treated patients. A 50% cut-off for response as well as a baseline ctDNA 0f 0.3 ng/microlitre showed a trend for better PFS in these patients. This study highlights the need for serial monitoring. To our knowledge, this is among the first real-world Indian studies validating serial NGS-based ctDNA monitoring in immunotherapy-treated NSCLC. It demonstrates feasibility, predictive value, and real-world applicability in a lower-middle-income context.

TI Pulsed blue light, saliva and curcumin significantly inactivate human
   coronavirus
SO JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY
AB In a recent study, we showed that pulsed blue light (PBL) inactivates as much as 52.3% of human beta coronavirus HCoV-OC43, a surrogate of SARS-CoV-2, and one of the major strains of viruses responsible for the annual epidemic of the common cold. Since curcumin and saliva are similarly antiviral and curcumin acts as blue light photosensitizer, we used Qubit fluorometry and WarmStart RT-LAMP assays to study the effect of combining 405 nm, 410 nm, 425 nm or 450 nm wavelengths of PBL with curcumin, saliva or a combination of curcumin and saliva against human beta coronavirus HCoV-OC43. The results showed that PBL, curcumin and saliva independently and collectively inactivate HCoV-OC43. Without saliva or curcumin supplementation 21.6 J/cm(2) PBL reduced HCoV-OC43 RNA concentration a maximum of 32.8% (log(10) = 2.13). Saliva supplementation alone inactivated the virus, reducing its RNA concentration by 61% (log(10) = 2.23); with irradiation the reduction was as much as 79.1%. Curcumin supplementation alone decreased viral RNA 71.1%, and a maximum of 87.8% with irradiation. The combination of saliva and curcumin reduced viral RNA to 83.1% and decreased the RNA up to 90.2% with irradiation. The reduced levels could not be detected with qPCR. These findings show that PBL in the range of 405 nm to 450 nm wavelength is antiviral against human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, a surrogate of the COVID-19 virus. Further, it shows that with curcumin as a photosensitizer, it is possible to photodynamically inactivate the virus beyond qPCR detectable level using PBL. Since HCoV-OC43 is of the same beta coronavirus family as SARS-CoV-2, has the same genomic size, and is often used as its surrogate, these findings heighten the prospect of similarly inactivating novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 pandemic.

TI Comparison of six methods for Loa loa genomic DNA extraction
SO PLOS ONE
AB ObjectivesGood-quality and sufficient DNA is essential for diagnostics and vaccine development. We aimed to compare six DNA extraction techniques applied to Loa loa microfilariae in order to evaluate the purity and integrity of extracts in terms of quality and quantity. MethodsThe microfilariae were purified via a Percoll gradient procedure with blood from hyper-microfilaremic individuals (> 30,000 microfilaria [mf]/ml). DNA extraction was carried out in duplicate at a rate of 350,000 mf/tube for each technique: phenol/chloroform, commercial Qiagen kit, salting out, Tris-EDTA, methanol, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The integrity, purity, concentration, and quality of the DNA extracts were successively verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry (A(260)/A(280) and A(260)/A(230) wavelength ratio), Qubit fluorometry, and endonuclease and polymerase activity. The six techniques were compared on the basis of the following parameters: concentration, purity, efficiency, effectiveness, integrity, safety of the technique, as well as cost and duration of the protocol. ResultsThe ratios of the optical densities of the extracts A(260)/A(280) and A(260)/A(230) were, respectively: phenol/chloroform (1.82; 1.11), Qiagen (1.93; 1.36), salting-out (1.9; 2.04), Tris-EDTA (1.99; 1.183), methanol (2.126; 1.343), and CTAB (2.01; 2.426). The DNA yield was: phenol/chloroform (3.920 mu g), Qiagen (10.280 mu g), salting-out (10.390 mu g), Tris-EDTA (0.5528 mu g), methanol (0.1036 mu g), and CTAB (1.115 mu g). Endonuclease and polymerase activity was demonstrated by digestion of DNA and through amplicons obtained via polymerase chain reaction assays with phenol/chloroform, Qiagen, and salting-out extracts. ConclusionThe phenol/chloroform, Qiagen, and salting-out DNA extracts were all of good quality. Salting out had the best yield followed by Qiagen and then phenol/chloroform. Endonuclease and polymerase activity was effective in all three extracts despite the presence of some contaminants. These methods are therefore suitable for the extraction of DNA from Loa loa microfilariae. Tris-EDTA and methanol did not show adequate sensitivity, while CTAB was found to be unsuitable.

TI A Toss without a Coin: Information, Discontinuity, and Mathematics in
   Quantum Theory
SO ENTROPY
AB The article argues that-at least in certain interpretations, such as the one assumed in this article under the heading of "reality without realism"-the quantum-theoretical situation appears as follows: While-in terms of probabilistic predictions-connected to and connecting the information obtained in quantum phenomena, the mathematics of quantum theory (QM or QFT), which is continuous, does not represent and is discontinuous with both the emergence of quantum phenomena and the physics of these phenomena, phenomena that are physically discontinuous with each other as well. These phenomena, and thus this information, are described by classical physics. All actually available information (in the mathematical sense of information theory) is classical: it is composed of units, such as bits, that are-or are contained in-entities described by classical physics. On the other hand, classical physics cannot predict this information when it is created, as manifested in measuring instruments, in quantum experiments, while quantum theory can. In this epistemological sense, this information is quantum. The article designates the discontinuity between quantum theory and the emergence of quantum phenomena the "Heisenberg discontinuity", because it was introduced by W. Heisenberg along with QM, and the discontinuity between QM or QFT and the classical physics of quantum phenomena, the "Bohr discontinuity", because it was introduced as part of Bohr's interpretation of quantum phenomena and QM, under the assumption of Heisenberg discontinuity. Combining both discontinuities precludes QM or QFT from being connected to either physical reality, that ultimately responsible for quantum phenomena or that of these phenomena themselves, other than by means of probabilistic predictions concerning the information, classical in character, contained in quantum phenomena. The nature of quantum information is, in this view, defined by this situation. A major implication, discussed in the Conclusion, is the existence and arguably the necessity of two-classical and quantum-or with relativity, three and possibly more essentially different theories in fundamental physics.

TI Development of a Nanoplate-Based Digital PCR Test Method for
   Quantitative Detection of Human Adenovirus DNA
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Objective: Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) assay is an advanced PCR technique that allows for the simultaneous detection and absolute quantification of diverse patho-gens. Commercially validated kits available for detecting all subtypes of human adenovi-rus (HAdV) are limited. This study aimed to demonstrate the development of an in-house nanoplate-based dPCR assay with high sensitivity, even at low copy numbers. Materials and Methods: In this methodological study, the standardized HAdV DNA was prepared by amplifying the specific hexon gene region with real-time PCR and purifying the HAdV DNA using magnetic beads from HAdV-positive extractions. Dilutions were tested in triplicate during three independent runs to determine the dynamic range, the limit of detection (LoD), the limit of quantification (LoQ), precision, and reproducibility. The primer and probe sequences used in the study were selected based on a literature review to ensure the detection of all HAdV serotypes in a single run. The selected primers were verified using the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NBCI) nBLAST tools, and the target sequence was determined using the BioEdit software. The DNA concentration of the stock solution was measured using a Qubit fluorometer. The estimated copy number of the stock solution per milliliter was calculated based on the length of the amplified base sequence and fluorometer measurement. Results: The dynamic range of the test was determined to be from 770.4 to 0.9476 cp/mu l, with the LoD and LoQ values both being 0.9476 cp/mu l. The coefficient of determination (r2) value of the test was 0.9986. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the dPCR method could be an ideal tool for the di-agnosis and absolute quantification of human adenoviruses, especially in low copy numbers. In order to determine the reproducibility of the test and validate the method for field use, it needs to be developed and adapted in various laboratories and supported by clinical studies.

TI Significance of screening sensitive methylation sites using whole-genome
   sequencing in early diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The current study aimed to screen the sensitive methylation sites of non-small cell lung cancer by whole-genome sequencing and construct an early warning system for lung cancer. For this purpose, from June 2017 to December 2020, fresh NSCLC tissues and paired adjacent NSCLC tissues from 45 patients were collected. DNA and total RNA were extracted from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and paired non-cancerous lung tissues. The DNA library combined with a biotinylated probe was collected by Dynabeads m270 streptavidin beads. The concentration of the final library was determined by qubit dsDNA HS assay. Quantitative analysis of DMR methylation in 45 paired tumor and normal lung tissues was performed. RT qPCR and Western blot were used to verify the mRNA expression of candidate genes. Results showed that the methylation rate of CpG 7 in stxbp6 in stage III NSCLC was higher than that in stage I and early-stage II NSCLC; The methylation rates of cpg1 and 38-39 units in fzd10 were higher in stage I NSCLC than in stage II and III NSCLC; The methylation rates of CpG 6 in stxbp6 and CpG 4 and 20-21 in bcl6b in patients with tumor diameter > 3cm were higher than those in patients with tumor diameter < 3cm; Methylation of CpG unit 3 in stxbp6 is associated with age. Stxbp6, bcl6b, fzd10 and hspb6 mRNA expression were down-regulated in patients under 45 years old. The methylation rates of CpG 7 in stxbp6, CPG 6 in stxbp6 and CpG 4 and 20-21 in bcl6b were negatively correlated with the survival time of patients; The methylation rates of CpG 1 and 38-39 units in fzd10 were positively correlated with survival time (P<0.05). It was concluded that the methylation rates of CpG 7 in stxbp6, CPG 6 in stxbp6 and CpG 4 and 20-21 in bcl6b are valuable for early diagnosis. Copyright: (c) 2021 by the C.M.B. Association.

TI Quantum nonlocal test of "X" state based on geometric interpretation of
   CHSH inequality
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum nonlocal correlation is one of the important features that distinguish the quantum theory from classical theory. As a typical quantum mixed state, the study of quantum nonlocal correlation based on the "X" state is of great importance for the verification of the correctness of quantum theory and the application of quantum information theory. In this work, with the traditional Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality testing for quantum nonlocal correlations, we propose a strategy for testing the quantum nonlocal correlations based on the geometric interpretation of the "X" state. By using the geometric interpretation of the "X" state, which is described by the transform of Bloch sphere, it is possible to investigate the optimal selection of measurement settings. The maximum value of CHSH inequalities can also obtained from the physical images. Finally, the range of parameters for a successful quantum nonlocal correlation testing based on the CHSH inequality for the "X" state is studied. The results show that when f = 1, the "X" state will be reduced to a normal pure entangled state, and the quantum nonlocal correlation testing results are in full agreement with the traditional ones. This result proves the correctness of the geometric interpretation strategy proposed in this work. When f < 1, only some of the "X" states can be used for e successfully testing the quantum nonlocal correlations. It is also found that the range of fidelity values that can successfully test the quantum nonlocal correlations will be further increased by increasing the values of r. In particular, when r = 1, the range of fidelity value will reach a largest one (e.g. f > 0.781). The results in this work can provide the reference for experimentally testing the quantum nonlocal correlation by using the "X" state.

TI Entanglement island, miracle operators and the firewall
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we obtain some general results on information retrieval from the black hole interior, based on the recent progress on quantum extremal surface formula and entanglement island. We study an AdS black hole coupled to a bath with generic dynamics, and ask whether it is possible to retrieve information about a small perturbation in the interior from the bath system. We show that the one-norm distance between two reduced states in a bath region A is equal to the same quantity in the bulk quantum field theory for region AI where I is the entanglement island of A. This is a straightforward generalization of bulk-boundary correspondence in AdS/CFT. However, we show that a contradiction arises if we apply this result to a special situation when the bath dynamics includes a unitary operation that carries a particular measurement to a region A and send the result to another region W. Physically, the contradiction arises between transferability of classical information during the measurement, and non-transferability of quantum information which determines the entanglement island.
   We propose that the resolution of the contradiction is to realize that the state reconstruction formula does not apply to the special situation involving interior-information-retrieving measurements. This implies that the assumption of smooth replica AdS geometry with boundary condition set by the flat space bath has to break down when the particular measurement operator is applied to the bath. Using replica trick, we introduce an explicitly construction of such operator, which we name as "miracle operators". From this construction we see that the smooth replica geometry assumption breaks down because we have to introduce extra replica wormholes connecting with the "simulated blackholes" introduced by the miracle operator. We study the implication of miracle operators in understanding the firewall paradox.

TI Consideration of non-phase-matched nonlinear effects in the design of
   quasi-phase-matching crystals for optical parametric oscillators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Femtosecond optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are widely used in ultrafast nonlinear frequency conversion and quantum information. However, conventional OPOs based on quasi-phase-matching (QPM) crystals have many parasitic non-phase-matched processes which decrease the conversion efficiency. Here, we propose nine-wave coupled equations (NWCEs) to simulate all phase-matched and non-phase-matched interactions in QPM crystals to improve conventional three-wave coupled equations (TWCEs), especially for the situation of high intensity ultrashort pulses and complexly structured crystals. We discuss how to design the poling period of QPM crystal to maximize the conversion efficiency of signal light for a given OPO system. The simulation reveals that the OPO based on chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPPLN) with a certain chirp rate has higher signal wave conversion efficiency than that of a PPLN, and demonstrates that NWCEs illustrate more details of the pulse evolution in the OPO cavity. Starting from a CPPLN, an aperiodically poled lithium niobate (APPLN) design is available by modifying the domain lengths of the crystal and optimizing the OPO output power via dynamical optimization algorithm. The results show that by using a properly designed APPLN crystal, a 1600 nm OPO, when pumped by a femtosecond laser with 1030 nm central wavelength, 150 femtosecond pulse duration and 5 GW/cm(2) power intensity at the focus, can achieve very efficient output with a signal light conversion efficiency of 50.6%, which is higher than that of PPLN (25.2%) and CPPLN (40.2%). The scheme in this paper will provide a reference for the design of nonlinear QPM crystals of OPOs and will help to understand the complex nonlinear dynamical behavior in OPO cavities.

We show that, under additional symmetry assumptions, this problem reduces to a linear program that can be solved in time that does not scale in d, and we provide a general framework to execute this reduction under different types of symmetries. The key ingredient of our method is a compact parametrization of the solution space by linear combinations of walled Brauer algebra diagrams. This parametrization requires the idempotents of a Gelfand-Tsetlin basis, which we obtain by adapting a general method inspired by the Okounkov-Vershik approach. To illustrate potential applications of our framework, we use several examples from quantum information: deciding the principal eigenvalue of a quantum state, quantum majority vote, asymmetric cloning and transformation of a black-box unitary. We also outline a possible route for extending our method to general unitary-equivariant semidefinite programs.

TI Distillable entanglement under dually non-entangling operations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Computing the exact rate at which entanglement can be distilled from noisy quantum states is one of the longest-standing questions in quantum information. We give an exact solution for entanglement distillation under the set of dually non-entangling (DNE) operations-a relaxation of the typically considered local operations and classical communication, comprising all channels which preserve the sets of separable states and measurements. We show that the DNE distillable entanglement coincides with a modified version of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement in which the arguments are measured with a separable measurement. Ours is only the second known regularised formula for the distillable entanglement under any class of free operations in entanglement theory, after that given by Devetak and Winter for (one-way) local operations and classical communication. An immediate consequence of our finding is that, under DNE, entanglement can be distilled from any entangled state. As our second main result, we construct a general upper bound on the DNE distillable entanglement, using which we prove that the separably measured relative entropy of entanglement can be strictly smaller than the regularisation of the standard relative entropy of entanglement, solving an open problem posed by Li and Winter. Finally, we study also the reverse task of entanglement dilution and show that the restriction to DNE operations does not change the entanglement cost when compared with the larger class of non-entangling operations. This implies a strong form of irreversiblility of entanglement theory under DNE operations: even when asymptotically vanishing amounts of entanglement may be generated, entangled states cannot be converted reversibly.
   Computing how much entanglement can be extracted from imperfect quantum states is a long-standing problem in quantum resource theory. Here, Lami and Regula move away from the usual case in which the operations considered free to implement are local operations and classical communication, and find instead a solution for the case of dually non-entangling operations.

Employing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that laser-driven topological edge states significantly boost second-harmonic generation (SHG) and third-harmonic generation (THG) efficiencies, enabling advanced photonic devices and nonlinear spectroscopy.

TI Multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization of ultracold molecular
   orientation with limited rotational states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The design of shaping pulse fields for controlling molecular orientation is of great importance in fields of stereochemical reactions, strong-field ionization, and quantum information processing. Traditional quantum optimal control algorithms typically solve the problem of molecular orientation in an infinite-dimensional rotational space, but they often overlook the constraints imposed by experimental limitations. In this work, a multi-objective and multi-constraint quantum optimal control algorithm is proposed to design a pulse field that conforms to the constraints of pulse area and energy. Specifically, the algorithm enforces a zero pulse area condition to eliminate the static field components and maintains constant pulse energy, ensuring compatibility with realistic experimental setups. Under these constraints, the algorithm optimizes the population and phase distribution of a selected number of low-lying rotational states in ultracold molecules to achieve maximum molecular orientation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical studies involving two-and three-state target subspaces, where the creation of a coherent superposition state with optimized population and phase distribution leads to the desired molecular orientation. Furthermore, its scalability is validated by applying it to a more complex 17-state subspace, where a maximum orientation value of 0.99055 is obtained, approaching the global optimal value of 1. Our findings demonstrate that by effectively managing these constraints, the influence of rotational states in the non-target state subspace can be substantially suppressed. The time-frequency analysis of the optimized pulses, combined with the Fourier transform spectrum of the time-dependent degree of orientation, indicates that the maximum molecular orientation is mainly achieved through ladder-climbing excitation of multi-color pulse fields, with the contributions from highly excited states being minimal. This work provides a valuable reference for designing experimentally feasible pulse fields using multi-constraint optimization algorithms, which helps to precisely control a limited number of rotational states to achieve maximum molecular orientation.

TI Effects of topological and non-topological edge states on information
   propagation and scrambling in a Floquet spin chain
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The action of any local operator on a quantum system propagates through the system carrying the information of the operator. This is usually studied via the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We numerically study the information propagation from one end of a periodically driven spin-1/2 XY chain with open boundary conditions using the Floquet infinite-temperature OTOC. We calculate the OTOC for two different spin operators, sigma x and sigma z . For sinusoidal driving, the model can be shown to host different types of edge states, namely, topological (Majorana) edge states and non-topological edge states. We observe a localization of information at the edge for both sigma z and sigma x OTOCs whenever edge states are present. In addition, in the case of non-topological edge states, we see oscillations of the OTOC in time near the edge, the oscillation period being inversely proportional to the gap between the Floquet eigenvalues of the edge states. We provide an analytical understanding of these effects due to the edge states. It was known earlier that the OTOC for the spin operator which is local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions (sigma z ) shows no signature of information scrambling inside the light cone of propagation, while the OTOC for the spin operator which is non-local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions (sigma x ) shows signatures of scrambling. We report a remarkable 'unscrambling effect' in the sigma x OTOC after reflections from the ends of the system. Finally, we demonstrate that the information propagates into the system mainly via the bulk states with the maximum value of the group velocity, and we show how this velocity is controlled by the driving frequency and amplitude.

TI Spectral estimation for Hamiltonians: a comparison between classical
   imaginary-time evolution and quantum real-time evolution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We consider the task of spectral estimation of local quantum Hamiltonians. The spectral estimation is performed by estimating the oscillation frequencies or decay rates of signals representing the time evolution of states. We present a classical Monte Carlo (MC) scheme which efficiently estimates an imaginary-time, decaying signal for stoquastic (i.e. sign-problem-free) local Hamiltonians. The decay rates in this signal correspond to Hamiltonian eigenvalues (with associated eigenstates present in an input state) and can be extracted using a classical signal processing method like ESPRIT. We compare the efficiency of this MC scheme to its quantum counterpart in which one extracts eigenvalues of a general local Hamiltonian from a real-time, oscillatory signal obtained through quantum phase estimation circuits, again using the ESPRIT method. We prove that the ESPRIT method can resolve S = poly(n) eigenvalues, assuming a 1/poly(n) gap between them, with poly(n) quantum and classical effort through the quantum phase estimation (QPE) circuits, assuming efficient preparation of the input state. We prove that our MC scheme plus the ESPRIT method can resolve S = O(1) eigenvalues, assuming a 1/poly(n) gap between them, with poly(n) purely classical effort for stoquastic Hamiltonians, requiring some access structure to the input state. However, we also show that under these assumptions, i.e. S = O(1) eigenvalues, assuming a 1/poly(n) gap between them and some access structure to the input state, one can achieve this with poly(n) purely classical effort for general local Hamiltonians. These results thus quantify some opportunities and limitations of MC methods for spectral estimation of Hamiltonians. We numerically compare the MC eigenvalue estimation scheme (for stoquastic Hamiltonians) and the quantum-phase-estimation-based eigenvalue estimation scheme by implementing them for an archetypal stoquastic Hamiltonian system: the transverse field Ising chain.

TI Scattering strings off quantum extremal surfaces
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We consider a Hayden & Preskill like setup for both maximally chaotic and sub-maximally chaotic quantum field theories. We act on the vacuum with an operator in a Rindler like wedge R and transfer a small subregion I of R to the other wedge. The chaotic scrambling dynamics of the QFT Rindler time evolution reveals the information in the other wedge. The holographic dual of this process involves a particle excitation falling into the bulk and crossing into the entanglement wedge of the complement to r = R\I. With the goal of studying the locality of the emergent holographic theory we compute various quantum information measures on the boundary that tell us when the particle has entered this entanglement wedge. In a maximally chaotic theory, these measures indicate a sharp transition where the particle enters the wedge exactly when the insertion is null separated from the quantum extremal surface for r. For sub-maximally chaotic theories, we find a smoothed crossover at a delayed time given in terms of the smaller Lyapunov exponent and dependent on the time-smearing scale of the probe excitation. The information quantities that we consider include the full vacuum modular energy R\I as well as the fidelity between the state with the particle and the state without. Along the way, we find a new explicit formula for the modular Hamiltonian of two intervals in an arbitrary 1+1 dimensional CFT to leading order in the small cross ratio limit. We also give an explicit calculation of the Regge limit of the modular flowed chaos correlator and find examples which do not saturate the modular chaos bound. Finally, we discuss the extent to which our results reveal properties of the target of the probe excitation as a "stringy quantum extremal surface" or simply quantify the probe itself thus giving a new approach to studying the notion of longitudinal string spreading.

TI Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in Gaussian beams using a
   cylindrical lens pair with tunable focal lengths
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams is critical for improving performance in many applications like microscopy, atomic physics, quantum information processing, and advanced manufacturing. Passive correction methods based on cylindrical lens telescopes require choosing lenses with precise focal lengths, effectively limiting the range of tunability when using standard catalog optics. Active solutions based on diffractive optical elements can achieve superior performance and dynamic response, but they are bulky, expensive, and suffer from finite diffraction efficiency and added complexity. Here, we introduce a simple method to convert astigmatic elliptical beams into circular Gaussian beams without astigmatism. Our method comprises three cylindrical lenses. The first lens focuses the beam along its major axis to create a plane where the intensity profile is radially symmetric. The second and third lenses are placed one behind the other in that plane at a relative angle, acting as a biaxial lens pair with tunable focal lengths. By adjusting the relative angle of the lenses, the two separate beam waists of the astigmatic beam can be overlapped, resulting in a circular Gaussian beam without astigmatism. We theoretically validate our method, numerically quantify its robustness to experimental imperfections, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to circularize the output beam of a commercial laser source. Compared to SLM-based approaches, our design is significantly more compact and cost-effective, with component prices comparable to standard lenses and dimensions suitable for integration into tabletop optical paths. Its performance is ultimately limited by the validity of the paraxial approximation (breaking down for beam sizes comparable to the wavelength), the finite inter-lens distance between the second and third lenses, and the inability of cylindrical lenses to address higher-order aberrations. Its simple and compact design makes it well-suited for both laboratory and industrial optical systems. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Interacting topological quantum aspects with light and geometrical
   functions
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB I review my recent progress and develop a geometrical approach in the quantum with light as a guide, from the vector potential in classical physics, revealing that topological properties can be equivalently measured from the poles of a sphere. The topological state is induced on the Bloch sphere of a spin-1/2 particle from a radial magnetic field related to the physics of Skyrmions. This shows a relation between the global topological response being measured at the poles, the response to a circularly polarized field and the quantum metric. I show how this approach is helpful for the classification of matter with the detection of the global topological invariant at specific points in the Brillouin zone, e.g. the Dirac points, from the responses to electromagnetic waves such as circularly polarized light and from new geometrical functions associated to the quantum metric measuring the quantum Hall and spin Hall conductivities. The M point associated to the Brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice also reveals the topological signature. Interactions are included in momentum space within a stochastic variational approach. In a realistic quantum model of interacting spins, this leads to fractional topological entangled aspects with a correspondence between a pair of half invariants and a Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair or Bell state at one pole. I also formulate a correspondence between fractional topological numbers and resonating valence bond states. This approach gives further insight on the characterization of topological matter linked to superconductivity, protected topological semimetals in two dimensions and on the search of Majorana fermions for topologically protected quantum information. We also address a correspondence with the fractional quantum Hall effect and surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Advances in detection and regulation of surface-supported molecular
   quantum states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Single molecular systems are typical quantum confinement systems, which have rich electronic states, photon states and spin states due to their discrete energy levels, localized orbitals and diverse chemical structures. The states determined by quantum mechanics in these molecular systems make it possible to serveas great physical entities for future quantum information technology. The detection and manipulation of quantum states on a single molecule scale are beneficial to the bottom-up construction of quantum devices.Owing to the highly limited spatial localization of single molecular systems, it is difficult to accurately addressand manipulate them with conventional macroscopic characterization methods. Scanning tunneling microscope(STM) is such a powerful tool that it can achieve high-resolution real-space imaging as well as spectroscopicinvestigation, with the ability to in-situ manipulating the individual atoms or molecules. It can also work jointly with various near-field or external field characterization techniques, making it a most important technique forprecisely detecting and manipulating quantum properties at a single molecule level. In this paper, we reviewrecent research progress of quantum states of surface-supported single molecules and relevant structures based on scanning tunneling microscopy. We start from the methods for the synthesis of molecular structures with desired quantum states, and then we review the recent advances in the local spin states for single molecular systems and the optical properties of single molecules serving as a single-photon source. An emerging family of molecular nanographene systems showing intriguing topological properties and magnetic properties is also reviewed. In the last part, we summarize the research progress made recently and prospect the future development of the quantum states at a single molecular level

TI Endogenous cell-free DNA in fetal bovine serum introduces artifacts to
   in vitro cell-free DNA models
SO BIOTECHNIQUES
AB Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of growing clinical and research significance. In vitro cfDNA models are a useful tool in cfDNA research; however, artifacts in these models may have implications for the interpretation of new and published data. This report aimed to establish how endogenous cfDNA in fetal bovine serum (FBS) may influence in vitro cfDNA measurements. Three commercial cell culture media, supplemented with 10% FBS, were analyzed for the presence of cfDNA, with and without culture with ovarian cancer cell lines. cfDNA from FBS was identified with all three commercial media and contributed a major portion of 167-bp cfDNA. Future studies should account for bovine cfDNA in FBS-supplemented media when conducting in vitro cfDNA research.
   Multidisciplinary abstract In vitro cell culture models are an invaluable tool for researchers. These models should represent the closest practical approximations of their target biological phenomena, with any limitations clearly acknowledged. This article demonstrates a previously overlooked inconsistency in in vitro models of cell-free DNA generation. Cell-free DNA is an important molecular biology template which can be detected in human body fluids, useful in minimally invasive liquid biopsies for oncological, prenatal and transplant medicine. It is therefore important to ensure that its in vitro models are appropriately controlled, to ensure validity. Here we show extrinsic animal cell-free DNA to be present in in vitro cell-free DNA models, and we argue for consideration of this when designing future studies and interpreting published data.
   Method summary Three commercial cell culture media supplemented with 10% FBS were analyzed for the presence of bovine cfDNA with and without culture with ovarian cancer cell lines. cfDNA was quantitated using the Qubit (TM) DNA fluorimetry assay and its size profile was investigated by gel and capillary electrophoresis.
   Tweetable abstract In vitro models are useful tools for researching cell-free DNA, but extrinsic cell-free DNA introduced to culture media by fetal bovine serum supplementation may compromise results.

TI Photoluminescence Dynamics Defined by Exciton Trapping Potential of
   Coupled Defect States in DNA-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes
SO ACS NANO
AB Chemical reactions between semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) achieve spatially patterned covalent functionalization sites and create coupled fluorescent quantum defects on the nanotube surface, tailoring SWCNT photophysics for applications such as single-photon emitters in quantum information technologies. The evaluation of relaxation dynamics of photoluminescence (PL) from those coupled quantum defects is essential for understanding the nanotube electronic structure and beneficial to the design of quantum light emitters. Here, we measured the PL decay for ssDNA-functionalized SWCNTs as a function of the guanine content of the ssDNA oligo that dictates the red-shifting of their PL emission peaks relative to the band-edge exciton. We then correlate the observed dependence of PL decay dynamics on energy red-shifts to the exciton potential energy landscape, which is modeled using first-principles approaches based upon the morphology of ssDNA-altered SWCNTs obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Our simulations illustrate that the multiple guanine defects introduced within a single ssDNA strand strongly interact to create a deep exciton trapping well, acting as a single hybrid trap. The emission decay from the distinctive trapping potential landscape is found to be biexponential for ssDNA-modified SWCNTs. We attributed the fast time component of the biexponential PL decay to the redistribution of exciton population among the lowest energy bright states and a manifold of dark states emerging from the coupling of multiple guanine defects. The long lifetime component in the biexponential decay, on the other hand, is attributed to the redistribution of exciton population among different exciton trapping sites that arise from the binding of multiple ssDNA strands along the nanotube axis. AFM measurements indicate that those trapping sites are separated on average by similar to 8 nm along the nanotube axis.

TI Data-Driven and Multiscale Modeling of DNA-Templated Dye Aggregates
SO MOLECULES
AB Dye aggregates are of interest for excitonic applications, including biomedical imaging, organic photovoltaics, and quantum information systems. Dyes with large transition dipole moments (mu) are necessary to optimize coupling within dye aggregates. Extinction coefficients (epsilon) can be used to determine the mu of dyes, and so dyes with a large epsilon (>150,000 M(-1)cm(-1)) should be engineered or identified. However, dye properties leading to a large epsilon are not fully understood, and low-throughput methods of dye screening, such as experimental measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can be time-consuming. In order to screen large datasets of molecules for desirable properties (i.e., large epsilon and mu), a computational workflow was established using machine learning (ML), DFT, time-dependent (TD-) DFT, and molecular dynamics (MD). ML models were developed through training and validation on a dataset of 8802 dyes using structural features. A Classifier was developed with an accuracy of 97% and a Regressor was constructed with an R-2 of above 0.9, comparing between experiment and ML prediction. Using the Regressor, the epsilon values of over 18,000 dyes were predicted. The top 100 dyes were further screened using DFT and TD-DFT to identify 15 dyes with a mu relative to a reference dye, pentamethine indocyanine dye Cy5. Two benchmark MD simulations were performed on Cy5 and Cy5.5 dimers, and it was found that MD could accurately capture experimental results. The results of this study exhibit that our computational workflow for identifying dyes with a large mu for excitonic applications is effective and can be used as a tool to develop new dyes for excitonic applications.

TI Microscopic analysis of proximity-induced superconductivity and
   metallization effects in superconductor-germanium hole nanowires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Low-dimensional germanium hole devices are promising systems with many potential applications such as hole spin qubits, Andreev spin qubits, and Josephson junctions, and can serve as a basis for the realization of topological superconductivity. This vast array of potential uses for Ge largely stems from the exceptionally strong and controllable spin-orbit interaction (SOI), ultralong mean free paths, long coherence times, and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. However, when brought into proximity with a superconductor (SC), metallization normally diminishes many useful properties of a semiconductor, for instance, typically reducing the g factor and SOI energy, as well as renormalizing the effective mass. In this paper, we consider metallization of a Ge nanowire (NW) in proximity to a SC, explicitly taking into account the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the NW. We find that proximitized Ge exhibits a unique phenomenology of metallization effects, where the 3D cross section plays a crucial role. For instance, in contrast to expectations, we find that SOI can be enhanced by strong coupling to the superconductor. We also show that the thickness of the NW plays a critical role in determining both the size of the proximity-induced pairing potential and metallization effects, since the coupling between the NW and SC strongly depends on the distance of the NW wave function from the interface with the SC. In the absence of electrostatic effects, we find that a sizable gap opens only in thin NWs (d less than or similar to 3 nm). In thicker NWs, the wave function must be pushed closer to the SC by electrostatic effects in order to achieve a sizable proximity gap such that the required electrostatic field strength can simultaneously induce a strong SOI. The unique and sometimes beneficial nature of metallization effects in SC-Ge NW devices evinces them as ideal platforms for future applications in quantum information processing.

TI Improved Thermal Area Law and Quasilinear Time Algorithm for Quantum
   Gibbs States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB One of the most fundamental problems in quantum many-body physics is the characterization of correlations among thermal states. Of particular relevance is the thermal area law, which justifies the tensor network approximations to thermal states with a bond dimension growing polynomially with the system size. In the regime of sufficiently low temperatures, which is crucially important for practical applications, the existing techniques do not yield optimal bounds. Here, we propose a new thermal area law that holds for generic many-body systems on lattices. We improve the temperature dependence from the original O(beta) to O(beta(2/3)) up to a logarithmic factor, thereby suggesting subballistic propagation of entanglement by imaginary-time evolution. This qualitatively differs from the real-time evolution, which usually induces linear growth of entanglement. We also prove analogous bounds for the Renyi entanglement of purification and the entanglement of formation. Our analysis is based on a polynomial approximation to the exponential function which provides a relationship between the imaginary-time evolution and random walks. Moreover, for one-dimensional (1D) systems with n spins, we prove that the Gibbs state is well approximated by a matrix product operator with a sublinear bond dimension for beta = o[log(n)]. This proof allows us to rigorously establish, for the first time, a quasilinear time classical algorithm for constructing a matrix product state representation of 1D quantum Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures of beta = o[log(n)]. Our new technical ingredient is a block decomposition of the Gibbs state that bears a resemblance to the decomposition of real-time evolution given by Haah et al. [Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE 59th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) (IEEE, New York, 2018), pp. 350-360].

TI Suppression of laser beam's polarization and intensity fluctuation via a
   Mach-Zehnder interferometer with proper feedback
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Long ground-Rydberg coherence lifetime is interesting for implementing high-fidelity quantum logic gates, many-body physics, and other quantum information protocols. However, the potential well formed by a conventional far-off-resonance red-detuned optical-dipole trap that is attractive for ground-state cold atoms is usually repulsive for Rydberg atoms, which will result in the rapid loss of atoms and low repetition rate of the experimental sequence. Moreover, the coherence time will be sharply shortened due to the residual thermal motion of cold atoms. These issues can be addressed by a one-dimensional magic lattice trap, which can form a deeper potential trap than the traveling wave optical dipole trap when the output power is limited. In addition, these common techniques for atomic confinement generally have certain requirements for the polarization and intensity stability of the laser. Here, we demonstrated a method to suppress both the polarization drift and power fluctuation only based on the phase management of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer for a one-dimensional magic lattice trap. With the combination of three wave plates and the interferometer, we used the instrument to collect data in the time domain, analyzed the fluctuation of laser intensity, and calculated the noise power spectral density. We found that the total intensity fluctuation comprising laser power fluctuation and polarization drift was significantly suppressed, and the noise power spectral density after closed-loop locking with a typical bandwidth of 1-3000 Hz was significantly lower than that under the free running of the laser system. Typically, at 1000 Hz, the noise power spectral density after locking was about 10 dB lower than that under the free running of a master oscillator power amplifier system. The intensity-polarization control technique provides potential applications for atomic confinement protocols that demand fixed polarization and intensity.

TI Random Regular Graph States Are Complex at Almost Any Depth
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due to their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are also intimately related to instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits, which have applications in quantum pseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to understand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure, and computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the computational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the degree d of a regular graph state [Ghosh et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 030601 (2023)]. In this paper, we study the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of varying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence that a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case. Specifically, we consider random d-regular graph states and prove three distinct results: First, we show two families of IQP circuits of depth d and show that they anticoncentrate for any 2 <d =o(n(1/2)) when measured in a random X-Y plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random constant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime d =Theta(n(c)) with c is an element of(0,1), we prove that random d-regular graph states contain polynomially large grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that they are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in the regime of high degree (d similar to n/2), we show that random graph states are not sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar-random states. Proving the three results requires different techniques-the analysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck polynomials, graph-theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis of the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.

TI Transition from Light-Induced Phase Reconstruction to Halide Segregation
   in CsPbBr3-xI x  Nanocrystal Thin Films
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Inorganic metal-halide perovskite materials pave the way for many applications ranging from optoelectronics to quantum information due to their low cost, high photoluminescence and energy conversion efficiencies. However, light-induced bandgap instability due to ion migration in mixed-halide perovskites remains a significant challenge to the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. Thus, we combined hyperspectral fluorescence microspectroscopy and computational methods to understand the underlying transition mechanism between phase reconstruction and segregation in CsPbBr3-xIx (0 < x < 3) nanocrystal thin films. Our outcomes have shown that samples with x = 1.0 and x = 1.5 exhibit halide migration, favoring Br enrichment locally. In this case, an interplay between photo and thermal activation promotes the expulsion of I- from the perovskite lattice and generates a reconstruction of Br-rich domains, forming the CsPbBr3 phase. Thus, thermodynamic parameters such as the halide activation energy and phase reconstruction diffusibility were obtained by combining the kinetic parameters from linear unmixing data and Fick's second law. Moreover, we observed that the Br-I interdiffusion followed an Arrhenius-like behavior over laser-induced temperature increase. On the other hand, for samples with x = 2.0, phase segregation occurred due to the larger CsPbBrI2 nanocrystal size, iodine content and the high laser intensity employed. These three combined effects modify transport and recombination due to the reduction of charge carrier diffusion length (L-D = 10.2 nm) and bandgap. Thus, iodide ions diffuse from the nanocrystal surface to the core forming a "type-II heterostructure", promoting a red shift in the fluorescence spectrum, which is characteristic of phase segregation. Furthermore, real-time dark recovery of light-induced halide segregation is reported for CsPbBrI2 nanocrystal thin films. Finally, the possible halide migration mechanism and physical origins of the transition between these phenomena are pointed out.

TI Dissipative dynamics of optomagnonic nonclassical features via
   anti-Stokes optical pulses: squeezing, blockade, anti-correlation, and
   entanglement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a feasible experimental model to investigate the generation and characterization of nonclassical states in a cavity optomagnonic system consisting of a ferromagnetic YIG sphere that simultaneously supports both the magnon mode and two whispering gallery modes of optical photons. The photons undergo the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, which is a well-established tool for the cavity-assisted manipulations of magnons as well as magnon spintronics. At first, we derive the desired interaction Hamiltonian under the influence of the anti-Stokes scattering process and then proceed to analyze the dynamical evolution of quantum statistics of photons and magnons as well as their intermodal entanglement. The results show that both photons and magnons generally acquire some nonclassical features, e.g., the strong antibunching and anti-correlation. Interestingly, the system may experience the perfect photon and magnon blockade phenomena, simultaneously. Besides, the nonclassical features may be protected against the unwanted environmental effects for a relatively long time, especially, in the weak driving field regime and when the system is initiated with a small number of particles. However, it should be noted that some fast quantum-classical transitions may occur in-between. Although the unwanted dissipative effects plague the nonclassical features, we show that this system can be adopted to prepare optomagnonic entangled states. The generation of entangled states depends on the initial state of the system and the interaction regime. The intermodal photon-magnon entanglement may be generated and pronounced, especially, if the system is initialized with low intensity even Schrodinger cat state in the strong coupling regime. The cavity-assisted manipulation of magnons is a unique and flexible mechanism that allows an interesting test bed for investigating the interdisciplinary contexts involving quantum optics and spintronics. Moreover, such a hybrid optomagnonic system may be used to design both on-demand single-photon and single-magnon sources and may find potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Comparison of DNA concentration and bacterial pathogen PCR detection
   when using two DNA extraction kits for nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal
   samples
SO PLOS ONE
AB Introduction Several important human pathogens that cause life-threatening infections are asymptomatically carried in the Nasopharynx/Oropharynx (NP/OP). DNA extraction is a prerequisite for most culture-independent techniques used to identify pathogens in the NP/OP. However, components of DNA extraction kits differ thereby giving rise to differences in performance. We compared the DNA concentration and the detection of three pathogens in the NP/OP using the discontinued DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Kit DP) and the DNeasy PowerLyzer PowerSoil Kit (Kit DPP).
   Methods DNA was extracted from the same set of 103 NP/OP samples using the two kits. DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Real-time Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) was done using the QuantStudio 7-flex system to detect three pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis. Bland-Altman statistics and plots were used to determine the threshold cycle (Ct) value agreement for the two kits.
   Results The average DNA concentration from kit DPP was higher than Kit DP; 1235.6 ng/ml (SD = 1368.3) vs 884.9 ng/ml (SD = 1095.3), p = 0.002. Using a Ct value cutoff of 40 for positivity, the concordance for the presence of S. pneumoniae was 82% (84/102); 94%(96/103) for N. meningitidis and 92%(95/103) for H. influenzae. Kit DP proportionately resulted in higher Ct values than Kit DPP for all pathogens. The Ct value bias of measurement for S. pneumoniae was +2.4 (95% CI, 1.9-3.0), +1.4 (95% CI, 0.9-1.9) for N. meningitidis and +1.4 (95% CI, 0.2-2.5) for H. influenzae.
   Conclusion The higher DNA concentration obtained using kit DPP could increase the chances of recovering low abundant bacteria. The PCR results were reproducible for more than 90% of the samples for the gram-negative H. influenzae and N. meningitidis. Ct value variations of the kits must be taken into consideration when comparing studies that have used the two kits.

TI Bisulfite-Converted DNA Quantity Evaluation: A Multiplex Quantitative
   Real-Time PCR System for Evaluation of Bisulfite Conversion
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Bisulfite (BS) conversion, which includes a series of chemical reactions using bisulfite, is a prerequisite to most DNA methylation analysis methods, and thus is an essential step in the associated research process. Unfortunately, BS conversion leads to the degradation or loss of DNA, which can hinder further downstream analysis. In addition, it is well known that incomplete BS conversion is crucial, as it causes an exaggeration of the DNA methylation level, which can adversely affect the results. Therefore, there have been many attempts to measure three key features of BS conversion: BS conversion efficiency, recovery, and degradation level. In this study, a multiplex quantitative real-time PCR system named BisQuE was suggested to simultaneously analyze three important aspects of the conversion step. By adopting cytosine-free PCR primers for two differently sized multicopy regions, the short amplicon and long amplicon were obtained from both the genomic and BS-converted DNA, thus enabling the obtaining of reliable and sensitive results and the calculation of the degradation level of the conversion step. Also, probes for detecting converted/unconverted templates and C-T indicators for inducing the formula were included in this assay to quantify BS-converted DNA in order to compute the conversion efficiency and recovery. Six BS conversion kits (EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning Kit, Premium Bisulfite kit, MethylEdge(R) Bisulfite Conversion System, EpiJET Bisulfite Conversion Kit, EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit, and NEBNext(R) Enzymatic Methyl-seq Conversion Module) were tested in 20 samples using 50 ng of genomic DNA as an input with the BisQuE. The conversion efficiency, degradation levels, as well as recovery rates of the kits were investigated. A total of 99.61-99.90% conversion efficiency was perceived for five of the kits, while the NEBNext kit showed about 94%. The lowest degradation level was shown by the NEBNext kit, whereas the other kits were quite similar. The recovery rates of the kits were found to be within the range of 18-50%. A Qubit assay was also used to compare the recovery rate of BisQuE.

TI Nature of electrically detected magnetic resonance in highly
   nitrogen-doped 6H-SiC single crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB This work focuses on unraveling electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) properties of n-type 6H silicon carbide (SiC) single crystals with high concentrations of uncompensated nitrogen (N) donors, which is essential for fundamental understanding of spin-related phenomena, developing spin-based devices, optimizing materials and devices, and advancing research in quantum information and spintronics. Utilizing low-temperature multifrequency EPR spectroscopy (9.4-395.12 GHz), we identified two intense signals labeled as S line and S1 line in the 6H-SiC crystals with N D - N A approximate to 8 x 1018 and 4 x 1019 cm-3. In addition, in 6H-SiC crystals with N D - N A approximate to 8 x 1018 cm-3, a low-intensity triplet from N donors substituting the quasicubic "k2" nonequivalent position (Nk2) was observed. The S line [g perpendicular to = 2.0029(2), g|| = 2.0038(2)] was assigned to the exchange interaction of conduction electrons and Nk2, while the S1 line [g perpendicular to = 2.0030(2), g|| = 2.0040(2)] is caused by the exchange spin coupling of localized N donors at the "k1" and "k2" positions. The S1 line was observed in high-frequency EDMR spectra of 6H-SiC with N D - N A approximate to 8 x 1018 cm-3, and its emergence was explained by an enhancement of the hopping conductivity due to the EPR-induced temperature increase mechanism. No EDMR spectra were found to occur in the 6H-SiC crystals with N D - N A approximate to 4 x 1019 cm-3, which is close to the critical donor concentration value for a semiconductor-metal transition. Thus it can be concluded that this N donor concentration is too high for the appearance of spin-dependent scattering and too low for the emergence of EPR-induced hopping mechanisms in 6H-SiC.

TI Molecular characterization of colorectal cancer (CRC) using next
   generation sequencing (NGS) in bridging the gap between research and
   clinical practice: from biomarker discovery to clinical implementation
SO DISCOVER ONCOLOGY
AB BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in men and third in females, a heterogeneous disease involving multistep mechanisms that represents 10% of all cancers globally. This study investigates gene mutation profiling in CRC using Next-Generation sequencing machine.MethodFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 30 CRC patients were retrieved and reviewed. DNA was isolated from selected tissues. Desirable quality check using Qubit and Nanoquant machine was done, and desirable libraries prepared were loaded into the sequencer for sequencing. Using Illumina BaseSpace and Illumina Variant interpreter, generated FastQ data were treated for annotation, alignment, and mapping with reference genome. Sequencing-runs with Phred-score >= 30 were selected as desirable runs. Finally, the variants were validated on NCBI-dsSNP and Ensembl databases for clinical consequence interpretations.ResultsOverall, patient distribution consists of 12(40%) females and 18 (60%) males with mean age (53.2 + 5.3). most patients were in TNM stage-3: 53.3% (15/30) and the least was Stage-4: 20%(6/30) respectively. Overall, 73.3%: (22/30) completed the sequencing, and 552 mutations involving 29 genes and 12 chromosomes were detected. The most upregulated variants are KIT:68(12.3%), FGFR4:61(11.1%), EGFR:60(10.9%), ALK:53(9.6%), DCUN1D1:41(7.4%), PDGFR:40(7.2%), KRAS:33(6.0%), CDK4:27(4.9%), FGFR3:26(4.7%), MTOR:14(2.6), while NRAS, CDK6, PIK3CA, and RET each has 13(2.4%) apiece. Chromosomes 4:134/55(24.2%), chr7:84/552(15.2%), chr12:71/552(12.9%), chr5:64/552(11.6%), chr2:61/552(11.1%), chr3:54/552(9.8%), and chr1:43/552(7.8%) are the most involved chromosomes. Nine genes (APC, NRAS, ALK, PIK3CA, KRAS, IDH1, FGFR1, ERBB2, and ESR1) are identified as pathogenic-causing variants in CRC.ConclusionThis is the first NGS-based molecular study on FFPE-CRC tissues in hospital-USM that showed the most upregulated variants in CRC and identified nine genes as crucial pathogenic variants.

TI Use of radiolabeled hyaluronic acid for preclinical assessment of
   inflammatory injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome
SO NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is accompanied by a dramatic increase in lung hyaluronic acid (HA), leading to a dose-dependent reduction of pulmonary oxygenation. This pattern is associated with severe in-fections, such as COVID-19, and other important lung injury etiologies. HA actively participates in molecular pathways involved in the cytokine storm of COVID-19-induced ARDS. The objective of this study was to evaluate an imaging approach of radiolabeled HA for assessment of dysregulated HA deposition in mouse models with skin inflammation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS using a novel portable intensified Quantum Imaging Detector (iQID) gamma camera system.Methods: HA of 10 kDa molecular weight (HA10) was radiolabeled with 125I and 99mTc respectively to produce [125I]I-HA10 and [99mTc]Tc-HA10, followed by comparative studies on stability, in vivo biodistribution, and uptake at inflammatory skin sites in mice with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-inflamed ears. [99mTc]Tc-HA10 was used for iQID in vivo dynamic imaging of mice with ARDS induced by intratracheal instillation of LPS.Results: [99mTc]Tc-HA10 and [125I]I-HA10 had similar biodistribution and localization at inflammatory sites. [99mTc]Tc-HA10 was shown to be feasible in measuring skin injury and monitoring skin wound healing. [99mTc] Tc-HA10 dynamic pulmonary images yielded good visualization of radioactive uptake in the lungs. There was significantly increased lung uptake and slower lung washout in mice with LPS-induced ARDS than in control mice. Postmortem biodistribution measurement of [99mTc]TcHA10 (%ID/g) was 11.0 +/- 3.9 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3 in the ARDS mice (n = 6) and controls (n = 6) (P < 0.001), consistent with upregulated HA expression as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.Conclusions: [99mTc]Tc-HA10 is promising as a biomarker for evaluating HA dysregulation that contributes to pulmonary injury in ARDS. Rapid iQID imaging of [99mTc]Tc-HA10 clearance from injured lungs may provide a functional template for timely assessment and quantitative monitoring of pulmonary pathophysiology and intervention in ARDS.

TI New investigation of encoding secondary metabolites gene by genome
   mining of a marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas viridis BBR56
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Pseudoalteromonas viridis strain BBR56 was isolated from seawater at Dutungan Island, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Bacterial DNA was isolated using Promega Genomic DNA TM050. DNA purity and quantity were assessed using NanoDrop spectrophotometers and Qubit fluorometers. The DNA library and sequencing were prepared using Oxford Nanopore Technology GridION MinKNOW 20.06.9 with long read, direct, and comprehensive analysis. High accuracy base calling was assessed with Guppy version 4.0.11. Filtlong and NanoPlot were used for filtering and visualizing the FASTQ data. Flye (2.8.1) was used for de novo assembly analysis. Variant calls and consensus sequences were created using Medaka. The annotation of the genome was elaborated by DFAST. The assembled genome and annotation were tested using Busco and CheckM. Herein, we found that the highest similarity of the BBR56 isolate was 98.37% with the 16 S rRNA gene sequence of P. viridis G-1387. The genome size was 5.5 Mb and included chromosome 1 (4.2 Mbp) and chromosome 2 (1.3 Mbp), which encoded 61 pseudogenes, 4 noncoding RNAs, 113 tRNAs, 31 rRNAs, 4,505 coding DNA sequences, 4 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, 4,444 coding genes, and a GC content of 49.5%. The sequence of the whole genome of P. viridis BBR56 was uploaded to GenBank under the accession numbers CP072425-CP072426, biosample number SAMN18435505, and bioproject number PRJNA716373. The sequence read archive (SRR14179986) was successfully obtained from NCBI for BBR56 raw sequencing reads. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization results showed that the genome of BBR56 had the potential to be a new species because no other bacterial genomes were similar to the sample. Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were assessed using BAGEL4 and the antiSMASH bacterial version. The genome harbored diverse BGCs, including genes that encoded polyketide synthase, nonribosomal peptide synthase, RiPP-like, NRP-metallophore, hydrogen cyanide, betalactone, thioamide-NRP, Lant class I, sactipeptide, and prodigiosin. Thus, BBR56 has considerable potential for further exploration regarding the use of its secondary metabolite products in the human and fisheries sectors.

TI Universal separability criterion for arbitrary density matrices from
   causal properties of separable and entangled quantum states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB General physical background of famous Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose (PH- or PPT-) separability criterion is revealed. Especially, the physical sense of partial transpose operation is shown to be equivalent to what one could call as the "local causality reversal" (LCR-) procedure for all separable quantum systems or to the uncertainty in a global time arrow direction in all entangled cases. Using these universal causal considerations brand new general relations for the heuristic causal separability criterion have been proposed for arbitrary D-N x D-N density matrices acting in H-D(circle times N) Hilbert spaces which describe the ensembles of N quantum systems of D eigenstates each. Resulting general formulas have been then analyzed for the widest special type of one-parametric density matrices of arbitrary dimensionality, which model a number of equivalent quantum subsystems being equally connected (EC-) with each other to arbitrary degree by means of a single entanglement parameter p. In particular, for the family of such EC-density matrices it has been found that there exists a number of N- and D-dependent separability (or entanglement) thresholdspth(N,D) for the values of the corresponded entanglement parameter p, which in the simplest case of a qubit-pair density matrix in H-2 circle times H-2 Hilbert space are shown to reduce to well-known results obtained earlier independently by Peres (Phys Rev Lett 77:1413-1415, 1996) and Horodecki (Phys Lett A 223(1-2):1-8, 1996). As the result, a number of remarkable features of the entanglement thresholds for EC-density matrices has been described for the first time. All novel results being obtained for the family of arbitrary EC-density matrices are shown to be applicable to a wide range of both interacting and non-interacting (at the moment of measurement) multi-partite quantum systems, such as arrays of qubits, spin chains, ensembles of quantum oscillators, strongly correlated quantum many-body systems with the possibility of many-body localization, etc.

TI Comparison of three commercial DNA extraction kits and assemblers for
   AMR determinant detection in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
   Enterobacter cloacae using long-read sequencing
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS
AB Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, both members of the ESKAPE group, are multidrug-resistant pathogens that pose significant challenges in clinical care. The high GC-content (similar to 67 %) of the P. aeruginosa genome complicates DNA extraction and long-read sequencing, with downstream effects on genome assembly and analyses. We compared three commercial extraction kits for isolating high-quality DNA suitable for Oxford Nanopore sequencing from clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae. Methods Genomic DNA was extracted from P. aeruginosa (n = 63; 3 x 21) and E. cloacae (n = 96; 3 x 32) clinical isolates using the MagAttract HMW DNA Kit (Qiagen), the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial Kit (Qiagen), and the MagMAX (TM) Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher). DNA quantity/quality was assessed by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific), fluorometry (Qubit, ThermoFisher), and capillary electrophoresis (TapeStation 2200, Agilent). Libraries were prepared and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. Assemblies were generated with Unicycler (v.0.5.1) and Flye (v.2.9.6); quality was assessed with QUAST (v.5.3). Genome completeness was evaluated by CheckM (v.1.1.6). Antimicrobial resistance determinants were identified with AMRFinderPlus (v.4.1.19). Results DNeasy yielded up to 4.7x higher DNA and similar to 50 % higher sequencing output than MagAttract, while MagAttract produced higher DNA integrity and more contiguous assemblies. The choice of assembly had a greater impact on the detection of AMR determinants than the extraction method alone. Across workflows, Flye outperformed Unicycler, increasing detection by 2-14 percentage points. The best-performing combination (DNeasy + Flye) achieved 95.2 % AMR determinants, compared to 67.8 % for MagMAX + Unicycler, with the most difference (37.5 %) in efflux pump genes. Conclusions This systematic comparison highlights trade-offs between DNA yield, integrity, and downstream assembly performance, demonstrating that assembler choice critically impacts the detection of AMR determinants. These findings provide practical guidance for optimizing long-read-based sequencing workflows to support AMR surveillance and genomic epidemiology.

TI Frequency-Quadrupled Vertical External-Cavity Surface-Emitting Deep
   Ultraviolet Laser
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective The significance of deep-ultraviolet (DUV) band light is its unique sterilization and disinfection ability, environmental performance, and wide application in other fields. Specifically, deep ultraviolet light can destroy the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) structure of microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, thereby achieving efficient sterilization and disinfection. In addition, DUV technology has been applied in multiple fields such as water purification, air purification, medical treatment, biological research, national defense security, and ultraviolet communication, demonstrating broad application prospects. Therefore, the DUV bands are crucial in improving the quality of human life and promoting technological progress. Deep-ultraviolet vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) can achieve high output power, excellent beam quality, and tunable wavelength by optimizing the resonant cavity structure to meet the urgent demand for DUV laser sources in scientific research and industrial fields. Stable and efficient DUV VECSELs provide advanced analytical tools and technical means in fields such as materials science, biomedicine, and environmental monitoring. In addition, research on DUV VECSEL will promote the development of nonlinear optical frequency conversion and quantum frequency conversion technologies, providing key technical support for cutting-edge fields such as quantum communication and quantum computing. Overall, research on DUV VECSEL aims to expand the application boundaries of laser technology and promote technological progress and industrial development. Methods First a gain chip with a center wavelength of 980 nm is designed. A high-Al-composition Al0.6GaAs etch stop layer is grown on a GaAs substrate to block selective corrosion. Subsequently, a GaAs cap layer is grown, and after the etch-stop layer is corroded, this layer becomes the outermost layer of the gain chip, providing protection for the chip. Next, the active region is grown, which is mainly composed of 12 pairs of In0.2GaAs/GaAsP0.02 multiple quantum wells (MQWs). The content of In in the In0.2GaAs quantum-well material corresponds to a design wavelength of 980 nm, but epitaxial growth on the GaAs substrate introduces a compressive strain of approximately 1.4%, which affects the quality of epitaxial growth. To minimize the frequent replacement of material types during epitaxial growth and better ensure the quality of epitaxial growth, this chip design specifically uses the GaAsP layer not only as a stress compensation layer but also as a barrier layer for quantum wells. Therefore, the content of P in GaAsP needs to be finely and reasonably designed to be sufficiently high to compensate for the stress introduced by multiple quantum wells. However, if the content of P is too high, InGaP cannot absorb pump photons. The final growth part of the gain chip is the distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), which is composed of 30 pairs of alternating GaAs/AlAs, with each layer having an optical thickness of 1/4 laser wavelength, which is 980 nm. Next is the performance testing of the gain chips, especially temperature and power testing, which directly affects the quality and efficiency of the final output light. Temperature and power testing are particularly important, because they can intuitively reflect the stability and output power of chips in different working environments. It is particularly noteworthy to observe the redshift phenomenon between the chip design wavelength and the actual output wavelength.
   Subsequently, the design of optical resonant cavities and the optimization of crystal selection are also key steps in improving optical conversion efficiency. When using a flat concave cavity structure, it is necessary to accurately match the core diameter of the pump with the laser spot inside the resonant cavity and calculate the waist position of the laser inside the cavity through simulation. This is directly related to the placement and length selection of the subsequent crystals. Based on the waist size, the optimal crystal length can be calculated, and the crystal can be accurately placed at the position of the laser waist to achieve high-frequency doubling conversion efficiency and high-power blue light output. Finally, the high-power blue light obtained is further converted into 245 nm deep ultraviolet light through barium metaborate (BBO) crystals. Results and Discussions We use a specially designed semiconductor gain chip (Fig. 1). The characteristics and advantages of the flat concave V-shaped cavity frequency-doubled blue light combined with the generated frequency-doubled blue light for fourth-harmonic generation result in a DUV output at 246.8 nm. The results indicate that the frequency-doubled blue light obtained using this cavity structure has excellent beam quality, close to the diffraction limit, a small beam divergence angle, and a more stable output mode while producing high power. In this study, a type-I phase-matched lithium triborate (LBO) crystal is selected as the frequency-doubling crystal. At an operating temperature of 15 degrees C using thermoelectric cooler (TEC), a 0.5 mm thick birefringent filter is inserted into the cavity. Using a 5 mm long LBO, we obtain a high-power blue light output of 4.5 W at a wavelength of 493 nm (Fig. 4). After passing through the type-I phase-matched BBO crystal, a DUV output of 29.2 mW at a wavelength of 246.8 nm is obtained (Fig. 7). This frequency-quadrupled VECSEL has advantages such as excellent beam quality, easy implementation, and a compact structure. Conclusions This paper presents the output of a compact frequency-quadrupled vertical external cavity surface that emits a DUV laser. A V-type laser resonant cavity is constructed using specially designed semiconductor gain chips, folding mirrors, and rear-end mirrors. Under a working temperature of 15 degrees C, a high-power blue light output of 4.5 W is obtained by inserting a 5 mm long LBO crystal. A single-pass four-fold structure is formed by combining the rear reflection mirror, ultraviolet folding mirror, and ultraviolet output mirror of the frequency-doubling blue resonant cavity. The obtained blue light passes through a 3 mm long type I phase-matched BBO crystal, resulting in a 246.8 nm DUV laser output with a power of 29.2 mW through an output mirror with a transmittance of 50% at a wavelength of 245 nm. The aforementioned experimental results are limited by the pump power and coating of each optical lens. The DUV laser in this band can play a significant role in sterilization, disinfection, formaldehyde treatment, and other fields.

TI Rydberg atomic spectroscopy based on nanosecond pulsed laser excitation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Through the cascade excitation of 852-nm continuous-wave (CW) laser and 509-nm nanosecond pulsed laser, the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopic signals of ladder-type three-level cesium atoms with Rydberg state are obtained by using a room-temperature cesium vapor cell. The power of 509-nm pulsed laser beam is similar to 176 W, while the pulse repetition frequency ranges from 300 kHz to 100 MHz and can be continuously adjusted. The laser pulse duration runs from 1 to 100 ns and can be continuously adjusted. The relationship between Rydberg EIT spectroscopic signals and 509-nm nanosecond pulsed laser parameters is investigated experimentally. By changing the pulse repetition frequency and the pulse duration of the 509-nm nanosecond pulsed laser, the comb-like Rydberg atomic spectrum is obtained by using a room-temperature cesium vapor cell. Within a certain range of repetition frequency and pulse duration, the envelope of spectral lines shows a regular pattern, and the spacing between the transmission peaks is consistent with the pulse repetition frequency. By changing the 509-nm laser pulse repetition frequency and pulse duration, atoms with the specific velocity group can be excited to Rydberg state.
   Reducing the repetition frequency of the 509-nm pulsed coupling laser can further increase the number of atoms in the Rydberg state in comparison with the case of finite velocity group pumping of cesium atoms by a continuous-wave laser. When the repetition frequency of the 509-nm pulsed laser approaches the EIT linewidth, the number of cesium Rydberg atoms can be increased by up to 10 times. In the parameter optimization process, the dynamic characteristics of pulsed excitation in multi-level atoms, as well as the interaction characteristics between arbitrarily shaped laser pulses and multi-level atomic systems, should be considered. Pulsed laser pumping can achieve the interaction between the laser field and atomic group with a specific velocity, and its developed atomic frequency comb spectra can be used for electric and magnetic field measurements. The multi-peak structure of the spectrum can be used to more accurately determine the intensity, frequency, and phase of the microwave electric field by measuring spectral variations. This high- sensitivity and high-resolution measurement capability is crucial for precisely measuring microwave electric fields. The pulsed coupling laser can excite atoms in a specific velocity group to the Rydberg state. High-density Rydberg atoms can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured spectrum, which has potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum measurement based on Rydberg atoms.

TI Molecular Control of Triplet-Pair Spin Polarization and Its
   Optoelectronic Magnetic Resonance Probes
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB Preparing and manipulating pure magnetic states in molecular systems are the key initial requirements for harnessing the power of synthetic chemistry to drive practical quantum sensing and computing technologies. One route for achieving the requisite higher spin states in organic systems exploits the phenomenon of singlet fission, which produces pairs of triplet excited states from initially photoexcited singlets in molecular assemblies with multiple chromophores. The resulting spin states are characterized by total spin (quintet, triplet, or singlet) and its projection onto a specified molecular or magnetic field axis. These excited states are typically highly polarized but exhibit an impure spin population pattern. Herein, we report the prediction and experimental verification of molecular design rules that drive the population of a single pure magnetic state and describe the progress toward its experimental realization. A vital feature of this work is the close partnership among theory, chemical synthesis, and spectroscopy. We begin by presenting our theoretical framework for understanding spin manifold interconversion in singlet fission systems. This theory makes specific testable predictions about the intermolecular structure and orientation relative to an external magnetic field that should lead to pure magnetic state preparation and provides a powerful tool for interpreting magnetic spectra. We then test these predictions through detailed magnetic spectroscopy experiments on a series of new molecular architectures that meet one or more of the identified structural criteria. Many of these architectures rely on the synthesis of molecules with features unique to this effort: rigid bridges between chromophores in dimers, heteroacenes with tailored singlet/triplet-pair energy level matching, or side-group engineering to produce specific crystal structures. The spin evolution of these systems is revealed through our application and development of several magnetic resonance methods, each of which has different sensitivities and relevance in environments relevant to quantum applications. Our theoretical predictions prove to be remarkably consistent with our experimental results, though experimentally meeting all the structural prescriptions demanded by theory for true pure-state preparation remains a challenge. Our magnetic spectra agree with our model of triplet-pair behavior, including funneling of the population to the m(s )= 0 magnetic sublevel of the quintet under specified conditions in dimers and crystals, showing that this phenomenon is subject to control through molecular design. Moreover, our demonstration of novel and/or highly sensitive detection mechanisms of spin states in singlet fission systems, including photoluminescence (PL), photoinduced absorption (PA), and magnetoconductance (MC), points the way toward both a deeper understanding of how these systems evolve and technologically feasible routes toward experiments at the single-molecule quantum limit that are desirable for computational applications.

TI Ocean carbon from space: Current status and priorities for the next
   decade
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The ocean plays a central role in modulating the Earth's carbon cycle. Monitoring how the ocean carbon cycle is changing is fundamental to managing climate change. Satellite remote sensing is currently our best tool for viewing the ocean surface globally and systematically, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the past few decades have seen an exponential growth in studies utilising satellite data for ocean carbon research. Satellite -based observations must be combined with in-situ observations and models, to obtain a comprehensive view of ocean carbon pools and fluxes. To help prioritise future research in this area, a workshop was organised that assembled leading experts working on the topic, from around the world, including remote-sensing scientists, field scientists and modellers, with the goal to articulate a collective view of the current status of ocean carbon research, identify gaps in knowledge, and formulate a scientific roadmap for the next decade, with an emphasis on evaluating where satellite remote sensing may contribute. A total of 449 scientists and stakeholders partic-ipated (with balanced gender representation), from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Sessions targeted both inorganic and organic pools of carbon in the ocean, in both dissolved and particulate form, as well as major fluxes of carbon between reservoirs (e.g., primary production) and at interfaces (e.g., air-sea and land-ocean). Extreme events, blue carbon and carbon budgeting were also key topics discussed. Emerging pri-orities identified include: expanding the networks and quality of in-situ observations; improved satellite re-trievals; improved uncertainty quantification; improved understanding of vertical distributions; integration with models; improved techniques to bridge spatial and temporal scales of the different data sources; and improved fundamental understanding of the ocean carbon cycle, and of the interactions among pools of carbon and light. We also report on priorities for the specific pools and fluxes studied, and highlight issues and concerns that arose during discussions, such as the need to consider the environmental impact of satellites or space activities; the role satellites can play in monitoring ocean carbon dioxide removal approaches; economic valuation of the satellite based information; to consider how satellites can contribute to monitoring cycles of other important climatically -relevant compounds and elements; to promote diversity and inclusivity in ocean carbon research; to bring together communities working on different aspects of planetary carbon; maximising use of international bodies; to follow an open science approach; to explore new and innovative ways to remotely monitor ocean carbon; and to harness quantum computing. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive scientific roadmap for the next decade on how satellite remote sensing could help monitor the ocean carbon cycle, and its links to the other domains, such as terrestrial and atmosphere.

TI Visualizing the next frontiers in wine yeast research
SO FEMS YEAST RESEARCH
AB This minireview envisages and explores the next frontiers in wine yeast research spurred by bioinformational engineering and synthetic genomics.
   A range of game-changing biodigital and biodesign technologies are coming of age all around us, transforming our world in complex ways that are hard to predict. Not a day goes by without news of how data-centric engineering, algorithm-driven modelling, and biocyber technologies-including the convergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, automated robotics, quantum computing, and genome editing-will change our world. If we are to be better at expecting the unexpected in the world of wine, we need to gain deeper insights into the potential and limitations of these technological developments and advances along with their promise and perils. This article anticipates how these fast-expanding bioinformational and biodesign toolkits might lead to the creation of synthetic organisms and model systems, and ultimately new understandings of biological complexities could be achieved. A total of four future frontiers in wine yeast research are discussed in this article: the construction of fully synthetic yeast genomes, including minimal genomes; supernumerary pan-genome neochromosomes; synthetic metagenomes; and synthetic yeast communities. These four concepts are at varying stages of development with plenty of technological pitfalls to overcome before such model chromosomes, genomes, strains, and yeast communities could illuminate some of the ill-understood aspects of yeast resilience, fermentation performance, flavour biosynthesis, and ecological interactions in vineyard and winery settings. From a winemaker's perspective, some of these ideas might be considered as far-fetched and, as such, tempting to ignore. However, synthetic biologists know that by exploring these futuristic concepts in the laboratory could well forge new research frontiers to deepen our understanding of the complexities of consistently producing fine wines with different fermentation processes from distinctive viticultural terroirs. As the saying goes in the disruptive technology industry, it take years to create an overnight success. The purpose of this article is neither to glorify any of these concepts as a panacea to all ills nor to crucify them as a danger to winemaking traditions. Rather, this article suggests that these proposed research endeavours deserve due consideration because they are likely to cast new light on the genetic blind spots of wine yeasts, and how they interact as communities in vineyards and wineries. Future-focussed research is, of course, designed to be subject to revision as new data and technologies become available. Successful dislodging of old paradigms with transformative innovations will require open-mindedness and pragmatism, not dogmatism-and this can make for a catch-22 situation in an archetypal traditional industry, such as the wine industry, with its rich territorial and socio-cultural connotations.

TI Cutting-Edge Stochastic Approach: Efficient Monte Carlo Algorithms with
   Applications to Sensitivity Analysis
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Many important practical problems connected to energy efficiency in buildings, ecology, metallurgy, the development of wireless communication systems, the optimization of radar technology, quantum computing, pharmacology, and seismology are described by large-scale mathematical models that are typically represented by systems of partial differential equations. Such systems often involve numerous input parameters. It is crucial to understand how susceptible the solutions are to uncontrolled variations or uncertainties within these input parameters. This knowledge helps in identifying critical factors that significantly influence the model's outcomes and can guide efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions. Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a method used efficiently to assess the sensitivity of the output results from large-scale mathematical models to uncertainties in their input data. By performing SA, we can better manage risks associated with uncertain inputs and make more informed decisions based on the model's outputs. In recent years, researchers have developed advanced algorithms based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique for computing numerical sensitivity indicators. These methods have also incorporated computationally efficient Monte Carlo integration techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation of Monte Carlo algorithms based on "symmetrized shaking" of Sobol's quasi-random sequences. The theoretical proof demonstrates that these algorithms exhibit an optimal rate of convergence for functions with continuous and bounded first derivatives and for functions with continuous and bounded second derivatives, respectively, both in terms of probability and mean square error. For the purposes of numerical study, these approaches were successfully applied to a particular problem. A specialized software tool for the global sensitivity analysis of an air pollution mathematical model was developed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted regarding some important air pollutant levels, calculated using a large-scale mathematical model describing the long-distance transport of air pollutants-the Unified Danish Eulerian Model (UNI-DEM). The sensitivity of the model was explored focusing on two distinct categories of key input parameters: chemical reaction rates and input emissions. To validate the theoretical findings and study the applicability of the algorithms across diverse problem classes, extensive numerical experiments were conducted to calculate the main sensitivity indicators-Sobol' global sensitivity indices. Various numerical integration algorithms were employed to meet this goal-Monte Carlo, quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC), scrambled quasi-Monte Carlo methods based on Sobol's sequences, and a sensitivity analysis approach implemented in the SIMLAB software for sensitivity analysis. During the study, an essential task arose that is small in value sensitivity measures. It required numerical integration approaches with higher accuracy to ensure reliable predictions based on a specific mathematical model, defining a vital role for small sensitivity measures. Both the analysis and numerical results highlight the advantages of one of the proposed approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly for relatively small sensitivity indices.

TI 4 K GM-type pulse tube cryocooler with large cooling capacity
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Owing to the advantages of large cooling capacity, low vibration and high reliability, GM-type pulse tube cryocoolers at liquid helium temperature have important applications in frontier fields of condensed matter physics research, quantum computing, etc. The phase shifter has an important influence on the cooling performance of pulse tube cryocooler. Previous researches on the phase shifter of GM-type pulse tube cryocooler mainly focused on the effect of a single phase shifter on the performance of the cryocooler at liquid helium temperature. In this paper, based on Sage software, a simulation model of a 4 K two-stage gas-coupled GM-type pulse tube cryocooler is first designed and constructed. The influence of the phase shifters of the two stages on the first-stage and the second-stage temperatures are calculated. The adjustment and optimization process of the cryocooler to obtain the liquid helium temperature is studied. Numerical simulations are given below. 1) The lowest temperature of the model is only about 100 K when the phase shifters of the two stages are closed. The lowest temperature of the model can be reduced to 2.7 K by optimizing the first-stage orifice valve, the second-stage orifice valve, the first-stage double-inlet valve and the second-stage double-inlet valve in sequence. 2) The first-stage orifice valve, the second-stage orifice valve, and the second-stage double-inlet valve have a significant effect on reducing the cooling temperature of the second stage, while the first-stage double-inlet valve has little effect on reducing the temperature of the second stage. 3) The first-stage orifice valve and the second-stage double-inlet valve have a significant effect on reducing the cooling temperature of the first stage, and the first-stage double-inlet valve has little effect on reducing the temperature of the first stage. The second-stage orifice valve will worsen the first stage performance. Finally, an experimental system is constructed. The lowest temperature of the experimental prototype can reach 3.1 K, and the cooling capacity of 0.8 W can be produced at 4.2 K, which is presently the best result obtained by the domestic two-stage gas-coupled valve-separated GM type pulse tube cryocooler. This research can not only promote the independent construction of domestic 4 K refrigeration platform, but also support the relevant frontier basic scientific research and the development of important scientific instruments and equipment. In the future, the structure of the first-stage cold-end heat exchanger and the impedance matching between the compressor and the cryocooler will be improved, and the gas coupling characteristics inside the cryocooler will be studied theoretically and experimentally in depth.

TI Research progress on topological states and applications in optical
   waveguide arrays
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Topological insulators have been a novel area of research since the integer quantum Hall effect was proposed. The concept of topology was soon introduced to the field of photonics and attracted a lot of research attention due to the unique ability of light manipulation. Research on topological edge states, Anderson localization, and other interesting topological properties have been conducted in different systems. Topological photonic insulators, constructed on various platforms, have the advantages of high integration, robustness to external disorders under topological protection, and exhibit wide application prospects in light sensing, communications, and quantum computing. Optical waveguide arrays, with their properties of simple fabrication and fine structure, are one of the ideal platforms for studying topological photonics. Due to the similarity between the Schrodinger equation and the paraxial equation, topological properties can be visualized through light dynamics. In addition, a new type of Floquet topological insulator can be realized through space modulation in the z direction. In experiments, by changing the parameters of the waveguide arrays, such as refractive index, waveguide spacing, and waveguide configuration, the light field in waveguide arrays can be flexibly controlled within the tight-binding model. In addition, space modulation in the z direction and manipulation of non-Hermitian and nonlinear effects in waveguide arrays can realize novel topological photonic insulators.
   In this paper, we mainly focus on topological photonic insulators constructed using optical waveguide arrays and review recent experiments realized in different dimensions, covering the following aspects. First, we introduce the coupled-mode theory, which is the basis of topological photonics in waveguide arrays. We also describe the common fabrication methods of optical waveguide arrays, such as ultrafast laser direct writing and E-beam lithography, and we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Second, some typical topological experiments in one and two dimensions are introduced, discussing the topological phase transition and the bulk-edge correspondence in different models based on waveguide arrays. Most of the experiments have been realized in straight waveguides; however, recent research has found that helical waveguides are also useful. The z-reversal symmetry of the system can be broken by changing the shape of the waveguide in the z direction, revealing new topological properties. Third, we review non-Hermitian effects in topological waveguide arrays. Non-Hermitian modulation can be achieved by introducing gain and loss in waveguides. In experiments, loss can be easily introduced through spatial modulation or artificial additional loss, while gain is more difficult to achieve. Finally, we discuss the application potential of topological photonic insulators in waveguide arrays.
   In short, topological photonic insulators with novel light control properties are one of the interesting branches of condensed matter physics, which has application potential in many fields. Through this review, we hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of topological photonics in optical waveguide arrays and inspire future applications in topological optical waveguide array devices.

TI Ultra-low temperature adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator for
   sub-Kelvin region
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB With the development of space observation, quantum technology and other frontier scientific research fields, the demand for ultra-low temperature refrigeration in sub-Kelvin region is increasing. Compared with dilution refrigeration and sorption refrigeration, adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) has the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, compact, gravity independence and accessibility of working materials, which make ADR a promising technology for sub-Kelvin cooling.
   A single-stage ultro-low temperature adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator is designed and developed. The thermodynamic principle and quantitative analysis are presented, from the macroscopic and microcosmic view, and operating results show good agreement with the theoretical value.
   This refrigerator is precooled to 3 K by a GM-type refrigerator, with 252 g gadolinium gallium garnet (monocrystalline) used as a working medium. The maximum magnetic field of 4 T is provided by a superconducting coil. Flexible heat connection is used between the pre-cooler and ADR, so heat generated by vibration decreases. From (3 K, 4 T), the lowest temperature can reach 0.47 K by adiabatic demagnetization, which is consistent with the result drawn from the entropy data. In a constant-temperature-control mode, the demagnetization rate is controlled by a feedback loop, so the temperature can be held in the presence of a load.
   A cooling capacity of 2.7 J is provided at 1 K, with temperature fluctuation being lower than 0.5 mK, and the second thermodynamic efficiency of adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration is 57%. at 0.8 K, the cooling capacity is 1.2 J.
   Future work on improving the performance includes the improving of the on-off ratio of the heat switch, so, the irreversible loss caused by the heat transfer temperature difference in conduction state can be reduced. Improving the heat transfer performance of the salt pill, the heat can be ejected in a shorter period.
   This refrigerating machine is the first Chinese adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration system that can be operated in circulation, which is expected to be the 1st stage of a three-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration system in a 50 mK temperature zone. This study lays a foundation for further developing continuous multistage adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration at ultra-low temperature.

TI Development and Performance Evaluation of T-prep24: A Novel Automated
   Nucleic Acid Extraction System Based on Silica Magnetic Beads
SO DIAGNOSTICS
AB Background: Rapid molecular detection of infectious pathogen with high sensitivity and specificity has become increasingly important in clinical microbiology laboratories. The need to develop domestically produced nucleic acid extraction equipment has grown since COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. In this study, we developed a new magnetic bead-based automated nucleic acid extraction system, T-Prep24 system, and the performance of the new system was evaluated with many clinical specimens. Methods: A total of 180 respiratory specimens were collected, and nucleic acids were extracted using three different systems, the T-Prep24 system, TANBead system, and Qiagen system. The quality and concentration of extracted nucleic acid were evaluated by spectrophotometer and Qubit fluorometer. Qualitative determination for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by PowerChek SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR kit. Results: The median concentration of nucleic acid extracted by T-Prep24 system and measured by a fluorescence-based method was 0.685 ng/mu L (first to third interquartile range, 0.258-1.493 ng/mu L), which was lower than that of nucleic acid extracted by TANBead system (median value, 0.985 ng/mu L; first to third interquartile range, 0.610-1.583 ng/mu L; p < 0.001), and that of nucleic acid extracted by Qiagen system (median value, 4.710 ng/<mu>L; first to third interquartile range, 3.783-5.810 ng/mu L; p < 0.001). The Cq values of PCR assays using nucleic acid extracted by T-prep24 showed minimal systematic bias (slope = 1.015) when compared with those using nucleic acid extracted by TANBead, but significant proportional constant bias (slope = 0.907) when compared with those using nucleic acid extracted by Qiagen. The results of PCR assays using nucleic acid extracted by the T-Prep24 system were identical to those of PCR assays using nucleic acid extracted by TANBead system, and two discrepant results were identified when comparing with those by the Qiagen system. Conclusions: T-Prep24 system is a reliable and effective tool for nucleic acid extraction in clinical settings. Future investigations should be carried out to widen the applicability to a range of pathogens and sample types.

TI Mission operations for precise in-orbit collision prediction and space
   environment surveillance system
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB The growing number of satellites poses an increasing risk to critical infrastructure in low Earth orbit (LEO). Due to the changing geopolitical situation an increase in the number of intentional close encounters is expected. While LEO objects are already monitored closely from the ground, using ground-based infrastructure is difficult to monitor every object with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution and provide a collision prediction for approaching resident space objects (RSOs) that are equipped with a propulsion system. Therefore, Jena-Optronik GmbH, a leading manufacturer of optical space sensors, addresses this by enhancing their sensors for space situational awareness (SSA) applications. In a student project carried out at Technische Universit & auml;t Berlin (TU Berlin) the PRecise IN-orbit Collision prediction and space Environment Surveillance System (PRINCESS) mission concept was jointly developed to demonstrate SSA capabilities using the sensors of Jena-Optronik GmbH. The PRINCESS mission's formation of three small satellites-based on spacecraft from TU Berlin's QUEEN (QUantentechnologien f & uuml;r den Einsatz auf Einem Nanosatelliten (translated to quantum technologies for the use on nanosatellites)) and Nanosatellite Formation Flight (NanoFF) missions-shall demonstrate advanced SSA capabilities like autonomous in-orbit collision detection. A secondary mission goal is to demonstrate rendezvous and docking (RVD) capabilities using micro-patterned dry adhesives (MDAs). This paper presents a more detailed description of the required space and ground segment elements together with the operational aspects of the PRINCESS mission. In the formation, the QUEEN-based Mothership carries the SSA sensors and the broadband communication equipment, while the two NanoFF-based Free-Flyers, which are each equipped with a propulsion system, perform relative maneuvers with the Mothership. A ultra-high frequency (UHF) inter-satellite link (ISL) is used to communicate data between the space segment elements. The two major challenges identified for PRINCESS are firstly, the formation keeping with two dissimilar kinds of spacecraft in terms of the ballistic coefficient, which results in an unequal orbit decay. Secondly, the RVD with the non-maneuverable Mothership and the downlink of the significant quantities of payload data pose a considerable challenge. The downlink is composed of raw image data from two star trackers and two thermal infra-red (TIR) cameras together with data of a single LiDAR instrument on the Mothership. The payload data is further composed of on-board attitude and orbit state vector estimates. The required downlink capacity has been analyzed based on an optical terminal and an X-band transmitter on the Mothership with multiple optical and X-band ground-stations (GSs), among them the TU Berlin X-band GS in Berlin, Germany, and the TU Berlin optical ground station (TUBOGS) in Neustrelitz, Germany.

TI Universal coarse geometry of spin systems
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS

TI Coupled activity-current fluctuations in open quantum systems under
   strong symmetries
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Strong symmetries in open quantum systems lead to broken ergodicity and the emergence of multiple degenerate steady states. From a quantum jump (trajectory) perspective, the appearance of multiple steady states is related to underlying dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) at the fluctuating level, leading to a dynamical coexistence of different transport channels classified by symmetry. In this paper we investigate how strong symmetries affect both the transport properties and the activity patterns of a particular class of Markovian open quantum system, a three-qubit model under the action of a magnetic field and in contact with a thermal bath. We find a pair of twin DPTs in exciton current statistics, induced by the strong symmetry and related by time reversibility, where a zero-current exchange-antisymmetric phase coexists with a symmetric phase of negative exciton current. On the other hand, the activity statistics exhibits a single DPT where the symmetric and antisymmetric phases of different but nonzero activities dynamically coexists. Interestingly, the maximum current and maximum activity phases do not coincide for this three-qubits system. We also investigate how symmetries are reflected in the joint large deviation statistics of the activity and the current, a central issue in the characterization of the complex quantum jump dynamics. The presence of a strong symmetry under nonequilibrium conditions implies non-analyticities in the dynamical free energy in the dual activity-current plane (or equivalently in the joint activity-current large deviation function), including an activity-driven current lockdown phase for activities below some critical threshold. Remarkably, the DPT predicted around the steady state and its Gallavotti-Cohen twin dual are extended into lines of first-order DPTs in the current-activity plane, with a nontrivial structure which depends on the transport and activity properties of each of the symmetry phases. Finally, we also study the effect of a symmetry-breaking, ergodicity-restoring dephasing channel on the coupled activity-current statistics for this model. Interestingly, we observe that while this dephasing noise destroys the symmetry-induced DPTs, the underlying topological symmetry leaves a dynamical fingerprint in the form of an intermittent, bursty on/off dynamics between the different symmetry sectors.

TI Charge stability diagram of serial triple quantum dots br
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Serial triple quantum dot (STQD) systems have received extensive attention in the past decade, not onlybecause quantum dot scaling up is an indispensable ingredient for integrations, but also due to the fact thatspecific charge states of STQD can be employed to achieve fast full-electrical manipulation of spin qubits. Forthe latter, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between neighboring charge occupancy states ofSTQD is essential for three-electron exchange-only spin qubit-based quantum computations. Charge stabilitydiagram is usually employed to map out the charge occupation states about the plunger gate voltages of STQDsand to study the degeneracy among charge occupation states. Experimentally, two- rather than three-dimensional charge stability diagram was obtained in a lot of early studies by keeping one of plunger gatesunchanged to reduce complexity. The obtained two-dimensional diagram can only provide limited informationand is subject to blurred boundary of charge occupation states due to the low tunneling current and the energylevel broading effects. It is, therefore, challenge to searching for the working points where quantummanipulation can be performed promptly and accurately.In principle, three-dimensional charge occupation stability diagram can be efficiently constructed bynumerical simulations based on constant interaction (CI) model. In this study, we calculate the electrochemicalpotential of STQD about three plunger gate voltages by using the CI model-based capacitance network toreproduce any desired two-dimensional charge stability diagram. The simulated diagram not only well accordswith the diagrams obtained from the early experimental data of STQD, but also provides high clarity of thecharge state boundaries with tunable parameters. The systematical study of two-dimensional charge stabilitydiagram reviews the energy degeneracy triple and quadruple points of STQD charge occupation states andconcludes the energy degeneracy points in three types to compare with experimental data. For each of theenergy degeneracy points, we discuss both the electron and hole transport by using the electrochemical potentialalignment schematics. We reveal the common and unique triple points of STQD in comparison with those ofdouble quantum dot. The quadruple points of STQD are also addressed in the manipulation of quantum cellularautomata and quantum logical gate. The comprehensive understanding of these energy degeneracy points canefficiently guide experiments to build an optimal working point of the STQD system for quantum computationsand simulations

TI Combining machine learning algorithm to improve prediction performance
   of ab initio method for vibrational energy spectra of
   HF/HBr/H35Cl/Na35Cl
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Halides play an important role in atmospheric chemistry, corrosion of steel , also in controlling the abundance of O3. Moreover high-precision vibrational energy spectra contain a large amount of quantum information of molecular system , are basic data for people to understand and manipulate molecules. At present, ab-initio methods have achieved many calculation results of the potential energy surfaces and corresponding vibrational energy of molecules, but they still face challenges in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Recently, data-driven machine learning methods have demonstrated very strong capability of extracting high-dimensional functional relationships from massive data and have been widely used in spectrum studies. Therefore, a theoretical approach to combining ab-initio method and machine learning algorithm is presented here to predict the vibrational energy of diatomic systems, which improves the accuracy and simultaneously reduces the computational cost. Firstly, the vibrational energy levels of 42 diatomic molecules are obtained by using different CCSD(T) methods to calculate the configurations from simple to complex and the corresponding experimental results are also collected. A machine learning algorithm is then used to learn the difference between the CCSD(T) method calculated vibrational results and the experimental vibrational results, and a high-dimensional error function is finally constructed to improve the original CCSD(T) computational accuracy. The results for HF, HBr, H35Cl and Na35Cl (they did not appear in the training set) and other halogen molecules show that compared with the CCSD(T)/cc-pV5Z calculation method alone, the present method reduces the prediction error by more than 50% and the computational cost by nearly one order of magnitude. It is worth noting that the method proposed in this paper is not only limited to the energy level prediction of diatomic systems, but also applicable in other fields where data can be obtained by ab initio methods and experimental methods simultaneously, such as the energy spectrum properties of macromolecular systems.

AB Quantum optics/quantum information and nano-optics educational laboratory facility (QNOL) at the University of Rochester (UR) is located within three rooms of the Institute of Optics with a total area of 587 ft(2). Four teaching labs were prepared on the generation and characterization of entangled and single (antibunched) photons demonstrating the laws of quantum mechanics: (1) entanglement and Bell's inequalities, (2) single-photon interference (Young's double slit experiment and Mach-Zehnder interferometer), (3) single- photon source I: confocal fluorescence microscopy of single nanoemitters, and (4) single-photon source II: a Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup, fluorescence antibunching. We also describe a coherent undergraduate educational program in nanoscience/nanoengineering at the UR based on the QNOL and Integrated Nanosystems Center resources. From 2006 to May 2023, a total of similar to 900 students have utilized the quantum/nano labs for lab report submission (including 144 Monroe Community College students) and more than 300 students have used them for lab demonstrations. These two projects have three main outcomes: (1) developing a curriculum and offering the Certificate in Nanoscience and Nanoengineering; (2) creating an exemplary model of collaboration in quantum/nanotechnology between a university with state-of-the-art, expensive experimental facilities and a nearby two-year community college; and (3) developing universally accessible "hands-on" experiments (minilabs) on quantum/nanophotonics, learning materials, and pedagogical methods. The inexpensive mini-labs described herein can be adopted in small colleges.

TI Modeling of Al and Ga Droplet Nucleation during Droplet Epitaxy or
   Droplet Etching
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The temperature dependent density of Al and Ga droplets deposited on AlGaAs with molecular beam epitaxy is studied theoretically. Such droplets are important for applications in quantum information technology and can be functionalized e.g., by droplet epitaxy or droplet etching for the self-assembled generation of quantum emitters. After an estimation based on a scaling analysis, the droplet densities are simulated using first a mean-field rate model and second a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation basing on an atomistic representation of the mobile adatoms. The modeling of droplet nucleation with a very high surface activity of the adatoms and ultra-low droplet densities down to 5 x 10(6) cm(-2) is highly demanding in particular for the KMC simulation. Both models consider two material related model parameters, the energy barrier ES for surface diffusion of free adatoms and the energy barrier EE for escape of atoms from droplets. The rate model quantitatively reproduces the droplet densities with ES = 0.19 eV, EE = 1.71 eV for Al droplets and ES = 0.115 eV for Ga droplets. For Ga, the values of EE are temperature dependent indicating the relevance of additional processes. Interestingly, the critical nucleus size depends on deposition time, which conflicts with the assumptions of the scaling model. Using a multiscale KMC algorithm to substantially shorten the computation times, Al droplets up to 460 degrees C on a 7500 x 7500 simulation field and Ga droplets up to 550 degrees C are simulated. The results show a very good agreement with the experiments using ES = 0.19 eV, EE = 1.44 eV for Al, and ES = 0.115 eV, EE = 1.24 eV (T <= 300 degrees C) or EE = 1.24 + 0.06 (T[degrees C] - 300)/100 eV (T>300 degrees C) for Ga. The deviating EE is attributed to a re-nucleation effect that is not considered in the mean-field assumption of the rate model.

TI Quasi-parity-time symmetric dynamics in periodically driventwo-level
   non-Hermitian system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, there have been intensive studies of non-Hermitian physics and parity-time (PT) symmetrydue to their fundamental importance in theory and outstanding applications. A distinctive character in PT-symmetric system is phase transition (spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking), i.e. an all-real energy spectrumchanges into an all-complex one when the non-Hermitian parameter exceeds a certain threshold. However, theconditions for PT-symmetric system with real energy spectrum to occur are rather restrictive. Thegeneralization of PT-symmetric potentials to wider classes of non-PT-symmetric complex potentials with all-realenergy spectra is a currently important endeavor. A simple PT-symmetric two-level Floquet quantum system isnow being actively explored, because it holds potential for the realization of non-unitary single-qubit quantumgate. However, studies of the evolution dynamics of non-PT-symmetric two-level non-Hermitian Floquetquantum system are still relatively rare. In this paper, we investigate the non-Hermitian physics of a periodically driven non-PT-symmetric two-level quantum system. By phase-space analysis, we find that there exist so-called pseudo fixed points in phasespace representing the Floquet solutions with fixed population difference and a time-dependent relative phasebetween the two levels. According to these pseudo fixed points, we analytically construct a non-unitaryevolution operator and then explore the dynamic behaviors of the non-PT-symmetric two-level quantum systemin different parameter regions. We confirm both analytically and numerically that the two-level non-HermitianFloquet quantum system, although it is non-parity-time-symmetric, still features a phase transition with thequasienergy spectrum changing from all-real to all-complex energy spectrum, just like the PT symmetricsystem. Furthermore, we reveal that a novel phenomenon called quasi-PT symmetric dynamics occurs in thetime evolution process. The quasi-PT symmetric dynamics is so named in our paper, in the sense that the time-evolution of population probabilities in the non-PT-symmetric two-level system satisfies fully the time-spacesymmetry (PT symmetry), while time-evolution of the quantum state (containing the phase) does not meetsuch a PT symmetry, due to the fact that time-evolution of the phases of the probability amplitudes on the twolevels violates the requirement for the PT symmetry.

TI Single-ion phonon laser in quantum region
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The quantum phonon laser state is a vibrational state generated by phonon coherent amplification technology based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Its core feature is to achieve coherent excitation and manipulation of phonon quantum states through precise control of phonon dynamics. This technology has broken through the classical physical limits of the traditional phonon laser state, providing a brand-new research method for quantum information technology. Previous research on quantum phonon laser states mainly focused on quantum van der Bohr oscillators. Quantum van der Bohr oscillators, as typical representatives of nonlinear quantum systems, have demonstrated significant theoretical value and broad application prospects in trapped-ion systems in recent years. These research breakthroughs not only successfully expand the research scope of traditional nonlinear dynamics to the quantum domain, but more importantly, provide a brand-new experimental platform and theoretical framework for exploring quantum nonlinear phenomena. Although the realization of quantum phonon laser state has been verified in two-ion systems, its practical application still faces significant challenges. The present paper explores how a single trapped ion generates quantum phonon laser states based on the three-level model. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, the steady-state characteristics of the phonon laser state are systematically analyzed, with a focus on the quantum statistical behavior of the system, including the evolution laws of the Wigner quasi-probability distribution function and the second-order correlation function. This paper also presents a specific experimental scheme, which is based on a single trapped 40Ca+ ion and uses a dual-color light field composed of a bluesideband and a red-sideband lasers to generate quantum phonon laser states. By introducing the characteristic function of motion quantum states, the precise quantum state tomography of phonon laser states is achieved, thus providing a new approach for characterizing quantum states. In addition, there is a two-level model discussing the threshold effect of phonon lasers. However, it is found that the three-level model constructed in the present paper has significantly different phonon laser thresholds compared with the two-level model, and the three-level model can more accurately describe the physical mechanisms of complex quantum phonon laser states.

TI Reflection and transmission of electromagnetic pulses at a planar
   dielectric interface: Theory and quantum lattice simulations
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB There is considerable interest in the application of quantum information science to advance computations in plasma physics. A particular point of curiosity is whether it is possible to take advantage of quantum computers to speed up numerical simulations relative to conventional computers. Many of the topics in fusion plasma physics are classical in nature. In order to implement them on quantum computers, it will require couching a classical problem in the language of quantum mechanics. Electromagnetic waves are routinely used in fusion experiments to heat a plasma or to generate currents in the plasma. The propagation of electromagnetic waves is described by Maxwell equations with an appropriate description of the plasma as a dielectric medium. Before advancing to the tensor dielectric of a magnetized plasma, this paper considers electromagnetic wave propagation in a one-dimensional inhomogeneous scalar dielectric. The classic theory of scattering of plane electromagnetic waves at a planar interface, separating two different dielectric media, leads to Fresnel equations for reflection and transmission coefficients. In contrast to plane waves, this paper is on the reflection and transmission of a spatially confined electromagnetic pulse. Following an analytical formulation for the scattering of a Gaussian pulse, it is deduced that the maximum transmission coefficient for a pulse is n2/n1 times that for a plane wave; the incident and transmitted pulses propagate in dielectric media with refractive indices n(1) and n(2), respectively. The analytical theory is complemented by numerical simulations using a quantum lattice algorithm for Maxwell equations. The algorithm, based on the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber representation of the electromagnetic fields and expressed in terms of qubits, is an interleaved sequence of entangling operators at each lattice site and unitary streaming operators, which transmit information from one site to an adjacent lattice site. Besides substantiating results from the theory for Gaussian pulses, numerical simulations show their validity for non-Gaussian pulses. Apart from their time-asymptotic forms, the simulations display an interplay between the incident, reflected, and transmitted pulses in the vicinity of the transition region between two dielectric media.

TI On Infinite Families of Narrow-Sense Antiprimitive BCH Codes Admitting
   3-Transitive Automorphism Groups and Their Consequences
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are a well-studied subclass of cyclic codes that have found numerous applications in error correction and notably in quantum information processing. They are widely used in data storage and communication systems. A subclass of attractive BCH codes is the narrow-sense BCH codes over the Galois field GF(q) with length q + 1, which are closely related to the action of the projective general linear group of degree two on the projective line. Despite its interest, not much is known about this class of BCH codes. This paper aims to study some of the codes within this class and specifically narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH codes (these codes are also linear complementary duals (LCD) codes that have interesting practical recent applications in cryptography, among other benefits). We shall use tools and combine arguments from algebraic coding theory, combinatorial designs, and group theory (group actions, representation theory of finite groups, etc.) to investigate narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH Codes and extend results from the recent literature. Notably, the dimension, the minimum distance of some q-ary BCH codes with length q + 1, and their duals are determined in this paper. The dual codes of the narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH codes derived in this paper include almost MDS codes. Furthermore, the classification of PGL(2, p(m))-invariant codes over GF(p(h)) is completed. As an application of this result, the p-ranks of all incidence structures invariant under the projective general linear group PGL(2, p(m)) are determined. Furthermore, infinite families of narrow-sense BCH codes admitting a 3-transitive automorphism group are obtained. Via these BCH codes, a coding-theory approach to constructing the Witt spherical geometry designs is presented. The BCH codes proposed in this paper are good candidates for permutation decoding, as they have a relatively large group of automorphisms.

TI Experimental demonstration on quantum coherence evolution of two-mode
   state
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As one of the most remarkable features of quantum mechanics, quantum coherence is regarded as an important quantum resource in the quantum information processing. The one-mode squeezed state and the two mode squeezed state (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states) as the most representative examples of nonclassical states both have quantum coherence. The squeezing property of the squeezed state is described by the variance of quadrature components, and the positive partial transposition (PPT) criterion is used to describe the entanglement of the EPR entangled states. The research of the quantum coherence of Gaussian states is also a bridge between the properties of squeezing and entanglement. It has been shown that the quantum coherence with infinite-dimensional systems can be quantified by relative entropy. One of the widely used effective methods to obtain the value of quantum coherence experimentally is the quantum tomography. The covariance matrices of the quantum states are reconstructed via balanced homodyne detection and then taken into quantum coherence expression to calculate the corresponding value. The main factors affecting quantum coherence are the classical and uncorrelated noise in the actual experimental generation processing and the decoherence effect caused by the coupling between quantum resources and the surrounding environment. And the quantum coherence evolution in the generation and transmission process of the quantum resources is essential for the practical applications. Therefore, we analyze in detail the influences of the impurity of quantum resource on squeezing, entanglement and quantum coherence. The evolutions of quantum coherence of these Gaussian states in the lossy channels are demonstrated experimentally. The quantum coherence is shown to be robust against the loss in the lossy channels, which is similar to the case of squeezing and entanglement. The quantum coherences of the squeezed states and the EPR entangled states are robust against the thermal photons in the actual experimental generation processing, although the squeezing and entanglement of Gaussian states disappear at a certain number of thermal photons. Our research results provide a reference for the practical applications of quantum coherence of the squeezed state and entangled states in the lossy environment.

TI Unveiling topological order through multipartite entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is well known that the topological entanglement entropy (S-topo) of a topologically ordered ground state in two spatial dimensions can be captured efficiently by measuring the tripartite quantum information (I-3) of a specific annular arrangement of three subsystems. However, the nature of the general N-partite information (I-N) and correlation of a topologically ordered ground state remains unknown. In this work, we study such I-N measure and its nontrivial dependence on the arrangement of N subsystems. For the collection of subsystems (CSS) forming a closed annular structure, the I-N measure (N >= 3) is a topological invariant equal to the product of S-topo and the Euler characteristic of the CSS embedded on a planar manifold, vertical bar I-N vertical bar =.S-topo. Importantly, we establish that I-N is robust against several deformations of the annular CSS, such as the addition of holes within individual subsystems and handles between nearest-neighbor subsystems. While the addition of a handle between further neighbor subsystems causes I-N to vanish, the multipartite information measures of the two smaller annular CSS emergent from this deformation again yield the same topological invariant. For a general CSS with multiple holes (n(h) > 1), we find that the sum of the distinct, multipartite information measured on the annular CSS around those holes is given by the product of S-topo, chi and n(h), Sigma(nh)(mu i=1) vertical bar I-mu i(N mu i)vertical bar = n(h)chi S-topo. This constrains the concomitant measurement of several multipartite information on any complicated CSS. The Nth order irreducible correlations for an annular CSS of N subsystems is also found to be bounded from above by vertical bar I-N vertical bar, which shows the presence of correlations among subsystems arranged in the form of closed loops of all sizes. Thus, our results offer important insight into the nature of the many-particle entanglement and correlations within a topologically ordered state of matter.

TI Structural and vibrational properties of lanthanide Lindqvist
   polyoxometalate complexes
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Molecular spin qubits have demonstrated immense potential in quantum information science research due to the addressability of electron spins using microwave frequencies, and the scalability and tunability of molecular systems. Exemplary in this regard is the holmium polyoxometalate, [Na9Ho(W5O18)2]<middle dot>35H2O (HoW10), which features an accessible atomic clock transition at 9.4 GHz; however, the coherence time of this molecule is limited by spin-phonon coupling driven decoherence processes. To limit these decoherence pathways, materials need to be designed to reduce energy overlap between spin and phonon states, and this necessitates developing a better understanding on how structural modifications impact the vibrational landscape for classes of complexes. Herein we conducted a full investigation into the fundamental structural and vibrational properties of the lanthanide Lindqvist polyoxometalate series, [Na9Ln(W5O18)2]<middle dot>xH2O (Ln = La(iii)-Lu(iii), except Pm(iii)) (LnW10), to assess how structural changes effect vibrational characteristics and to elucidate pathways to improve the coherence properties of HoW10. Single crystal X-ray diffraction results revealed four distinct structural polymorphs in complexes 1-14 wherein first coordination spheres were identical, and differences manifested as changes in lattice packing. Interestingly, the subtle changes in packing exhibited by the four polymorphs were found to impact distortions away from ideal D4d symmetry for each of the LnW10 complexes. Raman and far-infrared (FIR) spectra of complexes 1-14 were collected to identify vibrational modes present in low energy regions and peak fitting assignments were made according to literature precedents. Qualitative and Partial least squares (PLS) analysis show correlations between complex structural parameters with the low energy Raman and FIR vibrational modes of interest. Overall, this investigation shows that the second coordination sphere plays an integral role in modulation of the structural and vibrational characteristics of LnW10 complexes, which makes it a viable route for tuning spin and vibrational manifolds of species within this series.
   The structural and vibrational properties of lanthanide Lindqvist (LnW10) polyoxometalates were investigated to delineate the effects of structural changes and polymorphism on vibrational manifolds relevant to spin based relaxation processes.

TI Strong coupling of single plasmonic nanoparticles and nanogaps with
   quantum emitters
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In cavity quantum electrodynamics, when the interaction between quantum emitter and cavity mode is strong enough to overcome the mean decay rate of the system, it will enter into a strong coupling regime, thereby forming part-light part-matter polariton states. Strong coupling can serve as a promising platform for room temperature Bose-Einstein condensation, polariton lasing, single photon nonlinearity, quantum information, etc. Localized surface plasmons supported by single metal nanostructures possess extremely smallmode volume, which is favorable for realizing strong coupling. Moreover, the nanoscale dimensions of plasmonicstructures can facilitate the miniaturization of strong coupling systems. Here, the research progress of strongplasmon-exciton coupling between single metal nanoparticles/nanogaps and quantum emitters is reviewed. Thetheory background of strong coupling is first introduced, including quantum treatment, classical coupledoscillator model, as well as the analytical expressions for scattering and photoluminescence spectra. Then,strong coupling between different kinds of plasmonic nanostructures and quantum emitters is reviewed. Singlemetal nanoparticles, nanoparticle dimers, and nanoparticle-on-mirror structures constitute the most typicalplasmonic nanostructures. The nanogaps in the latter two systems can highly concentrate electromagnetic field,providing optical nanocavities with smaller mode volume than single nanoparticles. Therefore, the larger coupling strength can be achieved in the nanogap systems, which is conducive to strong coupling at the single-exciton level. In addition, the active tuning of strong coupling based separately on thermal, electrical and optical means are reviewed. The energy and oscillator strength of the excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide(TMDC) monolayers are dependent on temperature. Therefore, the strong coupling can be tuned by heating or cooling the system. The excitons in TMDC monolayers can also be tuned by electrical gating, enabling electrical control of strong coupling. Optically tuning the quantum emitters provides another way to actively control the strong coupling. Overall, the research on active tuning of strong plasmon-exciton coupling is still very limited, and more investigations are needed. Finally, this review is concluded with a short summary and the prospect ofthis field

TI Tunable and robust optical and structural properties of a cooperative
   squaraine-dye aggregate-DNA DX-DAE tile system
SO NANOSCALE
AB Molecular excitons, which are excitations delocalized over multiple dyes in a wavelike manner, are of interest for a wide range of applications, including quantum information science. Numerous studies have templated a variety of synthetic dyes via a DNA scaffold to induce dye aggregation to create molecular excitons upon photoexcitation. Dye aggregate optical properties are critically dependent on relative dye geometry and local environment; therefore, an understanding of dye-dye and DNA-dye interactions is critical for advancing toward more complex DNA-dye systems. The extensively studied DNA Holliday junction (HJ) and less-studied double-crossover (DX) tile motif are fundamental test beds for designing complex and ultimately modular DNA-dye architectures. Here, we report the first study of single-linked squaraine dye aggregation and exciton delocalization on a larger and more stable (compared with the HJ) DX tile motif. We first highlight a few DNA-dye constructs that support single dyes and aggregates with distinct optical properties that are both tunable-through sample design, buffer conditions, and heat treatment-and robust to environment changes, including transfer to solid phase. Next, we assess several experimental and design considerations that demonstrate directed dye-driven assembly of a novel double-tile DNA configuration. Our results demonstrate that single-linked squaraine dyes templated to DX tiles provide a viable research path to design and evaluate dye aggregate networks that support exciton delocalization. We include herein the first report of exciton delocalization in the solid phase in a DNA-dye construct. Additionally, our findings indicate that dye aggregation impacts the assembly of the DNA-dye construct, and, in some cases, thereby cooperates with the DNA to determine a final robust system configuration. Finally, we show that a controlled annealing schedule can be employed to promote the homogeneous assembly of DNA-dye constructs. The findings in this study contribute to the understanding of DNA-dye systems and the relevant factors involved in their directed assembly to achieve specific constructs with desirable properties.

TI The Separability Problem in Molecular Quantum Systems:
   Information-Theoretic Framework for Atoms in Molecules
SO CHEMPHYSCHEM
AB Even though molecules are fundamentally quantum entities, the concept of a molecule retains certain classical attributes concerning its constituents. This includes the empirical separability of a molecule into its three-dimensional, rigid structure in Euclidean space, a framework often obtained through experimental methods like X-Ray crystallography. In this work, we delve into the mathematical implications of partitioning a molecule into its constituent parts using the widely recognized Atoms-In-Molecules (AIM) schemes, aiming to establish their validity within the framework of Information Theory concepts. We have uncovered information-theoretical justifications for employing some of the most prevalent AIM schemes in the field of Chemistry, including Hirshfeld (stockholder partitioning), Bader's (topological dissection), and the quantum approach (Hilbert's space definition). In the first approach we have applied the generalized principle of minimum relative entropy derived from the Sharma-Mittal two-parameter functional, avoiding the need for an arbitrary selection of reference promolecular atoms. Within the ambit of topological-information partitioning, we have demonstrated that the Fisher information of Bader's atoms conform to a comprehensive theory based on the Principle of Extreme Physical Information avoiding the need of employing the Schwinger's principle, which has been proven to be problematic. For the quantum approach we have presented information-theoretic justifications for conducting L & ouml;wdin symmetric transformations on the density matrix to form atomic Hilbert spaces generating orthonormal atomic orbitals with maximum occupancy for a given wavefunction.
   We explore the mathematical underpinnings of partitioning a molecule into its constituent atoms through the Atoms-in-Molecules (AIM) approach, validating its applicability through concepts from Information Theory. We present information-theoretic justifications for employing some of the most widely utilized AIM partitioning schemes in chemistry, such as the disjoint electron density partitioning (Hirshfeld), the fuzzy domains (Bader's basins) and the density matrix partitioning (Hilbert space). image

TI Exciton lifetime of quantum dots under hydrostatic pressure tuned
   scattering field Ag nanoparticles
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the past few decades, the studies of exciton emissions coupled with the metal nanoparticles have mainly focused on the enhancing exciton radiation and reducing exciton lifetime by near-field coupling interactions between excitons and metal nanoparticles. Only in recent years has the plasmon-field-induced to extend exciton lifetime (inhibition of the exciton emission) been reported. Experimentally, for observing a long-lifetime exciton state it needs to satisfy a condition of, instead of near-field condition of, where is the wavevector, is the refractive index, is the wavelength, and is the separation distance between the emitter and metal nanoparticle. Thus, in this paper, we tune the exciton emission wavelength by applying hydrostatic pressure to achieve the condition of in order to in detail investigate the coupling between excitons and metal nanoparticles. The studied InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) sample is grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a (001) semi-insulating GaAs substrate. After the AlAs sacrificial layer is etched with hydrofluoric acid, the QD film sample is transferred onto an Si substrate covered with Ag nanoparticles. Then the sample is placed in the diamond anvil cell device combined with a piezoelectric ceramic. In this case we can measure the photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the QD sample under different pressures. It is found that the observed longest exciton lifetime is at a pressure of, corresponding the exciton emission wavelength of, which is about times longer than the exciton lifetime of in QDs without the influence of Ag nanoparticles. The experimental results can be understood based on the destructive interference between the quantum dot exciton radiation field and the scattering field of metal nanoparticles. This model proposes a convenient way to increase the emission lifetime of dipoles on a large scale, and is expected to be applied to quantum information processing, optoelectronic applications, fundamental physics researches such as Bose-Einstein condensates.

TI Robustness anylysis of periodic oscillations in continuous-time crystals
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Continuous time crystals represent a novel state in many-body systems that can self-organize into timeperiodic oscillations without external periodic driving. Recent experiments have achieved such systems in dissipative solid-state materials, where persistent temporal order is autonomously sustained. A decisive characteristic of time crystals is their robustness, meaning that despite various disturbances, including fluctuations in internal parameters and external noise, they can still maintain rhythmic behavior, which has scientific value and echnological application potential. Although previous studies have shown that specific experimental parameters have robustness, thare is a lack of a systematic framework for quantifying and predicting their resilience to disturbances, and the underlying physics of this robustness is still not fully understood. The key unresolved problems include how nonlinear interactions and feedback mechanisms contribute to stability, and what the critical thresholds are for parameter variations beyond which temporal order collapses. This work addresses these gaps by systematically analyzing how internal parameters and external influences affect the oscillation period and overall stability. Internally, the dynamics are determined by dipole-dipole interactions and atomic transition strengths, which define the temporal symmetry breaking that occurs in the system. Externally, the response of the system is controlled by the strength of the optical driving field and the energy dissipation rate. A key finding is the determination of an intrinsic feedback mechanism for a dynamically stabile time crystal. This mechanism plays a role in restoring force, correcting deviations caused by minor disturbances, and maintaining the coherence of oscillatory phase. Moreover, the system displays nonlinear dynamical behavior, characterized by two different states: one is stable oscillation continuing under moderate disturbance, and the other is stronger disturbance causing dynamical phase transition, resulting in switching between disordered or dynamically unstable state and stable state. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the various behaviors observed in continuous time crystals and lay an important theoretical foundation for utilizing their unique properties in advanced applications such as quantum information processing and precision metrology.

TI Shannon information entropy for a quantum nonlinear oscillator on a
   space of non-constant curvature
SO PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA
AB The so-called Darboux III oscillator is an exactly solvable N-dimensional nonlinear oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant negative curvature. This oscillator can be interpreted as a smooth (super)integrable deformation of the usual N-dimensional harmonic oscillator in terms of a non-negative parameter & ANGS; which is directly related to the curvature of the underlying space. In this paper, a detailed study of the Shannon information entropy for the quantum version of the Darboux III oscillator is presented, and the interplay between entropy and curvature is analysed. In particular, analytical results for the Shannon entropy in the position space can be found in the N-dimensional case, and the known results for the quantum states of the N-dimensional harmonic oscillator are recovered in the limit of vanishing curvature & ANGS; & RARR; 0. However, the Fourier transform of the Darboux III wave functions cannot be computed in exact form, thus preventing the analytical study of the information entropy in momentum space. Nevertheless, we have computed the latter numerically both in the one and three-dimensional cases and we have found that by increasing the absolute value of the negative curvature (through a larger & ANGS; parameter) the information entropy in position space increases, while in momentum space it becomes smaller. This result is indeed consistent with the spreading properties of the wave functions of this quantum nonlinear oscillator, which are explicitly shown. The sum of the entropies in position and momentum spaces has been also analysed in terms of the curvature: for all excited states such total entropy decreases with & ANGS;, but for the ground state the total entropy is minimized when & ANGS; vanishes, and the corresponding uncertainty relation is always fulfilled.& COPY; 2022 The Author(s).

TI Ultrafast tunable photonic-integrated extended-DBR Pockels laser
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Frequency-agile lasers that can simultaneously feature low noise characteristics and fast mode-hop-free frequency tuning are keystone components for applications ranging from LiDAR and distributed sensing to communication and quantum information processing. Hybrid integrated lasers have recently demonstrated faster tuning and lower phase noise than the best legacy systems, including fibre lasers, offering new avenues for compact and scalable frequency-agile lasers. In particular, Pockels-tunable lasers based on self-injection locking to high-Q optical microresonators fabricated from lithium niobate on insulator have achieved ultrafast tuning rates reaching the petahertz per second. However, the impact of these lasers is still hampered by the dynamics of self-injection locking, which limits the maximum tuning range, output power and dictates high operational complexity. Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a turn-key-operable hybrid integrated Pockels laser featuring a mode-hop-free tuning range of over 10 GHz, a tuning efficiency of over 550 MHz V-1, tuning rates reaching the exahertz per second and a high output power of 15 mW. We achieve this drastic improvement of hybrid integrated laser performance with an elegant and compact external distributed Bragg reflector architecture that combines an inexpensive reflective semiconductor optical amplifier with an electro-optically-actuated distributed Bragg reflector manufactured at the wafer scale. The excellent linearity and coherence of the external distributed Bragg reflector Pockels laser, together with its unprecedented tuning bandwidth and range-a combination unmet by legacy bulk lasers-make it an ideal candidate for applications in frequency-modulated continuous-wave LiDAR, distributed fibre sensing and atmospheric gas metrology. We demonstrate this performance and flexibility in a proof-of-concept frequency-modulated continuous-wave LiDAR experiment, achieving a 4 cm distance resolution over a 20,000 voxel acquisition in 100 ms, as well as in a hydrogen cyanide spectroscopy experiment. The compact and rugged Pockels laser assembly has been packaged in a commercial butterfly package, improving its resilience to environmental noise and demonstrating long-term stability with a frequency fluctuation of the free-running laser of below 25 MHz over 2.5 h.

TI Entanglement and Generalized Berry Geometrical Phases in Quantum Gravity
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A new formalism is introduced that makes it possible to elucidate the physical and geometric content of quantum space-time. It is based on the Minimum Group Representation Principle (MGRP). Within this framework, new results for entanglement and geometrical/topological phases are found and implemented in cosmological and black hole space-times. Our main results here are as follows: (i) We find the Berry phases for inflation and for the cosmological perturbations and express them in terms of the observables, such as the spectral scalar and tensor indices, nS and nT, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. The Berry phase for de Sitter inflation is imaginary with the sign describing the exponential acceleration. (ii) The pure entangled states in the minimum group (metaplectic) Mp(n) representation for quantum de Sitter space-time and black holes are found. (iii) For entanglement, the relation between the Schmidt type representation and the physical states of the Mp(n) group is found: This is a new non-diagonal coherent state representation complementary to the known Sudarshan diagonal one. (iv) Mean value generators of Mp(2) are related to the adiabatic invariant and topological charge of the space-time, (matrix element of the transition -infinity<t<infinity). (v) The basic even and odd n-sectors of the Hilbert space are intrinsic to the quantum space-time and its discrete levels (in particular, continuum for n ->infinity), they do not require any extrinsic generation process such as the standard Schrodinger cat states, and are entangled. (vi) The gravity or cosmological domains on one side and another of the Planck scale are entangled. Examples: The quantum primordial trans-Planckian de Sitter vacuum and the classical late de Sitter vacuum today; the central quantum gravity region and the external classical gravity region of black holes. The classical and quantum dual gravity regions of the space-time are entangled. (vii) The general classical-quantum gravity duality is associated with the Metaplectic Mp(n) group symmetry which provides the complete full covering of the phase space and of the quantum space-time mapped from it.

TI Zero-Field Splitting in Cyclic Molecular Magnet
   {Cr8Y8}: A High-Frequency ESR Study
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB Cyclic 3d-4f molecular magnets have received considerable attention owing to their potential applications in high-density data storage and quantum information processing. As a rare example of ferromagnetic polynuclear Cr rings, {Cr8Y8} represents a valuable test bed to directly study the magnetic interaction between Cr3+ ions in large hexadecametallic {Cr(8)Ln(8)} (Ln = 4f metal) molecules. We have proposed a "single-J" model to approximate the low-temperature spin dynamics of {Cr8Y8} in our earlier study, while a zero-field splitting (ZFS) of the quantum levels was also suggested by the heat capacity data. In order to have a deeper understanding of the magnetism of {Cr8Y8}, it is necessary to verify the ZFS by means of high-resolution spectral methods and identify its origin. In this work, we present a high-frequency electron spin resonance (HF-ESR) study on the ZFS of {Cr8Y8}. The X-band ESR spectra consists of multi-peak structure, indicative of magnetic anisotropy that breaks the degeneracy between spin states in the absence of a magnetic field. HF-ESR spectra are collected to extract the ZFS parameters. We observed a sharp resonance peak due to the transitions between the S = 11 quantum levels and a broadband corresponding to a distribution of resonance peaks due to the ZFS of the S = 12 quantum levels. By analyzing HF-ESR spectra, we confirm the expected S = 12 ground state and determine its ZFS parameter D as -0.069 K, and, furthermore, we reproduce the spectra recorded at 154 GHz. The macrospin model proves to still be valid. The ZFS is attributed to the axial magnetic anisotropy, as found in some other Cr-based molecular wheels. The detailed HF-ESR investigation presented in this paper will benefit the studies on other {Cr(8)Ln(8)} wheels with magnetic Ln(3+) ions and highlights the importance of the HF-ESR method as a high-resolution probe in determining the ZFS parameters with very small magnitude.

TI Metamagnetic transition and a loss of magnetic hysteresis caused by
   electron trapping in monolayers of single-molecule magnet
   Tb2@C79N
SO NANOSCALE
AB Realization of stable spin states in surface-supported magnetic molecules is crucial for their applications in molecular spintronics, memory storage or quantum information processing. In this work, we studied the surface magnetism of dimetallo-azafullerene Tb-2@C79N, showing a broad magnetic hysteresis in a bulk form. Surprisingly, monolayers of Tb-2@C79N exhibited a completely different behavior, with the prevalence of a ground state with antiferromagnetic coupling at low magnetic field and a metamagnetic transition in the magnetic field of 2.5-4 T. Monolayers of Tb-2@C79N were deposited onto Cu(111) and Au(111) by evaporation in ultra-high vacuum conditions, and their topography and electronic structure were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in combination with DFT studies, revealed that the nitrogen atom of the azafullerene cage tends to avoid metallic surfaces. Magnetic properties of the (sub)monolayers were then studied by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Tb-M-4,M-5 absorption edge. While in bulk powder samples Tb-2@C79N behaves as a single-molecule magnet with ferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments and blocking of magnetization at 28 K, its monolayers exhibited a different ground state with antiferromagnetic coupling of Tb magnetic moments. To understand if this unexpected behavior is caused by a strong hybridization of fullerenes with metallic substrates, XMCD measurements were also performed for Tb-2@C79N adsorbed on h-BN|Rh(111) and MgO|Ag(100). The co-existence of two forms of Tb-2@C79N was found on these substrates as well, but magnetization curves showed narrow magnetic hysteresis detectable up to 25 K. The non-magnetic state of Tb-2@C79N in monolayers is assigned to anionic Tb-2@C79N- species with doubly-occupied Tb-Tb bonding orbital and antiferromagnetic coupling of the Tb moments. A charge transfer from the substrate or trapping of secondary electrons are discussed as a plausible origin of these species.

TI Atom-field-medium interactions: Graded influence actions for N
   harmonic atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper and planned subsequent ones have two broad aims. First, we construct a theory for multipartite open quantum systems comprising several layers of structure with self-consistent backactions. We develop the graded influence action formalism [Behunin and Hu, Phys. Rev. A 82 , 022507 (2010); 84 , 012902 (2011)] to account for the influences of successive sublayers on the dynamics of the variables of interest. Second, we apply these methods to the study of atom-field-medium interactions and highlight their merits over conventional methods. We consider a system of N harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (IDFs) of N neutral atoms (A), interacting with a quantum field (F), scalar here, for simplicity, altered by the presence of a dielectric medium (M). In this paper we use the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions in the influence functional formalism to derive the stochastic equations for the reduced density matrices of the dynamical variables in the successive layers of structure. The term "graded" refers to the specific ordering of the coarse-graining procedures. Three layers of coarse graining are performed. First, integrating over the common bath of the dielectric oscillators results not only in the appearance of necessary dissipative properties of the dielectric but also in essential nuanced features such as non-Markovian spatial correlations in the dielectric. Second, integrating over the medium variables as a whole results in a dielectric-modified quantum field, the influence of the medium on the quantum field manifesting through a frequency-dependent permittivity function. Finally, integrating over this dielectric- altered quantum field which interacts with the IDFs of the atoms allows us to derive an equation of motion which describes the nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of the IDFs of the atoms interacting with a dielectric medium-modified quantum field. In the future we plan to calculate the nonequilibrium covariant matrix elements of the correlation functions of the IDFS of N atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field, which are useful for probing many basic quantum information issues, such as the entanglement dynamics in AFM interactions.

TI Ultra-cold long-range Rydberg-ground molecules
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Ultra-cold long-range Rydberg-ground molecule consisting of a Rydberg atom and one or more ground-state atoms is formed by low-energy scattering between the Rydberg electron and ground-state atoms located inside the Rydberg electron's wave function. The low-energy scattering interaction, initially investigated by Fermi and Omont, has been predicted to lead to molecular binding in a novel type of Rydberg molecules, including the trilobite and butterfly molecules. Their unconventional binding mechanism, which is unlike covalent, or ionic, or van der Waals bonds, results in loosely bound molecules with bond lengths on the order of thousands of Bohr radius. This kind of molecule with large size and huge permanent electric dipole moment is a good candidate for realizing the certain strongly correlated many-body gases and for quantum information processing, as well as for dipolar quantum gases and spin systems with long-range interactions. Consequently, these molecules have received considerable attention in recent years.
   In this paper, we review the recent theoretical and experimental investigations of ultra-cold long-range Rydberg-ground molecules, including the scattering interaction between the Rydberg electron and ground-state atom and the resulting adiabatic potential curves, experimental observations of photo-associated Rydberg-ground molecules spectra, as well as the measurements of permanent electric dipole moment. Ultra-cold long-range Rydberg-ground molecules are prepared by photoassociation in a high-density cold atom sample. Therefore, the Rydberg electron can bind several ground-state atoms to form a polyatomic Rydberg-ground molecule. The permanent molecular electric-dipole moments are revealed by spectral line broadening in the electric fields. The latest research pointed out that the permanent electric dipole moments of the Cs nD(J)-type Rydberg-ground molecules are negative, which is different from the previous reports (the electric dipole moments are positive). The negative sign reflects a deficiency of Rydberg-electron density near the ground-state perturber, which is caused by electronic configuration mixing.

TI Role of IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα Gene Variants in
   Preterm Birth
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Background: The association of gene variants for interleukin 6 (IL-6) (rs1800796), interleukin 10 (IL-10) (rs1800896) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha (rs1800629) with the occurrence of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) was investigated to determine whether these genetic variants are a risk factor. Methods: A total of 199 blood samples from pregnant women who had given birth prematurely and 200 control blood samples were analyzed to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes for IL-6 (rs1800796), IL-10 (rs1800896) and TNF alpha (rs1800629). The control samples were samples from pregnant women with term delivery. The isolation of DNA was performed on mini-spin columns according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality and purity of the isolated DNA were tested using a Qubit 3 fluorometer. Genotyping was performed with an ABI PRISM 7500 SDS using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. The genotypes obtained were analyzed using the 7500 Software v2.3 package. Results: Carriers of the A/A genotype for the rs1800629 SNP of the TNF alpha gene have a 4.81 times greater chance of late-onset PTB compared to carriers of the G/G and A/G genotypes in the recessive inheritance model. The presence of the G/G genotype in the recessive inheritance model compared with the G/A and A/A genotypes for the rs1800896 SNP of the IL-10 gene represents a potentially protective factor, with mothers in the term-birth group having an almost 2-fold lower odds of PTB in general and an almost 10-fold lower odds of early PTB. On the other hand, carriers of the A/G genotype of rs1800896 have a 1.54-fold higher chance of preterm birth in general and a 1.6-fold higher chance of late preterm birth in the superdominant inheritance model compared to the A/A and G/G genotypes in the group of mothers with PTB. In this study, no association was found between PTB and the rs1800796 SNP of the IL-6 gene. Conclusions: rs1800629 in mothers was associated with PTB. rs1800896 shows a potentially protective effect for the occurrence of PTB in this study. No association was found between PTB and rs1800796.

TI Quantum nanophotonics with energetic particles: X-rays and free
   electrons
SO PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Rapid progress in precision nanoscale and atomic-scale design over the past decades has driven transformative advances in controlling the generation and propagation of light, giving rise to the field of nanophotonics. While nanophotonics has traditionally focused on manipulating electromagnetic waves across the microwave to visible spectrum, recent developments have extended its impact into ultrashort-wavelength regimes, including X-rays and free-electron wavepackets. In this review, we highlight the impact and potential of nanophotonics in this relatively unexplored yet technologically disruptive domain, demonstrating how nanoscale and atomic-scale design enable unprecedented technologies in quantum science related to X-rays and free electrons. We place particular emphasis on quantum phenomena arising from electron-photon entanglement in free-electron radiation, including quantum recoil effects, enhancing and controlling X-ray generation through free-electron waveshaping, and the potential for quantum light generation driven by free electrons. The nanoscale control of material structures and light enables manipulation of free-electron-driven X-rays and electron wavepackets at the wavelength scale, revealing quantum features and offering potential pathways for developing novel, compact light and electron sources. We also review high-harmonic generation (HHG), which arises from quasi-free electrons, as a source of extreme ultraviolet and X-rays, including nano-optics-enhanced and quantum light-driven HHG. The review then explores X-ray waveguide nanophotonics, covering waveguide fundamentals, fabrication, mode structures, and applications in coherent imaging and emitter interactions. Finally, we highlight emerging applications of nanophotonics-enabled X-rays and free electrons, including quantum X-ray imaging, X-ray detection, and quantum information technologies, where free electrons are explored as quantum probes, information carriers, and quantum light sources. Our review underscores the unique opportunities within the X-ray and free-electron regimes and the enormous potential of quantum nanophotonics to revolutionize these fields through tailored interactions between photons, free electrons, and nanomaterials.

TI Three dimensional image encryption algorithm based on quantum random
   walk and multidimensional chaos
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB With the development of computer network technology, people's requirements for information security is increasing day by day. However, the classical encryption technology has the defects of small key space and easy crack. The problems of image encryption technology in protecting image information security and private content need solving urgently. As a new type of quantum key generator, quantum random walk has a large key space. Compared with the classical random walk, the computing speed and security are significantly improved. This paper presents a three-dimensional image encryption algorithm that is based on quantum random walk and involves Lorenz and Rossler multidimensional chaos. Firstly, Gaussian pyramid is used to segment the image. Secondly, the Hamming distances of several sub images are calculated by using the random sequence generated by quantum random walk and the random sequence generated by Lorenz chaotic system in multidimensional chaos, and then synthesized, and the Euclidean distances between the three RGB channels of the image are calculated. Finally, the sequence value obtained from the remainder of Hamming distance and Euclidean distance, as an initial value is input into the Rossler system in multi-dimensional chaos to generate a random sequence which is used as the key to XOR the RGB channel of the image so as to create an encrypted image. The corresponding decryption scheme is the inverse process of the encryption process. In addition, in terms of transmission security, this paper uses a blind watermark embedding algorithm based on DCT and SVD to embed the watermark information into the encrypted image, so that the receiver can extract the watermark and judge whether the image is damaged by the attack in the transmission process according to the integrity of the watermark information. If it is not attacked maliciously, the image will be decrypted. This operation further improves the protection of image information security.The experimental results show that the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the encrypted image is stable between 7 and 9 and the encryption effect is good, the GVD score is close to 1, the correlation of the encrypted image is uniformly distributed, and the correlation coefficient is close to 0, and the key space is 2128 in size and the encrypted histogram is evenly distributed, showing a high ability to resist statistical analysis attacks.

TI Two-level systems in nucleated and non-nucleated epitaxial
   alpha-tantalum films
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Building usefully coherent superconducting quantum processors depends on reducing losses in their constituent materials [I. Siddiqi, Nat. Rev. Mater. 6, 875-891 (2021)]. Tantalum, like niobium, has proven utility as the primary superconducting layer within highly coherent qubits [Place et al., Nat. Commun. 12(1), 1-6 (2021) and Wang et al., npj Quantum Inf. 8(1), 1-6 (2022)]. However, unlike Nb, high temperatures are typically used to stabilize the desirable body-centered-cubic phase, alpha-Ta, during thin film deposition. It has long been known that a thin Nb layer permits the room-temperature nucleation of alpha-Ta [Westwood et al., Tantalum Thin Films (Academic Press, 1975); D. W. Face and D. E. Prober, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 5, 3408-3408 (1987); and Colin et al., Acta Mater. 126, 481-493 (2017)], but here we observe the epitaxial process and present few-photon microwave loss measurements in Nb-nucleated Ta films. We compare resonators patterned from Ta films grown at high temperature (500 degrees C) and films nucleated at room temperature, in order to understand the impact of the crystalline order on quantum coherence. In both cases, films grew with Al2O3 (001) ? Ta (110), indicating that the epitaxial orientation is independent of temperature and is preserved across the Nb/Ta interface. We use conventional low-power spectroscopy to measure two level system (TLS) loss as well as an electric-field bias technique to measure the effective dipole moments of TLS in the surfaces of resonators. In our measurements, Nb-nucleated Ta resonators had greater loss tangent (1.5 +/- 0.1x10(-5)) than non-nucleated (5 +/- 1x10(-6)) in approximate proportion to defect densities as characterized by x-ray diffraction (0.27 degrees vs 0.18 degrees [110] reflection width) and electron microscopy (30 vs 70nm domain size). The dependence of the loss tangent on domain size indicates that the development of more ordered Ta films is likely to lead to improvements in qubit coherence times [I. Siddiqi, Nat. Rev. Mater. 6, 875-891 (2021) and Premkumar et al., Commun. Mater. 2(1), 1-9 (2021)]. Moreover, low-temperature alpha-Ta epitaxy may enable the growth of microstate-free heterostructures, which would not withstand high temperature processing [McSkimming et al., J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 35, 021401 (2017)].

TI The smallest interacting universe
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study a mechanism by which the most basic structures of quantum physics can emerge from the most meager of starting points, a Hilbert space, lacking any preassigned structure such as a tensor decomposition, and a loss function. In a simple toy model of the universe, we hypothesize a fundamental loss functional for the combined Hamiltonian and quantum state, and then minimize this loss functional by gradient descent. We find that this minimization gives rise to a co-emergence of locality, i.e. a tensor product structure simultaneously respected by both the Hamiltonian and the state, suggesting that locality can emerge by a process analogous to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We discuss the relevance of this program to the arrow of time problem.
   In our toy model, we interpret the emergence of a tensor factorization as the appearance of individual degrees of freedom within a previously undifferentiated (raw) Hilbert space. Earlier work [5, 6] looked at the emergence of locality in Hamiltonians only, and in that context found strong numerical confirmation of the hypothesis that raw Hilbert spaces of dim = n are unstable and prefer to settle on tensor factorization when n is not prime, expressing, for example, n = pq, and in [6] even primes were seen to "factor" after first shedding a small summand, e.g. 7 = 1 + 2 center dot 3. This was found in the context of a rather general potential functional F on the space of metrics {g(ij)} on su(n), the Lie algebra of symmetries. This emergence of qunits through operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) may help us understand why the world seems to consist of myriad interacting degrees of freedom. But understanding why the universe has an initial Hamiltonian H-0 with a many-body structure is of limited conceptual value unless the initial state, |psi(0)>, is also structured by this tensor decomposition. Here we adapt F to become a functional on {g, |psi(0)>} = (metrics) x (initial states), and find SSB now produces a conspiracy between g and |psi(0)), where they simultaneously attain low entropy by jointly settling on the same qubit decomposition. Extreme scaling of the computational problem has confined us to studying C-4 breaking to C-2 circle times C-2 and C-8 breaking to C-2 circle times C-4 or C-2 circle times C-2 circle times C-2.

TI Advances and Future Trends in Photolithography and Photoresist Materials
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance The research on photolithography technology and photoresist materials is crucial, acting as a foundation for the advancement of modern microelectronics, semiconductor manufacturing, and various high-tech industries. Photolithography, a process that transfers complex circuit designs onto silicon wafers or other substrates with high precision and resolution, has significantly enhanced the integration density and performance of integrated circuits (ICs). This technology has drastically reduced manufacturing costs and enabled the rapid development of information technology. With the escalating demand for high-performance chips, driven by the proliferation of the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing, advanced photolithography techniques are becoming crucial. For instance, IoT devices require low-power, high-integration sensors, and processors, whereas AI applications demand powerful computational capabilities and high-speed data transmission. The continuous breakthrough of the resolution limits in photolithography enables the fabrication of sophisticated chips, thereby supporting the evolution of these cutting-edge technologies. Moreover, the adaptability and accuracy of photolithography extend beyond semiconductor manufacturing, with extensive applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), photonics, and biomedicine. In MEMS, photolithography facilitates the fabrication of intricate mechanical structures at a microscopic scale, which are essential for sensors, actuators, and miniaturized devices. In photonics, it is used to fabricate optical components and devices, such as waveguides and photonic crystals, which are crucial for optical communication and sensing. In biomedicine, photolithography is essential in developing microfluidic devices, biochips, and tissue engineering scaffolds, contributing to advancements in diagnostics, drug delivery, and regenerative medicine. The broad applicability and accuracy of photolithography render it an indispensable tool for innovation across these diverse fields. The development of novel photoresist materials is a key factor in the progress of photolithography, addressing the growing demands for higher resolution, sensitivity, and process compatibility. Traditional photoresists, such as positive and negative resists, have been extensively used for their reliability and ease of use. However, the increasing complexity and miniaturization of devices necessitate the exploration of specialized photoresists. These new materials, such as those used in nanoimprint lithography (NIL), laser direct writing (LDW), and scanning probe lithography, offer unique properties that enhance the performance of photolithographic processes. For example, NIL photoresists facilitate cost-effective and high-resolution pattern transfer, making them ideal for large-scale production. LDW photoresists provide unparalleled spatial resolution and flexibility, making them suitable for creating complex and precise structures. Continuous innovation in photoresist chemistry is essential for advancing photolithography and meeting the stringent requirements of next-generation devices. Furthermore, environmental sustainability is a growing concern in the semiconductor industry, and the development of eco-friendly photoresists is a crucial step toward mitigating the environmental impact of photolithography. Water-and bio-based photoresists signify important breakthroughs, providing biodegradability and reduced reliance on hazardous chemicals.
   These environmentally friendly alternatives enhance sustainable manufacturing practices and align with global initiatives to mitigate climate change and promote green technologies. By addressing existing challenges and exploring new frontiers, this research paves the way for more efficient, precise, and sustainable photolithographic processes, thereby advancing technological progress and environmental sustainability. Progress Photolithography and photoresist materials have witnessed significant advancements over the past few decades, driven by the relentless pursuit of higher resolution, increased efficiency, and broader application domains. The most significant development is the transition from conventional deep ultraviolet (UV) lithography (DUVL) to extreme UV lithography (EUVL). The EUVL, which uses a 13.5 nm wavelength, has revolutionized the semiconductor industry by facilitating the fabrication of features at 7 nm node and smaller. The introduction of the first commercial EUVL system by ASML in 2019 marked a significant milestone, as it significantly improved the resolution and production efficiency, making it possible to manufacture 5 nm and even smaller nodes (Fig. 5). This advancement has been crucial for the development of high-performance chips required by emerging technologies such as AI, the IoT, and quantum computing. The success of EUVL has prompted further research into optimizing EUV light sources, such as the development of new types of discharge-produced plasma sources based on liquid tin jet electrodes and the study of the temporal evolution parameters of the laser-produced tin plasma. Another significant advancement is the development of advanced photoresist materials tailored for high-resolution and high- sensitivity applications. Traditional photoresists have been the backbone of photolithography for many years. However, the increasing demands for finer feature sizes and better process control have prompted the investigation of novel photoresist formulations. For example, chemically amplified photoresists (CAPR) have become prevalent in EUVL, where the resist sensitivity and resolution are significantly enhanced through acid-catalyzed reactions. Furthermore, the development of multi-photon polymerization (MPP) photoresists has opened up new possibilities for three-dimensional (3D) and high-resolution patterning. MPP facilitates the fabrication of complex structures with sub-micron resolution, making it highly suitable for applications in MEMS and biomedicine. The integration of nanocomposites into photoresists has also been explored to improve their mechanical properties and functionality, such as the development of transparent magnesium aluminate spinel ceramics for additive manufacturing. These advancements in photoresist materials are crucial for pushing the boundaries of photolithography and facilitating the fabrication of more sophisticated and multifunctional devices. Conclusions and Prospects Research on photolithography technology and photoresist materials has significantly advanced, driving the development of modern microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing. The transition from conventional DUVL to EUVL has facilitated the fabrication of features at the 7 nm node and smaller, markedly improving the performance and integration density of the ICs. The development of advanced photoresist materials, such as CAPR and MPP photoresists, has further pushed the boundaries of resolution and functionality, creating new opportunities for applications in MEMS, photonics, and biomedicine.
   Moreover, the integration of electron beam lithography with other nanofabrication techniques has improved the accuracy and adaptability of nanostructure fabrication, supporting the development of high-density, high-performance devices. The future of photolithography depends on interdisciplinary collaboration, intelligent automation, and multifunctional integration. Interdisciplinary efforts in materials science, chemistry, physics, and computer science will persist in advancing innovations in photoresist chemistry and lithography processes. The adoption of machine learning algorithms for real-time optimization and control of lithography parameters will improve process consistency and efficiency, thereby reducing production costs and waste. Moreover, the development of multifunctional photoresists with properties such as conductivity, magnetism, and biological activity will expand the applicability of photolithography, facilitating the creation of advanced devices for flexible electronics, data storage, and biomedical imaging. With the increasing demand for high-performance and sustainable technologies, the ongoing advancement of photolithography will be pivotal in influencing the future of microelectronics and other fields.

TI One-Dimensional Beam Scanner Based on Refractive Galvanometer for Cold
   Atom Experiment
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective In recent years, single-atom- array- based quantum information processing has caught intense attention. In single-atom-array-based quantum simulators, programmable quantum processors, and fault- tolerant quantum computing, the transportation and addressing of single atoms play crucial roles. Additionally, the transportation of cold atoms over a long distance from a magneto-optical trap ( MOT) loading chamber to a science chamber can maintain lower vacuum pressure or better optical access for experiments. Traditionally, atom addressing and transportation often employ acoustooptic deflectors ( AODs) to control the deflection of laser beams on demand. However, there are some restrictions for AODs. The deflected laser frequency varies as the RF driving of AOD changes during atom addressing, and an auxiliary acousto-optical modulator ( AOM) is needed to compensate for the frequency, which often leads to a more complex experimental setup. Meanwhile, the clear aperture of the acousto-optic crystal limits the beam size of the transmitted laser and the limited diffraction efficiency of AOD results in substantial optical insertion loss. We experimentally demonstrate a one-dimensional beam scanner based on a refractive galvanometer, which is compatible for laser beams with large crosssections and has low insertion loss. By adjusting the rotation of the wedged prism of the scanner, we can adiabatically transport the position of an optical dipole trap (ODT) in one dimension over 7 mm within 22.5 ms. The 3 dB bandwidth of this beam scanner is 56 Hz, with an ODT waist of ( 21.9 +/- 0.4) mu m. During transportation, the waist size is constant, the variation in the optical power of the ODT is +/- 3.45%, and the ODT position perpendicular to the transportation is +/- 1.7% with respect to the confocal parameter of the ODT.
   Methods The refractive one- dimensional beam scanner consists of a rotatable wedge prism (optical wedge) and an electromotor [Fig. 1(b)]. The prism controlled by the electromotor to rotate around the z-axis deflects a collimated incident laser beam along the transverse direction (x-axis). In the movable ODT setup [Fig. 2(a)], an achromatic doublet focuses the collimated beam along the y-axis. As the prism is placed at the focal point of the lens, the prism rotation produces a displacement of the focused beam along the x direction. The beam waist is kept in the focal plane. The deflection angle of the laser is much smaller than the rotation angle of the prism ( motor) itself to make the accuracy of the beam deflection greater than that of the motor rotation. Additionally, when the scanner is adopted to transport cold atoms, as the refracted laser is insensitive to the vibration of the electromotor in the galvanometer, this setup configuration can greatly improve the spatial stability of the ODT. Furthermore, by designing the moving function of the electromotor driving voltage carefully, we can move the dipole trap (atoms) adiabatically over a long distance.
   Results and Discussions We construct a one-dimensional beam scanner system based on a refractive galvanometer, which is further manipulated as a movable ODT for transporting cold atoms over a long distance. By measuring the Bode diagram of the scanner, a 3 dB bandwidth of 56 Hz is obtained. During ODT transportation, the ODT waist is maintained at ( 21.9 +/- 0.4) mu m, and the variation in the ODT position in the y direction is +/- 48 mu m [Fig. 2(b)], which is +/- 1.7% of the confocal parameter. Meanwhile, we measure the variation in ODT power with respect to the prism rotation, and obtain a variation of +/- 3.5% in ODT power [ Fig. 2(c)]. To transport atoms over a long distance, we should consider the heating of the atoms in the optical trap during transportation. Therefore, we employ an adiabatic process to avoid heating the atoms. Then, a sine-type acceleration with respect to time in the transportation of the dipole trap is designed to meet adiabatic conditions. The ODT displacement and the deflection angle of the galvanometer are nonlinearly related, while the deflection angle of the prism is linearly related to the galvanometer motor voltage. We deduce the relations between the displacement and driving voltage, and by designing the time function of the electromotor driving voltage carefully, the adiabatic movement of the dipole trap is realized. The ODT can be moved more than 7 mm within 22.5 ms. The experimental results of the ODT trajectory are reasonably consistent with the expected trajectory (Fig. 3). Atoms can be transported over 5 mm within 30 ms, with atomic transfer efficiency exceeding 90% and a temperature change of less than 5 mu K. Furthermore, when the transportation duration is extended to 45 ms, the transfer efficiency reaches (99.6 +/- 4.6)%. By enhancing the motor's response, atoms can be adiabatically transported over 1 mm in 10 ms to yield atomic transfer efficiency of ( 94.3 +/- 3.6)% (Fig. 4).
   Conclusions We experimentally demonstrate a one- dimensional beam scanner based on a refractive galvanometer, which is compatible with laser beams with large spot size and low insertion loss. This scanner can be employed to transport cold atoms over a long distance or realize atom addressing. By adjusting the rotation of the wedged prism in the scanner, we can adiabatically move the ODT in one dimension over 7 mm within 22.5 ms. The 3 dB bandwidth of our beam scanner is 56 Hz. During the movement, the ODT waist is maintained at (21.9 +/- 0.4) mu m, the variation in the optical power of the ODT is +/- 3.45%, and the ODT position perpendicular to the moving direction is +/- 1.7% relative to the confocal parameter of the ODT. By utilizing this system, atoms can be transported over 5 mm within 30 ms, with atomic transfer efficiency exceeding 90% and a temperature change of less than 5 mu K. Furthermore, when the transportation duration is extended to 45 ms, the transfer efficiency reaches (99.6 +/- 4.6)%. By enhancing the motor's response, atoms can be adiabatically transported over 1 mm in 10 ms to achieve atomic transfer efficiency of (94.3 +/- 3.6)%. Compared to the dipole trap moving system using AOD, this method avoids the requirement for AOD to have a specific polarization for the incident light, providing a larger aperture for light, smaller optical losses, lower noise, and a constant dipole trap light frequency during the movement. In comparison with the reflective galvanometer system, this method exhibits smaller fluctuations in beam directionality, which is beneficial for the application in cold atom addressing experiments.

TI National natural science fund facilitating high-quality development of
   Earth System Models in China
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential tools for quantitatively depicting and predicting the evolution of various components and their interactions of the Earth system, including integrating human activities with the natural environment. These models seek to advance novel theories using leading-edge technologies. As the cornerstone of Earth Science, ESMs offer an indispensable, integrated platform and research tool that enhances the discipline, cultivating a profound comprehension and nuanced strategies to address global environmental challenges. To bolster ESMs' development in China, this contribution delves into a brief review of the historical development of ESMs. Finally, we discuss various funding initiatives by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) dedicated to ESMs and conclude with pertinent policy suggestions.
   ESMs have experienced three pivotal phases. The first phase, spanning the 1940s to the 1950s, was marked by groundbreaking work in atmospheric modeling and the advent of numerical weather prediction. The second phase, from the 1970s to 1990s, is known as the physical climate system model stage, with significant advancements in model components of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere. Since the millennium, ESMs have reached the third phase-The Earth System Model stage, which is characterized by the integration of biogeochemical cycles such as the carbon cycle, the refinement of spatial resolution to a global kilometer-scale and the incorporation of new elements like the near-space and lithosphere. Throughout all three stages, the success of ESMs has been contingent upon efficient and coordinated innovation.
   The emerging development trends of ESMs are further highlighted. Firstly, the increasing integration of human and social processes drives ESMs to better represent the dynamic interplay between the natural environment and human civilization. Secondly, as space exploration technologies continue to advance, planetary system models will become a new branch. Thirdly, innovations in algorithms and computational power, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence and quantum computing, are poised to accelerate the evolution of ESMs, enhancing their capabilities to unprecedented levels.
   The NSFC is instrumental in nurturing organized innovation within the realm of ESMs in China. Key initiatives by the NSFC include introducing the application codes of "D0511 Atmospheric Model Development" and "D0512 Earth System Model Development", launching a special fund for key theories and core technologies for coupling natural-social systems at multiple scales, and setting the priority funding area of "Earth System Numerical Prediction" in the Meteorological Joint Fund. Moreover, the NSFC has facilitated the establishment of a consortium of programs centered around Earthlab, China's first Earth system numerical simulation facility. By dissecting the underlying logic and management ideas behind these actions, this study elucidated the NSFC's forward-looking, strategic, and systematic funding layout for ESMs.
   Finally, policy suggestions for bolstering the expansion of ESMs in China have been deliberated: Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and nurturing groundbreaking innovation; unifying scientific and technological workforces to enhance resource sharing; adhering to the principles of talent development to refine selection metrics; and prioritizing international cooperation with an emphasis on fostering mutually beneficial and win-win scenarios.

TI Facile Strategies for Incorporating Chiroptical Activity into Organic
   Optoelectronic Devices
SO ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Chiral optoelectronics, which utilize the unique interactions between circularly polarized (CP) light and chiral materials, open up exciting possibilities in advanced technologies. These devices can detect, emit, or manipulate light with specific polarization, enabling applications in secure communication, sensing, and data processing. A key aspect of chiral optoelectronics is the ability to generate or detect optical and electrical signals by controlling or distinguishing CP light based on its polarization direction. This capability is rooted in the selective interaction of CP light with the stereogenic (non-superimposable) molecular geometry of chiral substances, wherein the polarization of CP light aligns with the intrinsic asymmetry of the material. Among the diverse chiral materials explored for this purpose, pi-conjugated molecules offer special advantages due to their tunable optoelectronic properties, efficient light-matter interactions, and cost-effective processability. Recent advancements in pi-conjugated molecule research have demonstrated their ability to generate strong chiroptical responses, thereby paving the way for compact and multifunctional device designs. Building on these unique advantages, pi-conjugated molecules have advanced organic electronics into rapidly evolving technological fields. The combination of chiral pi-conjugated molecules with organic electronics is anticipated to simplify the fabrication of chiroptical devices, thereby lowering technical barriers and accelerating progress in chiral optoelectronics.This Account introduces strategies for incorporating chiroptical activity into organic optoelectronic devices, focusing on two main approaches: direct incorporation of chiroptical activity into pi-conjugated polymer semiconductors and integration of chiral organic nanoarchitectures with conventional organic optoelectronic devices. In the first approach, we especially highlight simple methods to induce chiroptical activity in various achiral pi-conjugated polymers through the transfer of chirality from small chiral molecules. This hybrid approach effectively combines the excellent electrical properties and various optical transition properties of achiral polymers with the strong chiroptical activity of small molecules. Moreover, we address a fundamental challenge in achieving chiroptical transitions in planar pi-conjugated polymers, demonstrating the development of low-bandgap pi-conjugated polymers that exhibit both strong chiroptical activity and excellent electrical performance. Another approach, incorporating chiroptical activity into existing organic optoelectronic devices, which have already achieved significant performance advances, presents an effective strategy for high-performance chiral optoelectronics. For this purpose, we introduce the use of supramolecular assemblies of pi-conjugated molecules to impart chiroptical responses into high-performance optoelectronic systems, utilizing efficient charge transfer of photoexcited electrons in chiroptical supramolecular nanoarchitectures. Additionally, we explore the integration of organic chiral photonic structure into organic optoelectronic systems, which act as optical filters tailored for CP light. These architectures offer unique advantages, including easy processability and seamless compatibility with existing organic electronic platforms.
   By bridging concepts from chiral organic optoelectronic materials and advanced organic electronics, this work outlines actionable approaches for advancing chiral optoelectronic technologies. These strategies underscore the versatility of pi-conjugated molecules while also expanding the framework for next-generation applications. As the field of chiral optoelectronics evolves, integrating chiroptical functionalities into organic devices will facilitate transformative innovations in quantum computing, biosensing, and photonic encryption.

The considerable reduction in computational overhead positions our proposed scheme as a highly attractive option for resource-constrained environments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) terminals.Abstract Proxy re-signature enables transitive authentication of digital identities across different domains and has significant application value in areas such as digital rights management, cross-domain certificate validation, and distributed system access control. However, most existing proxy re-signature schemes, which are predominantly based on traditional public-key cryptosystems, face security vulnerabilities and certificate management bottlenecks. While identity-based schemes alleviate some issues, they introduce key escrow concerns. Certificateless schemes effectively resolve both certificate management and key escrow problems but remain vulnerable to quantum computing threats. To address these limitations, this paper constructs an efficient post-quantum certificateless proxy re-signature scheme based on algebraic lattices. Building upon algebraic lattice theory and leveraging the Dilithium algorithm, our scheme innovatively employs a lattice basis reduction-assisted parameter selection strategy to mitigate the potential algebraic attack vectors inherent in the NTRU lattice structure. This ensures the security and integrity of multi-party communication in quantum-threat environments. Furthermore, the scheme significantly reduces computational overhead and optimizes signature storage complexity through structured compression techniques, facilitating deployment on resource-constrained devices like Internet of Things (IoT) terminals.
   We formally prove the unforgeability of the scheme under the adaptive chosen-message attack model, with its security reducible to the hardness of the corresponding underlying lattice problems.

TI Research progress in quantum precision measurements based on linear and
   nonlinear interferometers
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum precision measurement is based on the basic principle of quantum mechanics by using theinteraction between light, atoms and magnetism to measure physical quantities, also known as precisionmeasurements based on microscopic particle systems and their quantum states. As an important means ofquantum precision measurement, interferometer precision measurement technology has great application valuein quantum communication. The linear interferometer measures the magnitude of the physical quantity byusing the phase change obtained from the measurements, but measurement accuracy is limited and unable tomeet the requirements of today's scientific problems for the precision measurement of some physical quantities.On this basis, nonlinear interferometer is able to take advantage of the quantum entangled state, that is, usingthe two light fields of quantum correlation characteristics to realize quantum enhanced precision measurement,thus greatly improving the measurement sensitivity, Therefore, the scope of application is wider, but thepreparation of quantum entangled states has many limitations in practical manipulation. With the maturity ofexperimental conditions and technology, how to use both of these interferometers to further improve themeasurement accuracy of the phase signal so as to break the limitation to shot noise, breaking the standardquantum limit and even approaching to the Heisenberg limit has become a frontier research topic . In thispaper, we introduce several methods to improve the accuracy of parameter evaluation in the measurementprocess by using linear (including an atomic/photon interferometer) and nonlinear interferometer to callquantum resources at different stages. High-precision measurement can be achieved by inputting non-classicalstates into the interferometer, such as compressed state, bi-fock state, and NOON state. And we also introducethe weak measurement developed for the direct observation of quantum states and its application to non-Hermitian systems, and the multiparameter measurement proposed to eliminate the accuracy balance betweenparameters. Compared with the first two measurement methods, weak measurement method is based on theweak value amplification principle of an indirect measurement. Measurements are performed virtually withoutperturbing the quantum system, which does not lead the wave function to collapse, the weak value of the realand virtual part have different physical significance, The combination of weak measurement theory and non-Hermitian system also further improves the measurement sensitivity. Multi-parameter measurement usesquantum entanglement, quantum control and other quantum resources to make the measurement progress reachthe Heisenberg limit, which is the current research hotspot in the field of precision measurement. Furthermore,we present a conjecture whether there will be multi-atomic mixing measurements based on atomic spin effectsor ultra-high sensitivity measurement instruments with precision of fT or even aT by using other particlesdetection. Finally, several measurement methods are analyzed and compared with each other, and thedevelopment prospect of quantum precision measurement is forecasted

TI Nanotechnology for Pain Management
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Introduction: In the context of the current opioid crisis, non-pharmacologic approaches to pain management have been considered important alternatives to the use of opioids or analgesics. Advancements in nano and quantum technology have led to the development of several nanotransporters, including nanoparticles, micelles, quantum dots, liposomes, nanofibers, and nano-scaffolds. These modes of nanotransporters have led to the development of new drug formulations. In pain medicine, new liposome formulations led to the development of DepoFoam (TM) introduced by Pacira Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Parsippany, NJ, USA). This formulation is the base of DepoDur (TM), which comprises a combination of liposomes and extended-release morphine, and Exparel (TM), which comprises a combination of liposomes and extended-release bupivacaine. In 2021, Heron Therapeutics (San Diego, CA, USA) created Zynrelef (TM), a mixture of bupivacaine and meloxicam. Advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of devices/patches containing millions of nanocapacitors. Data suggest that these nanotechnology-based devices/patches reduce acute and chronic pain. Methods: Google and PubMed searches were conducted to identify studies, case reports, and reviews of medical nanotechnology applications with a special focus on acute and chronic pain. This search was based on the use of keywords like nanotechnology, nano and quantum technology, nanoparticles, micelles, quantum dots, liposomes, nanofibers, nano-scaffolds, acute and chronic pain, and analgesics. This review focuses on the role of nanotechnology in acute and chronic pain. Results: (1) Nanotechnology-based transporters. DepoDur (TM), administered epidurally in 15, 20, or 25 mg single doses, has been demonstrated to produce significant analgesia lasting up to 48 h. Exparel (TM) is infiltrated at the surgical site at the recommended dose of 106 mg for bunionectomy, 266 mg for hemorrhoidectomy, 133 mg for shoulder surgery, and 266 mg for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Exparel (TM) is also approved for peripheral nerve blocks, including interscalene, sciatic at the popliteal fossa, and adductor canal blocks. The injection of Exparel (TM) is usually preceded by an injection of plain bupivacaine to initiate analgesia before bupivacaine is released in enough quantity from the depofoarm to be pharmacodynamically effective. Finally, Zynrelef (TM) is applied at the surgical site during closure. It was initially approved for open inguinal hernia, abdominal surgery requiring a small-to-medium incision, foot surgery, and TKA. (2) Nanotechnology-based devices/patches. Two studies support the use of nanocapacitor-based devices/patches for the management of acute and chronic pain. A randomized study conducted on patients undergoing unilateral primary total knee (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) provided insight into the potential value of nanocapacitor-based technology for the control of postoperative acute pain. The results were based on 2 studies, one observational and one randomized. The observational study was conducted in 128 patients experiencing chronic pain for at least one year. This study suggested that compared to baseline, the application of a nanocapacitor-based Kailo (TM) pain relief patch on the pain site for 30 days led to a time-dependent decrease in pain and analgesic use and an increase in well-being.
   The randomized study compared the effects of standard of care treatment to those of the same standard of care approach plus the use of two nanocapacitor-based device/patches (NeuroCuple (TM) device) placed in the recovery room and kept in place for three days. The study demonstrated that the use of the two NeuroCuple (TM) devices was associated with a 41% reduction in pain at rest and a 52% decrease in the number of opioid refills requested by patients over the first 30 days after discharge from the hospital. Discussion: For the management of pain, the use of nano-based technology has led to the development of nano transporters, especially focus on the use of liposome and nanocapacitors. The use of liposome led to the development of DepoDur (TM), bupivacaine Exparel (TM) and a mixture of bupivacaine and meloxicam (Zynrelef (TM)) and more recently lidocaine liposome formulation. In these cases, the technology is used to prolong the duration of action of drugs included in the preparation. Another indication of nanotechnology is the development of nanocapacitor device or patches. Although, data obtained with the use of nanocapacitors are still limited, evidence suggests that the use of nanocapacitors devices/patches may be interesting for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain, since the studies conducted with the NeuroCuple (TM) device and the based Kailo (TM) pain relief patch were not placebo-controlled, it is clear that additional placebo studies are required to confirm these preliminary results. Therefore, the development of a placebo devices/patches is necessary. Conclusions: Increasing evidence supports the concept that nanotechnology may represent a valuable tool as a drug transporter including liposomes and as a nanocapacitor-based device/patch to reduce or even eliminate the use of opioids in surgical patients. However, more studies are required to confirm this concept, especially with the use of nanotechnology incorporated in devices/patches.

TI Research progress of nonlinear optical properties of integrated
   two-dimensional materials
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Photonic platforms with excellent nonlinear optical characteristics are very important to improve the devices' performance parameters such as integration, modulation speeds and working bandwidths for all-optical signal processing. The traditional processing technology of photonic platforms based on silicon, silicon nitride and silicon oxide is mature, but the nonlinear function of these optical platforms is limited due to the characteristics of materials; Although two-dimensional (2D) materials possess excellent nonlinear optical properties, their nonlinear potentials cannot be fully utilized because of their atomic layer thickness. Integrating 2D materials with mature photonic platforms can significantly improve the interaction between light and matter, give full play to the potentials of 2D materials in the field of nonlinear optics, and improve the nonlinear optical performances of the integrated platforms on the basis of fully utilizing the mature processing technology of the photonic platforms. Based on the above ideas, starting from the basic principle of nonlinear optics (Section 2), this review combs the research progress of various nonlinear photonic platforms (resonators, metasurfaces, optical fibers, on-chip waveguides, etc.) heterogeneously integrated with 2D materials, realized by traditional transfer methods (Section 3) and emerging direct-growth methods (Section 4) in recent years, and the introduction is divided into second-order and third-order nonlinearity. Comparing with the transfer methods, the advantages of using direct-growth methods to realize the heterogeneous integration of 2D materials and photonic platforms for the study of nonlinear optics are expounded, and the technical difficulties to be overcome in preparing the actual devices are also pointed. In the future, we can try to grow 2D materials directly onto the surfaces of various cavities to study the enhancement of second-order nonlinearity; we can also try to grow 2D materials directly onto the on-chip waveguides or microrings to study the enhancement of third-order nonlinearity. Generally speaking, the research on integrated nonlinearity by directly growing 2D materials onto various photonic structures has aroused great interest of researchers in this field. As time goes on, breakthrough progress will be made in this field, and technical problems such as continuous growth of high-quality 2D materials onto photonic structures and wafer-level large-scale preparation will be broken through, further improving the performance parameters of chips and laying a good foundation for optical communication, signal processing, optical sensing, all-optical computing, quantum technology and so on.

TI Coupled Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB Electronic coupling and hence hybridization of atoms serves as the basis for the rich properties for the endless library of naturally occurring molecules. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) manifesting quantum strong confinement possess atomic-like characteristics with s and p electronic levels, which popularized the notion of CQDs as artificial atoms. Continuing this analogy, when two atoms are close enough to form a molecule so that their orbitals start overlapping, the orbitals energies start to split into bonding and antibonding states made out of hybridized orbitals. The same concept is also applicable for two fused core-shell nanocrystals in close proximity. Their band edge states, which dictate the emitted photon energy, start to hybridize, changing their electronic and optical properties. Thus, an exciting direction of "artificial molecules" emerges, leading to a multitude of possibilities for creating a library of new hybrid nanostructures with novel optoelectronic properties with relevance toward diverse applications including quantum technologies.
   The controlled separation and the barrier height between two adjacent quantum dots are key variables for dictating the magnitude of the coupling energy of the confined wave functions. In the past, coupled double quantum dot architectures prepared by molecular beam epitaxy revealed a coupling energy of few millielectron volts, which limits the applications to mostly cryogenic operation. The realization of artificial quantum molecules with sufficient coupling energy detectable at room temperature calls for the use of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystal building blocks. Moreover, the tunable surface chemistry widely opens the predesigned attachment strategies as well as the solution processing ability of the prepared artificial molecules, making the colloidal nanocrystals as an ideal candidate for this purpose. Despite several approaches that demonstrated enabling of the coupled structures, a general and reproducible method applicable to a broad range of colloidal quantum materials is needed for systematic tailoring of the coupling strength based on a dictated barrier
   This Account addresses the development of nanocrystal chemistry to create coupled colloidal quantum dot molecules and to study the controlled electronic coupling and their emergent properties. The simplest nanocrystal molecule, a homodimer formed from two core/shell nanocrystal monomers, in analogy to homonuclear diatomic molecules, serves as a model system. The shell material of the two CQDs is structurally fused, resulting in a continuous crystal. This lowers the potential energy barrier, enabling the hybridization of the electronic wave functions. The direct manifestation of the hybridization reflects on the band edge transition shifting toward lower energy and is dearly resolved at room temperature. The hybridization energy within the single homodimer molecule is strongly correlated with the extent of structural continuity, the delocalization of the exciton wave function, and the barrier thickness as calculated numerically. The hybridization impacts the emitted photon statistics manifesting faster radiative decay rate, photon bunching effect, and modified Auger recombination pathway compared to the monomer artificial atoms. Future perspectives for the nanocrystals chemistry paradigm are also highlighted.

TI Diamond Homoepitaxial Growth Technology toward Wafer Fabrication,
   Atomically Controlled Surfaces, and Low Resistivity
SO ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Strong covalent bonds provide diamond with superior properties such as higher thermal conductivity, electron/hole mobilities, and wider bandgap than those of other semiconductors. This makes diamonds promising for next-generation power devices, optoelectronics, quantum technologies, and sensors. However, there are still challenges in realizing practical diamond electronic applications. Key issues include controlling the microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) growth process to achieve a large size, smooth surfaces, and desired conductivity. Standard semiconductor processing techniques like polishing and ion implantation also need improvement for diamonds. This Account outlines three MPCVD growth technologies being investigated at Kanazawa University to address these challenges. First, growth rate enhancement technology was demonstrated for fabricating diamond wafers. By optimizing the reactor design, electric fields, gas composition, and substrate positioning, record high diamond CVD growth rates over 250 mu m/h were achieved without nitrogen addition while maintaining excellent crystal quality. Furthermore, nitrogen addition and optimized CVD growth conditions enabled higher growth rates up to 432 mu m/h. A 0.1 mm thick freestanding diamond plate was fabricated using the growth enhancement technology, exhibiting crystallinity comparable to high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) substrates and superior to commercial CVD substrates, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction measurements. Scaling up to larger areas remains a key challenge. Second, diamond surfaces were controlled at the atomic level by a growth mode adjustment. There are three main growth modes for homoepitaxial diamond (111): lateral growth, 2D island growth, and 3D growth. By precisely controlling growth parameters like methane concentration and misorientation direction/angle, the three different growth modes from lateral to 3D could be accessed on HPHT Ib (111) mesa substrates. The lateral growth mode was extended from micrometer mesa to millimeter substrate scales. It enabled atomically flat diamond surfaces over full substrates through optimized lateral growth conditions. Finally, the growth technique was expanded to impurity doping technology toward conductivity control. Heavily boron-doped diamond films ([B] > 10(20) cm(-3)) were grown at 30 mu m/h, about 5x faster than previous reports. Freestanding plates with controllable resistivity from 100 Omega cm (semiconductor) to 10(-2) Omega cm (metallic) were fabricated by varying the boron doping level. Delta-doped layers with alternating high and low boron concentrations were fabricated using a lateral growth mode. Atomically flat surface was maintained even with delta-doping layers. Delta doping enabled 12x higher carrier concentration and 7x higher mobility compared to uniform doping. Furthermore, lateral growth embedding within lightly nitrogen-doped layers demonstrated the precise 3D positioning of heavily boron-doped regions. By combining lateral growth mode control with modulated doping levels, deterministic doping for 3D device architecture fabrication became possible with optimized electronic properties while retaining atomically flat surfaces. Homoepitaxial growth technologies could help overcome current bottlenecks and enable the use of diamond in advanced electronic devices and applications.

TI Preservation of milk in liquid nitrogen during sample collection does
   not affect the RNA quality for RNA-seq analysis
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background Standard procedures for milk sample collection for transcriptome analysis use ice as preservation method, which can affect the RNA stability and requires immediate sample processing. These problems would be eased if the milk samples could be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This study describes the applicability of a new method for milk sample collection and subsequent RNA extraction from milk fat globules, determining whether the quality, integrity and quantity of the RNA extracts met the minimum requirements for downstream RNA-seq. Results The quality of the extracts measured by A(260/280) ratio and the Integrity and Quality (IQ) values obtained fulfilled the reference values of 1.9 - 2.1 (P1 < 0.05 and P2 < 0.05) and >= 9 (P < 0.05), respectively. However, the RNA Integrity Number (RIN), based on rRNA 18S and 28S analysis, was 3.59 (P > 0.05) and failed to meet the RIN >= 7 benchmark for RNA-seq (P > 0.05). Milk fat globules contain low molecular-weight RNA fragments and minimal 18S and 28S rRNA, suggesting low RIN values were inherent to sample type. Likewise, the RNA concentration from milk fat globules were generally low (120.43 +/- 22.27 ng/mu L, 102.87 +/- 15.64 ng/mu L and 109.43 +/- 22.69 ng/mu L, measured by Nanodrop, Qubit HS and QuanTI Ribogreen, respectively). Nevertheless, RNA-seq yielded 52.7 million paired-end reads per sample. The raw reads passed all quality control parameters having the same sequence-read lengths (151 bp), 100% base-coverage, 49% GC base content, and base quality scores of 36, enabling successful transcriptome profiling. Moreover, milk proteins were identified as the most abundant transcripts in MFG in the analysis of the most expressed genes, indicating that the sequenced reads would accurately reflect the transcriptome of this milk fraction. Conclusions Milk preservation in liquid nitrogen is a suitable sample collection method that overcomes the limitations of immediate sample processing required if ice is used. Thus, this procedure, together with the subsequent RNA isolation from milk fat globules and its sequencing by RNA-seq, would provide a practical and a non-invasive method for measuring the mammary epithelial cell transcriptome, improving the feasibility of conducting studies related to mammary gland and lactation physiology.

TI A systematic approach to the analysis of illicit drugs for DNA with an
   overview of the problems encountered
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
AB Due to the restricted nature of illicit drugs, it is difficult to conduct research surrounding the analysis of this drug material for any potential DNA in sufficient quantities acceptable for high numbers of replicates. Therefore, the current research available in peer reviewed journals thus far regarding analysing illicit drugs for DNA has been performed under varying experimental conditions, often using surrogate chemicals in place of illicit drugs. The data presented within this study originated from the analysis of genuine illicit drugs prepared both in controlled environments and those seized at the Australian border (and therefore from an uncontrolled environment) to determine if DNA can be obtained from this type of material. This study has been separated into three main parts (total n=114 samples): firstly, methamphetamine synthesised within a controlled environment was spiked with both saliva and trace DNA to determine the yield following DNA extraction; secondly, methamphetamine also synthesised in a controlled environment but on a larger scale was tested for the amount of DNA added incidentally throughout the synthesis, including the additional steps of recrystallising, homogenising and "cutting" the drug material to simulate preparation for distribution; and thirdly, the detection of human DNA within samples of cocaine and heroin seized at the Australian border. The DNA Fast Flow Microcon Device was utilised to concentrate all replicates from the same source into one combined extract to improve the DNA profiles for the samples where no DNA spiking occurred. Full STR profiles were successfully obtained from drug samples spiked with both saliva and trace DNA. Methamphetamine was present in the final DNA extracts and caused incompatibilities with the quantification of DNA using Qubit. The yields of DNA from drugs not spiked with DNA sources were much lower, resulting in 36 % of samples yielding alleles where all others did not. These results were not unexpected given these were realistic drug samples where the history of the drug material was unknown. This is the first study to obtain DNA profiles from genuine illicit drug material in both controlled and uncontrolled environments and indicates that the analysis of illicit drugs for DNA is an avenue worth pursuing to provide information which can in turn assist with disrupting the supply of these drugs. Given that DNA profiling is carried out worldwide using essentially the same systems as described within this study, the potential for impact is on a national and international scale.

TI Quantification of residual plasmid DNA and SV40 promoter-enhancer
   sequences in Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna modRNA COVID-19 vaccines from
   Ontario, Canada
SO AUTOIMMUNITY
AB For some of the COVID-19 vaccines, the drug substances released to market were manufactured differently than those used in clinical trials. Manufacturing nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) for commercial COVID-19 vaccines relies on RNA polymerase transcription of a plasmid DNA template. Previous studies identified high levels of plasmid DNA in vials of modRNA vaccines, suggesting that the removal of residual DNA template is problematic. Therefore, we quantified the DNA load in a limited number of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 modRNA vaccine vials using two independent methods. Total DNA and specific DNA targets were quantified by Qubit fluorometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), respectively on 32 vials representing 16 unique vaccine lots. RNase A treatment was used to assess the impact of RNA crosstalk in DNA fluorometry. A preliminary assessment of DNA fragment length and DNase I sensitivity were also performed. Total DNA ranged 371-1,548 ng/dose and 1,130-6,280 ng/dose in Pfizer and Moderna products, respectively. Specific DNA of multiple plasmid DNA targets ranged 0.22-7.28 ng/dose for Pfizer, and 0.01-0.78 ng/dose for Moderna. The SV40 promoter-enhancer-ori (0.25-23.72 ng/dose) was only detected in Pfizer vials. Oxford Nanopore sequencing of one vial found mean and maximum DNA fragment lengths of 214 bp and 3.5 kb, respectively. These data demonstrate the presence of 1.23 x 108 to 1.60 x 1011 plasmid DNA fragments per dose encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. Using fluorometry, total DNA in all vials tested exceeded the regulatory limit for residual DNA set by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Authorization (WHO) by 36-153-fold for Pfizer and 112-627-fold for Moderna after accounting for nonspecific binding to modRNA. When tested by qPCR, all Moderna vials were within the regulatory limit, but 2/6 Pfizer lots (3 vials) exceeded the regulatory limit for the SV40 promoter-enhancer-ori by 2-fold. The presence of the SV40 promoter-enhancer element in Pfizer vials raises significant safety concerns. This study emphasizes the importance of methodological considerations when quantifying residual plasmid DNA in modRNA products, considering increased LNP transfection efficiency, and cumulative dosing presents significant and unquantified risks to human health.

TI From Sampling to Sequencing: A Liquid Biopsy Pre-Analytic Workflow to
   Maximize Multi-Layer Genomic Information from a Single Tube
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary Liquid biopsies seek to isolate tumor derived genetic material that circulates in blood plasma or cerebrospinal fluid. The less-invasive character of liquid biopsies combined with the option for serial analyses bears enormous potential for treatment monitoring or surveillance. We aimed to establish robust sampling protocols and pre-analytical workflows to allow for site independent multi-layer liquid biopsy testing. For an optimal usage of precious material, we explored sample stabilization in various conservation tubes and describe a protocol for the parallel isolation of cell-free DNA and RNA. Quantification and quality control steps were optimized for minimal sample use with both high sensitivity and reproducibility. We provide detailed step-by-step information on how to i) choose the best-suited protocol and ii) implement this in the liquid biopsy workflow. We believe that our study has potential to increase comparability of liquid biopsy approaches to bring these one step closer to routine clinical application. Liquid biopsies hold great promise for the management of cancer. Reliable liquid biopsy data depend on stable and reproducible pre-analytical protocols that comply with quality measures, irrespective of the sampling and processing site. We established a workflow for plasma preservation, followed by processing, cell-free nucleic acid isolation, quantification, and enrichment of potentially tumor-derived cell-free DNA and RNA. Employing the same input material for a direct comparison of different kits and protocols allowed us to formulate unbiased recommendations for sample collection, storage, and processing. The presented workflow integrates the stabilization in Norgen, PAX, or Streck tubes and subsequent parallel isolation of cell-free DNA and RNA with NucleoSnap and NucleoSpin. Qubit, Bioanalyzer, and TapeStation quantification and quality control steps were optimized for minimal sample use and high sensitivity and reproducibility. We show the efficiency of the proposed workflow by successful droplet digital PCR amplification of both cell-free DNA and RNA and by detection of tumor-specific alterations in low-coverage whole-genome sequencing and DNA methylation profiling of plasma-derived cell-free DNA. For the first time, we demonstrated successful parallel extraction of cell-free DNA and RNA from plasma samples. This workflow paves the road towards multi-layer genomic analysis from one single liquid biopsy sample.

TI Expression of immune response genes in human corneal epithelial cells
   interacting with Aspergillus flavus conidia
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background Aspergillus flavus, one of the causative agents of human fungal keratitis, can be phagocytosed by human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells and the conidia containing phagosomes mature into phagolysosomes. But the immunological responses of human corneal epithelial cells interacting with A. flavus are not clear. In this study, we report the expression of immune response related genes of HCE cells exposed to A. flavus spores using targeted transcriptomics. Methods Human corneal epithelial cell line and primary cultures were grown in a six-well plate and used for coculture experiments. Internalization of the conidia was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy of the colocalized endosomal markers CD71 and LAMP1. Total RNA was isolated, and the quantity and quality of the isolated RNA were assessed using Qubit and Bioanalyzer. NanoString nCounter platform was used for the analysis of mRNA abundance using the Human Immunology panel. R-package and nSolver software were used for data analysis. KEGG and FunRich 3.1.3 tools were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes. Results Different morphotypes of conidia were observed after 6 h of coculture with human corneal epithelial cells and found to be internalized by epithelial cells. NanoString profiling showed more than 20 differentially expressed genes in immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line and more than ten differentially expressed genes in primary corneal epithelial cells. Distinct set of genes were altered in their expression in cell line and primary corneal epithelial cells. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that genes associated with TNF signaling, NF-KB signaling, and Th17 signaling were up-regulated, and genes associated with chemokine signaling and B cell receptor signaling were down regulated. FunRich pathway analysis showed that pathways such as CDC42 signaling, PI3K signaling, and Arf6 trafficking events were activated by the clinical isolates CI1123 and CI1698 in both type of cells. Conclusions Combining the transcript analysis data from cell lines and primary cultures, we showed the up regulation of immune defense genes in A. flavus infected cells. At the same time, chemokine signaling and B cell signaling pathways are downregulated. The variability in the expression levels in the immortalized cell line and the primary cultures is likely due to the variable epigenetic reprogramming in the immortalized cells and primary cultures in the absence of any changes in the genome. It highlights the importance of using both cell types in host-pathogen interaction studies.

TI Adiabatic elimination theory of multi-level system in spin-orbit coupled
   Bose-Einstein condensate
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In quantum optics, adiabatic elimination simplifies multi-level quantum system by eliminating the fast oscillatory degree of freedom and preserving the slow-varying dynamics, thus obtaining an efficient description of the system. Adiabatic elimination has important applications in quantum simulation and quantum precision measurement. For example, spin-orbit coupling has been realized in ultracold atoms by using three-level Raman coupling and adiabatic elimination. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical method and generalize the adiabatic elimination in three-level non-Hermitian systems and multi-level systems on the basis of standard elimination scheme. These can provide theoretical guidance for realizing the interdiscipline of non-Hermitian physics and spin-orbit coupling effects and their potential applications. We mainly discuss the influences of dissipative effect on the population dynamics of the system, the validity and accuracy of the adiabatic elimination theory under different parameters for both non-Hermitian and two types of five-level systems. Specifically, the dynamics satisfying the large detuning condition gives very accurate results for quite a long evolution time with the adiabatic elimination theory, but when the two-photon detuning delta and the Rabi frequency ohm gradually increase, leading to the violation of the large detuning condition ohm,-y, 8 MUCH LESS-THAN increment , the effective two-level model can no longer describe the fast-varying dynamics of the system even in a short evolution time. Thus the choice of system parameters affects the effectiveness of adiabatic elimination of the excited levels. In a non-Hermitian system, the population in the ground state oscillates with gain periodically at the beginning, while that in the ground state oscillates with loss and decreases with time, with the total population decreasing with oscillation. For long-time evolution the gain in the system causes the population to diverge, and the adiabatic elimination of the effective two-energy level system describes this behavior accurately. The effect of the non-Hermitian parameters on the dynamics of the system in the resonance case is manifested in the case that the total population remains conserved, while the total population tends to diverge for finite two-photon detuning. We find that with the increase of detuning, the divergence appears earlier and the total number of particles can be kept constant by choosing the ratio of gain to loss appropriately. This study provides a theoretical basis for state preparation and dynamical manipulation in dissipative multi-energy quantum systems.

TI Multi-transparent Window Phenomenon in Coupled Cavity Magnomechanical
   System
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective With the rapid developments in nanotechnology, cavity optomechanics has become an important research topic in quantum mechanics. Magnomechanical cavity systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Compared to the cavity optomechanical system, the cavity magnomechanical system exhibits many benefits such as high spin density, high cooperativity with microwave photons, and a very low damping rate. Therefore, this study provides a new platform for examining interactions between light and matter. This study analyzes the multi-transparent window phenomenon, fast- and slow-light effects, and precision measurements in a coupled cavity magnomechanical system. These results have potential applications in quantum information processing and high-precision measurements. MethodsIn this study, we commence with a coupled cavity magnomechanical system model. The hybrid cavity magnomechanical system consists of two yttrium iron garnet (YIG) balls located near the maximum magnetic field of the two resonant cavities, and a bias magnetic field is applied to the YIG balls in the z-direction of the two resonant cavities to excite the magnon mode and realize strong coupling with the cavity field. Mutual coupling exists between the optical fields of the two resonators, and the coupling strength is related to the distance between them. A weak probe laser beam epsilon p with frequency omega p is applied to the optical cavity a1. The total Hamiltonian of the coupled cavity-magnetic field can be obtained in a frame rotating at the frequency of the driving field. Based on the Heisenberg equation and input-output relationship, we can obtain the output field (epsilon out) expression and group delay (tau)expression of the system. Subsequently, the effects of various parameters on the optical response of the system are investigated. Results and DiscussionsWhen the coupling between two microwave cavities and magnon-phonon coupling are absent, there is only photon-magnon coupling between the cavity a1 and magnon m1. At this time, there is a magnon-induced transparency window in the absorption spectrum generated by the interaction between the magnon and optical cavity field. We introduce various coupling terms, and the absorption spectrum of the output field exhibits different numbers of transparent windows (Fig.2). The dispersion spectrum of the output field is plotted under the same conditions (Fig.3). Next, the influence of the coupling strength between the two microwave cavities on the transmission characteristics of the hybrid cavity magnomechanical system is examined. These results indicate that better transparency can be realized in the output field by adjusting the coupling strength using the coupling strength (Fig.4). The absorption peak heights and widths of the detection field absorption spectra are plotted as a function of the coupling strength (Fig.5). The results indicate that the absorption peak height of the detection field absorption spectrum is inversely proportional to the coupling strength (J) of the two microwave cavities, and the width is directly proportional to J. Therefore, the coupling strength J can be obtained by simply measuring the height and width of the absorption peak, which also indicates that the hybrid cavity magnomechanical system is an effective and accurate method for measuring the coupling strength J. We also investigate the effects of K1,K2,g2, and kappa a2 on the output field (Figs.6 and 7).
   The results show that g2 and kappa a2 only cause a change in the position of the absorption peak of the absorption spectrum and do not affect the position of the transparent window. Finally, the functions of the group delay (tau) with the normalized detection field detuning (delta omega b) are plotted for different J and kappa a2(Fig.6). There are upward peaks (slow-light effect) and downward valleys (fast-light effect) near delta=0.7 omega b and delta=1.3 omega b, and the peak value of the group delay tau decreases with an increase in cavity dissipation kappa a2 and increases with an increase in coupling strength J. Therefore, the conversion between fast- and slow-light effects can be realized by changing the dissipation and coupling strengths of the resonant cavity. Conclusions Based on the coupled cavity magnomechanical system, the phenomenon of multiple transparent windows and effect of slow-fast light are investigated. The output characteristics of the system are discussed using quantum optics theory and standard input-output relations. The results show that different numbers of transparent windows can be obtained by adjusting the system parameters,and better transparency can be realized. Simultaneously, a method for precisely measuring the interaction strength between the two cavities is proposed by measuring the height and width of the absorption peaks. Additionally, fast-slow light conversion can be achieved by adjusting the system parameters. This scheme has important guiding significance for research on precision measurements and quantum information processing.

TI Integrating quantum synchronization in future generation networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The advent of Beyond 5G (emerging 6G) technologies represents a significant step forward in telecommunications, offering unprecedented data speeds and connectivity. These advances enable a wide range of applications, from enhanced mobile broadband and the Internet of Things to ultra-reliable low-latency communication and the tactical Internet. Thus, having accurate and dependable time synchronization is of utmost importance and plays a critical role in ensuring that all processes function smoothly and effectively. However, existing standards, such as the precision time protocol, are unreliable due to jitters, datagram losses, and complexity. Increasing the synchronization error from the ideal tens of nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds is unacceptable in future-generation networks. This work provides a novel way to establish ultraprecise synchronization, which is critical for the growth of converged optical communication networks and the 6G era. We investigate quantum non-linear synchronization (QNS), which explores the interaction between the non-linear dynamics of atomic systems and dissipation to establish a stable limit-cycle state. In this process, atoms confined within optical resonators are subjected to potential fields, and their spatial motion is synchronized by achieving a stable, phase-locked configuration. By introducing photons into the optical resonators and precisely managing the dissipation effects, it is possible to synchronize multiple optical resonators (referred to as nodes), even in systems with more than three interconnected resonators containing non-linear atoms. To transcend the synchronization signal from the optical setup to communication networks, we propose a distinct mechanism that utilizes the exceptional precision of QNS in the optical lattice setup and frequency down-conversion using frequency combs. In addition, it is combined with electronic components such as analog-to-digital converters and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to create synchronized digital signals that are understandable to communication networks. Our method transforms optical pulses into precisely timed electrical signals that can be analyzed and used in sophisticated network systems. We demonstrated that QNS and dissipation can synchronize a tri-node clock network to the highest precision of thulium atom-based optical lattice clocks. Our work also highlights the practicality of these applications through MATLAB simulations, bridging theoretical principles and real-world solutions with current technology. In our simulations, we utilized an optical signal with a frequency of 263 THz, downconverted to a lower microwave frequency of 100 GHz to achieve subnanosecond-level synchronized signals. The down-converted signal was subjected to white noise and subsequently digitized. The digital signal was then simulated by sampling rate of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$f_s = 100$$\end{document} GHz or GSa/s (gigasample per second) and limiting the resolution to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$b = 8$$\end{document} bits. Finally, high-frequency noise was removed by implementing low-pass filtration using FPGAs.
   This study takes an essential step toward meeting the rising demands for rapid and efficient data transfer in the ever-evolving digital communications landscape, enabling faster and more reliable connectivity for future communication networks and the quantum Internet.

TI A quantum digital signature protocol with state preparation error
   tolerance
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The quantum digital signature (QDS) has attracted much attention as it ensures the nonrepudiation, unforgeability, and transferability of signature messages based on information -theoretic security. Amiri et al. (Phys. Rev. A 93 032325) proposed the first practical QDS protocol based on orthogonal coding, which has realized information -theoretic security and become the mainstream paradigm in QDS research. The procedure of QDS involves two essential stages, the one is the distribution stage, in which Alice -Bob and Alice -Charlie individually utilize the three -intensity decoy -state quantum key distribution protocol but without error correction or privacy amplification, namely, key -generation protocol, to generate correlated bit strings, the other is the messaging stage, in which Alice transmits signature messages to the two recipients. However, previous theoretical and experimental studies both overlooked the modulation errors that may be introduced in the state preparation process due to the imperfections in modulator devices. Under the traditional framework of GLLP analysis method, these errors will significantly reduce the actual signature rates. Therefore, we propose a state -preparation -error tolerant QDS and use parameter analysis to characterize the state preparation error to make the simulation analysis more realistic. In addition, we analyze the signature rates of the present scheme by using the three -intensity decoy -state method. Compared with previous QDS protocols, our protocol almost shows no performance degradation under practical state preparation errors and exhibits a maximum transmission distance around 180 km. Furthermore, state preparation errors do not have a significant influence on the bit error rate induced by normal communication between the legitimate users or the one produced by an eavesdropper. These results prove that the method proposed in this paper has excellent robustness against state preparation errors and it can achieve much higher signature rates and signature distances than other standard methods. Besides, signature rates are basically unchanged under different total pulse numbers, which shows that our protocol also has good robustness against the finite -size effect. Additionally, in the key generation process, our method is only required to prepare three quantum states, which will reduce the difficulty of experiment realizations. Furthermore, the proposed method can also be combined with the measurement -device -independent QDS protocol and the twin -field QDS protocol to further increase the security level of QDS protocol. Therefore, our work will provide an important reference value for realizing the practical application of QDS in the future.

TI Quantum non-local correlation testing of Werner state in non-Markovian
   environment
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Research on whether quantum states retain quantum non-local correlation properties after evolving in non-Markovian environments has significant applications in the field of quantum information. In this work, we investigate the density matrix of quantum states evolving with time in various non-Markovian environments. Specifically, we examine two types of non-Markovian phase damping environments, namely random telegraph (RT) noise environment and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise environment, and non-Markovian amplitude damping (AD) environment. By utilizing the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, a quantum non-local correlation testing of the Werner state after its evolution in these non-Markovian environments is conducted. The results show significant differences in the quantum non-local correlation testing results of the Werner state after evolving in different non-Markovian environments. Notably, the Werner state displays information backflow in the RT noise environment and the AD environment, resulting in periodic oscillations in its quantum non-local correlation testing. This suggests that under certain conditions, the quantum state can transition from a state without quantum non-local correlation back to a state with such a correlation as evolution time progresses. The results also show that the Werner state exhibits the information about backflow phenomena in RT noise environment and AD environment, leading to periodic oscillations in its quantum non-local correlation testing. Furthermore, these periods are inversely proportional to certain parameters, such as root(2 gamma/a)(2) - 1 and root(2 Gamma/gamma - (Gamma/gamma)(2). On the contrary, in the OU noise environment, no information about backflow is obtained, thereby leading the value of the quantum non-local correlation test to increase with evolution time increasing. In most of AD and OU noise environments, there exists a specific maximum evolution time gamma t(max) in which successful quantum non-local correlation testing can be conducted. This maximum evolution time gamma t(max) shows a nonlinear variation with fidelity increasing and an inverse variation with Gamma/gamma parameter increasing. In comparison, the maximum evolution time for successful quantum non-local correlation testing in the OU noise environment exceeds that in the AD environment under the same conditions, indicating that the AD environment exerts a more pronounced weakening effect on the quantum non-local correlation properties of the Werner state.

TI Enhanced nonlinear optical effects based on strong coupling between
   epsilon-near-zero mode and gap surface plasmons
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Optical nonlinear effect plays an important role in optical communication, optical detection, quantum information and other areas. However, it is constrained by the weakness of the nonlinear optical response of the common materials. The enhancement of the optical nonlinear response on a nanoscale becomes a critical challenge. Over the years, several ways to enhance the optical nonlinear effects have been suggested. In fact, these technologies can slightly enhance the optical nonlinear response. Recently, some research groups focused on the materials with vanished permittivity, which is called epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material, showing that it can exhibit large optical nonlinearity due to the field enhancement in the material of this type. However, the ENZ material only holds a large optical nonlinear response in a limited spectral range. In order to overcome this limitation, here in this paper we report the ENZ mode which is excited by the ITO film and strongly coupled to the gap surface plasmons excited by the metal-dielectric-metal structure. To acquire the nonlinear refractive index n2, we first calculate the ITO permittivity through the Drude-Lorentz model and find the wavelength of the ENZ material. Then we calculate the time-dependent electron temperature and lattice temperature of ITO by the two-temperature model. According to the elevated electron temperature, we can calculate the plasma frequency wp, and by taking it into the Drude-Lorentz model, we can obtain a new permittivity of ITO compared with the initial one. Finally, we can calculate the variation of the refractive index Delta n, and the nonlinear refractive index n(2) = Delta n/I-0. In this paper, our coupled structure exhibits a broadband (similar to 1000 nm bandwidth) enhancement of the nonlinear optical effect in the near-infrared spectrum, a maximum nonlinear refractive index n(2) as large as 3.02 cm(2).GW(-1), which is nearly 3 orders larger than the previously reported nonlinear refractive index of bare ITO film. As a result, it is possible to realize a dramatically large variation of nonlinear refractive index under a low-power optical field. It is expected to be used in the nano photonic devices such as optical storage, all-optical switches, etc.

TI A new method of isotope enrichment and separation: preferential
   embedding of heavier isotopes of Xe into amorphous solid water
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we examine a new method for isotope separation involving the embedding of atoms and molecules into ice. This method is based upon isotope dependent embedding, i.e. capture, in a cryogenic matrix which exhibits excellent single-pass enrichment as demonstrated successfully for selected isotopes of Xe. This is a totally new method that holds significant promise as a quite general method for enrichment and purification. It is based upon exploiting the energetic and momentum barriers that need to be overcome in order to embed a given isotope or isotopologue into the capture matrix, initially amorphous ice. From our previous experiments, we know that there is a strong dependence of the embedding probability with incident momentum. Using supersonic molecular beam techniques, we generated Xe atomic beams of controlled velocities, relatively narrow velocity distributions due to supersonic expansion, and with all of the entrained isotopes having identical velocities arising from the seeded molecular beam expansion. As we had postulated, the heavier isotope becomes preferentially absorbed, i.e., embedded, in the ice matrix. Herein we demonstrate the efficacy of this method by comparing the capture of Xe-134 and Xe-136 to the reference isotope, Xe-129. Enrichment of the heavier isotopes in the capture matrix was 1.2 for Xe-134 and 1.3 for Xe-136 greater than that expected for natural abundance. Note that enriched isotopic fractions can be collected from either the condensate or the reflected fraction depending on interest in either the heavier or lighter isotope, respectively. Cycling of these single-step enrichment events for all methods can lead to significantly higher levels of purification, and routes to scale-up can be realistically envisioned. This method holds significant promise to be quite general in applicability, including both atomic isotopes or molecular isotopologues across a wide range of particle masses spanning, essentially, the periodic table. This topic has profound implications and significant potential impact for a wide-variety of isotope-based technologies in the physical and biological sciences, medicine, advanced energy and energetic systems, including isotopically-purified materials that exhibit high-performance electronic and thermal characteristics, as well as isotopically purified spin-free materials for use in quantum information science platforms.

TI Dephasing by optical phonons in GaN defect single-photon emitters
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Single-photon defect emitters (SPEs), especially those with magnetically and optically addressable spin states, in technologically mature wide bandgap semiconductors are attractive for realizing integrated platforms for quantum applications. Broadening of the zero phonon line (ZPL) caused by dephasing in solid state SPEs limits the indistinguishability of the emitted photons. Dephasing also limits the use of defect states in quantum information processing, sensing, and metrology. In most defect emitters, such as those in SiC and diamond, interaction with low-energy acoustic phonons determines the temperature dependence of the dephasing rate and the resulting broadening of the ZPL with the temperature obeys a power law. GaN hosts bright and stable single-photon emitters in the 600-700 nm wavelength range with strong ZPLs even at room temperature. In this work, we study the temperature dependence of the ZPL spectra of GaN SPEs integrated with solid immersion lenses with the goal of understanding the relevant dephasing mechanisms. At temperatures below similar to 50 K, the ZPL lineshape is found to be Gaussian and the ZPL linewidth is temperature independent and dominated by spectral diffusion. Above similar to 50 K, the linewidth increases monotonically with the temperature and the lineshape evolves into a Lorentzian. Quite remarkably, the temperature dependence of the linewidth does not follow a power law. We propose a model in which dephasing caused by absorption/emission of optical phonons in an elastic Raman process determines the temperature dependence of the lineshape and the linewidth. Our model explains the temperature dependence of the ZPL linewidth and lineshape in the entire 10-270 K temperature range explored in this work. The similar to 19 meV optical phonon energy extracted by fitting the model to the data matches remarkably well the similar to 18 meV zone center energy of the lowest optical phonon band (E-2(low)) in GaN. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms responsible for linewidth broadening in GaN SPEs. Since a low energy optical phonon band (E-2(low)) is a feature of most group III-V nitrides with a wurtzite crystal structure, including hBN and AlN, we expect our proposed mechanism to play an important role in defect emitters in these materials as well.

TI Depiction of Hamiltonian PT-symmetry
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The theory of PT-symmetry describes the non-hermitian Hamiltonian with real energy levels, which means that the Hamiltonian H is invariant neither under parity operator P, nor under time reversal operator T, PTH = H. Whether the Hamiltonian is real and symmetric is not a necessary condition for ensuring the fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics: real energy levels and unitary time evolution. The theory of PT-symmetry plays a significant role in studying quantum physics and quantum information science, Researchers have paid much attention to how to describe PT-symmetry of Hamiltonian. In the paper, we define operator F according to the PT-symmetry theory and the normalized eigenfunction of Hamiltonian. Then we first describe the PT-symmetry of Hamiltonian in dimensionless cases after finding the features of commutator and anti-commutator of operator CPT and operator F. Furthermore, we find that this method can also quantify the PT-symmetry of Hamiltonian in dimensionless case. I(CPT, F) = ||[CPT, F]|| CPT represents the part of PT-symmetry broken, and J(CPT, F) = ||[CPT, F]|| CPT represents the part of PT-symmetry. If I(CPT, F) = ||[CPT, F]|| CPT = 0, Hamiltonian H is globally PT-symmetric. Once I(CPT, F) = ||[CPT, F]|| CPT not equal 0, Hamiltonian H is PT-symmetrically broken. In addition, we propose another method to describe PT-symmetry of Hamiltonian based on real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues of Hamiltonian, to judge whether the Hamiltonian is PT symmetric. ReF = 1/4||(CPTF+F)||CPT represents the sum of squares of real part of the eigenvalue E-n of Hamiltonian H, ImF = 1/4||(CPTF-F)||CPT is the sum of imaginary part of the eigenvalue E-n of a Hamiltonian H. If ImF = 0, Hamiltonian H is globally PT-symmetric. Once ImF not equal 0, Hamiltonian H is PT-symmetrically broken. ReF = 0 implies that Hamiltonian H is PT-asymmetric, but it is a sufficient condition, not necessary condition. The later is easier to realize in the experiment, but the studying conditions are tighter, and it further requires that CPT phi(n) (x) = phi(n) (x). If we only pay attention to whether PT-symmetry is broken, it is simpler to use the latter method. The former method is perhaps better to quantify the PT-symmetrically broken part and the part of local PT-symmetry.

TI Analysis of squeezed light source in band of alkali atomtransitions
   based on cascaded optical parametric amplifiers
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The squeezed light field in the band of alkali metal atomic transitions is an important quantum resource inthe field of quantum information and precision measurement. The wavelengths of atomic transition lines(760-860 nm) are relatively short. Limited by the gray-tracking effect of nonlinear crystals, the squeezing degreeof the squeezed light in this band generated by the optical parametric amplifiers is low. Now, the squeezing isabout 3-5 dB. Considering the problems in the experimental generation of the squeezed light at the wavelengthsof atomic transitions, the variation law of quantum noise of the light field output from the single opticalparametric amplifier with its physical parameters is studied theoretically, and the optimal physical parametersare obtained. To further improve the squeezing in the band of alkali metal atomic transitions, the cascadedoptical parametric amplifiers are considered. Based on the basic theory of the optical parametric amplifiers, thetheoretical model of the cascaded optical parametric amplifiers is constructed, in which the optical loss andphase noise of the cascaded optical loops are considered. Based on this, the quantum noise characteristics of thelight field output from the cascaded system versus the optical loss and phase noise are analyzed at thefrequencies of 2 MHz and 100 kHz, respectively. It is found that for the squeezing at 2 MHz, cascading 2 to 3optical parametric amplifiers can significantly improve the squeezing under the premise of the low optical pathloss and phase noise; for the squeezing in the low-frequency band, the enhancement of the squeezing for thecascaded system is quite weak. Under the current experimental parameters, the squeezing at 2 MHz of thesqueezed light on rubidium resonance can be improved from -5 dB to -7 dB by cascading another DOPA. Forthe squeezing at low frequency band, the cascaded system proves to be useless, and the efforts should be madeto reduce the technique noise in the low frequency band. Furthermore, the quantum limit and spectralcharacteristics of the squeezed light field output from the cascaded system are further explored. This study canprovide reference and guidance for the improvement in the squeezing degree of the band of atomic transitions

TI Shannon entropy of asymmetric rectangular multiple well with unequal
   width barrier
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We present the Shannon entropy of the Schrodinger equation with an asymmetric rectangular multiple well, in which the potential well width is equal but the barrier width is in an arithmetic sequence. When the confined potential is small, we notice that the wave function of the particle is distributed inside the entire interval, but its distribution is mainly confined inside the wells as the confined potential increases. For the higher excited state, we find that the magnitude inside the barrier is always bigger than that inside the well. However, in the double-well case the magnitude is the biggest in the leftmost second barrier for V-conf = 1000 meV, but it is in the rightmost barrier in the triple well case. For large confined potential, the momentum entropy density (MED) will be concentrated to the center of the total rectangular multiple well with the increasing confined potential. Likewise, we see that the momentum entropy densities of the ground, first and second excited states are overlapped in the triple well case, but they are all overlapped in the four well case. Particularly, in the double well case, the position entropy densities of ground state and 2nd excited state as well as the 1st and 3rd excited states occupy each well. In the triple well case, however, the position entropy densities of ground state and 2nd excited state occupy each one of three wells, but the 1st and 3rd excited states occupy one of four wells. The position entropy density (PED) of each state in four well case is distributed in each well of them as the confined potential is very large. When the number of wells increases, there exist some additional oscillations in the PED. For the higher excited state, the oscillator frequency of the PED increases inside the well but decreases inside the barrier as the confined potential depth increases. For the lower states, as the potential well depth increases the MED extends outward from the original central distribution, but the main distribution is concentrated to the center of the total system for the higher excited state. We also note that both the position entropy S-x and the momentum entropy S-p do not decrease or increase as the parameter V-conf increases, but their sum always satisfies the BBM inequality.

TI Solutions to the generalized Eshelby conjecture for anisotropic media:
   Proofs of the weak version and counter-examples to the high-order and
   the strong versions
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS
AB The Eshelby formalism for an inclusion in a solid is of significant theoretical and practical implications in mechanics and other fields of heterogeneous media. Eshelby's finding that a uniform eigenstrain prescribed in a solitary ellipsoidal inclusion in an infinite isotropic medium results in a uniform elastic strain field in the inclusion leads to the conjecture that the ellipsoid is the only inclusion that possesses the so-called Eshelby uniformity property. Previously, only the weak version of the conjecture has been proved for the isotropic medium, whereas the general validity of the conjecture for anisotropic media in three dimensions is yet to be explored. In this work, firstly, we present proofs of the weak version of the generalized Eshelby conjecture for anisotropic media that possess cubic, transversely isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic symmetries, which substantiates that only the ellipsoidal shape can transform all uniform eigenstrains into uniform elastic strain fields in a solitary inclusion in infinite media possessing these symmetries. Secondly, we prove that in these anisotropic media, there exist non-ellipsoidal inclusions that can transform particular polynomial eigenstrains of even degrees into polynomial elastic strain fields of the same even degrees in them. These results constitute counter-examples, in the strong sense, to the generalized high-order Eshelby conjecture (inverse problem of Eshelby's polynomial conservation theorem) for polynomial eigenstrains in both anisotropic media and the isotropic medium (quadratic eigenstrain only). In addition, we also show that there are counter-examples to the strong version of the generalized Eshelby conjecture for uniform eigenstrains in these anisotropic media. A sufficient condition for the existence of those counterexample inclusions is provided. These findings reveal striking richness of the uniformity between the eigenstrains and the correspondingly induced elastic strains in inclusions in anisotropic media beyond the canonical ellipsoidal inclusions. Since the strain fields in embedded and inherently anisotropic quantum dot crystals are effective tuning knobs of the quality of the emitted photons by the quantum dots, the results may have implications in the technology of quantum information, in addition to in mechanics and materials science.

TI Extracted Plasma Cell-Free DNA Concentrations Are Elevated in Colic
   Patients with Systemic Inflammation
SO VETERINARY SCIENCES
AB Simple Summary Colic is a common and potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal (GI) condition in horses. Colic cases can be challenging for veterinarians to determine the cause, recommend appropriate treatment, and predict outcome. Biomarkers are molecules that can be measured in body fluids and can assist clinicians with disease diagnosis and/or prognosis. In this study, we investigated a biomarker known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). This biomarker is released from cells when they are damaged, dying, or activated by inflammation. For this study, we measured the cfDNA in blood collected from horses with colic and compared cfDNA concentrations in groups of horses with different types of GI disease, different signs of inflammatory response, and survivors vs. non-survivors. We found that cfDNA was not different in comparisons of GI disease type or survival status, but cfDNA was elevated in colic patients that had evidence of systemic inflammation. Further research is needed to determine whether cfDNA is a clinically useful biomarker for colic in horses.Abstract Colic is a common and potentially life-threatening condition in horses; in many cases, it remains challenging for clinicians to determine the cause, appropriate treatment, and prognosis. One approach that could improve patient care and outcomes is identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a biomarker that shows promise for characterizing disease severity and predicting survival in humans with acute abdominal pain or requiring emergency abdominal surgery. In horses, we recently determined that extracted plasma cfDNA concentrations are elevated in colic patients compared to healthy controls. For this current study, we hypothesized that extracted plasma cfDNA concentrations would be significantly higher in horses with strangulating or inflammatory colic lesions, in colic patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and in non-survivors. Cell-free DNA concentrations were measured in extracted plasma samples using a compact, portable Qubit fluorometer. Colic patients that met published criteria for equine SIRS had significantly higher median extracted plasma cfDNA compared to non-SIRS colic patients. There were no significant differences in extracted plasma cfDNA concentrations between other groups of interest. Our data offer early evidence that extracted plasma cfDNA concentration may provide information about systemic inflammation in colic patients, and additional research is warranted to expand on these findings.

TI SARS-CoV-2 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data from clinical isolates
   from the East Texas Region of the United States
SO DATA IN BRIEF
AB The SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved throughout the pandemic and is likely to continue evolving into new variants. Some of these variants may affect functional properties, including infectivity, interactions with host immunity, and disease severity. And compromised vaccine efficacy is an emerging concern with every new viral variant. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as the tool of choice for discovering new variants and understanding the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Deciphering the SARS-CoV-2 genome has enabled epidemiological survivance and forecast of altered etiologically. Clinical presentations of the infection are influenced by comorbidities such as age, immune status, diabetes, and the infecting variant. Thus, clinical management and vaccine efficacy may differ for new variants. For example, some monoclonal antibody treatments are variant-specific, and some vaccines are less efficacious against the omicron and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, determining the local outbreaks and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOC) is one of the primary strategies for the pandemic's containment. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a gold standard for genomic surveillance and variant discovery, the assays are not approved for variant diagnosis for clinical decision-making. Advanta Genetics, Texas, USA, optimized Illumina COVID-seq protocol to reduce cost without compromising accuracy and validated the Illumina COVID-Seq assay as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) according to the guidelines prescribed by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The whole genome of the virus was sequenced in (n = 161) samples from the East Texas region using the Illumina MiniSeq (R) instrument and analyzed by using Illumina baseSpace (https://basespace.illumina.com) bioinformatics pipeline. Briefly, the library was prepared by using Illumina COVIDSeq research use only (RUO) kit, and the individual libraries were normalized using the DNA concentration measured by Qubit Flex Fluorometer, and the pooled libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiniSeq (R) Instrument. Illumina baseSpace application was used for sequencing QC, FASTQ generation, genome assembly, and identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This whole genome shotgun project (n = 161) has been deposited at GISAID. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Antiferromagnets studied by optical second harmonic generation
   characterization techniques
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Antiferromagnets have garnered significant attention due to their unique magnetic properties and promising application prospects in the fields of information storage, spintronics, and quantum computing. Unlike ferromagnetic materials, where the magnetic moments of adjacent atoms align parallel, antiferromagnetic materials exhibit an antiparallel alignment of adjacent spins. This results in a net magnetic moment of zero in an ideal case and a property that eliminates stray magnetic fields, offering advantages for high-density magnetic storage and spintronic devices. However, the lack of a nonzero net magnetic moment also makes the detecting and characterizing of the antiferromagnetic order exceptionally challenging using conventional techniques. The search for effective methods to probe the intricate properties of antiferromagnetic materials has thus become a critical topic of modern physics. Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing antiferromagnetic materials. As a nonlinear optical process, SHG involves two photons combining into one with twice the photon frequency, which is a phenomenon sensitive to asymmetry properties such as spatial inversion symmetry breaking. This sensitivity makes SHG ideal for studying small-scale or delicate materials, including thin films and two-dimensional (2D) systems, positioning it as a key method for investigating antiferromagnetic properties and dynamics. One primary application of SHG is characterizing spatial inversion symmetry breaking induced by antiferromagnetic order. Polarization-dependent SHG signals provide insights into both the material symmetry and the spin configurations. This is particularly useful for materials like chromium oxide and bismuth ferrite, which exhibit intricate antiferromagnetic structures. SHG also excels in probing spin dynamics and phase transitions. By tracking the variation of symmetry and spin structures during phase transitions, such as from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic, SHG can reveal the phase transition temperatures and mechanisms. Time-resolved SHG experiments can monitor ultrafast spin dynamics with femtosecond resolution, capturing real-time evolution under external perturbations. Another significant application is visualizing magnetic domain structures and magnetoelectric coupling effects. Conventional methods struggle to detect antiferromagnetic domains due to their zero net magnetic moment, but the sensitivity of SHG to local symmetry allows detailed antiferromagnetic domain imaging. For instance, SHG microscopy has mapped magnetic domains in bismuth ferrite thin films, revealing domain configurations and their responses to electric or magnetic fields-Insights crucial for optimizing multiferroic materials. The exploration of 2D antiferromagnetic materials, such as CrI3 and MnPS3, further underscores the versatility of SHG technology. These materials exhibit unique magnetic behaviors and strong spin- lattice coupling due to reduced dimensionality. SHG has identified their distinctive properties, including phase transitions and responses to external fields like magnetic and optical excitation. In summary, SHG technology offers a versatile and sensitive approach for studying antiferromagnetic materials. Due to its ability to probe spatial inversion symmetry breaking, spin dynamics, phase transitions, and magnetic domain structures, SHG has become an indispensable tool for unraveling the complexity of antiferromagnetic order.
   Future advancements in SHG experimental techniques, such as higher spatial and temporal resolution and the integration with complementary methods, are expected to further enrich its applications. As researchers continue uncovering the micro-mechanisms of antiferromagnetism, SHG will play a pivotal role in advancing both fundamental understanding and technological applications in this exciting field.

TI Mechanism of suppressing noise intensity of squeezed state enhancement
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB This research focuses on advanced noise suppression technologies for high-precision measurement systems, particularly addressing the limitations of classical noise reducing approaches. The noise level of laser sources is a crucial factor that directly affects the measurement sensitivity in applications such as gravitational wave detection and biomedical imaging. Classical feedback control technologies are effective but often encounter a bottleneck resulting from the classical noise suppression limits. To cope with these challenges, a novel method integrating quantum squeezed light with classical feedback control systems to reduce intensity noise is proposed in this work. By employing an amplitude-squeezed light field, a quantum-enhanced feedback control model is developed, thereby theoretically examining the influence of both the feedback loop gain and the degree of squeezing on the noise suppression performance. The results show that the injection of squeezed light significantly reduces the intensity noise, approaching the shot noise limit (SNL), thereby improving the system sensitivity beyond the classical noise reduction boundaries. Specifically, -10 dB squeezed state injection into the feedback system yields an additional noise suppression of approximately 8.97 dB, exceeding what is achievable using classical feedback alone. This demonstrates that the potential of the proposed method can enhance measurement precision close to the quantum noise limits without increasing the laser power. The analysis highlights the asymmetric noise suppression effects between the inner feedback loop and outer feedback loop. Although the outer loop benefits significantly from the squeezed light injection and achieves noise levels that are unattainable by classical feedback methods, the inner loop shows relatively minor improvements. This asymmetry is attributed to the inherent characteristics of quantum squeezing and the limitations of the feedback loop design. Further investigation into the individual noise components reveals that the primary contributors to the intensity noise include input noise, photodetector noise, and beam splitter-induced vacuum fluctuations. The injection of squeezed light effectively mitigates these vacuum fluctuations, which are typically a major noise source in high-precision laser systems. Theoretical research results show that the use of squeezed light in feedback control systems can effectively enhance noise suppression, equivalent to a nine fold increase in detected optical power, without the physical drawbacks of increasing laser power such as thermal noise. In conclusion, this study provides a theoretical validation of combining quantum squeezed states with classical feedback control to exceed classical noise suppression limits. The integration of a-10 dB squeezed state demonstrates a significant noise reduction, showing that this hybrid approach could revolutionize noise management in precision measurement applications. The results pave the way for further exploring quantum-enhanced control technologies in fields such as gravitational wave detection, quantum communication, and advanced optical sensing, providing a pathway for improving sensitivity and noise suppression without increasing additional power requirements.

TI Molecular Optomechanics Approach to Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB CONSPECTUS: Molecular vibrations constitute one of the smallest mechanical oscillators available for micro-/nanoengineering. The energy and strength of molecular oscillations depend delicately on the attached specific functional groups as well as on the chemical and physical environments. By exploiting the inelastic interaction of molecules with optical photons, Raman scattering can access the information contained in molecular vibrations. However, the low efficiency of the Raman process typically allows only for characterizing large numbers of molecules. To circumvent this limitation, plasmonic resonances supported by metallic nanostructures and nanocavities can be used because they localize and enhance light at optical frequencies, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), where the Raman signal is increased by many orders of magnitude. This enhancement enables few- or even single-molecule characterization. The coupling between a single molecular vibration and a plasmonic mode constitutes an example of an optomechanical interaction, analogous to that existing between cavity photons and mechanical vibrations. Optomechanical systems have been intensely studied because of their fundamental interest as well as their application in practical implementations of quantum technology and sensing. In this context, SERS brings cavity optomechanics down to the molecular scale and gives access to larger vibrational frequencies associated with molecular motion, offering new possibilities for novel optomechanical nanodevices. The molecular optomechanics description of SERS is recent, and its implications have only started to be explored. In this Account, we describe the current understanding and progress of this new description of SERS, focusing on our own contributions to the field. We first show that the quantum description of molecular optomechanics is fully consistent with standard classical and semiclassical models often used to describe SERS. Furthermore, we note that the molecular optomechanics framework naturally accounts for a rich variety of nonlinear effects in the SERS signal with increasing laser intensity. Furthermore, the molecular optomechanics framework provides a tool particularly suited to addressing novel effects of fundamental and practical interest in SERS, such as the emergence of collective phenomena involving many molecules or the modification of the effective losses and energy of the molecular vibrations due to the plasmon-vibration interaction. As compared to standard optomechanics, the plasmonic resonance often differs from a single Lorentzian mode and thus requires a more detailed description of its optical response. This quantum description of SERS also allows us to address the statistics of the Raman photons emitted, enabling the interpretation of two-color correlations of the emerging photons, with potential use in the generation of nonclassical states of light. Current SERS experimental implementations in organic molecules and two-dimensional layers suggest the interest in further exploring intense pulsed illumination, situations of strong coupling, resonant-SERS, and atomic-scale field confinement.

TI Follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates free radical generation without
   inducing substantial oxidative stress in human granulosa cells
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION OPEN
AB STUDY QUESTION Does FSH induce free radical generation with substantial oxidative damage in human cumulus granulosa cells (cGCs) and mural granulosa cells (mGCs)? SUMMARY ANSWER FSH of both physiological and supraphysiological concentrations induced free radical generation on subcellular levels, most notably in the mitochondria, while the elevated free radical load caused neglectable oxidative damage in both cGCs and mGCs. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY FSH is fundamental for regulation of granulosa cell (GC) function and oocyte maturation, during which a physiological level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential, while excessive amounts lead to oxidative damage. Potential adverse effects of high FSH doses on GCs may be mediated by ROS. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This prospective experimental study included patients who attended a reproductive medicine center in 2023. cGC and mGC were separately isolated and brought into culture on the day of oocyte retrieval, 36 h after ovulation induction with recombinant hCG (250 mg). Recombinant FSH, at different concentrations, mimicking physiological (6 mIU/ml) and supraphysiological (60 and 600 mIU/ml) conditions, was applied (n = 4 in each group). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women aged 20-35 years, undergoing ICSI with at least three follicles, were included. Quantum sensing of cGC and mGC free radicals, detected by either cytoplasm-located fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) or mitochondria-targeted FNDs, was tracked for 2 h following FSH treatment in a magnetometry setup. Mitochondrial function analysis, as well as oxidative damage to DNA/RNA, lipids, and proteins, upon FSH exposure, was examined. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE FSH-induced cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS increases in cGC and mGC (P < 0.01 in all concentrations after 2 h) while showing different patterns along time: cGC showed significantly larger cytoplasmic ROS change compared with mGC to physiological (P < 0.01) and supraphysiological (P < 0.05) concentrations of FSH. Significantly larger free radical changes were observed in the mitochondria compared to the cytoplasm in response to FSH (all concentrations in cGCs with P < 0.05; supraphysiological concentrations in mGCs with P < 0.05, P < 0.001, respectively) after 2 h. Mitochondrial basal respiration and ATP production were significantly increased upon FSH exposure to supraphysiological concentrations in both cGCs (P < 0.01) and mGCs (P < 0.05). However, no oxidative damage to GC DNA/RNA, proteins, or lipids was found upon FSH exposure at any concentration except elevated lipid peroxidation in the FSH group of 600 mIU/ml (P < 0.05). LARGE SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The GCs came from females of different biological backgrounds and were stimulated before oocyte and GC retrieval, thereby increasing the risk of variation. In addition, the effects of long-term FSH exposure as well as the effects of the FSH-induced ROS on the oocyte remain to be investigated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS We demonstrate that FSH of both physiological and supraphysiological concentrations induces free radical generation at subcellular levels, most notably in the mitochondria, while the elevated free radical load causes neglectable oxidative damage in both cGCs and mGCs. Our results suggest that the 'FSH Ootoxicity' hypothesis would not seem to be mediated by ROS in human GCs.

TI Fast protocols for charging a three-spin-chain quantum battery
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We derive fast protocols for charging a three-qubit Ising spin-chain quantum battery, using amplitude and phase control of the global transverse field. For weak coupling between the qubits in the chain, where the initial ground state of the system is the spin-down state, we find that the optimal strategy is to fix the control amplitude at its maximum value while properly varying the phase with time. For the strong coupling case, where the initial ground state is the one-excitation Dicke state \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\vert {W} \rangle$$\end{document}, we apply two related charging protocols. In the first approach we use a pulse-sequence derived numerically in the recent work (Stojanovi & cacute; and Nauth in Phys Rev A 108:012608, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.012608), composed of delta Bang pulses and intervals where the control is switched off. We call this method fast charging via subspace decomposition, since it involves identifying and manipulating effective two-level subsystems. Here we find analytically the characteristics of the pulses composing the sequence, which were calculated numerically in the above reference. In the second approach, we apply a similar pulse-sequence with delta Bang pulses and Off intervals, but with a carrier frequency which brings on resonance the initial \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\vert {W} \rangle$$\end{document} state and the target spin-up state of maximum energy. We call this method charging via resonant excitation. We calculate numerically the characteristics of the pulses in the sequence and find a shorter charging time compared to the non-resonant method inspired by the above reference. We also use numerical optimal control to solve the problem of full charging the quantum battery but for finite values of the control amplitude and find that, for some relatively large values of this bound, the optimal solution has similar structure with the sequence incorporating delta Bang pulses but longer duration, as expected. Although this study focuses on a three-spin chain, the proposed methodology can be also extended to larger spin-chains. The lowest and highest energy eigenstates need to be identified first, serving as the initial and target states. Then, optimal control can be exploited to find the amplitude and phase modulation of a field resonant to this transition, which maximize the stored energy in the battery for a given duration.

TI High-Complexity One-Pot Golden Gate Assembly
SO CURRENT PROTOCOLS
AB Golden Gate Assembly is a flexible method of DNA assembly and cloning that permits the joining of multiple fragments in a single reaction through predefined connections. The method depends on cutting DNA using a Type IIS restriction enzyme, which cuts outside its recognition site and therefore can generate overhangs of any sequence while separating the recognition site from the generated fragment. By choosing compatible fusion sites, Golden Gate permits the joining of multiple DNA fragments in a defined order in a single reaction. Conventionally, this method has been used to join five to eight fragments in a single assembly round, with yield and accuracy dropping off rapidly for more complex assemblies. Recently, we demonstrated the application of comprehensive measurements of ligation fidelity and bias data using data-optimized assembly design (DAD) to enable a high degree of assembly accuracy for very complex assemblies with the simultaneous joining of as many as 52 fragments in one reaction. Here, we describe methods for applying DAD principles and online tools to evaluate the fidelity of existing fusion site sets and assembly standards, selecting new optimal sets, and adding fusion sites to existing assemblies. We further describe the application of DAD to divide known sequences at optimal points, including designing one-pot assemblies of small genomes. Using the T7 bacteriophage genome as an example, we present a protocol that includes removal of native Type IIS sites (domestication) simultaneously with parts generation by PCR. Finally, we present recommended cycling protocols for assemblies of medium to high complexity (12-36 fragments), methods for producing high-quality parts, examples highlighting the importance of DNA purity and fragment stoichiometric balance for optimal assembly outcomes, and methods for assessing assembly success.

TI The outcome prediction method of football matches by the quantum neural
   network based on deep learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The precise prediction of football match outcomes holds significant value in the sports domain. However, traditional prediction methods are limited by data complexity and model capabilities, struggling to meet the demands for high accuracy. Quantum neural networks (QNNs) leverage the unique quantum properties of quantum bits (qubits) such as superposition and entanglement. They have enhanced information processing capabilities and potential pattern mining abilities when dealing with vast, high-dimensional, and complex football match data. This makes QNNs a superior choice compared to traditional neural networks and other advanced models for football match prediction. This study focuses on a deep learning (DL)-based QNN model, aiming to construct and optimize this model to analyze historical football match data for high-precision predictions of future match outcomes. Specifically, detailed match records from 2008 to 2022 of major European football leagues were obtained from the "European Football Database" public dataset on Kaggle. The data includes various factors such as match outcomes, team information, player stats, and match venues. The data are cleaned, standardized, and feature-engineered to meet the input requirements of neural network models. A multilayer perceptron model consisting of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer is designed and implemented. During the model training phase, gradient descent is used to optimize weight parameters, and quantum algorithms are integrated to continuously adjust network weights to minimize prediction errors. The model is trained, parameter tuning is completed, and performance is evaluated using the training, validation, and independent test sets. The model's effectiveness is measured using indicators such as F1 score, accuracy, and recall. The study results indicate that the optimized QNN model significantly outperforms other advanced models in prediction accuracy. The optimized QNN model has an improvement of more than 20.5% in precision, an enhancement of over 23.2% in recall, and an increase of over 22.3% and 21.8% in accuracy and F1 score. Additionally, the model predicts the championship probabilities for Spain, France, England, and the Netherlands in the European Championship as 31.72%, 27.61%, 22.58%, and 18.09%, respectively. This study innovatively applies the optimized QNN model to outcome prediction in football matches, validating its effectiveness in the sports prediction field. It provides new ideas and methods for football match outcome prediction while offering valuable references for developing prediction models for other sports events. By integrating public data with DL technology, this study lays the foundation for the practical application of sports data analysis and prediction models, holding significant theoretical and practical value. Furthermore, future research can further explore the integration of QNN models with mathematical analysis systems, expanding their application scenarios in the real world. For example, sports betting agencies are provided with more accurate risk assessments, assisting teams in formulating more scientific tactical strategies, and optimizing event organization arrangements, to fully leverage their potential value.

TI Electrical circuit simulation of nonreciprocal Aubry-Andre models
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The introduction of non-Hermiticity into traditional Hermitian quantum systems generalizes their basic notions and brings about many novel phenomena, e.g., the non-Hermitian skin effect that is exclusive to non-Hermitian systems, attracting enormous attention from almost all branches of physics. Contrary to the quantum platforms, classical systems have the advantages of low cost and mature techniques under room temperature. Among them, the classical electrical circuits are more flexible on simulating quantum tight-binding models in principle with any range of hopping under any boundary conditions in any dimension, and have become a powerful platform for the simulation of quantum matters. In this paper, by constructing an electrical circuit, we simulate by SPICE the static properties of a prototypical non-Hermitian model the nonreciprocal Aubry-Andre (AA) model that has the nonreciprocal hopping and on-site quasiperiodic potentials.
   The paper is organized as follows: Following the introduction, in Sec. II we review in detail the Laplacian formalism of electrical circuits and the mapping to the quantum tight-binding model. Then, in Sec. III, an electrical circuit is proposed with resistors, capacitors, inductors, and the negative impedance converters with current inversion (INICs), establishing a mapping between the circuit's Laplacian and the non-reciprocal AA model's Hamiltonian under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) or open boundary conditions (OBCs). Especially, the nonreciprocity, the key of this model, is realized by INICs. In Sec IV, based on the mapping, for the proposed circuit under PBCs, we reconstruct the circuit's Laplacian via SPICE by measuring voltage responses of an AC current input at each node. The complex spectrum and its winding number v can be calculated by the measured Laplacian, which are consistent with the theoretical prediction, showing v = +/- 1 for non-Hermitian topological regimes with complex eigenenergies and extended eigenstates, and v = 0 for topologically trivial regimes with real eigenenergies and localized eigenstates. In Sec V, for the circuit under OBCs, a similar method is used for measuring the node distribution of voltage response, which simulates the competition of non-Hermitian skin effects and the Anderson localization, depending on the strength of quasiperiodic potentials; the phase transition points also appear in the inverse participation ratios of voltage responses.
   During the design process, the parameters of auxiliary resistors and capacitors are evaluated for obtaining stable responses, because the complex eigenfrequecies of the circuits are inevitable under PBCs. Our detailed scheme can directly instruct further potential experiments, and the designing method of the electrical circuit is universal and can in principle be applied to the simulation for other quantum tight-binding models.

TI Co-Fiber Quantum- Classical Signal Transmission Technology for CVQKD
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective The co- fiber quantum-classical signal transmission technology is of great significance for the development of practical quantum secure communication networks. Quantum signals are interfered with the noise resulting from the nonlinear effects, such as Raman scattering (RS), four-wave mixing (FWM), and cross-phase modulation (XPM), of the classical signal in fiber channels. For the above reason, this paper constructs a simulation model for the secure key rate of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system based on co-fiber quantum-classical signal transmission. The paper focuses on analyzing the influences of the power of the classical light, channel spacing, and detection method on system noise and key rate. The results show that the FWM noise dominates the short- range transmission process, while the XPM noise is larger than both the RS noise and the FWM noise when the transmission range is longer than 10 km. The total system noise is positively correlated with the power of the classical light and inversely correlated with the spacing of wavelength division multiplexing channels. Under homodyne and heterodyne detection, the variations in the secure key rate with the transmission range exhibit a similar overall trend, although the homodyne detection method achieves a longer maximum transmission range. This paper can provide a reference for the optimal design of practical CVQKD systems based on co-fiber quantum- classical signal transmission.
   Methods Focusing on the CVQKD system, this paper builds a co-fiber quantum- classical signal transmission model integrating the RS, FWM, and XPM effects and simulates and analyzes the effects of the three nonlinear effects on system noise and key rate. The research status of co- fiber quantum- classical signal transmission and the focus of this paper are outlined; the simulation model is constructed, and the secure key rate of the CVQKD system, RS, FWM, XPM, and simulation parameter settings are presented; the properties of co-fiber quantum-classical signal transmission are expounded. This paper can provide theoretical support and a reference for co-fiber quantum-classical signal transmission of CVQKD systems in practical environments.
   Results and Discussions As shown in Fig. 2, the RS noise first increases and then decreases with the increase in the transmission range. The FWM noise exhibits an oscillating distribution as the range increases, and its maximum decreases gradually. The XPM noise increases with the range. When the transmission range is short, the FWM noise is dominant among the three noises. Otherwise, the XPM noise is larger than the RS noise and the FWM noise. In Fig. 3, the total system noise increases with the power of the classical light. As the transmission range increases, the maximum and minimum of the total noise gradually converge, and during long-range transmission, the total noise is approximately positively proportional to the power of the classical light. The differences in the maximum of the total noise under different power of the classical light are much larger in short-range transmission than in long- range transmission. Fig. 4 shows the variation in the total system noise with transmission distance under different channel spacings. The total noise decreases with the increase in channel frequency spacing, and with the increase in the range, the decreasing trend of the noise becomes obvious. The difference between the maximum and minimum of the total noise also decreases as the channel frequency spacing increases. Fig. 5 presents the change in the secure key rate of the CVQKD system with the transmission distance under different power of the classical light. The system's secure key rate gradually decreases with the increase in the transmission distance, and the secret key rate decreases rapidly when the transmission distance reaches a certain value, which is the longest transmission distance that the system can achieve under the corresponding condition. The secret key rate and the maximum transmission distance both decrease with the increase in the power of the classical light.
   Conclusions The RS noise first increases and then decreases with the increase in the transmission distance. The FWM noise is in an oscillating distribution as the range increases. The XPM noise is positively correlated with the transmission distance. When the transmission distance is short, the FWM noise dominates. In contrast, the XPM noise will be larger than both the RS noise and the FWM noise when the transmission distance is longer than 10 km. The total noise increases with the power of the classical light, and during long-range transmission, it is approximately positively proportional to the power of the classical light. Nevertheless, it decreases as the channel frequency spacing increases and decreases more rapidly as the distance increases. The system's secret key rate gradually decreases with the increase in the transmission distance. Large power of the classical light results in a lower secret key rate and a shorter maximum transmission distance that the system can achieve under the same distance. The secret key rate curves under different channel spacings are approximate during short-range transmission. As the transmission distance increases, the curves gradually separate, and the secret key rate and the maximum transmission distance both increase as the channel spacing increases. Under the two detection methods, the overall change trends of the secret key rate curves are close to each other. When the transmission distance is long, the homodyne detection can obtain a higher secret key rate, but the difference is not large. To sum up, the power of the classical light and channel spacing have a great influence on the noise and secret key rate of the system and should thus be selected properly in actual co-fiber classical- quantum signal transmission systems.

TI Multi-party quantum secret sharing protocol based on orthogonal product
   states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a cryptographic protocol that utilizes fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to securely distribute and reconstruct secret information among multiple participants. Most existing protocols rely on entangled states (such as Bell and GHZ states), but in practical applications. The preparation of entangled state is constrained by a short quantum coherence time, low state fidelity, etc., which makes it difficult to implement entangled resource-dependent QSS protocols. In this work, a novel practical and verifiable multi-party QSS protocol is proposed based on orthogonal product states, which are easier to prepare than entangled states. During the protocol preparation stage, the secret distributor first converts pre-shared classical secret information into the corresponding orthogonal product states according to the encoding rules, and pre-shares a communication key with participants via quantum key distribution (QKD), which is used to hide the initial quantum sequence information through subsequent particle transformation operations. After preparing the orthogonal product states, the distributor reorganizes the particles by position, extracting particles at the same position from each state to form new sequences, shuffling their order, then applying Hadamard operations using a pre-shared key, inserting decoy particles, and sending the sequences to the participants. After receiving it, participants conduct eavesdropping detection, use the same key for the inverse transformations, retain one particle from each sequence, and sequentially pass the remaining particles until the last participant receives a complete set, triggering state verification with the arbiter distributor. If the verification is successful, the particles will be returned to the first participant and the return stage will follow the same procedure. Only after both the transmission and return stage verifications have passed, will the distributor reveal the initial particle positions, allowing participants to collaboratively reconstruct the secret. In the protocol, the secret distributor acts as an arbitrator to verify the particle state information together with participants at designated points (the end of the transmission stage and the end of the return stage) in order to determine whether the particle-state information is error-free during transmission. If the verification fails at either stage, the protocol will be terminated immediately. Meanwhile, considering that the number of participants may change during the execution of the protocol, a dynamic scheme for personnel changes is designed to ensure the flexibility of the protocol. Through the analysis of possible internal and external attacks, It can be proven that our protocol can effectively resist the existing common attack. Using Qiskit simulation experiments, the core quantum procedures of the protocol can be successfully modeled. The experimental results provide strong computational validation of the theoretical feasibility of the protocol.

TI Secure real-time transmission of multi-spectral satellite images
   inducing a 6D hyper-chaotic system and BB84 QKD protocol
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB As the field of remote sensing advances quickly, the images from satellites are mostly utilized for different applications such as environmental monitoring, navigation, surveillance, etc. The most common approach to delivering security to the satellite images throughout the propagation from unauthorized access is by using image encryption techniques. Real-time images are challenging to process with conventional technologies because they include a diversity of information with significant prolixity, high correlation among neighboring pixels, and high uncertainty due to sensor noise and environmental conditions. Therefore, the present work focuses on the secured transmission of real-time satellite images with a high Signal-to-Noise ratio. In this work, we have developed a novel hybrid encryption method that combines a six-dimensional (6D) hyper-chaotic system with the BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol for secure and efficient image transmission. The hyper-chaotic system enhances pixel scrambling and diffusion, reducing correlations in the image data, while BB84 ensures secure key exchange during transmission over Free Space Optics (FSO) channels. The integration of a 6D hyper-chaotic system with BB84 QKD protocol is capable of transmitting multichannel information in a single secured channel. The proposed technique is corroborated using a set of satellite images, as satellite images possess highly correlated information. In the proposed model, the original satellite images are taken for Gunupur, Odisha during the period of November 22, 2023, to January 23, 2024. These images' information is confused by the hyper-chaotic system. Then, the permuted images are diffused to generate the scrambled image using the BB84 protocol. On the receiver side, the same information is recovered with reduced information loss using the proposed receiver module, which consists of an optical hard limiter followed by a low pass filter. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested via various quantitative assessments including entropy, mutual information, histogram, cross-correlation, and differential attack analysis. Performance metrics reveal robust security and high-quality reconstruction, achieving an entropy of 7.9976, a PSNR of 8.9967, and a BER of 0.1111 for the Pepper image. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates resilience against differential attacks, with a UACI of 34.6970 and an NPCR of 0.9973. The system is implemented using Optisystem 15.1 and MATLAB 2017a, and experimental results confirm superior performance compared to 22 existing techniques across various metrics, including entropy, mutual information, histogram analysis, and cross-correlation. This approach highlights the potential for secure real-time image transmission in optical networks while addressing challenges in satellite image encryption.

TI High-precision magnetic field locking system for cold atoms
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In ultracold atomic experiments, evaporative cooling is usually achieved by using Feshbach resonance magnetic fields on the order of Gauss to hundreds of Gausses. The frequency of resonant transition induced by the optical field or radiofrequency is directly affected by the stability of the quantum axis. For example, the phase between two linearly independent vectors of a qubit is affected by the magnetic field noise. Based on the Feshbach resonance technique, magnetic field regulation has become a basic tool to control the interaction between atoms. Narrow Feshbach resonance shows unique advantages in high-temperature superconducting, superfluidity, neutron star state simulation, etc. However, since its resonance width and Fermi energy can be compared with each other, the scattering characteristics are greatly disturbed by the magnetic field. Therefore, a stable and uniform magnetic field is a prerequisite for studying the narrow Feshbach resonances. In experiment, Helmholtz coils are usually used to provide the magnetic field for cold atomic gas, and the magnetic field noise is generally determined by the coil current noise and other magnetic field noises of the environment. However, there are relatively few researches of the high-precision control of large magnetic fields above hundreds of Gausses. With a larger coil current required, the coil current noise contributes more to the magnetic field noise, thus high-precision control of large magnetic fields is still challenging. In this paper, a magnetic field locking system is used to realize a 2.27 x 10(-6) level locking of the Feshbach magnetic field. A feedback locking system is used to achieve the stability by shunting the magnetic field coil current noise. Compared with the non-locked magnetic field, the low-frequency current noise is suppressed by more than 45 dB. To assess the stability of the actual magnetic field at the atoms, the Rabi oscillation is measured, the coherence time increases nearly 9.6 times, which effectively improves the stability of the ultracold atomic system. Furthermore, we measure the atom number fluctuation at the Gaussian inflection point of the loss spectrum under different Raman pulse widths to evaluate the noise of the magnetic field. Roman pulse duration up to a 24 tis is used to increase the sensitivity of atom number fluctuation in loss spectrum relative to magnetic field noise, of which the root mean square (RMS) noise is suppressed from 20.66 mGs to 1.2 mGs, a 16-fold reduction of the noise is obtained. Such a magnetic field locking system can provide an accurate and stable background magnetic field for ultracold atomic gases, which is of great significance for extending quantum storage time, precisely controlling atomic scattering, and simulating of condensed matter and other ultracold quantum gas in experiment.

TI Engineering quantum carbon dots unveiling quantum wave entanglement wave
   function on enamel substrate: A relativistic in-vitro study
SO DENTAL MATERIALS
AB Objectives: As artificial atoms, quantum dots are widely used in quantum information research since their individual energy levels may be precisely controlled using gate voltages. The purpose of the study was to modify carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and evaluate its effects on the structure, crystal orientation and mechanical properties of the enamel substrate along with antibacterial properties of CQDs. Materials and methods: Enamel specimens of 4 mm x 4 mm x 3 mm were cut and CQD solution was dialyzed in deionized water mixed with urea solution and placed in microwave system (800 W) to obtain *CQD(0.1 %)(-), **CQD(0.2 %)(-), ***CQD(0.3 %)(-), and *****CQD(0.5 %) for enamel blocks to be immersed for 2 weeks. X-ray diffraction analysis and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to determine degree of phase purity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for imaging of CQDs and treated enamel, with zeta potential measured with Zetasizer. Raman spectra was acquired with spectral range of 400-2000 cm(-1). Atomic force microscopy was performed with a peak force set at 200 nN. Lactobacillus biofilm was prepared on treated enamel substrates and analysed using confocal, scanning electron microscopy and TEM. Results: DFT calculations summarised improved lattice parameters of HAp***CQD(0.3 %)(-) and HAp***CQD(0.5 %)(-). Zeta potential is least for salineS and is maximum for *****CQD(0.5 %)(-) distributed system. The salineS, and *CQD(0.1 %)(-) groups had comparable v(1)PO(4)(3-) value, indicating consistent phosphate intensities. TEM successfully verified carbon dots as spherical. Enamel crystals aligned their c-axis perpendicular to the electron beam within 1 degrees with CQDs treated specimens exhibiting misoriented-crystals. *****CQD(0.5 %)(-) group had highest elastic modulus and nano hardness with maximum shear stress. Calculated bond length and angles using XRD show higher measures (p < 0.05) in all CQD groups. *****CQD(0.5 %)(-) exhibited a fibre texture pattern with an orientational distribution resembling an angle distortion. Most bacteria in the biofilms fluoresced red in CQD groups with no colony chain formations observed with *****CQD(0.5 %)(-) group. CQDs assemblies were observed to cause explosive lysis through loss of cell integrity. Conclusion: *****CQD(0.5 %)(-) modified enamel substrate displayed significant crystallite changes providing a novel option for fabrication of diverse functional CQDs aimed at modification of enamel tissue while possessing optimum antimicrobial properties.

TI Deciphering the doublet luminescence mechanism in neutral organic
   radicals: spin-exchange coupling, reversed-quartet mechanism,
   excited-state dynamics
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Neutral organic radical molecules have recently attracted considerable attention as promising luminescent and quantum-information materials. However, the presence of a radical often shortens their excited-state lifetime and results in fluorescence quenching due to enhanced intersystem crossing (EISC). Recently, an experimental report introduced an efficient luminescent radical molecule, tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl-carbazole-anthracene (TTM-1Cz-An). In this study, we systematically performed quantum theoretical calculations combined with the path integral approach to quantitatively calculate the excited-state dynamics processes and spectral characteristics. Our theoretical findings suggest that the sing-doublet D1 state, originating from the anthracene excited singlet state, is quickly converted to the doublet (trip-doublet) state via EISC, facilitated by a significant nonequivalence exchange interaction, with Delta JST = 0.174 cm-1. The formation of the quartet state (Q1, trip-quartet) was predominantly dependent on the exchange coupling 3/2JTR = 0.086 cm-1 between the triplet spin electrons of anthracene and the TTM-1Cz radical. Direct spin-orbit coupling ISC to the Q1 state was minimal due to the nearly identical spatial wavefunctions of the and Q1 levels. The effective occurrence of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from the Q1 to D1 state is a critical step in controlling the luminescence of TTM-1Cz-An. The calculated RISC rate kRISC, including the Herzberg-Teller effect, was 3.64 x 105 s-1 at 298 K, significantly exceeding the phosphorescence and nonradiative rates of the Q1 state, thus enabling the D1 repopulation. Subsequently, a strong electronic coupling of 37.4 meV was observed between the D1 and D2 states, along with a dense manifold of doublet states near the D1 state energy, resulting in a larger reverse internal conversion rate kRIC of 9.26 x 1010 s-1. Distributed to the D2 state, the obtained emission rate of kf = 2.98-3.18 x 107 s-1 was in quite good agreement with the experimental value of 1.28 x 107 s-1, and its temperature effect was not remarkable. Our study not only provides strong support for the experimental findings but also offers valuable insights for the molecular design of high-efficiency radical emitters.

TI Magnet-superconductor hybrid quantum systems: a materials platform for
   topological superconductivity
SO RIVISTA DEL NUOVO CIMENTO
AB Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems have recently emerged as one of the most significant developments in condensed matter physics. This has generated, in the last decade, a steadily rising interest in the understanding of their unique properties. They have been proposed as one of the most promising platforms for the establishment of topological superconductivity, which holds high potential for application in future quantum information technologies. Their emergent electronic properties stem from the exchange interaction between the magnetic moments and the superconducting condensate. Given the atomic-level origin of such interaction, it is of paramount importance to investigate new magnet-superconductor hybrids at the atomic scale. In this regard, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy are playing a crucial role in the race to unveil the fundamental origin of the unique properties of MSH systems, with the aim to discover new hybrid quantum materials capable of hosting topologically non-trivial unconventional superconducting phases. In particular, the combination of STM studies with tight-binding model calculations have represented, so far, the most successful approach to unveil and explain the emergent electronic properties of MSHs. The scope of this review is to offer a broad perspective on the field of MSHs from an atomic-level investigation point-of-view. The focus is on discussing the link between the magnetic ground state hosted by the hybrid system and the corresponding emergent superconducting phase. This is done for MSHs with both one-dimensional (atomic chains) and two-dimensional (atomic lattices and thin films) magnetic systems proximitized to conventional s-wave superconductors. We present a systematic categorization of the experimentally investigated systems with respect to defined experimentally accessible criteria to verify or falsify the presence of topological superconductivity and Majorana edge modes. The discussion will start with an introduction to the physics of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states at magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces. This will be used as a base for the discussion of magnetic atomic chains on superconductors, distinguishing between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear magnetic ground states. A similar approach will be used for the discussion of magnetic thin film islands on superconductors. Given the vast number of publications on the topic, we limit ourselves to discuss works which are most relevant to the search for topological superconductivity.

TI Spatially oriented correlated emission based on selective drive of
   diatomic superradiance states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, the radiative properties of atomic systems have been a hot topic in the research fields of quantum optics and quantum information. With the continuous development of nanophotonics, quantum antennas have become an important model for studying atomic radiation. In order to investigate these phenomena in depth, we investigate a system composed of two two-level atoms, and study the two-photon emission phenomenon of diatomic system under conditions of driving directional tunable laser field, interatomic dipole-dipole interaction, and spontaneous emission coherence.
   In this study, we diagonalize the atomic Hamiltonian to obtain the eigenvalues and entangled states of the system (symmetric and asymmetric states of two atoms), and use the rotating wave approximation to rotate the system into the laser frame. The evolution of the system is characterized mainly by the evolution of symmetric and asymmetric state, as well as the evolution of coherent terms. In our studies it is found that for identical atoms, certain laser directions and geometric configurations can exclusively drive the superradiant and subradiant states of atoms, which can enhance the first-order interference effect of the atoms and markedly increase the probability of two-photon emission in a specific detection direction. When the superradiant state of the atom is solely driven, there will be no coupling between the superradiant state and subradiant state, resulting in a correlation function angular distribution that is symmetric along the direction perpendicular to atomic axis. Further adjusting the laser direction causes the atomic interference patterns to shift, and the system will exhibit two-photon emission characteristics on one side or both sides.
   For nonidentical atomic systems, due to detuning between the two atoms, the laser cannot drive the superradiant state or subradiant state individually, and the influence of changing the laser direction on the coupling strength diminishes with the increase of detuning between the atoms. When the laser is in resonance with one of the atoms, due to the atomic interactions, the other atom can achieve the strongest coherent effect without resonating with the laser. This research reveals that atomic detuning is crucial for the correlation values and angular distribution of the correlation function. By adjusting the atomic detuning and laser direction, the system can display highly directed one-sided two-photon emission characteristics. However, different dissipation rates will lead the probability of two-photon emission to decrease. Our studies can achieve highly directional two-photon emission on one side or both sides, which provides a theoretical basis for studying the two-photon emission of nanoantennas.

TI Unraveling sources of emission heterogeneity in Silicon Vacancy color
   centers with cryo-cathodoluminescence microscopy
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Diamond color centers have proven to be versatile quantum emitters and exquisite sensors of stress, temperature, electric and magnetic fields, and biochemical processes. Among color centers, the silicon -vacancy (SiV-) defect exhibits high brightness, minimal phonon coupling, narrow optical linewidths, and high degrees of photon indistinguishability. Yet the creation of reliable and scalable SiV--based color centers has been hampered by heterogeneous emission, theorized to originate from surface imperfections, crystal lattice strain, defect symmetry, or other lattice impurities. Here, we advance high -resolution cryo-electron microscopy combined with cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to elucidate the structural sources of heterogeneity in SiV- emission from nanodiamond with sub-nanometer-scale resolution. Our diamond nanoparticles are grown directly on TEM membranes from molecular -level seedings, representing the natural formation conditions of color centers in diamond. We show that individual subcrystallites within a single nanodiamond exhibit distinct zero -phonon line (ZPL) energies and differences in brightness that can vary by 0.1 meV in energy and over 70% in brightness. These changes are correlated with the atomic -scale lattice structure. We find that ZPL blueshifts result from tensile strain, while ZPL red shifts are due to compressive strain. We also find that distinct crystallites host distinct densities of SiV- emitters and that grain boundaries impact SiV- emission significantly. Finally, we interrogate nanodiamonds as small as 40 nm in diameter and show that these diamonds exhibit no spatial change to their ZPL energy. Our work provides a foundation for atomic -scale structure -emission correlation, e.g., of single atomic defects in a range of quantum and two-dimensional materials. Significance Color centers are promising quantum optical sources for future quantum information systems. However, it remains unknown how their atomic crystalline structure influences their optical emission. Here, we utilize a unique light -coupled cryo-electron microscope, outfitted with spectrometers for cathodoluminescence, to unveil how atomic -scale crystalline structure influences quantum optical emission. We focus on silicon vacancies in diamond, which are among the most promising color centers for solid-state quantum optical systems. We find grain boundaries created during the diamond crystal growth create distinct pockets of silicon vacancy emission. The expansion of the diamond lattice across grain boundaries modifies the emission, with tensile strain leading to higher emission energy and increased brightness.These findings help inform optimal materials structure for future quantum sources.

TI Entanglement Order Parameters and Critical Behavior for Topological
   Phase Transitions and Beyond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Order parameters are key to our understanding of phases of matter. Not only do they allow one to classify phases, but they also enable the study of phase transitions through their critical exponents which identify the universal long-range physics underlying the transition. Topological phases are exotic quantum phases which are lacking the characterization in terms of order parameters. While probes have been developed to identify such phases, those probes are only qualitative, in that they take discrete values, and, thus, provide no means to study the scaling behavior in the vicinity of phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a unified framework based on variational tensor networks (infinite projected entangled pair states) for the quantitative study of both topological and conventional phase transitions through entanglement order parameters. To this end, we employ tensor networks with suitable physical and/or entanglement symmetries encoded and allow for order parameters detecting the behavior of any of those symmetries, both physical and entanglement ones. On the one hand, this gives rise to entanglement-based order parameters for topologically ordered phases. These topological order parameters allow one to quantitatively probe the behavior when going through topological phase transitions and, thus, to identify universal signatures of such transitions. We apply our framework to the study of the toric code model in different magnetic fields, which along some special lines maps to the (2 + 1) Ising model. Our method identifies 3D Ising critical exponents for the entire transition, consistent with those special cases and general belief. However, we, in addition, also find an unknown critical exponent beta* approximate to 0.021 for one of our topological order parameters. We take this-together with known dualities between the toric code and the Ising model-as a motivation to also apply our framework of entanglement order parameters to conventional phase transitions. There, it enables us to construct a novel type of disorder operator (or disorder parameter), which is nonzero in the disordered phase and measures the response of the wave function to a symmetry twist in the entanglement. We numerically evaluate this disorder operator for the (2 + 1) transverse field Ising model, where we again recover a critical exponent hitherto unknown in the (2 + 1) Ising model, beta* approximate to 0.024, consistent with the findings for the toric code. This shows that entanglement order parameters can provide additional means of characterizing the universal data both at topological and conventional phase transitions and altogether demonstrates the power of this framework to identify the universal data underlying the transition.

TI Many-body localization in the age of classical computing*
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase, in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time? This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. The last decades of research have brought an unprecedented new variety of tools and indicators to study the breakdown of ergodicity, ranging from spectral and wave function measures, matrix elements of observables, through quantities probing unitary quantum dynamics, to transport and quantum information measures. We give a comprehensive overview of these approaches and attempt to provide a unified understanding of their main features. We emphasize general trends towards ergodicity with increasing length and time scales, which exclude naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis, necessitate the use of more refined scaling procedures, and prevent unambiguous extrapolations of numerical results to the asymptotic limit. Providing a concise description of numerical methods for studying ETH and MBL, we explore various approaches to tackle the question of the MBL phase. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in quantities derived from eigenvalues and eigenvectors of disordered many-body systems. The drifts are related to continuous inching towards ergodicity and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede the understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength provides premises suggesting the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.

TI Preparation of continuously tunable orthogonal squeezed light filed
   corresponding to cesium D1 line
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The non-classical light resonance on the cesium D-1 (894.6 nm) line has important applications in solid-state quantum information networks due to its unique advantages. The cesium D-1 line has a simplified hyperfine structure and can be used to realize a light-atom interface. In our previous work, we demonstrated 2.8-dB quadrature squeezed vacuum light at cesium D-1 line in an optical parametric oscillator(OPO) with a periodically poled KTP(PPKTP) crystal. However, the squeezing level is relatively low, and the tunability that has practical significance for squeezed light has not been further investigated. Theoretically, the increase of the transmittance of output mirror and the decrease of the intra-cavity loss of the OPO can improve the squeezing level. Here, we use super-polished and optimal coating cavity mirrors to improve the nonlinear process in OPO. We prepare 447.3 nm blue light from 894.6 nm fundamental light by a second harmonic generation cavity (SHG). The SHG is a two-mirror standing-wave cavity with a PPKTP crystal as the nonlinear medium. The power of generated blue laser is 32 mW when the incident infrared power is 120 mW. Using the blue light to pump an OPO, we achieve quadrature squeezed vacuum light at cesium D-1 line. The OPO is a two-mirror standing-wave cavity with a PPKTP crystal. The threshold of OPO is reduced to 28 mW. The squeezing level of generated quadrature squeezed vacuum light is increased to 3.3 dB when the pump power is 15 mW. Taking into account the overall detection efficiency, the actual squeezing reaches 5.5 dB. We inject a weak signal beam into the OPO cavity to act as an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and test the tunability of squeezzed light. The blue light and the squeezed light are tuned by using a low-frequency triangular wave signal to scan the Ti: sapphire laser. Gradually increasing the amplitude of the scanning triangle wave signal, the generated bright squeezed light can be continuously tuned over a range around 80 MHz without losing the stability of the whole system. The generated squeezed light offers the possibility for the efficient coupling between the non-classical source and solid medium in the process of quantum interface.

TI Formation, identification, and regulation mechanisms of interlayer
   excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides heterostructures
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Interlayer excitons (IXs), formed in type-II van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures where electrons and holes reside in adjacent monolayers, have attracted increasing interest due to their spatially indirect nature, long lifetime, strong Coulomb binding, and unique out-of-plane dipole moment. These features make IXs a promising platform for exploring many-body physics and realizing next-generation excitonic devices. This review systematically presents the formation mechanisms, identification methods, and external modulation strategies of interlayer excitons in two-dimensional materials.<br /> First, we analye the prerequisites for the IX formation, emphasizing the role of band alignment, interlayer charge transfer, and momentum mismatch. Recent studies have also revealed that direct interlayer absorption is an alternative pathway for IX generation. For identification, we summarize multiple optical techniques, including photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE), transient absorption (TA), and electroabsorption (EA). These techniques can detect IX energy positions, binding energies, and recombination pathways. However, distinguishing interlayer excitons from defect-bound or momentum-indirect excitons remains challenging in experiment due to spectral overlap and measurement-dependent explanation. Then, we review five primary external modulation methods: electric field, strain, magnetic field, twist angle, and optical cavities. Electric fields can realize fast, reversible tuning of exciton energy levels, especially for excitons with large dipole moments. Strain provides nanoscale spatial control and can reshape local potential landscapes. Magnetic fields affect the spin-valley configurations and allow access to exciton polarization dynamics. Moire engineering via twist angles introduces periodic potential landscapes, yielding moire-trapped IXs and novel hybrid exciton-polaritons. Optical cavities enhance exciton radiative recombination via light-matter coupling and open up possibilities for strong coupling regimes. We further discuss additional strategies such as substrate-induced screening, dielectric environment, probe-induced local stress, and ferroelectric gating, all of which enrich the modulation toolbox.<br /> To facilitate cross-comparison, we present a comprehensive summary table comparing different modulation approaches in terms of tuning targets, dimensionality, efficiency, dynamic responsiveness, and implementation complexity.<br /> Finally, we discuss emerging applications of IXs in optoelectronic and quantum devices. Their tunable emission and long-lived nature make them suitable for exciton-based memory, logic, lasers, and reconfigurable photonic circuits. With the development of material synthesis, interface engineering, and hybrid integration, interlayer excitons are evolving from basic quasiparticles to programmable excitonic elements in chip-scale photonics and quantum information technologies.

TI Quantum counterfactuals based on weak measurement and interaction-free
   measurement
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Many counterfactual predictions are made by quantum theory, such as quantum tunneling and violations of Bell's inequalities. Experimental verifications of these predictions demonstrate that quantum theory is reliable for the microscopic world. Despite its widespread application, consistent theoretical interpretations of quantum theory remain a challenge. Recently, Aharonov et al. proposed several new and intriguing counterfactuals based on quantum weak measurement and interaction-free measurement, such as the quantum violation of the pigeonhole principle and the departure of physical properties from particles, also known as the quantum Cheshire cat effect. These counterfactuals garnered considerable interest. Although no common consensus has been reached, many pioneering experiments have already been conducted in light of these theoretical proposals. Furthermore, these counterfactuals and the key concepts underlying them, weak measurement and interaction-free measurement, open up a whole new way of thinking about and understanding the strange quantum theory.
   Herein, our aim is to provide a unified perspective on these counterfactuals. The theoretical ideas, particularly the fundamental quantum concepts underlying these counterfactuals, are the focus of our attention. First, we present concise and insightful introductions to weak measurement and interaction-free measurement, which are the two key fundamental constructions for discussing all of the following quantum counterfactuals. Next, we discuss the quantum violation of the pigeonhole principle in depth, explicitly demonstrating that the key idea leading to the violation is destructive quantum interference between the possible paths of two particles traveling along the same path. Then, two key proposals of the quantum Cheshire cat effect are examined based on weak values of certain physical properties. Both proposals are built around interaction-free measurement, and the departure of physical properties from their bodies is realized based on the quantum Zeno effect. After introducing the weak measurement and weak value, the non-locality in the quantum Cheshire cat effect can be dismissed, and the physical properties leave the body continuously with infinitesimal quantum amplitudes. Meanwhile, during the departure, the total property in the entire space remains invariant. Finally, we present our conclusion on quantum counterfactuals, arguing that when coherent processes are endowed with concrete physical properties, counterfactuals are unavoidable.
   Throughout our discussions, we try to elaborate on the key roles played by the quantum concepts, quantum amplitudes, and quantum coherence in these counterfactuals. The idea behind weak measurement and weak value is that information about a coherent process can be obtained with sufficiently weak coupling. In other words, a quantum coherent process becomes observable with a weak measurement and even acquires a specific property quantified by a weak value. When compared to our conventional understanding of quantum coherent processes, this is a mind-boggling viewpoint. The idea behind interaction-free measurement is that weak amplitudes can cause large system evolution even if they cannot transport the body of the system, which is also astonishing! This demonstrates the enormous power of infinitesimal quantum amplitudes in quantum communication and computation. Therefore, all quantum counterfactuals provide new perspectives to further investigate these fundamental quantum concepts.

TI Dynamics of quadratic phase controlled Hermite-Gaussian beams in
   fractional systems based on different variable coefficients and
   potentials
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beam has many potential advanced applications in optical communications, electron acceleration, nonlinear optics and bio-optical disease detection, owing to its distinctive mode and intensity distribution. The research on HG beam are significant in the development of optics, medicine and quantum technology. However, the controlling of the evolutions of HG beam with quadratic phase modulation QPM) in fractional systems under variable coefficients and potentials has been rarely studied. In this work, the propagation dynamic behaviors of the HG beam with QPM are investigated based on the fractional Schrodinger equation (FSE) under different variable coefficients and potentials by using a split-step Fourier algorithm. In the free space, the focusing spot of the beam becomes larger as the positive QPM coefficient increases or the Levy index decreases. The QPM coefficient has little effect on the focusing amplitude when the Levy index is 2. When the QPM coefficient is negative, the focusing of the beam disappears. Under the joint action of cosine modulations and QPM, the transmission of the beam oscillates not by the cosine law, but presents a large and a small breathing structure. The positive and the negative coefficient of QPM only alter the breathing sequence. The evolution period and width of the beam decrease as the modulation frequency increases. The trajectory of split beams turns into a parabolic shape under the linear modulation. In the joint influence of linear modulations and QPM, the HG beam exhibits either focusing or not focusing. Furthermore, the focusing position and focal plane of the beam decrease as the Levy index increases. When the Levy index is small, the beam keeps a straight-line transmission without distortion at a longer distance under the joint effect of the power function modulation and a positive QPM. The transmission of the beam also stabilizes and the beam width becomes larger with a negative QPM. Under a linear potential, the splitting of the HG beam disappears with the increase of the linear coefficient and shows a periodic evolution. The propagation trajectory of the beam shows a serrated pattern. By adding QPM, the beam is significantly amplified. Additionally, the evolution period of the beam is inversely proportional to the linear coefficient, and the transverse amplitude turns larger as the Levy index increases. The interference among beams is strong, but it also exhibits an autofocusdefocusing effect under the joint action of a parabolic potential and QPM. In addition, the positive coefficient and the negative coefficient of QPM only affect the focusing time of the beam. The frequency of focusing increases as the Levy index and parabolic coefficient rise. These features are important for applications in optical manipulations and optical focusing.

TI Refractive index measurement of nonpolar rarefied gas in quantum vacuum
   metrology standard
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the face of the historical change of international measurement system, the classical physics based physical standard corresponding to many measurement parameters develops toward "natural standard", namely quantum standard. In order to further improve the reproducibility and accuracy of vacuum value, the latest research uses quantum technology to realize the measurement and characterization of vacuum value. In this method, Fabry-Perot cavity is used to accurately measure the refractive index of the gas. The density can be calculated by the refractive index and inversed to obtain the corresponding vacuum value. The measurement of the gas refractive index is the key to the accuracy of the vacuum value. The macroscopic permittivity of nonpolar gases is related to the microscopic polarization parameters of atoms through quantum dynamics. In recent years, with the rapid development of ab initio theory and methods on the electromagnetic and thermodynamic properties of monatomic molecules, the calculation accuracy of relevant parameters was constantly improved, which can further reduce the measurement uncertainty of the above methods. In this paper, the theoretical value of helium refractive index is calculated accurately based on the first principle with known pressure and temperature. The relationship between gas pressure and refractive index is obtained, and the relative uncertainty of the theoretical value of refractive index is 6.27 x 10(-12). Then, the refractive index of helium in a range of 10(2)-10(5) Pa is measured by the vacuum measuring device which is based on Fabry-Perot cavity, and the uncertainty of measurement is 9.59 x 10(-8). Finally, the discrepancy between the theoretical and measured values of helium refractive index is compared and analyzed. It can be concluded that the the uncertainty of helium refractive index measurement originates from the deformation of the cavity caused by helium permeation. Therefore, solving the problem of helium permeation is the key to establishing a new vacuum standard. In this paper, the change of cavity length caused by helium penetration in the cavity is corrected. The refractive index coefficient is corrected at various pressure points in a vacuum range of 10(3)-10(5) Pa, and its pressure-dependent expression is obtained The variation of cavity length caused by gas pressure is further quantified. The relationship between the change of cavity caused by gas pressure and that caused by the refractive index is obtained. The correction parameter of cavity length is calculated to be 3.12 x 10(-2). In the future experiment of helium refractive index measurement by means of Fabry-Perot cavity, the refractive index correction coefficient at each pressure point given in this paper can be used to correct the refractive index measurement results, thereby eliminating the influence of helium penetration on the refractive index measurement, and obtaining the gas pressure with high accuracy.

TI Three-dimensional magneto-optical trapping model of CaH molecule based
   on multi-energy-level rate equation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of molecules is regarded as one of the state-of-the-art research fields in physics, which possesses broad applications in exploring fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model, quantum many-body physics, cold/ultracold chemistry and collision studies and so forth. Owing to the characteristic of highly diagonal Franck-Condon factors, lower saturation irradiance and larger scattering rate, the CaH molecule has been proposed as a promising candidate for laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping ever since 2004. Taking advantage of the multi-energy-level rate equation as well as the dual frequency effect, we evaluate the damping and trapping forces contained in the optical transitions of A(2)Pi(1/2) <- X-2 Sigma(+) and B-2 Sigma(+) <- X-2 Sigma(+), analyze the cooling and trapping performance for different laser polarization sets, power values and detunings of four laser components, and determine the variations in the damping and trapping forces due to an additional frequency component. It is discovered that if the laser polarization is set to be sigma(-)sigma(+)sigma(+)sigma(+)sigma(+), the detuning for the second laser component is Gamma while the detuning of other components are set to be -2 Gamma, and the laser power is set to be 150 mW, one can obtain a damping acceleration of 28000 m/s(2), and a trapping acceleration of 19000 m/s(2) for the transition of A(2)Pi(1/2) <- X-2 Sigma(+), both of which reach the optimal values under the current scope of the research and exhibit better performance than the CaF molecule. Our results, on one hand, not only offer an ideal method to comprehend the CaH MOT in theory but also help design the CaH MOT experiment or even achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of cold diatomic molecules. On the other hand, alkaline-earth-metal monohydrides (AEMHs) such as CaH, SrH and BaH are well-known for their permanent electric dipole moment, therefore these trapped diatomic molecules can be utilized to untangle the mechanism of dipole-dipole interaction, thus paving the way to realizing the molecular entanglement and quantum computing. More interestingly, current experimental systems for the non-zero measurement of the electron' s electric dipole moment (eEDM), including ThO, YbF and HfF+, still cannot be conducted simultaneously under the laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping technique while maintaining the ease of full polarization and internal co-magnetometry, all of which undoubtedly can increase the coherent measurement time and hence the statistical sensitivity, as well as the immunity to the systematic sensitivity. Previous studies reported that AEMHs share some similar characters with alkaline-earth-metal monofluorides (AEMFs) such as in electron correlation effects, however, the hyperfine energy level structures of AEMHs are relatively simpler than those of AEMFs, and AEMHs are prone to being polarized under the externally applied electric field. All of these lead to the trend that AEMHs may possess the dual character that it can be not only laser cooled and trapped in a MOT but also adopted as an candidate to measure the eEDM.
   Therefore, our work lays a substantial foundation for the theoretical and experimental study of SrH and BaH that inevitably will contribute to the exploration of the CP violation and new physics beyond the Standard Model on a scientific platform based on cold polar molecules, which is obviously different from large facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider.

TI First-principles modelling of the new generation of subnanometric metal
   clusters: Recent case studies
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The very recent development of highly selective techniques making possible the synthesis and experimental characterization of subnanometric (subnanometer-sized) metal clusters (even single atoms) is pushing our understanding far beyond the present knowledge in materials science, driving these clusters as a new generation of quantum materials at the lower bounds of nanotechnology. When the size of the metal cluster is reduced to a small number of atoms, the d-band of the metal splits into a subnanometric d-type molecular orbitals network in which all metal atoms are inter-connected, with the interconnections having the length of a chemical bond (1-2 A). These molecular characteristics are at the very core of the high stability and novel properties of the smallest metal clusters, with their integration into colloidal materials interacting with the environment having the potential to further boost their performance in applications such as luminescence, sensing, bioimaging, theranostics, energy conversion, catalysis, and photocatalysis. Through the presentation of very recent case studies, this Feature Article is aimed to illustrate how first-principles modelling, including methods beyond the state-of-the-art and an interplay with cutting-edge experiments, is helping to understand the special properties of these clusters at the most fundamental level. Moreover, it will be discussed how superfluid helium droplets can act both as nano-reactors and carriers to achieve the synthesis and surface deposition of metal clusters. This concept will be illustrated with the quantum simulation of the helium droplet-assisted soft-landing of a single Au atom onto a titanium dioxide (TiO2) surface. Next, it will be shown how the application of first principles methods have disclosed the fundamental reasons why subnanometric Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation, and capable of increasing and extending into the visible region the solar absorption of TiO2, of augmenting its efficiency for photo-catalysis beyond a factor of four, also considering the decomposition and photo-activation of CO2 as a prototypical (photo-) catalytic reaction. Finally, I will discuss how the modification of the same material with subnanometric Ag5 clusters has converted it into a "reporter" of a surface polaron property as well as a novel two-dimensional polaronic material.

TI Generation of High-Power Continuous-Wave Laser at 386 nm (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective All-solid-state lasers possess significant advantages such as high conversion efficiency, long service life, excellent stability, and compact structure, making them an ideal choice for achieving high-power, high-beam-quality laser output. In particular, continuous-wave lasers in the ultraviolet and deep-ultraviolet bands, characterized by their short wavelengths, high photon energy, and superior resolution, play an indispensable role in cutting-edge fields such as precision micromachining, semiconductor inspection, biomedical applications, spectral analysis, and quantum technologies. Currently, high-power continuous-wave ultraviolet lasers are primarily obtained through a two-stage nonlinear frequency conversion process: first converting infrared lasers to visible light via frequency doubling, followed by further frequency doubling or sum-frequency generation to produce ultraviolet light. This study innovatively designs an efficient 386 nm continuous-wave ultraviolet laser system based on impedance-matched external cavity frequency doubling technology. The system employs a 1547 nm fiber laser as the seed source, which is amplified and then sequentially frequency-doubled through periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) and LiB3O5 (LBO) crystals. By systematically investigating the loss characteristics of nonlinear crystals and precisely optimizing the resonant cavity parameters, we achieve highly efficient pump light coupling. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a conversion efficiency of 60.9% when converting 773 nm laser light to 386 nm ultraviolet light, with a maximum output power of 4.02 W. These performance metrics fully highlight the system's advantages in terms of power conversion efficiency and output stability, providing a reliable ultraviolet laser source for relevant application fields. Methods This research is based on all-solid-state laser technology and adopts a two-stage nonlinear frequency conversion scheme to achieve 386 nm ultraviolet laser output. In terms of system design, a 1547 nm narrow-linewidth fiber laser is selected as the seed source, and the power is increased to 20 W through a ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier. For the first-stage frequency doubling, a 50 mm-long PPLN crystal is used to achieve type-I phase matching at 61 degrees C, converting the 1547 nm laser into a 773 nm laser. The second-stage frequency doubling system adopts a four-mirror bow-tie ring resonator structure, consisting of two plane mirrors (M1, M2) and two concave mirrors with a radius of curvature of 30 mm (M3, M4). The key innovation points are as follows: First, based on the Boyd-Kleinman theory, the optimal length (10 mm) and beam waist radius (28.6 mu m) of the LBO crystal are determined through numerical calculation optimization, maximizing the focusing factor to 0.2125. Second, the nonlinear loss characteristics of the frequency doubling cavity under different pump powers are systematically studied, and it is found that when the transmittance of the input coupling mirror (1.8%) matches the intracavity linear loss (0.52%), the optimal impedance matching state can be achieved. Finally, the Hansch-Couillaud (H-C) cavity locking technology is adopted. An error detection system composed of a quarter-wave plate and a polarization beam splitter, combined with the feedback of a piezoelectric ceramic to adjust the cavity length, ensures the long-term stable operation of the resonator. Through precise temperature control (+/- 0.
   05 degrees C) and strict optical alignment of the entire system, problems such as the thermal lens effect and mode mismatch are effectively suppressed. Results and Discussions In this study, high-power 386 nm continuous ultraviolet laser output is achieved through systematic optimization. Based on the Boyd-Kleinman theory calculation, the optimal crystal length of LBO is determined to be 10 mm and the beam waist radius is 28.6 mu m (Fig. 1). The experimental setup adopts a three-stage system design, including key components such as a 1547 nm fiber laser, PPLN first harmonic generation, and a ring resonator second harmonic generation (Fig. 2). Power tests show that the 1547 nm pump power is basically consistent with the theoretical calculation for 773 nm. The maximum output power of the 773 nm laser is 7.1 W, and the first harmonic generation efficiency reaches 35.5% (Fig. 3). The experimental results show that when the input power of the 773 nm fundamental frequency light is 1.8-3.5 W, the input coupling mirror with a transmittance of 1.8% can not only achieve a maximum coupling efficiency of nearly 80% [Fig. 4(a)], but also optimize the output power of the 386 nm second harmonic light [Fig. 4(b)], indicating that this transmittance is the best choice under the current mode matching conditions. When the input power of the 773 nm laser increases from 0.08 W to 6.6 W, the total loss of the harmonic generation cavity increases from 2.32% to 3.71%. The linear loss at low power mainly comes from the transmission and scattering of the cavity mirror and the reflection of the crystal end face, while the increase in loss at higher power is mainly caused by the nonlinear absorption effect [Fig. 5(a)]. Under these conditions, an output of 4.02 W is obtained with an input of 6.6 W, and the conversion efficiency reaches 60.9% [Fig. 5(b)]. The H-C cavity locking technique is used to achieve precise control of the harmonic generation cavity. After locking, the signal fluctuation is less than +/- 0.1 V (Fig. 6). The long-term stability test of the system shows that the power fluctuation is less than 1.09% within 4 h (Fig. 7), verifying the reliability of the scheme. Conclusions This study develops a highly efficient 386 nm continuous-wave ultraviolet laser system based on all-solid-state laser technology. The system not only serves as a fundamental light source to generate 193 nm deep-ultraviolet lasers widely used in industrial applications but also holds significant value in atomic/molecular precision spectroscopy, biomedical research, and quantum information. The research adopts an innovative two-stage frequency-doubling scheme, using a 1547 nm fiber laser as the pump source. First, 7.1 W of 773 nm laser light is generated via single-pass frequency doubling in a PPLN crystal (first-stage conversion efficiency: 35.5%). This is then resonantly enhanced in a ring cavity and efficiently frequency-doubled again using an LBO crystal. Based on Boyd-Kleinman theory, the influence of focusing parameters on conversion efficiency is investigated, and the nonlinear loss characteristics of the frequency-doubling cavity under different pump powers are precisely calibrated (total loss increases from 2.32% at low power to 3.71% at 6.6 W). By optimizing the input coupler transmittance (optimal value: 1.8%), impedance matching under high pump intensity is achieved, resulting in a fundamental light coupling efficiency of 80%. Under 20 W of 1547 nm pump power, a final output of 4.
   02 W at 386 nm is obtained, with a second-stage frequency-doubling efficiency as high as 60.9%. The system features a compact structure and excellent stability (power fluctuation <1.09% over 4 h), not only meeting industrial demands for high-power ultraviolet lasers but also providing valuable insights into impedance-matching design for deep-ultraviolet laser development.

TI Review on Development and Application of Optical Wireless Communication
   Security Technology (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance The exponential growth of global data traffic has revealed fundamental limitations in traditional radio frequency (RF) communication, including spectrum scarcity, electromagnetic interference, and vulnerability to information leakage, which impede its capacity to meet 6G networks' demanding requirements for high speed, low latency, and reliable connectivity. Optical wireless communication (OWC), which utilizes light in visible, infrared, and ultraviolet bands as the transmission medium, emerges as a revolutionary solution, providing abundant spectrum resources, high data rates, and immunity to electromagnetic interference, among other benefits. However, despite its technological advantages, OWC encounters substantial security challenges including eavesdropping, signal interception, and channel disturbances at the physical layer that compromise its deployment in critical sectors such as military communications, satellite networks, and intelligent infrastructure. Addressing these security vulnerabilities is essential to realizing OWC's full potential and securing its position as a foundational technology for future intelligent communication systems. Progress OWC encompasses three core technical modalities designed for specific operational environments: free space optical (FSO) communication, visible light communication (VLC), and underwater wireless optical (UOWC) communication (Figs. 1-3). FSO systems employ near-infrared lasers to establish high throughput point-to-point links for long distance transmission, facilitating secure backhaul connectivity in urban networks, inter-satellite communications, and supporting communication requirements in emergency response scenarios (Fig. 1). Utilizing light emitting diodes operating in the 400 -800 THz spectral band, VLC provides dual functionality of illumination and data transmission, enabling innovations in smart home automation, industrial internet of things ecosystems, and secure indoor positioning systems (Fig. 2). UOWC employs the blue-green light window where water absorption is minimal to overcome the bandwidth limitations of underwater acoustic communication, supporting applications in marine sensor networks, offshore exploration, and naval tactical operations (Fig. 3). The security challenges confronting OWC manifest across interconnected dimensions: spatial eavesdropping emerges from beam divergence in FSO and the broadcast nature of VLC, enabling passive interception through receiver deployment or beam splitting. Channel induced vulnerabilities, such as atmospheric turbulence in FSO and underwater multipath fading in UOWC, compromise signal integrity and expand attack surfaces. Protocol level risks, including RF side channel sniffing in VLC and beam splitting attacks in FSO, challenge traditional encryption methods. To address these, physical layer security technologies have been developed: chaotic encryption employs nonlinear systems like Lorenz and R & ouml;ssler models to generate unpredictable signals (Fig. 4), resisting eavesdropping in VLC and FSO despite synchronization challenges from atmospheric turbulence. Beam control techniques, such as orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing, encode data into orthogonal spiral phase modes to complicate interception via mode specific decoding. In addition, optical fractal coding technology draws on the principles of fractal geometry and utilizes the self-similarity and recursiveness of fractal structures to efficiently compress and encrypt optical signals (Fig. 5).
   Quantum key distribution (QKD), based on the BB84 protocol, offers theoretically unbreakable key exchange via quantum mechanics but is limited by short transmission ranges and polarization decoherence (Fig. 6). Spread spectrum and optical code division multiple access enhance security through wideband spreading or orthogonal coding, though requiring high speed hardware and facing dynamic channel noise, while intelligent reflecting surfaces and artificial noise injection optimize signal phase and power in hybrid RF-FSO systems to boost legitimate links and degrade eavesdropper channels (Fig. 7). Adaptive enhancements, including dynamic power allocation and deep reinforcement learning, enable real time optimization of beam pointing and modulation, adapting to turbulent or underwater channel fluctuations, with anti- turbulence coding ensuring reliable transmission under varying conditions. Hybrid OWC architectures, such as RF-FSO links (Fig. 8) and satellite-air-ground integration, utilize complementary technologies to address single system limitations, enhancing reliability and security by dynamically switching between high speed FSO and robust RF links or forming resilient global networks (Fig. 9). Collaborative mechanisms, including multi-hop relay and hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access, optimize resource allocation and increase attack complexity through signal path diversification. In practical applications, unmanned aerial vehicle secure communication employs laser-VLC hybrid links with OAM multiplexing and quantum noise encryption to resist jamming during dynamic aerial ground data exchange (Fig. 10). Military tactical systems utilize narrow beam FSO with chaotic encryption to avoid electromagnetic interference, integrating high energy lasers for both communication and directed energy countermeasures (Fig. 11). Finally, civil applications include VLC for secure indoor networks in smart homes and healthcare, vehicle-to-everything networks based on VLC and hybrid links technologies, as well as UOWC for underwater sensor networks using blue-green light and adaptive optics to mitigate water scattering (Fig. 12). Conclusions and Prospects OWC has progressed significantly through physical layer innovations, hybrid system designs, and application specific security solutions, establishing a foundation for secure, high reliability communication. However, key challenges persist: QKD faces obstacles in long distance transmission and cost-effective hardware, chaotic encryption requires robust control in turbulent channels, and hybrid networks demand improved cross layer security optimization, particularly in complex scenarios like air-water cross domain communication. Future research should prioritize three key directions to advance OWC technology. First, the integration of quantum security technologies, including advanced QKD protocols and quantum-resistant encryption into OWC systems, is essential for achieving absolute confidentiality. This necessitates the development of low-power, high-efficiency QKD modules compatible with both terrestrial and space-based OWC architectures. Second, the implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks, particularly deep reinforcement learning for adaptive beamforming and neural network-based channel prediction, offers significant potential to enhance OWC resilience against dynamic eavesdropping and jamming threats. This approach enables real-time optimization of security parameters in response to environmental variations.
   Third, the expansion of OWC applications into emerging 6G and post 6G scenarios, such as ultra-reliable low-latency communication for autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, and distributed edge computing networks, requires interdisciplinary advancement across photonics, cryptography, and network engineering. Addressing these aspects will establish OWC as a foundation for next-generation networks, ensuring secure, efficient, and ubiquitous connectivity across terrestrial, aerial, and underwater domains, thus meeting the requirements of future intelligent systems.

TI Real-time locking of 1550 nm single-photon linear polarization state
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The key security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is guaranteed by the basic principle of quantum mechanics, which makes it possible to combine information theory security communication with one-time encryption. The key is usually encoded on the polarization dimension or phase dimension of a single-photon. It is considered that the birefringence effect of single-mode fiber leads to a random variation of polarization state, which would induce the bit error rate. So it is of great significance to keep the single-photon linear polarization state stable for both polarization encoding QKD system and phase encoding QKD system. By using the single-photon polarization modulation technology, the single-photon linear polarization state periodically varies with the external modulation signal. The flicker noise is suppressed effectively, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of single-photon counting is increased as indicated by the phase-sensitive detection with a lock-in amplifier (LIA). The error signal is generated by demodulating the modulated single photons and it is used to lock an arbitrary 1550 nm single-photon linear polarization state to the optical axis of in-line polarizer (ILP). The modulation frequency reaches up to 5 kHz, which can eliminate the influence of low frequency flicker noise. The LIA demodulates the single-photon pulses by using 78.1 Hz filter bandwidth, with a time constant of 1 ms and a filter slope of 24 dB. The SNR of error signal is 20. The zero-crossing point of error signal represents the single photon's linear polarization state aligned to the optical axis of ILP. The linear slope around the zero-crossing point for the polarization state angle versus the error signal amplitude is 1.267 rad/V. When the negative feedback loop does not work, the polarization drift of single-photon pulses is 0.082 rad due to the random environmental noise. However, by using the single-photon polarization modulation technology, the polarization drift of stable single-photon pulses is limited to 0.0011 rad within 2000 s through the precise control with a polarization rotator, and the corresponding Allan deviation reaches the minimal value of 6.7x10-5 at an integration time of 128 ms. The advantages for the single-photon polarization modulation technology are as follows: i) the linear polarization state drift is compensated in real-time at the single-photon level; ii) single frequency polarization modulation can be extended to multiple frequency polarization modulation in order to achieve simultaneous locking of multiple linear polarization states of single-photon pulses; iii) these 1550 nm single-photon pulses with the 0.0011 rad linear polarization state stability can be directly used as the single-photon source in either polarization encoding or phase encoding QKD system.

TI A P-I-N Structure Single-Photon Avalanche Diode Detector with Low Dark
   Count Rate
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Over the past few decades, single-photon detection technology has rapidly developed. Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors operating in Geiger mode have advantages such as high sensitivity, fast response speed, and strong capability for single-photon detection. As a result, they have been widely used in optical sensing fields such as quantum communication, lidar, and fluorescence lifetime imaging. SPAD arrays compatible with CMOS technology have gained significant attention due to their high integration and miniaturization. In laser radar applications, SPADs are employed to receive returning photons. However, optical signals are susceptible to environmental factors like dust and weather conditions. The received light intensity might be at the single-photon level, and high dark count noise can degrade device performance. Considering the potential harm of short-wavelength lasers to human eyes, the design of SPAD devices with low dark counts and high photon detection probabilities has become a hot research direction.
   Methods The SPAD (Fig. 1) employs a P-I-N diode structure, with the avalanche region located between the P-type drift region and the high-voltage N+ buried layer. The P epitaxial layer serves as the intrinsic region, with P-trap guard rings and virtual guard rings surrounding the P-doped region to mitigate the impact of shallow trench isolation on dark count rates (DCR). The proposed SPAD devices with GRW of 3, 4, 5 mu m are simulated based on 0.18 mu m BCD technology to study the impact of GRW on device performance [Fig. 2(a)]. Simulation results show that the device can only work normally at GRW of 5 mu m without a large edge electric field, and it will also cause the dark count to decrease. Figure 2(c) illustrates the 2D electric field distributions when STI extends into PW. Changing STI appropriately can hardly improve the electric field strength.
   Results and Discussions The I-Vc haracteristic of the SPAD is firstly measured which exhibits avalanche breakdown voltage at around 56 V [Fig. 3(c)], showing no difference to the TCAD simulation results (Fig. 2). DCR measurement results [Fig. 4(a)] show that the variation of DCR with V-ex is not obvious and this value is more dependent on temperature changes. the data demonstrates excellent performance of 0.56 s(-1)center dot mu m(-2) at 23 degrees C and 5 V excess bias voltage. The PDP measurements (Fig. 5) show that the peak PDP reaches 41.5% (600 nm) at V-ex=5 V. Moreover, due to the wide depletion layer, there is a higher response sensitivity for near-infrared photons (780-940 nm) and PDP at 905 nm is more than 6%.
   Conclusions We propose an additional P-type injection enhanced P-I-N structure SPAD based on the SMIC 180 nm BCD process. The test results show that at V-ex=5 V, the PDP peak of the SPAD reaches 41.5%, and the near-infrared PDP at the 905 nm wavelength is larger than 6%. At room temperature, it achieves a median DCR of 0.56 s(-1)center dot mu m(-2) and a very low afterpulsing probability <1.2% when quenched passively with a dead time of 14 mu s.

TI Entropy production and the generalised second law of black hole
   thermodynamics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The generalised second law of black hole thermodynamics states that the sum of a black hole's entropy and the entropy of all matter outside the black hole cannot decrease with time. The violation of the generalised second law via the process in which a distant observer extracts work by lowering a box arbitrarily close to the event horizon of a black hole has two profound ramifications: (1) that the entropy of the Universe can be decreased arbitrarily via this process; and (2) that it is not appropriate to apply the laws of thermodynamics to systems containing black holes. In this paper, we argue that for the generalised second law to not be violated, entropy must be produced during the lowering process. To demonstrate this, we begin by deriving an equation for the locally measured temperature of the vacuum state of an observer that is a finite distance from the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. Then, using this locally measured temperature and the Unruh effect, we derive an equation for the force required to hold this observer in a stationary position relative to a Schwarzschild black hole. These equations form a framework for calculating the change in black hole entropy as a result of the lowering process both in the case where the process is isentropic and in the case where entropy is produced during the lowering process. In the latter case, two requirements: (1) that the resultant change in black hole entropy is finite; and (2) that the resultant change in common entropy is finite, are used to identify two conditions that the form of an entropy production function must satisfy. These, in turn, are used to identify a set of possible functions describing the production of entropy. Using this set of functions, we demonstrate that the production of entropy limits the amount of work that the distant observer can extract from the lowering process. We find that this allows for the generalised second law to be preserved, provided that a coefficient in this set of functions satisfies a given bound. To conclude, we discuss two natural choices of this coefficient that allow for the generalised second law to be preserved in this lowering process. In addition to providing a resolution to this violation of the generalised second law, the framework presented in this paper can be applied to inform theories of gravity and quantum gravity on the form of their entropy relations, such that they do not violate the generalised second law.

TI Examining the quantum fisher information in the interaction of a dirac
   system with a squeezed generalized amplitude damping channel
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The inherent association between real quantum systems and their surrounding environment invariably results in decoherence, leading to the loss of entanglement. This diminution in entanglement coincides with a decline in the fidelity of transmitted information using the entangled quantum resource. This study scrutinizes the impact of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel on quantum Fisher information (QFI) parameters.

TI Light-driven Molecular Magnetic Switch for a Metallofullerene
SO ACTA CHIMICA SINICA
AB Metallofullerene Sc3C2@C-80 was synthesized by the arc-discharging method and isolated by multi-stage high performance liquid chromatography. Two Sc3C2@C-80 azobenzene nitroxide radical derivatives, compound I and II were synthesized through a Prato reaction, respectively. Usually, azobenzene undergoes trans-cis isomerization when irradiated with light tuned to an appropriate wavelength. The reverse cis-trans isomerization can be driven by light or occurs thermally in the dark. Thus, the compound I was excited by UV light, and it exhibited a strong absorption band decrease at around 340 nm and a slight increase at about 470 nm, which belonging to the pi ->pi* and n ->pi* transition respectively. Similar to the azobenzene molecule in solution, the typical change of the absorption spectrum of compound I can be ascribed to the trans-to-cis transition with UV light irradiation. Similarly, the reverse isomerization of UV-irradiated compound I with visible light (475 nm) resulted in an obvious pi ->pi* band increase, also indicating the reverse isomerization of compound I from cis-to-trans form. Besides, the structure and spin density distributions of compound I were calculated as well. It has two unpaired spins localizing on the Sc3C2@C-80 moiety and nitroxide radical. The magnetic property of metallofullerene can be manipulated by the spin interactions of the two spin centers. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals of the trans isomer of the compound I are almost independent of each other. After UV light irradiation, the distance of the two spin centers decreased to r=0.752 nm, and the strong spin-spin interaction weakened the EPR signals of Sc3C2@C-80. However, the decreased chain length between Sc3C2@C-80 and nitroxide radical would result in a weakened spin-lattice interaction, which increased the EPR signals of the nitroxide radical. Moreover, the UV-radiated compound I with visible light treated later for several minutes, and the EPR signals of Sc3C2@C-80 has a certain degree of recovery with visible light irradiation. Therefore, the compound I has sensitive and reversible spin variation with different light irradiation. The remote nitroxide radical group serves as a magnetic switch for the EPR signal of Sc3C2@C-80 through the photoisomerization properties of azobenzene bridge. The EPR signals of Sc3C2@C-80 moiety were decreased by the strong spin-spin interaction, and the EPR signals of Sc3C2@C-80 would be enhanced by larger space with visible light irradiation. Such magnetic switch for metallofullerenes has potential applications in quantum information processing and molecular devices.

TI Cryogenic Electron Microscopy on Strongly Correlated Quantum Materials
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB Quantum materials refers to a class of materials with exotic properties that arise from the quantum mechanical nature of their constituent electrons, exhibiting, for example, high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistivity, multiferroicity, and topological behavior. Quantum materials often have incompletely filled d- or f-electron shells with narrow energy bands, and the conduct of their electrons is strongly correlated. One distinct characteristic of the materials is that their electronic states are often spatially inhomogeneous and thus well suited for study using a spatially resolved electron beam with its great scattering power and sensitivity to atomic ionicity. Furthermore, most of these exotic properties only manifest at very low temperatures, posing a challenge to modern electron microscopy. It requires extraordinarily instrument stabilities at cryogenic temperatures with critical spatial, temporal, and energy resolutions in both static and dynamic manner to probe these materials. On the other hand, the ability to directly visualize the atomic, electronic and spin structures and inhomogeneities of quantum materials and correlate them to their functionalities creates enormous opportunities. At the most elementary levels of condensed matter physics, understanding the competing order of electron, spin, orbital, and lattice and their degrees of freedom, the impacts of defects and interfaces, and the site-specific quantum phenomena and phase transitions that give rise to the emergent behaviors allows us to discover and control novel materials for quantum information science and technologies.
   In this Account, several of our research examples are selected to highlight the use of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study strongly correlated quantum materials. We focus on the critical roles of heterogeneity, interfaces, defects, and disorder in crystal structure, magnetic structure, and electronic structure to understand the physical properties of the materials that cryo-EM enables. We show how electron crystallography coupled with Bragg diffraction and diffuse scattering analysis empowers us to reveal the nature of structural modulations, lattice distortion, and phonons and how quantitative electron diffraction can be used to map the distributions of the valence electrons that bond atoms together. We exploit transformative advances in imaging capabilities including the use of femtosecond laser and ultrafast electron diffraction to probe electron-lattice interactions and photoinduced transitions beyond equilibrium of matter. We review our Lorentz phase microscopy studies to illustrate the intriguing transformations among various topological chiral spin states under applied magnetic field at various cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that atomically resolved imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy at 10 K can be used to understand interface-enhanced superconductivity. The wide range of research and progress on quantum materials at low temperature reported here may inspire and attract more researchers in this ever-expanding field of cryo-EM.

TI Characterization of mode field distribution in optical Fabry-Perot
   cavity based on nanofiber
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The composite cavity optomechanical system combining optical Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavities, particles, and micro/nano mechanical oscillators is becoming more significant in the researches and applications of the fundamental physics, quantum information processing, and precision measurement. Characterizing the mode field distribution of optical F-P cavity is significant prior to the application of optical F-P cavity. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a method to measure the waist of an optical F-P cavity and to characterize the mode field distribution of the optical F-P cavity by using a nanofiber nondestructively. In experiment, a nanofiber is placed in the mode of the optical F-P cavity with a fineness of around 1500. The optical F-P cavity is composed of two mirrors each with high reflectivity of 99.8%. The radius of curvature of the each mirror is 50 mm. The cavity length is (80 +/- 4) mm. The nanofiber is fabricated from a single-mode fiber by the flame-brush method. The nanofiber diameter is around 440 nm. The transmission spectra of the optical F-P cavity are measured by scanning the cavity length. The free spectrum ranges and the inner cavity losses can be obtained from the transmission spectra. First, the influence of the nanofiber on the optical F-P cavity fineness is investigated. The fineness as a function of nanofiber position along the radial direction of the optical F-P cavity is measured. The fineness caused by the nanofiber decreases to a minimum value of about 240. Second, it is investigated that the optical F-P cavity inner loss caused by the nanofiber as a function of the nanofiber position along the radial direction of the optical F-P cavity when the nanofiber is placed at the waist of the optical F-P cavity. The inner loss of the optical F-P cavity caused by the nanofiber is related to the intensity distribution of the optical F-P cavity mode field, which is predicted theoretically. Thus, by making the Gaussian fitting of the optical F-P cavity inner loss as a function of the nanofiber position, we can obtain a waist radius of the optical F-P cavity to be (72 +/- 1) mu m. This is in good agreement with the theoretical calculation. Finally, the mode field distribution of the optical F-P cavity along the cavity axis is characterized. This method can be used for precisely controlling the coupling between the particles on the surface of nanofiber and optical F-P cavity. Besides, this method provides a good platform for studying the hybrid optomechanical system combining cavities, photons and quantum emitters.

TI Erbium-doped tellurium oxide ridge waveguides for optical amplification
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The rapid advancement of information technology has sparked an exponential demand for high-speed, large-capacity data transmission and processing. Traditional electronic communication systems face inherent limitations such as bandwidth constraints and electromagnetic interference, prompting people to shift toward photonic technologies. Integrated optical waveguides, as core components of on-chip photonic systems, enable efficient light confinement and manipulation at microscale dimensions, offering advantages in miniaturization, low power consumption, and high compatibility with existing optical communication infrastructure. Among these, erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers (EDWAs) have emerged as critical active devices for signal amplification in the 1550 nm communication band, leveraging the radiative transitions of Er3+ ions to achieve optical gain. Numerous studies have shown that the fluorescence performance of Er3+ is closely related to the factors such as doping method, preparation and annealing conditions. Besides, the performance of such amplifiers heavily relies on the choice of host materials, which must exhibit low optical loss, high rare-earth ion solubility, and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes. Tellurium dioxide (TeO2), with its high refractive index (2.1-2.4), broad transparency range (0.33-5 mu m), exceptional chemical stability, and low phonon energy, has shown significant promise as a superior alternative to traditional materials such as silicon nitride (Si3N4) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). This study focuses on the development of erbium-doped TeO2 (Er:TeO2) ridge waveguides for on-chip optical amplification. The Er:TeO2 thin films are deposited via radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering using high-purity Te and Er targets. The key deposition parameters, including Er2O3 target sputtering power (10-30 W), Ar/O2 gas flow ratio (1:1 to 5:1), and post-deposition annealing conditions (200-300 degrees C under oxygen atmosphere), are systematically optimized to improve photoluminescence properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence spectroscopy are employed to evaluate film morphology and emission characteristics. A bilayer waveguide structure is designed to mitigate surface roughness induced by direct etching of the Er-doped layer. The lower Er:TeO2 active layer (500 nm in thickness) and upper undoped TeO2 cladding layer (150 nm in thickness) are patterned by using ultraviolet lithography and plasma etching (O2/Ar/CHF3 gas mixture), achieving a ridge width of 2 mu m. Optical confinement and mode field distribution are simulated by using finite-difference eigenmode (FDE) analysis, confirming effective light-matter overlap within the Er-doped region. Experimental results reveal that the optimal Er:TeO2 film, deposited at an Er target power of 20 W and an Ar/O2 flow ratio of 5:1, and annealed at 250 degrees C for 10 hours, exhibits a photoluminescence intensity of 3.5 x 106 photon counts at 1545 nm-nearly two orders of magnitude higher than non-annealed samples. Oxygen annealing effectively activates Er3+ ions while passivating oxygen vacancies, which is critical for minimizing non-radiative recombination. Excessive Er doping (30 W in sputtering power) leads to ion clustering and fluorescence quenching, highlighting the importance of controlled dopant concentration. Surface morphology analysis via SEM and optical microscopy confirms smooth, crack-free films with minimal particulate contamination, which is essential for low-loss waveguide fabrication.
   Waveguide performance is characterized by using the cut-back method at 1310 nm, yielding a propagation loss of 0.607 dB/cm for a 0.5 cm-long device. However, a coupling loss of 6.34 dB/facet is observed due to rough end-faces from mechanical dicing, highlighting the need for post-fabrication polishing or anti-reflective coatings. Amplification tests at 1545 nm under 980 nm pumping demonstrate an internal gain of 7.2 dB/cm at a pump power of 88.45 mW, with gain saturation observed beyond 90 mW. The broadband emission spectrum (80 nm full-width at half-maximum) further validates Er:TeO2's potential for wideband amplification in the C-bands. In summary, this study elucidates the advantages of erbium-doped tellurium oxide (Er:TeO2) ridge waveguides as on-chip optical amplifiers, optimizes their deposition and annealing protocols, and designs a bilayer waveguide structure. The achieved low propagation loss and significant internal gain highlight the compatibility of materials with photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Future efforts will focus on improving the quality of waveguide endface, enhance pump efficiency, and scaling device lengths to achieve practical net gains for telecommunications and quantum photonic applications. These advancements render Er:TeO2 a cornerstone material for next-generation compact, high-performance photonic systems.

TI PD-L1 mRNA derived from tumor-educated platelets as a potential
   immunotherapy biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer
SO TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
AB Background: To date, the role of programmed death ligand-1 (PD -L1) messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from tumor -educated platelets (TEPs) has not been well investigated in patients with advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A few reports have examined whether mRNA in TEPs can predict the clinical responses of patients with advanced NSCLC following immunotherapy. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers to improve the clinical benefits and outcomes of NSCLC patients. Methods: Advanced NSCLC patients receiving a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, or immunotherapy alone as a first- or second -line treatment at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center were enrolled in this study. All the patients had wild -type epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase. The patients were enrolled in clinical trials for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, tremelimumab, and camrelizumab. Tumoral PD -L1 expression was tested by immunohistochemistry (PD -L1 22C3 pharmDx kit, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in archived tissue samples, when available, to calculate the tumor proportion scores (TPSs). RNA and exosomal RNA of blood were isolated before immunotherapy using the Yunying RNA extraction kit (Yunying Medicine, Shanghai, China). The concentration and quality of the RNA was determined using a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Finally, we analyzed the predictive value of TEP-derived PD -L1 mRNA expression and association with the level of the tumoral PD -L1 expression. Results: In total, 72 patients were enrolled in this study. Most of the patients were male (n=54, 75.0%), had adenocarcinoma (n=49, 68.1%). We found there was no significant correlation between the TEP-derived mRNA of PD -L1 and tumoral PD -L1 expression based on the results of the Pearson Correlation test (r=-0.19, P=0.233). Based on the median of PD -L1 mRNA, 72 patients were divided into a high PD -L1 group and a low PD -L1 group. We found that 19 patients (44.4%) responded to immunotherapy [partial response or progression -free survival (PFS) >6 months] in the high PD -L1 group, but only five patients (13.9%) responded to immunotherapy in the low PD -L1 group (P<0.01). The median PFS of the low PD -L1 group was lower than that of the high PD -L1 group (2.8 vs. 8.3 months, P<0.001). For the patients who were treated with immunotherapy alone (n=64), a similar PFS advantage was observed in the high PD -L1 group (2.8 vs. 8.0 months, P=0.002). Conclusions: This article presented the first data on TEP-derived PD -L1 mRNA in advanced NSCLC patients following immunotherapy and showed the potential advantage of using it as the surrogate biomarker for predicting the PFS and overall survival of patients following immunotherapy.

Objective. The goal of the investigation is to develop engineering architectures for monitoring and managing social processes based on vector logic. Method. The research is focused on the development of engineering vector-logical schemes and architectures for management of social processes based on their comprehensive metric monitoring in order to create comfortable conditions for creative work. Definitions of the main concepts of AI development are given. Interesting fragments of the history of computing are given. The computing equation is introduced as a transitive closure in a triad of relations-in the form of an error that creates new structures, processes or phenomena. Mechanisms of intelligent computing are developed that combine algorithms and data structures of deterministic and probabilistic AI computing. Mechanisms for constructing models based on the universe of primitives that have Similarity in relation to their use for process modeling (in-hardware synthesis, in-software programming, in neural network training, in-qubit quantization, in-memory modeling, in-truth table logic generation) are proposed. An intelligent computing metric is introduced, which is used to select the architecture and models of computing processes in order to obtain effective solutions to practical problems. Results. The following is proposed: 1) the computing equation as a transitive closure in a triad of relations-in the form of an error that creates new structures, processes or phenomena; 2) mechanisms of intelligent computing aimed at a significant reduction in time and energy costs in solving practical problems by zeroing out algorithms for processing big data, due to the exponential redundancy of smart and redundant AI models; 3) mechanisms for constructing models based on the universe of primitives that have Similarity in relation to their use for modeling processes. Conclusions. Scientific novelty concludes the following innovative solutions: 1) a triad of relations based on the xoroperation for measuring processes and phenomena in the cyber-social world is proposed; 2) intelligent computing architectures are proposed for managing social processes based on their comprehensive monitoring; 3) the implementation of these schemes in the in-memory computing architecture makes it possible not to use processor instructions, only read-write transactions on logical vectors, which saves time and energy for the execution of big data analysis algorithms; 4) mechanisms for synthesizing vector-logical models of social processes or phenomena based on unitary coding of patterns on the universe of primitives are proposed, which are focused on verification, modeling and testing of decisions made. The practical significance of the study lies in the fact that the metric of intelligent computing is proposed, which is used as a method for selecting the architecture and models of computing processes to obtain effective solutions to practical problems. Engineering social computing is designed to contribute to the construction of peaceful, fair and open societies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 16).

TI Exploration of doped quantum magnets with ultracold atoms
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB In the last decade, quantum simulators, and in particular cold atoms in optical lattices, have emerged as a valuable tool to study strongly correlated quantum matter. These experiments are now reaching regimes that are numerically difficult or impossible to access. In particular they have started to fulfill a promise which has contributed significantly to defining and shaping the field of cold atom quantum simulations, namely the exploration of doped and frustrated quantum magnets and the search for the origins of high-temperature superconductivity in the fermionic Hubbard model. Despite many future challenges lying ahead, such as the need to further lower the experimentally accessible temperatures, remarkable studies have already been conducted. Among them, spin-charge separation in one-dimensional systems has been demonstrated, extended-range antiferromagnetism in two-dimensional systems has been observed, connections to modern day large-scale numerical simulations were made, and unprecedented comparisons with microscopic trial wavefunctions have been carried out at finite doping. In many regards, the field has acquired new realms, putting old ideas to a new test and producing new insights and inspiration for the next generation of physicists. In the first part of this paper, we review the results achieved in cold atom realizations of the Fermi-Hubbard model in recent years. We put special emphasis on the new probes available in quantum gas microscopes, such as higher-order correlation functions, full counting statistics, the ability to study far-from -equilibrium dynamics, machine learning and pattern recognition of instantaneous snapshots of the many-body wavefunction, and access to non-local correlators. Our review is written from a theoretical perspective, but aims to provide basic understanding of the experimental procedures. We cover one- dimensional systems, where the phenomenon of spin-charge separation is ubiquitous, and two-dimensional systems where we distinguish between situations with and without doping. Throughout, we focus on the strong coupling regime where the Hubbard inter-actions U dominate and connections to t - J models can be justified. In the second part of this paper, with the stage set and the current state of the field in mind, we propose a new direction for cold atoms to explore: namely mixed-dimensional bilayer systems, where the charge motion is restricted to individual layers which remain coupled through spin-exchange. These systems can be directly realized experimentally and we argue that they have a rich phase diagram, potentially including a strongly correlated BEC-to-BCS cross-over and regimes with different superconducting order parameters, as well as complex parton phases and possibly even analogs of tetraquark states. In particular, we propose a novel, strong pairing mechanism in these systems, which puts the formation of hole pairs at experimentally accessible, elevated temperatures within reach. Ultimately we propose to explore how the physics of the mixed-dimensional bilayer system can be connected to the rich phenomenology of the single-layer Hubbard model. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI Design of 1 kHz-200 MHz Broadband Balanced Homodyne Detector Based on
   R-C Coupled Circuit
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective The balanced homodyne detector (BHD) is widely used in quantum noise measurement, gravitational wave detection, high-sensitivity interferometric timing measurement, continuous- variable quantum key distribution, and quantum random number generation. Highly sensitive to the amplitude and phase of the incident light, the BHD can reliably extract quantum fluctuations, suppress the classical common-mode noise, and amplify quantum fluctuations to the macro level. However, the performance of the BHD is limited by the bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the detector. The optimal design of the BHD has always been a research hotspot. The transimpedance circuit based on a direct current (DC) coupled circuit is not suitable for detecting quantum noise. The reason is that as the power of the incident light increases, the unbalanced DC increases rapidly, and the transimpedance amplifier is saturated, which significantly reduces the dynamic range of the BHD. The BHD based on an inductor-capacitor ( L-C) coupled circuit generates higher electronic noise at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. It is not suitable for low-frequency measurements due to the parasitic effect of the inductor and the low impedance of the inductor at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. In this paper, the noise sources of the BHD are analyzed theoretically, and a resistor-capacitor (R-C) coupled transimpedance circuit is used to improve the performance of the BHD at an analyzing frequency in the kHz range. Furthermore, the transimpedance circuit is optimized to increase the bandwidth to 200 MHz. The CMRR of the BHD is improved by designing a self-subtraction photodetector scheme, a variable optical attenuator, and an adjustable reverse bias voltage. These designs allow the BHD to meet the low-frequency and highfrequency measurements with high SNR and CMRR in quantum noise measurement.
   Methods To enable the BHD to measure both low-frequency and high-frequency signals with high sensitivity, this paper adopts the BHD based on an R-C coupled transimpedance circuit. Two photodiodes are connected in series, and the balanced current signal in the two photodiodes is divided into a DC signal and an alternating current ( AC) signal by the R-C coupled structure. The AC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and is further used to measure the shot-noise power of the incident light. The DC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a load resistor and is then used to measure the balance between the two incident lights. To reduce the crosstalk between the DC circuit and the AC circuit, an isolation amplifier is added after the load resistor. An adjustable bias voltage (BV) circuit is used to adjust the junction capacitance of the photodiodes and further improve the CMRR. To compensate for the difference in the amplitude of the two photodiodes and thereby improve the CMRR of the BHD, the paper also utilizes a variable optical attenuator based on fiber bending, where variable attenuation is achieved by changing the radius of the bent fiber. The attenuation of the fiber is precisely adjusted to balance the photocurrent. In addition, an equivalent noise model is constructed. The electronic noise from the TIA circuit includes four parts, i. e., the noise introduced by the dark current in the photodiodes, the thermal noise in the feedback resistor, the noise generated by the input current noise in the TIA, and the noise produced by the input voltage noise. On the basis of theoretical analysis, reasonable DC load resistance and feedback capacitance, photodiodes with low dark current and low junction capacitance, and a TIA with low input noise are selected to reduce the electronic noise and improve the SNR of the BHD.
   Results and Discussions A BHD with an R-C coupled circuit structure is designed (Fig. 1). A test device is built to test the performance of the BHD. The AC output is connected with a spectrometer to measure the bandwidth and the SNR of the BHD. The DC output is connected with an oscilloscope to make sure that the power of the two incident lights is balanced (Fig. 3). When the incident optical power is 8, 4, 2, and 1 mW, respectively, the paper tests the shot-noise spectrum and the electronic noise spectrum of the BHD with different analyzing frequencies. The test results show that the 3-dB bandwidth of the BHD is 1 kHz-200 MHz. The resolution bandwidth (RBW) and the video bandwidth (VBW) of the spectrum analyzer are set to 10 Hz and 1 Hz, respectively, and the number of averaging times is set to 40. In this case, the SNR is 12 dB at the analyzing frequency of 5 kHz under an incident optical power of 8 mW. The SNR is 20 dB at the analyzing frequency of 100 MHz when the RBW is 200 kHz and the VBW is 100 Hz. Moreover, in the analyzing frequency range of 10 kHz-200 MHz, the shot-noise power decreases by about 3 dB when the incident optical power decreases by half, indicating that the AC output of the BHD has favorable linear gain characteristics in the range of 1 mW to 8 mW (Fig. 4). In addition, 5 kHz and 100 MHz sinusoidal signals are loaded into an electro-optical amplitude modulator to modulate the incident light and thereby test the CMRR. The results show that the CMRR is 70 dB at the analyzing frequency of 5 kHz and 66 dB at the analyzing frequency of 100 MHz (Fig. 5).
   Conclusions By analyzing the noise sources of the BHD, adopting the R-C coupled transimpedance circuit, and optimizing the TIA circuit, this paper implements a broadband balanced homodyne detector that works in the bandwidth range from 1 kHz to 200 MHz with low noise and high CMRR. In the case of an incident optical power of 8 mW@ 1550 nm, the shot-noise power is 12 dB higher than the electronic noise power and the CMRR reaches 70 dB at the analyzing frequency of 5 kHz, and the shot-noise power is 20 dB higher than the electronic noise power and the CMRR reaches 66 dB at the analyzing frequency of 100 MHz. Such a homodyne detector can serve as a high-performance detection tool in various applications, such as low-frequency gravitational wave detection, high-speed continuous-variable quantum key distribution, and high-speed quantum random number generation.

TI Evolution of Mid-Infrared Vortex Laser in Organic Crystal DSTMS (
   Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Vortex beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have many unique properties compared to other beams, and their spiral wavefront structure and phase changes open up new dimensions for applications such as lithography, optical communication, optical trapping, and quantum entanglement. In recent decades, researchers have been exploring the linear and nonlinear transmission of the Laguerre-Gaussian ( LG) vortex beam in media, and the coverage has been continuously expanded, which lays a solid foundation for developing the optical vortex. Most relevant research focuses on analyzing the properties of vortex beams and their linear transmission and evolution. However, the ultrashort pulse vortex laser has become a research hotspot with extensive studies. Since the inclusion of nonlinear processes will greatly increase the complexity of vortex beam analysis, the study on transmission and evolution of ultrashort pulse vortex lasers in nonlinear media is still rare. Thus, we experimentally investigate the propagation of mid-infrared LG beams in organic crystal DSTMS due to the cubic-quintic nonlinear effect and analyze the differences in the effect of polarization of the incident vortex beam on the transverse light field distribution.
   Methods High power mid-infrared optical parametric amplifier (OPA) pulses with 1450 nm center wavelength, 60 fs pulse duration, and 1 kHz repetition rate serve as the pump of the system. After passing through a customized spiral phase plate (SPP), the mid-infrared laser light is modulated into vortex beams and incident perpendicularly onto the surface of an organic crystal with a 640 mu m thickness. A 4f imaging system is constructed using two lenses to conduct imaging on the spot in either plane perpendicular to the light propagation direction within the crystal. The CCD camera moves back and forth in the horizontal direction to observe and record the spot evolution of the vortex beam during propagation, starting from the rear surface of the crystal.
   Results and Discussions In the experiment, the spot changes of mid-infrared vortex light before and after passing through the DSTMS crystal are found and compared with those of the BBO crystal to analyze the spot characteristics of the vortex beam after passing through different crystals. After passing through the BBO crystal, there is still only one bright ring in the spot, with the spot radius almost unchanged. However, after passing through the DSTMS crystal, the spot changes significantly from the original doughnut structure to three thin bright rings, and the number of rings increases. This is due to the nonlinear process of three-photon absorption of pump light by the DSTMS crystal. When the pump light polarization fulfills the optimal THz generation conditions, the nonlinear refractive index of DSTMS mainly originates from the quasi-chi((3)) effect due to a combination of the cascaded 2nd-order OR process and the linear EO effect. The contribution from the intrinsic chi((3)) nonlinearity of DSTMS should be negligible. Its additional nonlinear refractive index causes the refractive index of the pump light to vary with light intensity, which in turn leads to spectrum broadening. For each spectral component generated after the spectrum broadening of the incident LG beam in the Kerr medium, its respective corresponding LG mode has the same topological charge and radial index. As the frequency value of each spectral component is different, the respective corresponding Rayleigh length and beam waist position are different to bring various light field expressions for the LG vortex beam corresponding to each spectral component. Therefore, the corresponding brightest rings have different radii, and each bright ring generally does not coincide with each other in the observation plane, resulting in a weak spot intensity in most regions of the observation plane. To verify the above optical spot evolution process, we can simulate the light field distribution of the LG beam before and after passing through the DSTMS medium with a Kerr-like effect by MATLAB simulation analysis based on the generalized Gaussian beam decomposition method, with the simulation results shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(c) reveals that the effect of the Kerr medium on the incident LG beam is to produce LG beams with different radial modes. Meanwhile, the effect of the polarization of the incident vortex light on the spot of the outgoing light from the rear surface of the crystal is further investigated experimentally, and the experimental results illustrate that the incident light with different polarization produces vortex beams with different light intensity distributions.
   Conclusions We research the evolutionary mechanism of vortex beams in nonlinear organic crystal DSTMS initially, showing that the nonlinear transmission effect can change the light intensity distribution of vortex beams to a large extent. The generalized Gaussian beam decomposition method is utilized to simulate and analyze the light intensity distribution of the LG beam before and after passing through the medium with a Kerr- like effect, which indicates that the Kerr medium affects the incident LG beam by producing LG beams with different radial modes. Additionally, the effect of different polarization of the incident vortex light on vortex mid-infrared laser transmission in DSTMS is studied to demonstrate the effect of nonlinear transmission on the LG beam.

TI Study of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma transcriptome after
   proton therapy
SO BYULLETEN SIBIRSKOY MEDITSINY
AB Aim. To evaluate changes in the transcriptome of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissue cells in patients after proton therapy. Materials and methods. Biopsy material obtained from 3 HNSCC patients before and after proton therapy at a total dose of 10 isoGy was homogenized, purified, and concentrated. Then total RNA was isolated with further purification and concentration with the RNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). Library quantitation was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 instrument (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). After isolation of 1 mu g total RNA for sequencing, libraries were prepared on the Illumina platform using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 with a 10-cycle enrichment step according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The quality of RNA and the resulting libraries was checked using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Tec. Inc., USA). The RIN parameter for RNA was at least 7. The library concentration was assessed by real-time PCR on the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA). Final libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios before sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using 50 base-pair paired-end reads. The Q20 parameter for all samples was > 97%, and the number of reads averaged 60.2 million per sample. Raw reads were processed using the RTA 1.17.21.3 and Casava 1.8.2 (Illumina). The enrichment analysis was performed using the PANTHER 17.0 software. Results. The transcriptome analysis of HNSCC after proton radiation therapy (5 x 2 isoGy) at a total dose of 10 isoGy revealed 1,414 significantly differentially expressed genes. The 10 most and least expressed genes and their associated signaling pathways were identified. A number of signaling pathways associated with the underexpressed genes were detected in HNSCC after proton therapy, such as: STAT5; PD-1 signaling pathway; marked MET-mediated activation of PTK2 signaling pathway, PDGF signaling; CD22-mediated regulation of BCR; and FCERI-mediated MAPK activation. In addition to the above signaling pathways, activation of collagen degradation, FCGR3A-mediated phagocytosis, and FCGR3A-mediated interleukin (IL)-10 synthesis are of interest. In the enrichment analysis among highly expressed genes, keratinization and biological oxidation processes were activated in HNSCC tissues after proton therapy. Conclusion. Proton therapy in HNSCC leads to overexpression of genes involved in the regulation of keratinization and biological oxidation processes as well as to underexpression of genes associated with suppression of signaling pathways: STAT5, PD-1, MET-mediated activation of PTK2 signaling pathway, PDGF signaling; CD22-mediated regulation of BCR; FCERI-mediated MAPK activation, collagen degradation, FCGR3A-mediated phagocytosis activation, and FCGR3A-mediated IL-10 synthesis. All signaling pathways of underexpressed genes function in HNSCC cells if there is no negative influence on the tumor from outside (irradiation or delivery of antitumor drugs). The predominance of suppressed signaling pathways over activated ones most likely indicates a decrease in the functional potential of cells after proton therapy. The dose-dependence of proton therapy effects requires further study of changes in cellular and molecular-genetic signatures of HNSCC after proton therapy at different doses.

TI Advances in electronic structure methods for strongly correlated
   molecular systems
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB In recent years, numerous novel materials have emerged in fields such as high-temperature superconductivity and quantum communication, including unconventional superconductors, topological insulators, and spin liquids. These materials exhibit significant quantum phenomena such as quantum interference, tunneling, fluctuations, and entanglement, often arising from strong correlation effects among electrons within molecules.
   In the community of quantum chemistry, strong correlation effects are typically classified into dynamic electron correlation and static electron correlation. Dynamic electron correlation, caused by the instantaneous movement of electrons leading to charge density fluctuations, presents computational challenges due to the necessity of introducing a multi-particle form of the wave function. This departure from the mean-field single-particle perspective results in a substantial increase in the computational cost for calculating electron correlation levels. On the other hand, static electron correlation arises from the near-degeneracy of numerous frontier molecular orbitals, resulting in a quantum superposition of electron configurations. It requires the use of multi-configuration methods and faces the well-known "exponential wall" challenge, where computational complexity exponentially grows with the system size. Therefore, due to the involvement of both dynamic and static electron correlations in strongly correlated systems, achieving precise electronic structure calculations is exceptionally difficult, representing a significant challenge in theoretical chemistry and computational physics.
   Traditionally, to describe the static correlation, quantum chemists often define crucial correlated orbitals and their electrons within the complete active space (CAS). Full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations are performed within the CAS, while the region outside the CAS is described by mean-field methods. While these multi-configuration methods allow for arbitrary electron arrangement within the CAS, effectively capturing the static correlation of the system, they struggle to handle the dynamic correlations beyond the CAS. Therefore, combining them with multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI), multi-reference perturbation theory (MRPT), multi-reference coupled cluster theory (MRCC), and other multi-reference methods becomes essential to accurately handle strong correlation systems. Constructing multi-configuration wave functions to obtain static correlation by multi-configuration methods, and then generating excitation configurations based on these multi-configuration wave functions to obtain dynamic correlation has become the mainstream of the development of current wave function methods. Challenges in this direction include the exponential growth in computational complexity with an increase in CAS size and the precision of multi-reference methods affecting the accuracy of capturing dynamic correlations beyond the active space.
   Over the last decade, various multi-configuration methods, such as selected configuration interaction (sCI), Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), and neural-network quantum states (NQS), have successfully expanded the computable active space by explicitly or implicitly extracting and compressing complete configuration space information. Furthermore, combining these multi-configuration methods with traditional multi-reference approaches, such as MRCI, MRPT and MRCC, enables capturing dynamic correlations caused by electronic instantaneous interactions beyond the active space. This achieves higher precision and quantitative descriptions for mid-sized strongly correlated molecular systems (around 50 active orbitals). Additionally, novel methods like Block-Correlated Coupled Cluster Theory (BCCC) have made progress in attempting to discuss static and dynamic correlations within a unified framework.
   This article primarily introduces the advancements in wave function theory electronic structure methods for strongly correlated molecular systems in recent years. The first section details multi-configuration methods that have expanded the CAS size, including sCI, DMRG, FCIQMC, NQS, and outlines their developmental trajectories. The second section delves into the combination of these multi-configuration methods with traditional multi-reference approaches, leveraging larger active spaces to address dynamic correlations and achieve higher precision results. Finally, the article discusses the prospects of these methods in three directions: Handling static and dynamic correlations within a unified framework, integrating with relativistic effects, and combining with machine learning.

TI Effect of Zn Diffusion on Avalanche Breakdown Probability of InGaAs/InP
   Single Photon Avalanche Diodes
SO ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
AB Single photon detection technology is a very sensitive photoelectric detection technology that can detect the energy of a single photon. It is a weak signal detection technology widely used in laser ranging, quantum communication, laser radar 3D imaging, and other fields. Single photon avalanche diodes generally operate in Geiger mode,that is,the operating voltage is greater than the breakdown voltage. Photon detection efficiency refers to the probability that a photon incident on a device is converted into a macroscopic signal that can be detected. It is an important parameter to measure the detection ability of single photon avalanche diodes. InGaAs/InP single photon avalanche diodes can work in near infrared band,has the characteristics of high photon detection efficiency and good time jitter,in addition to small size, high stability,excellent anti-radiation performance,can realize large array imaging and other advantages, become one of the most promising near infrared single photon detectors. The planar back-illuminated InGaAs/ InP single photon avalanche diodes designed in this paper adopt the absorption grading charge multiplication separation structure,in which the charge layer can control the electric field intensity of the multiplier layer to be high enough to produce avalanche breakdown,while the absorption layer electric field intensity is limited to a certain range to reduce the tunneling effect. The grading layer can reduce the accumulation of carriers at the heterogeneous interface. The P+ active region is formed by two Zn diffusion structures,the multiplication region is limited to the area below the deep diffusion. The shallow diffusion can effectively limit the edge electric field of the multiplication region without using the guard ring structure to avoid premature edge breakdown. The structure design and numerical simulation of InGaAs/ InP single photon avalanche diodes are carried out by using TCAD software and selecting the appropriate physical model and parameters,and the corresponding electrical and optical parameters are obtained. Then aiming at the effect of avalanche breakdown probability on device photon detection efficiency,the relationship between the avalanche breakdown probability of the device and the difference between the two Zn diffusion depths,the lateral diffusion factor of Zn diffusion,the doping concentration of Zn,and the temperature parameters is emphatically studied. It is found that when the depth of deep diffusion is 2.3 mu m,there is an optimal target value corresponding to the shallow diffusion depth. The deeper the shallow diffusion depth, the higher the breakdown probability of avalanche in the center of the multiplication region under the same overbias,and the higher the electric field intensity will also increase. However, when the difference between the two Zn diffusion depths is less than 0.6 mu m,non-ideal breakdown will occur outside the multiplication region,resulting in an increase in the dark count of the device. The larger the lateral diffusion factor of Zn diffusion, the higher the breakdown probability of the avalanche at the center of the multiplication region, and the lower the breakdown probability of the avalanche at the edge of the multiplication region. With the same diffusion depth,the shallow diffusion Zn doping concentration has no significant effect on avalanche breakdown probability, but the higher the deep diffusion Zn doping concentration,the lower the avalanche breakdown probability under the same overbias.
   The study of the influence of temperature on avalanche breakdown probability shows that the device can obtain better performance at low temperature. The research work in this paper can guide the design of InGaAs/ InP single photon avalanche diodes with higher photon detection efficiency and lower dark count. Moreover, relevant research can also provide a reference for selecting the optimal working point of the device to ensure the device works in the best state and realize the optimal application of the device.

TI High-performance two-dimensional chiral perovskite X-ray detectors based
   on chirality-induced spin selectivity
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Organic-inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite materials have shown enormous application values in the field of optoelectronics, such as light emitting, solar photovoltaic, laser, quantum communication, and 3D display. This is mainly owing to their unique crystal structures and excellent optoelectronic properties. Based on their tunable chemical composition and crystal structures, the two-dimensional chiral metal halide perovskite with a layered structure can be obtained by introducing chiral organic cations into the achiral inorganic frameworks, leading to the significant optical activities and spin properties of two-dimensional chiral metal halide perovskite in the absence of magnetic, optical, electrical fields, such as circular dichroism (CD), chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), etc. Thus, this kind of material is usually used in circularly polarized luminescence and detection, nonlinear optics, as well as spintronics, but its application research in high-energy X-ray detection remains unknown. In this work, we introduce chiral organic molecules (R/S-NEA=(R/S-C12H13N)) and achiral organic molecules (rac-NEA) into the achiral inorganic octahedral frameworks (PbI6) to synthesize a two-dimensional chiral perovskite ((R/S-NEA)(2)PbBr4) and an achiral two-dimensional chiral perovskite ((rac-NEA)(2)PbBr4) single crystals, respectively. These crystals possess remarkable white flake-like shapes. Meanwhile, this single crystal can be used to fabricate a structurally simple direct X-ray detector (C/(R/S/rac-NEA)(2)PbBr4/C). We find that the sensitivity of X-ray detectors based on (S-NEA)(2)PbBr4 crystal is as high as 2.87 x 10(4) mu C Gyair(-1) cm(-2), which is much higher than that of two-dimensional achiral metal halide perovskite polycrystalline X-ray detectors. Moreover, both the dark current and dark current drift values of the devices are only 0.15 nA and 7.6 x 10(-8) nA cm(-1) s(-1) V-1, respectively. The product of carrier mobility and lifetime (mu tau) can reach 5.85 x 10(-4) cm(2) V-1. The activation energy for ion migration is 219 meV. In addition, the (R/S-NEA)(2)PbBr4 X-ray detector exhibits excellent stability under prolonged X-ray irradiation. However, the sensitivity of X-ray detectors based on (rac-NEA)(2)PbBr4 crystal is merely 7.41x10(3) mu C Gyair(-1) cm(-2), which is distinctly much lower than that of (S-NEA)(2)PbBr4 crystal X-ray detectors. These experimental results indicate that two-dimensional chiral perovskites crystals (R/S-NEA)(2)PbBr4 have outstanding electrical transport properties, which makes them have the potential to be applied in the field of high-energy X-ray detection. According to the analysis of optical activity and spintronics properties of two-dimensional chiral perovskites (R/S-NEA)(2)PbBr4, we conclude that the excited state can be easily polarized in the (R/S-NEA)(2)PbBr4 crystals through CISS interaction. The spin-polarized excitons in the (R/S-NEA)(2)PbBr4 X-ray detector are rapidly dissociated into a large number of spin-dependent photo-generated charge carriers under X-ray irradiation, resulting in a reduced recombination probability between spin anti-parallel electrons and holes charge carriers.
   The spin parallel electrons and holes charge carriers can be effectively extracted by top and bottom electrodes of detector to greatly generate photocurrent, which further improve the performance of (R/S-NEA)(2)PbBr4 X-ray detector. Oppositely, the achiral (rac-NEA)(2)PbBr4 X-ray detector without CISS property exhibits lower sensitivity. This deeply demonstrates that the CISS indeed has a significantly enhanced impaction on improvement of X-ray detector's performance. This study provides theoretical guidance and experimental supports for the development of low-cost and high-performance direct perovskite X-ray detectors.

TI Impact of Scaling Classic Component on Performance of Hybrid
   Multi-Backbone Quantum-Classic Neural Networks for Medical Applications
SO COMPUTATION
AB Purpose: While hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HNNs) are a promising avenue for quantum advantage, the critical influence of the classical backbone architecture on their performance remains poorly understood. This study investigates the role of lightweight convolutional neural network architectures, focusing on LCNet, in determining the stability, generalization, and effectiveness of hybrid models augmented with quantum layers for medical applications. The objective is to clarify the architectural compatibility between quantum and classical components and provide guidelines for backbone selection in hybrid designs. Methods: We constructed HNNs by integrating a four-qubit quantum circuit (with trainable rotations) into scaled versions of LCNet (050, 075, 100, 150, 200). These models were rigorously evaluated on CIFAR-10 and MedMNIST using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, assessing accuracy, AUC, and robustness metrics. Performance was assessed with accuracy, macro- and micro-averaged area under the ROC curve (AUC), per-class accuracy, and out-of-fold (OoF) predictions to ensure unbiased generalization. In addition, training dynamics, confusion matrices, and performance stability across folds were analyzed to capture both predictive accuracy and robustness. Results: The experiments revealed a strong dependence of hybrid network performance on both backbone architecture and model scale. Across all tests, LCNet-based hybrids achieved the most consistent benefits, particularly at compact and medium configurations. From LCNet050 to LCNet100, hybrid models maintained high macro-AUC values exceeding 0.95 and delivered higher mean accuracies with lower variance across folds, confirming enhanced stability and generalization through quantum integration. On the DermaMNIST dataset, these hybrids achieved accuracy gains of up to seven percentage points and improved AUC by more than three points, demonstrating their robustness in imbalanced medical settings. However, as backbone complexity increased (LCNet150 and LCNet200), the classical architectures regained superiority, indicating that the advantages of quantum layers diminish with scale. The mostconsistent gains were observed at smaller and medium LCNet scales, where hybridization improved accuracy and stability across folds. This divergence indicates that hybrid networks do not necessarily follow the "bigger is better" paradigm of classical deep learning. Per-class analysis further showed that hybrids improved recognition in challenging categories, narrowing the gap between easy and difficult classes. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that the performance and stability of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks are fundamentally determined by the characteristics of their classical backbones. Across extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and DermaMNIST, LCNet-based hybrids consistently outperformed or matched their classical counterparts at smaller and medium scales, achieving higher accuracy and AUC along with notably reduced variability across folds. These improvements highlight the role of quantum layers as implicit regularizers that enhance learning stability and generalization-particularly in data-limited or imbalanced medical settings. However, the observed benefits diminished with increasing backbone complexity, as larger classical models regained superiority in both accuracy and convergence reliability. This indicates that hybrid architectures do not follow the conventional "larger-is-better" paradigm of classical deep learning.
   Overall, the results establish that architectural compatibility and model scale are decisive factors for effective quantum-classical integration. Lightweight backbones such as LCNet offer a robust foundation for realizing the advantages of hybridization in practical, resource-constrained medical applications, paving the way for future studies on scalable, hardware-efficient, and clinically reliable hybrid neural networks.

TI Research on Delay Line Anode Photon Counting Imaging Detector
SO ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
AB A useful technique for detecting very faint light is photon counting technology, which has numerous potential applications in high-energy physics, astronomical detection, quantum key distribution systems, and high-resolution spectral measurement. The micro-channel plate based single-photon counting detector benefits from being small and compact in design. While counting photons, it can precisely record the arrival time and location information by combining with the position-sensitive anode. The detector based on microchannel plate and position-sensitive anode has high sensitivity and time and space discrimination ability, and has been widely used in various fields.
   Firstly, we investigated position-sensitive anodes for imaging, there are many position-sensitive anodes for imaging. Among which the spatial resolution of WSA anodes decreases gradually with the increase of detection area;the electronics design of MAMA anodes becomes more complex as the detection area increases;each strip of XS anode requires an independent readout electronics, resulting in higher circuit power consumption;the spatial resolution of delay line anodes is much better than that of other kinds of position-sensitive anodes because it is not impacted by the detecting area. Therefore, a novel two-dimensional cross delay line anode based on a printed circuit board was proposed after the delay line anode single photon detector's operating principle was examined. The anode adopts a multi-layer structure design, from top to bottom including an upper collection unit, a reference ground, a lower collection unit, a reference ground, a collection unit and a delay unit through the via connection to achieve signal transmission. Compared to traditional anode designs, this design places the delay unit on the back of the collection unit, making it more miniaturized.
   Secondly, the high resistance sensor layer was replaced of an anode to capture electrons based on the charge induction readout technology. Due to the characteristics of high resistance of sensor layer, when the electron cloud reaches the charge induction layer, it takes a certain time to diffuse to the ground, so an equal amount of induced charge is generated on the other side, and the position-sensitive anode senses the induced charge and performs analytical imaging on it. Compared with the traditional direct collection method, the direct collection is easy to cause the redistribution of secondary electrons on the anode, resulting in the instability of the output image. Charge induction technology effectively avoids these problems and eliminates the influence of non-uniform electron field on electron motion, it provides convenience for the development of vacuum package detector, which not only reduces the difficulty of device manufacturing, but also facilitates testing.
   Finally, a set of experimental system is used to test the delay line anode, the developed signal readout circuit mainly includes time digital conversion circuit and photon arrival timing circuit, and imaging is realized by signal discrimination and photon arrival timing circuit. According to the test results, the detector's ideal spatial resolution is 107 mu m and its ideal dark count is 0.23 count/(cm(2)center dot s). The innovative cross delay line anode has created the groundwork for single photon image detection in large area arrays, it provides theoretical guidance for further performance improvement.

TI LUMOS-Low and Intermediate Grade Glioma Umbrella Study of Molecular
   Guided TherapieS at relapse: Protocol for a pilot study
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Introduction Grades 2 and 3 gliomas (G2/3 gliomas), when combined, are the second largest group of malignant brain tumours in adults. The outcomes for G2/3 gliomas at progression approach the dismal outcomes for glioblastoma (GBM), yet there is a paucity of trials for Australian patients with relapsed G2/3 gliomas compared with patients with GBM. LUMOS will be a pilot umbrella study for patients with relapsed G2/3 gliomas that aims to match patients to targeted therapies based on molecular screening with contemporaneous tumour tissue. Participants in whom no actionable or no druggable mutation is found, or in whom the matching drug is not available, will form a comparator arm and receive standard of care chemotherapy. The objective of the LUMOS trial is to assess the feasibility of this approach in a multicentre study across five sites in Australia, with a view to establishing a national molecular screening platform for patient treatment guided by the mutational analysis of contemporaneous tissue biopsies Methods and analysis This study will be a multicentre pilot study enrolling patients with recurrent grade 2/3 gliomas that have previously been treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy at diagnosis or at first relapse. Contemporaneous tumour tissue at the time of first relapse, defined as tissue obtained within 6 months of relapse and without subsequent intervening therapy, will be obtained from patients. Molecular screening will be performed by targeted next-generation sequencing at the reference laboratory (PathWest, Perth, Australia). RNA and DNA will be extracted from representative formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue scrolls or microdissected from sections on glass slides tissue sections following a review of the histology by pathologists. Extracted nucleic acid will be quantified by Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Library preparation and targeted capture will be performed using the TruSight Tumor 170 (TST170) kit and samples sequenced on NextSeq 550 (Illumina) using NextSeq V.2.5 hi output reagents, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data analysis will be performed using the Illumina BaseSpace TST170 app v1.02 and a custom tertiary pipeline, implemented within the Clinical Genomics Workspace software platform from PierianDx (also refer to section 3.2). Primary outcomes for the study will be the number of patients enrolled and the number of patients who complete molecular screening. Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of screened patients enrolled; proportion of patients who complete molecular screening; the turn-around time of molecular screening; and the value of a brain tumour specific multi-disciplinary tumour board, called the molecular tumour advisory panel as measured by the proportion of patients in whom the treatment recommendation was refined compared with the recommendations from the automated bioinformatics platform of the reference laboratory testing. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the lead Human Research Ethics Committee of the Sydney Local Health District: Protocol No. X19-0383. The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 2013, guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the National Health and Medical Research Council National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007, updated 2018 and as amended periodically). Results will be disseminated using a range of media channels including newsletters, social media, scientific conferences and peer-reviewed publications.

TI Quantum phase transition and exceptional points in dissipative optical
   cavity with nonlinear atom-photon interaction
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Dicke model, as an important many-body model in quantum optics, describes the interaction between multiple identical two-level atoms and a quantized electromagnetic field. This spin-boson model shows collective phenomena in light-matter interaction systems and can undergo a second-order quantum phase transition from a normal phase to a superradiant phase when the coupling strength between the two-level atoms and the optical field exceeds a critical value. Dicke model embodies unique many-body quantum theories. And it has been widely studied and obtained many significant research results in quantum information, quantum process, and other quantum systems. Meanwhile, Dicke model also has wide applications in quantum optics and condensed matter physics. The extended Dicke model, describing the interaction of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical cavity, provides a remarkable platform for studying extraordinary quantum phase transitions in theory and experiment. Based on the recent experiment on non-Hermitian coupling between two long-lived atomic spin waves in an optical cavity, in this work we use spin-coherent-state variational method and present the macroscopic quantum-state energy of the non-Hermitian Dicke model. The spin coherent state variational method has an advantage in the theoretical research of macroscopic quantum states, especially in the normal and the inverted pseudospin states. In the variational method, optical coherent states and atomic extremum spin coherent states are used as the trial wave functions. A Hermitian transformation operator is proposed to diagonalize the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which is different from the ordinary quantum mechanics where the transformation operator must be unitary. Herein, the energy function is not necessarily real in the entire coupling region. Beyond an exceptional point, the spectrum becomes complex and introducing biorthogonal sets of atomic extremum states is necessary to evaluate the average quantities. The normal phase (for the zero average photon number) possesses real energy and atomic population. The non-Hermitian interaction destroys the superradiant phase (for the stable nonzero average photon number) and leads to the absence of quantum phase transition. However, the introduced atom-photon interaction, which is induced by the pump field experimentally, can change the situation, dramatically. The pump field can balance the loss by the non-Hermitian atom-photon interaction to achieve the superradiant phase. An interesting double exceptional point are observed in the energy functional. There is the real spectrum below the first exceptional point and beyond the second exceptional point, while there is a complex spectrum between these two exceptional points. The superradiant phase appears only beyond a critical value, which is related to the nonlinear interaction and the pump laser. A new and inverted quantum phase transition from the superradiant phase to the normal phase, is observed by modulating the atom-field coupling strength. The superradiant phase of the population inversion state appears for a negative effective frequency and a large atom-photon interaction. The influence of the dissipative coupling may be observed in cold atom experiment in an optical cavity. All the parameters adopted in this work are the actual experimental parameters.

TI Automatic Frequency Stabilization System Based on Sideband PDH Technique
   with Transfer Cavity
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective Transfer cavity locking is a high-performance, low-cost frequency stabilization method that is widely used in optical clocks and quantum computing with neutral atoms or ions. Typically, the transfer cavity-locked laser is not tunable, making it unsuitable for cold atom experiments. To address this problem, this study presents an automatic frequency-locking system for a cooling laser of mercury atoms. The wavelength of the cooling laser is 254 nm, which is quadrupled from a 1015-nm slave laser locked to the transfer cavity. To lock the deep-ultraviolet (DUV) laser to the atomic transition, we build an automatic frequency-locking system based on sideband PDH (Pound-Drever-Hall) technology. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is employed to acquire the saturated absorption spectra (SAS) and lock-in amplified signals, and an algorithm is developed to identify different atomic transitions. The processed signal is then fed back to the sideband frequency, realizing automatic frequency sweeping, peak searching, and frequency locking. Methods To derive the sideband PDH technique, sidebands are generated using two cascaded fiber electro-optical modulators (FEOMs) to modulate a 1062-nm master laser. Because the cavity is locked to one sideband, adjusting the sideband frequency can change the cavity length, which in turn changes the frequency of the 1015-nm slave laser. In addition, to achieve automatic frequency locking, we develop a program based on LabVIEW that integrates both algorithm and hardware communication functionalities. Before operation, we need only to set up an appropriate signal threshold, and the system automatically identifies the atomic transition based on this value. The program controls the ADC to collect and analyze the SAS and lock-in amplifier signals. The regulation signal is then fed into the signal generator to change the sideband frequency for scanning and locking. Consequently, when the 1015-nm slave laser is locked to the transfer cavity using the sideband PDH technique, the sideband frequency is regulated by a program that references the SAS signal and lock-in amplifier signal, and the laser frequency can be locked to the atomic transition. Results and Discussions To demonstrate the excellent locking performance of the transfer cavity system, we first measure the frequency noise power spectrum and deep-ultraviolet laser linewidth during locking. The results show that transfer locking significantly reduces the low-frequency noise of the laser (Fig. 6). The linewidth of the two DUV lasers is 450 kHz after being locked to the slave laser by an optical phase-lock loop (Fig. 7), which can be used for laser cooling of mercury atoms. Using a wavelength meter, we also measure the frequency fluctuations of the slave laser after locking. The results show that the frequency of the slave laser has no significant drift within the accuracy of the wavelength meter (Fig. 9). Subsequently, the 254-nm DUV laser is locked to different atomic transitions. For Hg-202, only a single transition occurs in the broad Doppler profile. The system can normally lock the slave laser to this transition, and the SAS signal after locking exhibits excellent stability (Fig. 8). In addition, the transitions of Hg-199 and Hg-204 are very close to each other, and the system can identify them and lock the 254-nm DUV laser to them separately by inputting different signal thresholds (Fig. 10).
   Furthermore, the system offers high flexibility; after locking, detuning can be changed or switched to another atomic transition simply by changing the sideband frequency. Finally, we modulate the master laser in this system, effectively overcoming the issue of insufficient broadband FEOM at a certain wavelength. However, the slow frequency drift of the master laser can be directly compensated at the sideband frequency without introducing an additional FEOM. Conclusions We developed an automatic frequency stabilization system based on sideband PDH technology with a transfer cavity. By referencing the SAS signal and lock-in amplifier signal, we employ the sideband PDH technique to shift the frequency, allowing the 1015-nm slave laser to automatically lock to different transitions of the mercury atom. This method not only allows the slave laser to be locked to the atomic transition, but also achieves a narrow linewidth of the deep-ultraviolet laser. This system has a user-friendly interface that provides very simple operation for users. In short, this method combines the advantages of the SAS and transfer cavity, significantly improving frequency stability while ensuring that the laser is locked to the atomic transition. The method enables flexible detuning of the slave laser, making it widely applicable to various cold atom experiments.

TI Zeno's paradox and black hole information loss problem
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The black hole information paradox-a fundamental conflict between quantum unitarity and semi-classical gravity-remains unresolved within the framework of quantum gravity. This work builds a conceptual bridge between this modern dilemma and Zeno's ancient paradox of motion, emphasizing that they all rely on limit processes to reconcile infinite divisibility with finite physical outcomes. Although previous researches have established information conservation in black hole evaporation by copying wormholes, this study transcends mere unitarity verification to answer a deeper question: How do we quantify the statistical evolution and inherent irreversibility of Hawking radiation? Methods: i) Gravitational path integral formalism: We compute R & eacute;nyi entropies S-n = l-n Tr(p(n)) by analytic continuation (n -> 1) , incorporating both disconnected geometries (Hawking saddles) and connected replica wormhole saddles. ii) JT gravity model: A two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled to a conformal bath is analyzed, with End-of-the-World (EOW) branes modeling early Hawking radiation states. iii) Modular thermodynamics: Modular entropy Sm and entanglement capacity Cn are defined as: Sm= logTr(pn) - nan logTr(pn), Cn = n2a2nlog Tr(pn), mirroring thermodynamic entropy and heat capacity. Key results: i) Page curve restoration: The von Neumann entropy transitions from linear growth (Hawking phase) to zero (wormhole-dominated phase) at the Page time: indicating faster entropy reduction for higher n. ii) Replica wormhole mechanism: The gravitational path integral reveals a topological transition: tPage OC SBH/(nic), SBH = A/(4GN), kZ1n + knZn Tr(pn ) approximate to kZ(1)(n) + k(n)Z(n)/(kZ(1))(n)Dominance shift at k ti eS0 (kZ1)n . Quantum non-cloning constraints: A reversibility paradox arises: while n-copies-copies of a known state allow full reconstruction, the non-cloning theorem forbids replication of unknown states. This necessitates the a priori existence of multiple replicas to ensure consistency. iii) Connection to Zeno's paradox: The resolution of Zeno's paradox through Newtonian limits (v = lim triangle(t -> 0) triangle x/triangle t iv) Infinite-to-finite mapping: Both employ limit operations to compress divergent processes (infinite steps or entropy growth) into finite observables. Discrete vs. continuous: Challenge classical spacetime continuity, hinting at holographic or discrete quantum spacetime. Irreversibility and generalized second law: The relative entropy S (p||sigma) , defined as: S(p parallel to sigma) = Tr(plogp) - Tr(p log sigma), monotonically increases during the Hawking-to-wormhole transition, establishing statistical irreversibility in modular space. This generalized second law persists despite microscopic unitarity, analogous to thermodynamic ( ) irreversibilityinclosedsystemswiththeformula: (S-n - S-p) - n (H >(n) - (H >(p) >> 0. Conclusion: Our results address the black hole information paradox and the irreversible problem through three pillars: i) Unitarity: Replica wormholes enforce unitarity via non-perturbative spacetime topology changes. ii) Modular thermodynamics: A framework linking entanglement entropy, relative entropy, and irreversibility. iii) Replica priority principle: Multiple radiation replicas exist a priori, circumventing quantum cloning constraints.
   This work transcends mere information conservation, advancing into the second layer of black hole physics: Characterizing the irreversible evolution of Hawking radiation in modular space.

TI Progress on chiral optical near fields
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Near-field optics plays an essential role in exploring the subwavelength optical characteristics of light-matter interactions. Due to its inhomogeneous nature, the spatial and polarization degrees of freedom in optical near fields can strongly couple with each other. This gives rise to various intriguing properties and phenomena of chiral optical near fields. The interaction between the chiral optical near fields and matter provides rich physical mechanisms for state-of-the-art applications, which enable both the efficient control of near-field characteristics using optical structures/devices and the flexible optical manipulation/detection of small particles.
   This review introduces the recent progress in the research of chiral optical near fields from the theoretical and applied aspects. In the past few years, the study of optical near fields has been extended from evanescent fields to arbitrary inhomogeneous structured fields, revealing the intriguing physics associated with the extraordinary spin and momentum properties and promoting the development of modern optics. The property of spin-momentum locking can be employed to realize near-field optical directional coupling, non-Hermitian exception points, and near-field directional sources, with broad applications in photonic integrated circuits and quantum information processing. The transfer of transverse momentum and angular momentum between the chiral optical near fields and particles can generate the abnormal lateral optical force and torque, providing new degrees of freedom for optical trapping, chirality sorting, and optomechanical device design. Analogous to the longitudinal spin, the transverse spin of light can also give rise to geometric phases due to the curvilinear trajectory of optical near fields or spatially varying anisotropy of materials, which paves the way for the on-chip multiplexed optical manipulation. In addition, the interference of near fields can generate polarization singularities with unique properties in the real space. The interplay among the chiral near-field optics, singular optics and topological optics inspires the study of the near-field polarization structures and topological configurations, such as polarization Skyrmions and Mobius strips. The nontrivial topological properties of these near-field structures and configurations offer robust mechanisms for manipulating lights polarization and phase beyond the conventional approaches. Last but not least, chiral optical near fields have found essential applications in chiral sensing and discrimination, such as in the circular dichroism spectroscopy. The efficiency of such techniques depends on the local optical chirality. Strongly enhanced optical chirality can be achieved in the optical near fields generated by artificial structures, including the superchiral light fields associated with localized EM resonances and the fields at circular polarization singularities, which can give rise to highly efficient and sensitive chiral detection and sensing.
   This area of study can provide new insights into near-field optical physics and inspirations for other optical research including nano-integrated optics, non-Hermitian optics, singular optics, topological photonics, quantum optics, etc. At present, the research of chiral optical near fields is still in the early stage, with many novel mechanisms and phenomena to be explored (such as universal spin-momentum dynamics, spatiotemporal spin-orbit interactions, etc.) and key practical problems to be solved (such as the high-precision fabrication of micro-/nano-structures and integration technologies of optical devices). The research and application prospects are vast. We hope this review can contribute to the exploration of novel chiral light-matter interactions in the near fields and foster research discoveries and innovations for the next-generation optical technologies.

TI Recent Advances in Orbital Angular Momentum Multiplexed Metasurface
   Holography
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is manifested by the helical wavefront of light, has emerged as a new degree of freedom of light that can significantly enhance both the optical and quantum information capacities. Holography is an intriguing technique that can be used to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) light fields of an object. Because the helical -mode index of OAM beams is theoretically unlimited, numerous OAM-dependent information channels can be multiplexed in a single hologram, indicating that it has tremendous potential for achieving ultrahigh capacities in holographic devices and systems. Traditional OAM holograms rely on spatial light modulators (SLM) to modulate the wavefront. However, their low resolution and bulky size limit their practical applications. Metasurfaces, which are artificially engineered materials and are composed of optical thin films and subwavelength structure arrays, can be used to flexibly and accurately modulate optical fields, making them ideal candidates for high- performance optical applications. By designing the metasurface structure, it is possible to adjust the phase as well as independently and simultaneously adjust other physical dimensions such as the amplitude, polarization, angle, and frequency. A combination of these physical dimensions and OAM can be used to create independent information channels for high -capacity holographic multichannel multiplexing. The development of new degrees of freedom and improvement in the image quality open up new opportunities for future research in OAM holography, which can lead to the creation of safer and more integrated optical components.Progress The recent progress in OAM multiplexed holography is reviewed based on optical metasurfaces, from the basic concepts to the practical implementation. The OAM is divided into two categories according to its multiplexing form and other optical degrees of freedom (Fig. 1): extrinsic degree of freedom multiplexed OAM holography, and intrinsic degree of freedom multiplexed OAM holography. Extrinsic degrees of freedom multiplexed OAM holography mainly includes polarization multiplexed OAM holography (Fig. 3), frequency -multiplexed OAM holography (Fig. 4), space-time multiplexed OAM holography (Fig. 5), and chiro-optical field multiplexed OAM holography (Fig. 6). Intrinsic degree of freedom multiplexed OAM holography includes phase jump gradient factor -multiplexed OAM holography, angle -multiplexed OAM holography (Fig. 7), ellipticity -multiplexed OAM holography, and radial -angle -multiplexed OAM holography (Fig. 8).Conclusions and Prospects OAM holography can achieve an infinite number of orthogonal and independent channels, which significantly increases the information capacity for various applications. This can be achieved using a compact metasurface to miniaturize the device and improve the imaging quality by eliminating unnecessary diffraction. Furthermore, metasurfaces provide an excellent platform for combining OAM holography with other optical degrees of freedom, resulting in an enriched information capacity for potential applications in optical communications and information encryption. However, some pressing issues still require immediate resolution. First, as the topological charge of the OAM increases, the image resolution and information capacity of the OAM holography deteriorates because of the increased discrete sampling interval.
   Second, the current dynamic OAM holography primarily employs switchable metasurfaces; however, to achieve real-time and continuously tunable OAM holographic displays, adjustable materials should be utilized to design metasurface structures. Finally, further exploration of new optical degrees of freedom is imperative for achieving greater information capacity.

TI Tunable magnon and optical bistability in a cavity optomagnomechanical
   system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB This study establishes a theoretical framework for realizing and dynamically controlling magnon and optical bistability in a hybrid cavity optomagnomechanical system composed of microwave cavity mode, magnon mode, phonon mode, and optical cavity mode. The objective is to investigate the synergistic interplay among self-Kerr nonlinearity, magnetostrictive effect, and radiation pressure induced optomechanical coupling in generating and modulating bistable behavior. Furthermore, this work aims to reveal the transient quantum state transition dynamics between bistable states. The system Hamiltonian includes magnetic dipole interaction between the magnon mode and microwave cavity mode, magnomechanical interaction between the magnon mode and phonon mode, and optomechanical interaction between the phonon mode and optical cavity mode. In addition, the self-Kerr nonlinearity of the magnon mode is considered. Numerical analysis of the system dynamics is conducted using quantum Langevin equations that include dissipation and input noise terms. Steady-state analytical solutions for the average magnon number and optical photon number are derived, revealing a bistable characteristic with three possible solutions. Numerical simulations are performed using experimentally feasible parameters, including coupling strengths, frequency detunings, and dissipation rates. The results indicate that both magnon and optical bistabilities are tunable. Specifically, adjusting the microwave cavity-magnon coupling efficiency enables modulation of the energy transfer efficiency from microwave to magnon, thereby altering the hysteresis window and excitation threshold of the magnon bistability. Tuning the magnon-phonon interaction can influence the energy transfer from magnon to phonon. A larger magnon-pump detuning enhances nonlinear frequency shifts, alters energy transfer pathways, broadens the hysteresis loop, and increases the magnon population on the upper branch of the bistable curve. Higher magnon dissipation rate hinders the accumulation of nonlinear effect, narrowing the bistability window and shifting the threshold to higher pump powers. For optical bistability, stronger optomechanical interaction reduces the effective cavity loss and weakens the nonlinear response to the pump field, leading the amplitude of bistability to decrease and the hysteresis loop to narrow. The increase of the optical cavity-pump detuning suppresses energy transfer efficiency, necessitating higher pump power to achieve the same photon number, thereby enhancing the prominence of the bistability. Elevating the optical cavity dissipation rate requires stronger driving to compensate for photon losses, resulting in a narrower hysteresis loop and a rightward shift of the threshold. Sharp vertical jumps observed in the bistability curves correspond to instantaneous transitions at critical driving points, enabling switch-like behavior. Moreover, transient dynamics obtained by numerically solving the Langevin equations reveal the time evolution of magnon and photon numbers under nonequilibrium initial conditions. Within the bistability regime, the system exhibits quantum state transitions between low and high steady states. The transition rates are determined collectively by the system parameters. Therefore, this study provides a theoretical platform for the multi-parameter cooperative control of magnon and optical bistability. The tunability mechanism is governed by the joint action of coupling strength, detuning, and dissipation rate.
   The controllability of the bistability thresholds, hysteresis widths, and transient quantum state transition dynamics demonstrated in this work highlights the significant potential for applications such as tunable optical switches, quantum information processing devices, and fundamental studies of nonlinear quantum dynamics in hybrid systems.

TI First-Principles Simulation of Beam-Induced Processes Underlying Atomic
   Manipulation in Electron Microscopes
SO ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB The development of experimental methods and apparatuses capable of promoting atomically precise material manipulations holds great promise for realizing the ultimate limit of feature miniaturization in materials and devices. The ability to modify materials atom by atom is anticipated to usher in new technologies in areas as diverse as separation science, medicine, and quantum information science. Historically, scanning probe-based techniques have been the most prominent approaches in this space. However, these methods are best suited for the manipulation of surface-exposed regions of materials, as the strong perturbations required for bond scission are delivered most effectively to atoms in the near-proximity to the scanning probe. In contrast, convergent electron beams with energies tuned slightly below the threshold for inducing irreversible knock-on damage have recently been employed (within scanning transmission electron microscopy) to promote atomic-scale bond rearrangements in various beam-stable solids. Currently, however, the efficiency and selectivity of beam-induced atomic manipulation processes with focused electron beams are such that long irradiation times are required to induce a desired atomic rearrangement. With a better understanding of the underlying physics dictating the outcome of a given irradiation event, methods can be devised to improve the efficiency of these techniques so that their promise can be fully realized through widespread adoption.
   To this end, this Account details our recent efforts to develop and apply tractable first-principles simulation approaches for studying the response of materials to electric beam-like external electric potentials applied in real space. We briefly review the concepts and capabilities in the area of atomically precise materials manipulation and review the early demonstrations of accomplishments in this area, focusing on studies using scanned convergent electron beam probes in particular. We expound upon the depth of the challenge and identify critical shortcomings of theoretical methods that have previously been employed in the simulation of beam-induced processes. We then describe the computational methods that we have generalized from the concepts and tools most commonly applied to the study of molecular photochemistry and how our adaptations of these methods can be employed to capture the relevant dynamical phenomena for beam-induced processes ranging from the initial electron scattering to the ensuing multistate reactions. We contextualize these methods within the current state of the art in this area, which has historically focused primarily on the simulation of inelastic image formation in the electron microscope for the purpose of interpreting the results of quantitative electron microscopy experiments. We demonstrate that the spatial distribution of state-specific excitation rates due to the presence of an external (probe) electric charge is inhomogeneous, such that irradiation at particular locations in materials can favor specific electronic transitions (and disallow others). In addition to the potential for excited-state reaction pathways to be accessed through the initial inelastic scattering of the tightly focused electron beam from the targeted atoms, we also identify favorable conditions for the electronically nonadiabatic evolution of the highly vibrationally excited system to open complex multistate reaction pathways. Implications of the early results for understanding the mechanisms and potential routes to improved efficiency and selectivity in beam-induced reactions are discussed. We conclude with a summary of the current state of theory and modeling capabilities in this area and provide our perspective on future directions for theoretical and experimental developments that we view as crucial to advancing the use of convergent electron beams in mode-specific, atomically precise platforms for direct-write materials modifications.

TI Fabrication and applications of dielectric optical crystalline
   waveguides
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Optical waveguides, being defined as high refractive index cores surrounded by low-index layers. are the basic component for multi-functional integrated photonic systems. Generally, optical waveguide structures could confine the light propagation within very small regions of orders of several micrometers, in which the light intensities could reach very' high levels with respect to the bulk materials. Benefiting from this exceptional advantageous, capability of some features (e.g. nonlinear response. lasing performances. etc.) of many,' materials may be considerably enhanced to a certain extent in waveguide structures, enabling the implementations of highly efficient miniaturized and integrated platforms for a variety of photonic applications. In practice. channel (two dimensional. 2D) waveguides are more attractive than planar (one dimensional, 1D) waveguide structures because the former could restrict the light propagation in two dimensions. reaching higher optical density in more compact geometries, and are easier for constructions of more compact functional integrated devices.
   Dielectric crystals play important roles in many fields of optics and photonics. For example, nonlinear crystals are important frequency converters of light at different wavelength regions. Laser crystals are the favorite and attractive gain mediums for solid-state laser systems with comparable low lasing thresholds and excellent thermal properties with respect to glasses. Electro-optic crystals are ideal platforms for the modulations of light phase, energy and polarizations. Up to now, various optical applications have been realized through a broad variety of crystal-based devices and components. Benefiting from this, crystalline waveguides, with the combination of compact geometry of channel waveguides and valuable features of crystals, could become unique platforms for versatile miniature and integrated photonic applications.
   As of yet, a few methods have been employed to fabricate channel waveguides in crystals, including femtosecond (fs) laser micromachining, focus proton beam writing, ion implantation/irradiation, etc. Among these. fs laser micromachining has recently emerged as one of the most efficient techniques for direct three-dimensional microfabrication of transparent optical materials. During this process, fs laser pulses focused beneath the surface of a crystal are absorbed through nonlinear photoionization mechanisms. giving rise to a permanent localized modification with dimensions on the order of micro or submicrometre. By a suitable adjustment of the irradiation parameters, one could induce a localized refractive index modification, enabling direct channel waveguide fabrication by simple scanning the bulk materials, showing wide applicability in a large number of materials. Ion implantation/irradiation is also a powerful and efficient method for waveguide construction, which has been proved successful in more than 100 materials. Generally. ion implantation/ irradiation influences the refractive indices of the target materials mainly via physical mechanisms, which are independent on the chemical properties of the target materials. Benefiting this unique feature, ion implantation/irradiation has a wide applicability to most optical materials. Particularly, by combinations of fs laser micromachining or precise diamond dicing, 2D channel waveguide structure could be efficiently fabricated on the surface of the substrate.
   In this review, we will introduce femtosecond laser direct writing and energetic ion irradiation of crystalline waveguides (including crystalline thin films) and their related waveguide properties. The applications of dielectric waveguides in laser generation, nonlinear optical frequency conversion, signal modulation, and quantum information are reviewed.

TI Simulation and Experimental Verification of Quantum Non-Demolition
   Measurement in Strongly Coupled Optical Ring Cavity
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Strong coupling interactions between light and atoms in high-finesse optical cavities are fundamental to numerous cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) experiments. In multi-atom ensembles, quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements of atom number enabled by strong coupling allow for the generation of spin-squeezed states, thus enhancing the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as atomic clocks, atom interferometers, and Rydberg atom arrays beyond the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we examine collective QND measurements of atom number in a strongly coupled optical ring cavity. By extracting the dispersive error signal via Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking, we simulate and verify the signals generated as the atomic ensemble traverses the cavity mode, which provides crucial technical support for the realization of spin-squeezed states in such systems. Methods A theoretical model describing the strong coupling between a cold atomic ensemble and an optical ring cavity is built. The Heisenberg-Langevin equations are solved to derive the equations of atomic motion. The PDH method is employed to lock the probe light to the ring cavity. Exploiting the dispersive characteristics of the PDH error signal, we establish a relationship between the atom-induced dispersive cavity frequency shift on the intracavity light field and the PDH error signal. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to model the frequency shift signals generated as the atomic ensemble passes through the cavity mode, incorporating both the dipole trapping force exerted by the intracavity light field and the scattering force caused by atomic spontaneous emission. Finally, the agreement between experimental data and simulation results is evaluated, providing a foundation for QND atom number measurement and enabling further estimation of the degree of number squeezing of the atomic ensemble. Results and Discussions Simulations of the cavity frequency shift signals are performed under three conditions: considering only atomic free expansion and gravity, adding dipole forces, and further including scattering forces, as shown in Fig. 3. When dipole forces are included, the amplitude of the cavity frequency shift signal increases and its width broadens, which can be attributed to atoms being partially trapped in the cavity mode's dipole potential and continuously influencing the signal. By contrast, under the scattering force, the cavity frequency shift amplitude decreases, and a long tail signal emerges. This phenomenon is explained by decoherence caused by atoms spontaneously emitting photons, while atoms remaining in the cavity mode continue scattering photons, producing the long tail. Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between the cavity frequency shift signal and the probe light detuning and the initial atomic position. The cavity frequency shift is approximately inversely proportional to the probe light detuning. Moreover, when the atomic cloud's initial position is closer to the cavity mode, the amplitude of the frequency shift signal increases, and the long tail is significantly enhanced, indicating that more atoms are trapped in the dipole potential. The experimental results presented in Fig. 5 closely match the Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, since the amplitude of the cavity frequency shift signal reflects the atom number, combining simulation results with experimental data enables estimation of the number of atoms coupled into the cavity mode, facilitating non-demolition atom number measurement.
   To further characterize the degree of atomic number squeezing and the lifetime of squeezed states, it is essential to measure correlations between pre-and post-measurement states of the atomic ensemble. Furthermore, constructing dipole potentials or optical lattices within a ring cavity to trap and guide atoms can enable enhanced squeezed atomic interferometers, gyroscopes, and other quantum sensing devices. Conclusions In this paper, we investigate collective QND measurement methods for atom number in a strongly coupled optical ring cavity. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to model the cavity frequency shift signals induced by a freely falling atomic ensemble passing through the cavity mode. The results demonstrate that both the dipole trapping effect of the probe light circulating inside the cavity mode and the scattering force caused by atomic spontaneous emission affect the cavity frequency shift induced by the atoms. The effects of parameters such as probe light detuning and initial atomic position on the cavity frequency shift are analyzed. Experimental observations are consistent with simulation results, validating the feasibility of this method for collective QND atom number measurement and providing critical technical support for the generation of atomic spin-squeezed states. The research approach and findings offer valuable insights for investigating novel quantum phenomena and many-body entanglement effects in emerging optical microcavity systems, such as fiber ring cavities and lithium niobate optical microcavities.

TI Generation and Mode Recognition Method of Vectorial Vortex Beams
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Similar to macroscopic objects, photons can also carry angular momentum, such as spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum ( OAM). The two angular momenta contribute to a new structured beam, the vectorial vortex beam (VVB). A VVB has anisotropic wavefront and polarization distributions, thus providing multiple degrees of freedom and showing great potential in lots of advanced domains including quantum technology, laser communications, laser detection, laser processing, high-resolution imaging, and optical tweezers, attracting much attention around the world. The key to employing VVBs in these above scenarios is their generation and recognition with high performance. We review recent advances in generating and diagnosing VVBs in brief. In addition, we also systematically review research on this topic from our team in the past decade and focus more on our representative achievements. Progress This review consists of three main sections. The basic principles of VVBs are introduced in the first section. The introduction begins with the decomposition of VVBs, as a VVB can be regarded as the coaxial superposition of two scalar beams with opposite SAM and various OAMs. Then, typical representations of VVBs, the hybrid order Stokes parameters, and Poincare spheres are reviewed. Finally, our recent demonstration for VVB mode representation, the fourparameter notation, and its great performance is introduced. The second section presents recent advances in VVB generation, including extra- and intra- cavity generations. The extra-cavity generation scheme is to transform other beams containing Gaussian beams and Hermit- Gauss beams into VVBs outside a laser resonator, whose principle is based on the decomposition of VVBs. In addition, such a scheme is flexible to produce more complex vectorial vortex fields, including the VVB array and perfect vortex array. By employing programmable devices of the liquid- crystal spatial light modulator, VVBs can also be generated digitally. The intra- cavity generation scheme is to output VVBs from a laser resonator directly. One can place multiple devices or optical elements inside the cavity, thereby leading to the oscillation of high-order transverse modes including VVBs. One of the most common intra-cavity elements is Q- plate, with photon SAM-OAM conversion elements fabricated based on photon spin Hall effect. Such elements can transform the oscillated fundamental mode to vectorial vortex mode and meet with the mode self-consistence in a laser cavity. Furthermore, the spatial light modulator can also be employed as part of the resonator to replace the end mirror to form a "digital laser" and enable VVBs output. Our recent work is also presented emphatically in this section, including eye-safe solid VVB lasers, single frequency VVB lasers, and nonplanar ring oscillator VVB lasers. The third section presents recent advances in the vectorial vortex mode recognition. Vectorial vortex mode origins from the classical entanglement of SAM and OAM. Thus a VVB is also a total angular momentum (TAM) mode, and vectorial vortex mode recognition is equivalent to TAM measurement. As photon SAM has only two eigenvalues, the key to vectorial vortex mode recognition is to measure OAM distribution. This section introduces more about OAM analysis developed by our team, including universal OAM spectrum analyzer, deep learning-assisted OAM spectrum measurement, and photon OAM sorter.
   The universal OAM spectrum analyzer is based on the helical harmonic decomposition of beams, which is the definition of the OAM spectrum. Therefore, such an analyzer is universal and appropriate for beams with any patterns. The deep leaning-assisted OAM spectrum measurement is to extract OAM features firstly and analyze the extracted pattern through our developed convolutional neural network, the adjusted EfficientNet. The OAM sorter is accomplished through our developed multi-ring azimuthal-quadratic phase, and supports up to 73 OAM modes. Prospects We hope this review will provide more useful information for people who study VVBs and their applications, and inspire more novel and wonderful ideas.

TI Metasurfaces-Empowered Optical Micromanipulation (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Optical micromanipulation utilizes optical force to dynamically control particles, which has the characteristics of non-contact and can be operated in a vacuum environment. Since the invention of optical tweezers in the 1980s, the field has experienced rapid development and has given rise to many emerging research directions, such as holographic optical tweezers, near-field evanescent wave optical tweezers, fiber optic tweezers, optoelectronic tweezers, and photo-induced temperature field optical tweezers, providing rich and powerful tools for fields such as biology, chemistry, nanoscience, and quantum technology. These methods can not only capture, separate, and transport small objects but also allow more precise manipulation, such as the rotation of small objects. However, traditional manipulation methods rely on tightly focused local light, greatly limiting the action range of optical force. In addition, in order to generate a structured light field, larger optical components such as spatial light modulators are usually required, making it difficult to miniaturize and integrate the optical manipulation system.
   In recent years, metasurfaces have emerged as integrated devices composed of subwavelength nanoantennas, promising new opportunities for optical micromanipulation. This ultra-thin artificial microstructure device can flexiblely control multiple degrees of freedom such as amplitude, phase, and polarization of light, by specially designing the geometric shape, size, and material of its own micro/nanostructure. Compared with traditional optical components such as liquid crystal spatial light modulators, gratings, and lenses, metasurfaces exhibit higher operating bandwidth, structural compactness, and integration. With the merits of miniaturization, integration, and excellent performance in light tailoring, optical metasurfaces have been extensively incorporated into the realm of optical micromanipulation. Especially, owing to their peculiar photomechanical properties, the metasurfaces hold the ability to be actuated by light fields, paving the way to the next generation of light-driven artificial micro-robots. The fast development of this subject indicates that the time is now ripe to overview recent progress in this cross-field.
   Progress We summarized principles of optical micromanipulation and metasurfaces (Fig. 1) and overviewed meta-manipulation devices, including metasurface-based optical tweezers (Fig. 2), tractor beams (Fig. 5), multifunctional micromanipulation systems (Fig. 3), and metamachines (Figs. 7 and 8). Furthermore, we provided a detailed discussion of novel mechanical effects, such as topological light manipulation, which stems from the topological characteristics of nanostructures (Fig. 6).
   Conclusions and Prospects We review the cutting-edge developments in the field of optical micromanipulation based on metasurfaces. The metasurface-based micromanipulation technology is expected to evolve toward higher temporal resolution, higher spatial accuracy, and lower manipulation power. To this end, more urgent requirements have been imposed on the underlying design scheme and experimental preparation standards of the metasurface. Although the introduction of metasurfaces has benefited micromanipulation systems and significantly reduced their sizes, there is still much room for further development and improvement in wide bands, multi-dimensional responses, and device thresholds.
   In terms of micromanipulation systems, the subwavelength-scale structure of metasurfaces will continue to be a key focus of research. Especially in the field of topological light manipulation, it is expected to further expand its research scope, combining non-Abelitan, non-Hermitian, and nonlinear effects to discover new physical phenomena. In the fields of biology and chemistry, metasurface technology is expected to be flexibly applied on smaller scales, even achieving manipulation of single molecule-level objects. This technology is expected to be further applied to the fields such as battery quality inspection and targeted therapy, bringing changes to the basic research and practical applications of energy and life sciences. Specifically, in the development of ultrafast optics, metasurfaces are gradually exhibiting unique advantages. Nanoscale superlattice enables high-resolution spectral measurements, and the design of nonlinear superlattice surfaces can be used to enhance nonlinear effects or generate high-order harmonics, making high time resolution transient micromanipulation technology possible.
   Overall, the technological evolution from traditional optical micromanipulation to meta-manipulation will continue to drive the vigorous development of nanophotonics. This technological paradigm not only meets the needs of various basic research but also arouses more innovative applications, opening up new prospects for branched sciences and technologies.

TI Biexciton Emission in Semiconductor Quantum Dots br
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Biexcitons are exciton pairs which interact via Coulomb interactions and recombine to emit two photons. Compared with single excitons? biexcitons are achieved under a high excitation intensity. The physical model of the biexciton can be simplified as two electrons at the bottom of the conduction band and two holes at the top of the valence band. The luminescence process of biexcitons involves the cascade recombination of two excitons? and the intensity of the biexcitons shows a quadratic scale as a function of the excitation intensity.Biexcitons were first observed in CuCl by Mysyrowicz et al. in 1968 and then extended to other semiconductor materials? including II-VI (ZnSe and CdS? and III-V (GaAs?. In the 1980s? the study of biexcitons spread to low-dimensional semiconductors? such as quantum wells or quantum dots (QDs?? resulting in the discovery of entangled photon pairs as well as predicted advances as a laser gain medium. In the last 40 years? QDs have been widely studied owing to their size-dependent optical properties and potential applications in photonics and optoelectronics. Owing to their well-known quantum confinement effects? QDs offer strong light absorption and a discrete electronic state structure. Therefore? biexcitons in QDs have unique features? including the large binding energy? correlated polarization of the emitted photons? low threshold?and enhanced temperature stability in lasing. These properties provide the advantages of realizing an on-demand entangled photon source and laser diodes.Progress The entangled photons can be generated by biexciton-exciton cascade emission or Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM? interference from indistinguishable photons in QDs (Fig.5?. The degenerate exciton state is a superposition state and emits an exciton photon with opposite circular polarization with respect to the polarization of previously emitted biexciton photons. In 2006? Stevenson et al.demonstrated entangled photon pairs from a single InAs QD. Subsequently? InAs QDs were optimized to achieve high-quality entangled photons with reduced exciton polarization splitting. In 2019? Pan et al. performed a Boson sampling experiment using 20 pure single photons generated by a single InAs/GaAs QD. These results are significant breakthroughs in the field of quantum information and have inspired increased efforts to explore QD-based quantum light sources.In addition to the progress in self-assembled QDs? colloidal QDs have also received considerable attention because of their solution processability and easier spectral tunability. Because of the atom-like discrete structure of the electronic states in QDs? the population inversion is realized only when a fraction of QDs is excited with biexcitons (Fig.7?. The presence of biexcitons leads to an intrinsic nonradiative Auger recombination (Fig.6?. Owing to the efforts of Klimov et al.? several strategies have been successfully developed to suppress Auger recombination by controlling the electronic structure of QDs. Recently? Sargent etal. used the long Auger lifetime of thick-shell CdSe/CdS QDs to realize continuous wave (CW? lasing. The observed thresholds were 6.4-8.4kW/cm2. Klimov et al.used alloyed CdSe/CdxZn1-xSe/ZnSe0.5S0.5 QDs to fabricate a light-emitting diode architecture with a high-current focusing. This electrical pumping device shows a population inversion of the band-edge states in the absorption spectrum.
   Conclusions and Prospects Because biexcitons in QDs exhibit unique advantages in achieving entangled photon sources and quantum-dot lasers? exploring the photophysics of biexcitons in QDs is of great interest. Although significant progress has been made in recent years? there are still many challenges? such as increasing the number of entangled photons to enhance the quantum advantage?maintaining the high fidelity of entangled photons in long-distance transmission? and exploring new methods to suppress Auger recombination more effectively to realize electrically pumped colloid-quantum-dot lasers.

TI High-throughput DNA extraction strategy for fecal microbiome studies
SO MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB Microbiome studies are becoming larger in size to detect the potentially small effect that environmental factors have on our gut microbiomes, or that the microbiome has on our health. Therefore, fast and reproducible DNA isolation methods are needed to handle thousands of fecal samples. We used the Chemagic 360 chemistry and Magnetic Separation Module I (MSMI) instrument to compare two sample preservatives and four different pre-treatment protocols to find an optimal method for DNA isolation from thousands of fecal samples. The pre-treatments included bead beating, sample handling in tube and plate format, and proteinase K incubation. The optimal method offers a sufficient yield of high-quality DNA without contamination. Three human fecal samples (adult, senior, and infant) with technical replicates were extracted. The extraction included negative controls (OMNIgeneGUT, DNA/RNA shield fluid, and Chemagic Lysis Buffer 1) to detect cross-contamination and ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard as a positive control to mimic the human gut microbiome and assess sensitivity of the extraction method. All samples were extracted using Chemagic DNA Stool 200 H96 kit (PerkinElmer, Finland). The samples were collected in two preservatives, OMNIgeneGUT and DNA/RNA shield fluid. DNA quantity was measured using Qubit-fluorometer, DNA purity and quality using gel electrophoresis, and taxonomic signatures with 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing with V3V4 and V4 regions. Bead beating increased bacterial diversity. The largest increase was detected in gram-positive genera Blautia, Bifidobacterium, and Ruminococcus. Preservatives showed minor differences in bacterial abundances. The profiles between the V3V4 and V4 regions differed considerably with lower diversity samples. Negative controls showed signs from genera abundant in fecal samples. Technical replicates of the Gut Standard and stool samples showed low variation. The selected isolation protocol included recommended steps from manufacturer as well as bead beating. Bead beating was found to be necessary to detect hard-to-lyse bacteria. The protocol was reproducible in terms of DNA yield among different stool replicates and the ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard. The MSM1 instrument and pre-treatment in a 96-format offered the possibility of automation and handling of large sample collections. Both preservatives were feasible in terms of sample handling and had low variation in taxonomic signatures. The 16S rRNA target region had a high impact on the composition of the bacterial profile.IMPORTANCE Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a widely used method for determining the composition of the gut microbiota. Due to the differences in the gut microbiota composition between individuals, microbiome studies have expanded into large population studies to maximize detection of small effects on microbe-host interactions. Thus, the demand for a rapid and reliable microbial profiling is continuously increasing, making the optimization of high-throughput 96-format DNA extraction integral for NGS-based downstream applications. However, experimental protocols are prone to bias and errors from sample collection and storage, to DNA extraction, primer selection and sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses. Methodological bias can contribute to differences in microbiome profiles, causing variability across studies and laboratories using different protocols. To improve consistency and confidence of the measurements, the standardization of microbiome analysis methods has been recognized in many fields.

AB We discuss the torsion geometries as the universal dynamical setting for the five-fold symmetry and its relation to nonorientable surfaces of selfreference embodying a supradual logophysics, rooted in the Mobius strip and Klein Bottle. We frame the discussion in terms of image-schemas in cognitive semantics and their disruption stemming from supraduality and nonorientability. We present the relation with anholonomic phases, chaos and the brain-mind as an integrated dynamical system. We discuss nonorientability as the characteristic transcendental metapattern of resonant connection, pattern formation and recognition. We present the torsion geometry and nonorientability in psychophysics and the neurosciences. We discuss the homology of the torsion geometry of physical space or spacetime with that of the unconscious modelization by the brain-mind of the kinematics of objects in physical space and in the perception of music, elaborating on the Principle of Complementarity of cognitive psychology due to Shepard. We elaborate on the phenomenological construal of experience, the world as experience. We discuss the supraduality of the liminal states of consciousness and the basis of awareness in memory. We introduce the cognitive psychology foundations of memory on nonorientability and its relations to the short-memory space and its quantumlike nature, and the hyperbolicity of the psychophysics of vision. We discuss the chaotic behaviour of dynamical systems as a manifestation of supraduality as their nonorientability. We propose a basis for the source of consciousness, the Hard Problem, given by the principles of selfreference and hetero-reference which generate the Klein Bottle supradual logophysics. We present the supradual logophysics of neuron cytoskeletal structures, its relation to torsion, resonances, topological and geometrical phases and the microtubule dynamics in terms of nonlinear buckling patterns and nonorientability, and still the torsion geometry of the irreversible thermodynamical processes supporting interactions-at-a-distance. We discuss the primal relation of torsion, nonorientability and memory, particularly arising in the buckling of microtubules. We discuss the primal morphogenesis of the cell as a tensegrity structure, torsion and the indiscernibility of elastodynamics, electromagnetic and gravitational wavefronts as morphogenetic fields. We discuss nonorientability as the metaform pattern of connection and resonance, particularly of interaction-at-a-distance. We apply it to a topological allosteric effect mediated by electromagnetic fields. We discuss the topological chemistry paradigm, particularly of organic chemistry where conformation superposition is crucial, its relation to anaesthetics and its application to the ORC OR theory of Penrose and Hameroff for consciousness as arising from the collapse of the wave function which we relate to the multiconformation in the topological chemistry paradigm.We propose a model of continuous signal processing in digital terms which allows an optimal reconstruction -from digital to continuous- in terms of the Nyquist-Shannon theorem whose constraints on frequencies and bandwidths is naturally interpreted in the terms of the 2:1 harmonics of nonorientability in the Mobius strip or Klein Bottle. We discuss the non-dual logic of the tubulin code and the resonator nature of the neuronal cytoskeleton.
   We propose that the topological phases appearing in the cytoskeleton may correspond to the topological anholonomity, namely, nonorientability, as was elicited empirically by the Bandyopadhyay group, the existence of anholonomity corresponding to the 360 degrees rotation characteristic of the topological anholonomity, Mobius strip. We propose the Matrix Logic representation of the Klein Bottle logic as the basis for microtubule computations, and discuss the relation to quantum computation, topological entanglement and the topological coherence/decoherence Klein Bottle cycle. We also relate it to holography, the brain's integration and Velmans' Reflexive Monism extended by Rapoport. We discuss the multiconformation orientable and nonorientable resonators electronic devices and antennas as classical-quantum realisations of microtubule coherent behaviour. We discuss the relation of life and consciousness and the topological nonorientable embodiment of memory. We introduce the dynamical reduction program for the collapse of the quantum state in terms of the torsion stochastic differential geometry of the quantum geometry of Quantum Mechanics as projective space, and particularly the stochastic extension of the Schroedinger equation to account for the coupling of quantum system and environment, say a measurement apparatus. Thus we identify a realisation of the dynamical reduction program which is based on the torsion geometry, yet supports an agent-free collapse of the quantum state, as an objective albeit random process due to quantum fluctuations. We shall discuss the present supradual logophysics in several aspects such as 1) microtubule structure and dynamics, 2) the orientable and nonorientable conformations of organic molecules, 3) the relation with anaesthetics and the altered states of consciousness and 4) confront them with the tenets of Penrose & Hameroff ORC OR theory for the origin of consciousness, not only the topological chemistry but their choice of a superposition of null torsion as in General Relativity, which renders a trivial selfreferentiality, with the topological chemistry multiconformations which requires non-null torsion. The nontrivial selfreferentiality is both proper to the mind and the torsion geometry, be that on the physical, chemical, perceptual or cognitive domains. All in all, we propose that consciousness is neither based on panpsychism nor the collapse of quantum states, nor exclusively on the control of superposition of conformations of organic chemistry, but rather on the torsion-nonorientable geometry-topology based on the principles of selfreference and hetero-reference, operating in all domains: that of meaning,the mental-anatomical-physiological domain, structural processes of matter energy and in-formation, be that physical, chemical, biological, cognitive and perception. We present a remarkable connection between them. Our approach rather than multidisciplinary will be transdisciplinary, a possibility supported on supraduality - transcending the dual-logic based logophysics- from which the theory will follow in a rather smooth way.

TI Study of Gas Sensing Based on Electromagnetic Induced Transparency⁃ Like
   Effect in Coupled Microcavities
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective This study explores the feasibility and superiority of coupled cavities as electromagnetically induced transparent (EIT) excitation media. The EIT effect is realized by the coupled cavity structure, and its performance in gas sensing is investigated, including its sensitivity, detection limit, and selective recognition ability for different gases. In addition, we analyze the influence of the coupling cavity spacing on the EIT excitation and gas sensing performance to provide new ideas for the development of high- performance optical sensor devices. Methods The study is based on the coupled-mode theory, and the simulation model of the EIT-like effect of the coupled cavity is constructed using the finite difference in the time domain (FDTD) method for simulation. By optimizing the structure of the double- ring coupled cavity, the EIT-like effect is realized, and the refractive index sensing tests of several gases (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and chlorine) that are conventionally employed in the industry are carried out using this effect. The size, spacing, intrinsic loss, and coupling loss of the coupling cavity are considered in this study, and the EIT-like effect is modulated by changing these parameters and analyzing their effects on the gas sensing performance. Results and Discussions The results show that the coupling cavity can be employed effectively as an excitation medium for the EIT-like effect and that when the EIT is excited, its sensitivity is stable and can reach 205.166 nm/RIU, despite the decrease in sensitivity. The limit of detection (LOD) value reaches 7.46x10(-4) RIU, and it is optimized by a factor of 4.16 with respect to that of the unexcited EIT. This indicates that the coupling cavity structure has significant potential for applications in optical sensing, especially for improving the sensitivity and detection limit of the sensor. The effect of the coupling-cavity spacing on the excitation of the EIT is discussed in this paper. Researchers have observed the generation and variation of EIT-like effects by varying the spacing between the coupling cavities M1 and M2. As the spacing increases, the coupling loss increases, leading to the gradual absorption of the transparent peaks; however, when the spacing reaches a certain value, the EIT-like effect becomes obvious and the resolution and detection limit performance of the sensor are significantly improved. In addition, this study explores the refractive index sensitivity properties of the EIT-like effect under different gas environments. It is found that the change in the refractive index induced by gas molecules affects the waveguide transmission efficiency of the coupled mode, which thereby affects the position of the transparent peak in the EIT-like effect. By analyzing the corresponding transmission spectral line shapes and wavelength shifts of different gases, this study confirms that the coupling-cavity structure has a good selective recognition ability for different gases. Conclusions EIT media have the significant potential for application in several fields, including optical communication, optical pulse storage, and quantum information processing. The coupling cavity is an excellent medium for the study of EIT, owing to its advantages of a highly localized optical field, strong tunability, and simple structure. In this study, the feasibility and superiority of coupling cavities as EIT excitation media are investigated based on coupled mode theory.
   Utilizing FDTD simulations, this study investigates EIT-like excitation in coupled cavities for the selective identification of common gases in industrial applications. Additionally, the impact of the coupling distance on EIT-like excitation, as well as the sensor performance, including refractive index sensitivity and detection limit, is explored. The sensitivity of the EIT excitation is reduced, but it is approximately stable and can reach 205.166 nm/RIU. Moreover, the limit of detection reaches 7.46x10(-4) RIU, which is approximately 4.16 times that of the corresponding unexcited value. The results show that the coupling cavity has important research value in the field of electromagnetically induced transparent sensing and provides new ideas for the further realization of optical devices with easy tuning and ultralow detection limits.

TI Progress and Challenges of Optical Logic Computation (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Logic computing, a digital computational process grounded in Boolean logic, involves the processing of discrete signals through logic gates. It plays a pivotal role across numerous disciplines, including computer science, communications and electronics engineering, artificial intelligence, and emerging quantum computing, providing fundamental support for technological innovation and progress in modern information society. Chips serve as the hardware foundation for logic computing, executing fundamental computational tasks through logic circuits. These circuits, composed of tens of billions of transistors, enable chips to perform large-scale computations. The architectural design of a chip dictates its computational speed and efficiency, with distinct architectures tailored to specific computational tasks. Moreover, advancements in chip manufacturing technologies have fostered innovations in computational paradigms. Enhanced chip processes have led to devices with lower power consumption and greater performance, fueling the rapid expansion of big data, the Internet of Things, cloud services, and the rise of artificial intelligence. However, power consumption constraints have caused chip clock frequencies to plateau at a few gigahertz, and quantum uncertainty has rendered electronic transistors unreliable at nanoscale dimensions. Consequently, continued chip development is increasingly challenged in adhering to Moore's Law. Additionally, the growing demand for computational power across emerging fields has exposed significant bottlenecks in traditional electronic computing, which reveals a substantial gap between current capabilities and actual requirements. Optical computing, with its advantages of high parallelism, low power consumption, low latency, and independence from advanced fabrication processes, offers a promising path to overcome Moore's Law limitations. It holds the potential for the creation of high-performance, low-power chips. Extensive experience with digital circuits in very large-scale integration (VLSI) has demonstrated the critical role of logic computing due to its superior noise tolerance and high stability. By harnessing the low-power driving capabilities of optoelectronic devices, reconfigurable logic gates can execute a range of logic functions with ultra-low power consumption. The vast bandwidth of optical devices enables programmable logic arrays (PLAs) to dramatically enhance computational power. Additionally, the inherent speed of light propagation significantly reduces computational delays in arithmetic logic units (ALUs). Optical logic computing is emerging as a critical paradigm for the next generation of general-purpose photonic computing. While optical logic computing offers substantial performance benefits over traditional electronic chips, its large-scale implementation and application remain fraught with challenges. In recent years, discussions on its research progress and future development have been limited. Therefore, summarizing the existing research is essential to provide a sound foundation for the future trajectory of this field. Progress We provide an overview of the progress in optical logic computing and compare key metrics across different technological approaches. First, we define logic computing, discuss the conflict between computational power demands and chip development, and review recent advancements and landmark achievements in the field of optical logic computing. Then, we introduce the two primary paradigms of optical logic computing (Fig.
   1): one based on linear and nonlinear optical effects for all-optical logic computing (Fig. 2), and the other based on thermo-optic, electro-optic, and phase-change effects for electro-optic logic computing (Fig. 5). These paradigms hold great promise for constructing high-speed, high-performance, and energy-efficient systems in the post-Moore era, where traditional electronic logic computing faces bottlenecks in computational power and energy consumption. They represent critical paradigms for the next generation of general-purpose photonic computing. The development of these paradigms has evolved from simple logic gates to programmable logic arrays, and further to general-purpose computing systems, such as state machines and cellular automata. Notably, progress has been made in overcoming bit-width limitations, with a shift toward three-dimensional integration. In addition, the emergence of more advanced logic paradigms in recent years, combined with the improvement of automated design methods, has propelled modularization. Hybrid digital-analog neural networks and two-dimensional cellular automata highlight the potential of optical logic computing to address large-scale computational tasks. We also explore the advantages, disadvantages, and potential breakthroughs of various technological routes (Tables 1 and 2), summarizing the significant challenges currently faced by both all-optical and electro-optical logic computing, including issues related to bit-width expansion, performance enhancement, energy consumption reduction, and programmability. Central challenges include excessive link loss, difficulties in cascading devices, and obstacles in restoring logic signals (Figs. 7 and 8). Conclusions and Prospects The performance enhancement of contemporary general-purpose computing systems relying on electronic architectures has hit a bottleneck. Optical logic computing presents an opportunity to achieve breakthroughs in computational power, energy efficiency, and parallelism. The first step towards realizing this vision is to overcome the bandwidth, switching power, and device losses associated with electro-optic logic modulators while developing optical parallel logic and electro-optic multi-level loading to address bit-width limitations. This helps bridge the gap from fully electronic to fully optical general-purpose computing using electro-optic logic. The second step involves optimizing the loss and energy consumption of nonlinear optical devices, developing parallelizable all-optical nonlinear modules, and configuring programmable, general-purpose all-optical logic arrays. As diverse optical logic computing devices and architectures are demonstrated, optical logic computing becomes a fundamental building block for achieving arbitrary functionality in digital computing. This will bring revolutionary performance advancements in applications such as data centers, ultra-parameterized large models, and supercomputers.

TI Photoemission Orbital Tomography for Organic Nanomaterials br
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB SignificanceDevelopment of nanotechnology in the last few decades have witnessed the miniaturization of semiconductor devices and new challenges such as building a quantum computer using novel physical phenomena. On the fundamental level, however, many aspects in the understanding of physical properties at interfaces between materials are still in the exploration stage, and precise experimental and theoretical descriptions of complex surface structures are always difficult but crucial for practical applications. In the subfield of organic electronics that studies the solid-molecule interfaces, such as in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays or organic solar cells, the frontier orbitals of molecules are prime determinants of chemical, optical and electronic properties in the devices.For a long time, physicists and chemists have dreamed of experimentally imaging molecular orbitals, which contain information on the spatial distribution of the electrons at a certain energy. To date, experimental methods for this purpose include femtosecond laser spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy, which have gained widespread interest but also have some limitations. For example, high-order harmonic generation process based on ultrashort laser pulses is limited to the study of simple gas-phase molecules, and methods based on scanning probe microscopy require extremely low temperature to prevent molecular diffusion. In comparison, photoemission orbital tomography (POT) is based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) at room temperature with less restricted experimental conditions. As a combined experimental and theoretical technique, POT focuses on establishing a direct link between the photoelectron angular distribution and the initial-state molecular orbital structure. By using a relatively simple plane-wave approximation, one can perform accurate analysis of the angle-resolved photoemission spectra for pi-conjugated molecules on surface to study their respective properties.ProgressSince POT deals with the photoemission experimental data, the correct description should be Dyson orbitals. Because of the fact that Dyson orbitals closely resemble one-electron Kohn-Sham orbitals calculated from density functional theory (DFT), the simple one-electron picture is often used. By approximating the final state of photoelectrons by a plane wave, it can be shown that the photocurrent arising from one particular initial state, appearing as an intensity map (so-called k-map) in momentum space, is proportional to the Fourier transform (FT) of the initial state wave function (Fig.1). This tomographic relationship can be refined by taking two additional aspects into consideration: the first is to treat the final state with a damped plane wave in the z direction (Fig.2),and the second is to include a modulating term of polarization-dependent geometry factor (Fig.3). Experimentally, it is favorable to obtain a large detectable momentum-space range for the applications of POT. Suitable ARPES apparatuses include photoemission electron microscope, NanoESCA, toroidal electron analyzer, and time-of-flight momentum microscope.The accuracy and precision of the POT method have been proved by accumulating results in the past decade and several applications are introduced. Agreement between experimental ARPES results and calculated k-maps can be well utilized to determine the molecular orientation, if all orientation domains are properly considered.
   On the other hand, one could also infer the molecular orientations by comparing the measured k-maps with the theoretical ones based on the single molecule (Fig.4). POT, being capable of mapping the angular distribution of the wave function for each peak in conventional photoemission spectra, is an ideal technique to unambiguously identify the energy levels of molecular orbitals (Fig.5). If multiple molecular orbitals coexist in a small energy window, POT can provide an orbital-by-orbital characterization via deconvolution and create benchmark for ab initio electronic structure theory (Fig.6). Efforts have also been made to regain the lost phase information of orbital in the FT process (Fig.7) and even reconstruct the orbital in real space (Fig.8). Quantitative studies using POT have covered topics such as intra- and intermolecular band dispersion (Fig.9), delocalized pi-states and localized Sigma-states, nonplanar molecules, electron-phonon coupling (Fig.10), aromaticity, and the list continues.Conclusions and ProspectsThe overall experimental simplicity of POT and the convenience to approach molecular orbital and its Fourier transform under the plane-wave final state approximation are key reasons for the wide application of the technique. Albeit not applicable to some data from photoelectron diffraction and circular dichroism experiments, this approximation can provide a new perspective to study physical processes such as orbital hybridization by analyzing the discrepancy between theory and experiment.Future research on POT will improve the theoretical basis of the technique by implementing the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), providing more accurate predictions of the photoelectrons' momentum distribution. In combination with ultrafast lasers, POT has great potential to be extended into the time domain. For example, real-time observation of molecular orbitals in momentum space during excitation processes (Fig.11) or chemical reactions will greatly improve the understanding of ultrafast dynamics. With the help of advanced momentum microscopy, such as spin-resolved ARPES and NanoARPES, it is likely to further enhance the characterization capabilities of POT in momentum and real spaces and expand its application in materials science, physical chemistry, and nanophotonics

TI Theory, Progress, and Application of Optical Single Sideband Modulation
   Technology
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance As an important electro-optical modulation technique, the optical single sideband (OSSB) modulation technique has been widely used in the fields of laser communication, LIDAR, quantum optics, and quantum sensing owing to its advantages of easy electro-optical detection, low signal noise, and high spectral efficiency. For example, in optical communication, the OSSB modulation technique not only overcomes the power-fading problem caused by the mutual interference of phases of two sidebands in optical double sideband (ODSB) modulation but also improves the system receiving sensitivity and antidispersion ability, thus providing effective technical support for broadband communication. For cold atomic interferometry, OSSB modulation technology eliminates the adverse effects of redundant sidebands introduced by phase modulation, thus resulting in low phase noise and pure spectral Raman light. It is conducive to more accurate control of the atomic phase, reduces the effect on the accuracy of cold atomic interference, and improves the contrast of interference stripes. Consequently, the accuracy of cold atom interferometry has been significantly improved. OSSB modulation technology has been realized through various schemes, including optical filtering, phase-shift interference, and other methods. However, this technology has not been summarized systematically; therefore, its theory, progress, and application must be reviewed. Progress The optical-filtering method achieves OSSB modulation by filtering out the sideband of the ODSB signal. This method primarily utilizes fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and micro-ring resonators (MRRs) for optical-frequency screening to generate OSSB signals. Both techniques suppress specific sidebands through precise spectral selection to obtain the desired single-sideband signal. The fiber gratings typically used in optical filtering are uniform fiber Bragg gratings (UFBGs), phase-shift fiber gratings (PS FBGs), and Fabry -Perot fiber gratings (F-P FBGs). The refractive-index change amplitude and change period of the UFBG fiber core remain constant, and the bandwidth of the reflection spectrum is between 0.1 nm and 0.2 nm. Both PS FBGs and F-P FBGs are fabricated based on UFBGs. Extremely narrow filtering is achieved by introducing a phase-shift point or Fabry -Perot interferometer. The filtering bandwidths of the PS FBG and F-P FBG can reach less than 1 pm, which are three orders of magnitude higher than that of the UFBG, thus resulting in better filtering performance. The small footprint of the MRR allows it to be easily integrated into a single chip or photonic integrated circuits, thus enabling highly integrated optical systems. Additionally, the filtering characteristics of the MRR can be adjusted by fine-tuning the size of the ring or the environmental conditions, which provides a certain degree of flexibility. However, when the input power is extremely high, the MRR may exhibit nonlinear effects, such as four-wave mixing, which deteriorates its filtering performance. Moreover, the filtering bandwidth of the MRR is limited by its quality factor, which renders it difficult to achieve a wider bandwidth. Both the FBG and the MRR are sensitive to the ambient-temperature change, which results in transmission spectral drifts and affects the modulation. Thus, temperature control is required to stabilize the filtering characteristics. This paper summarizes the research status of OSSB modulation techniques based on the optical-filtering method (Table 1).
   The phase-shift interferometry method allows different beams to coincide and interfere in space by setting the driving conditions of the electro-optic modulator [dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) or in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulator] and precisely controlling the phases of different branched light waves; subsequently, the OSSB signal is generated by precisely controlling the phase difference. The DDMZM-based OSSB modulation can operate in a wide operating bandwidth for applications in different frequency ranges, thus allowing a large modulation depth to be realized. The DDMZM offers high filtering flexibility. However, it is easily affected by the external environment, thus resulting in subpar filtering stability. Therefore, the modulator filtering performance must be stabilized via temperature control; however, this increases the system complexity. Moreover, the OCSR of the OSSB signal generated by this method depends only on the modulation index, which renders further performance optimization challenging. The IQ modulator-based OSSB modulation technique allows the OCSR to be tuned within a wide range by controlling the bias voltage and the power of the radio frequency drive signal. However, the IQ modulator has a complex structure and requires multiple drive circuits. Moreover, its optical transmission loss can exceed 20 dB. Meanwhile, the electro-optic modulator is easily affected by the external environment, thus causing the optimal operating point to drift; however, this can be overcome via automatic bias control. We summarize the main technical indicators of the OSSB modulation technique based on phase-shift interferometry in Table 2. In addition to the methods above, OSSB modulation can be realized using Serrrodyne modulation, Sagnac interferometry, stimulated Brillouin scattering, and electro-absorptive modulation methods, which have been demonstrated experimentally. Conclusions and Prospects This paper reviews the research progress of OSSB modulation techniques. We first introduced the OSSB signal characteristics and modulation methods; subsequently, we described the principles and research progress of each modulation method. By systematically reviewing the related literature, we focused on analyzing and comparing the principles of the optical-filtering and phase-shift interferometry methods as well as their main technical indicators. Combined with other OSSB modulation methods, we elaborated the current status of their applications as well as their development trends and technical bottlenecks. Additionally, we highlighted the key development direction of on-chip integrated OSSB modulators. Owing to the rapid development of thin-film lithium niobate platforms, the prospect of fabricating large-bandwidth high-performance electro-optical modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate materials is promising.

TI RIN Characteristics of Yb⁃Doped Fiber Amplifier Tandem⁃Pumped by Single
   Frequency Laser
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective Single-frequency fiber lasers operating in the 1 mu m wavelength regime have become pivotal for scientific and industrial applications, including gravitational wave detection, coherent lidar system, and optical atomic clock, where low intensity noise and high output power are paramount. Traditional pumping schemes for Yb-doped fiber amplifiers (YDFAs) relying on 976 nm laser diodes (LDs) suffer from inherent limitations, including large quantum defect causing excessive thermal loading in the gain fiber and pumping-induced intensity fluctuations degrading the amplified laser stability. These limitations hinder their applicability in precision interferometry and frequency metrology, where even minor intensity fluctuations will propagate into systematic errors. Recent studies have explored tandem pumping strategy to mitigate these issues. By employing a pumping wavelength closer to the signal wavelength (e.g., 1018 nm pumping for 1064 nm amplification), quantum defect is minimized, and thermal deposition and excessive amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) are reduced. However, the relative intensity noise (RIN) characteristics of such tandem-pumped YDFAs, especially under high-power operation, are scarcely investigated. This study aims to analyze the RIN transmission and suppression mechanisms in a single-frequency YDFA at 1064 nm with maximum output power of 4 W, which is tandem-pumped by a single-frequency high-power laser at 1018 nm. Furthermore, in the same YDFA system, we explore the RIN performance under tandem pumping against that under conventional 976 nm LD pumping to quantify the RIN suppression in the frequency band of 10 Hz-10 MHz. This work provides a feasible method for designing low-RIN, high-power fiber amplifiers suitable for quantum technology and precision optical systems. Methods The single-frequency 1064 nm fiber laser consists of a semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) laser at 1064 nm with output power of 23 mW and a one-stage YDFA with gain fiber length of 4 m. The tandem pumping laser at 1018 nm is formed with a single-frequency semiconductor DFB seed laser and two-stage YDFAs. For the second YDFA at 1018 nm, a 27 W 976 nm LD is used as the pumping source and the active fiber is a 1.5 m long Yb-doped double-cladding fiber with core and cladding diameters of 15 mu m and 130 mu m. The maximum output power of the single-frequency 1018 nm laser reaches about 10 W. Two band-pass fiber filters at 1018 nm with bandwidth of 2 nm are spliced with the two ends of the first YDFA to remove the ASE generated from the seed and the first amplifier. The 1018 nm tandem pumping laser is coupled into the 1064 nm YDFA through a 1018/1064 nm wavelength division multiplexer (WDM). For comparison, an LD at 976 nm with maximum power of 27 W is employed as conventional pumping scheme for the 1064 nm YDFA. Both the 1018 nm tandem pumping and the 976 nm LD pumping can amplify the 1064 nm seed laser to 4 W power. The RIN measurements are conducted using a photodetector (150 MHz bandwidth) and a spectrum analyzer (26.5 GHz bandwidth). Results and Discussions At the output power of 4 W of the 1064 nm YDFA, the RIN level of the 1064 nm laser pumped using a single-frequency 1018 nm laser is below-125 dBc/Hz in the full range of 200 Hz-10 MHz, and the RIN level of the tandem-pumped YDFA output is reduced by 15 dB compared to that pumped using the 976 nm LD in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 100 kHz [Fig. 6(a)].
   Notably, in the frequency range of 200 Hz-50 kHz, the RIN level of the tandem-pumped laser is even lower than that of the seed laser. The better performance of the RIN suppression of the tandem pumping scheme is attributed to the high spectral purity and the low thermal loss. The spectra of the 1064 nm seed laser, the amplified 1064 nm laser pumped by 976 nm LD, and the amplified 1064 nm laser pumped by the 1018 nm single-frequency laser are investigated and shown in Fig. 6(b). The result reveals that the spectral proportion of the ASE is 0.31 degrees o for tandem-pumping and 0.58 degrees o for 976 nm LD pumping. Conclusions This study validates the effectiveness of tandem pumping for RIN suppression in single-frequency YDFAs. By utilizing a single frequency pumping laser at 1018 nm, the ASE and quantum defect are reduced in the 1064 nm YDFA, enabling a 15 dB RIN reduction in the frequency band of 100 Hz -100 kHz. While low-frequency (<100 Hz) noise remains terrible due to the excessive thermal and ambient noises, this passive RIN reduce strategy using tandem pumping offers a cost-effective alternative to complex active stabilization systems.

TI Coherent Modulation of Two-photon Ionization Photoelectron Spectra Under
   Excited by Chirped Field
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective The two-level system is the simplest system in the quantum system, and it is also the basic unit of other multi-level systems. Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the quantum properties of two-level system acting by light field for understanding the internal mechanism and physical essence of quantum effects. With the continuous development of laser technology, the interaction of ultra intense and ultra short laser pulses with atoms, molecules and other quantum systems has produced many new physical phenomena. In recent years, pulse shaping technology has been widely used to precisely control the coherent quantum effect by customizing and optimizing the characteristics of the light field. In this study, the optical field with a chirped frequency parameter is used to drive the excitation-ionization quantum system. The spectrum property of the ionization photoelectron of the quantum system can be effectively controlled by the chirp factor. The population probability of transition particles in the dressed state of the excited energy state, and the characteristics of ionized photoelectrons in the quantum system can be controlled by adjusting the chirp factor of the pump light, so as to achieve accurate and efficient quantum manipulation. Methods Under the rotating wave approximation and rotating coordinate transformation, the Hamiltonian operator of the interaction between the two-level system and the light field is obtained. Considering that the light field is a strongly chirped Gaussian field with the initial phase is zero, the particle population probability amplitudes of the two dressed states and excited states in the dressed state representation are obtained by solving the interaction Hamiltonian. Using perturbation theory, the probability amplitude of two-photon ionization photoelectron is calculated under the condition of weak field limit approximation, and the characteristics of ionization photoelectron spectrum of quantum system are obtained. Based on the dressed state theory and adiabatic following technique, the population probability of particles in dressed states modulated by different chirp factors is given. Results and Discussions The quantum properties of ionized photoelectrons in the excitation-ionization model under the influence of a strong chirped pulse light field are investigated by solving the Schr & ouml;dinger equation and using perturbation theory. The results reveal that the ionization photoelectron spectrum of the quantum system splits into two symmetrical spectral lines when the chirp factor of the light field is zero (Fig. 2). The reason is that the particles are equally likely to reside in the two dressed states when there is no chirp factor modulation, so the probability of ionization from the two dressed states is equal. However, an asymmetric distribution of spectral line splitting emerges when the chirp factor is non-zero. In the case of positive chirp, when the chirp factor is increased, the intensity of slow electron lines in the ionization spectrum gradually decreases, while the intensity of fast electron lines increases. In the case of negative chirp, the intensity of fast electron spectral lines gradually decreases with the increase of chirp factor, while the intensity of slow electron spectral lines gradually increases. When the positive and negative chirp factors reach a certain value respectively, only fast electron spectral lines or slow electron spectral lines can be detected in the ionization photoelectron spectrum (Fig. 3).
   In addition, the population probability of excited state particles is related to the absolute value of chirp factor. The positive and negative chirp factors with equal absolute values have the same effect on the population probability of excited state particles and on the population transfer efficiency. The selective population and evolution of particles in the dressed state are analyzed by the dressed state theory (Fig. 4). Positive chirp can conducive to the distribution of excited state particles in the upper dressed state, while negative chirp can conducive to the distribution of excited state particles in the lower dressed state. In the process of two-photon ionization, the electrons of ionization transition come from two different transition channels of dressed states. The interfere of two channels in the process of ionization transition results interference fringes on the envelope of ionization photoelectron spectrum. Through the adiabatic following technique, the selective population of particles in the dressed state in the quantum system modulated by the chirp factor of the light field is analyzed, so as to realize the coherent regulation of the ionization photoelectron spectrum. Conclusions The coherent modulation of the driving light field chirp factor on the two-photon ionization photoelectron spectrum in the excitation-ionization model is studied. The results show that the chirp factor of the pump light field has a very obvious modulation effect on the ionization photoelectron spectrum. The characteristics and laws of the chirp factor regulating the ionization photoelectron spectrum are analyzed through the theoretical calculation and dressing theory. The selective population of particles in the dressed state is realized by modulating the chirp factor of the light field, so as to realize the coherent regulation of the ionization photoelectron spectrum. The internal mechanism and physical essence of the interaction between the chirped light field and the quantum system are clearly presented. The results have certain theoretical guiding significance for the realization of precise quantum coherent control, and have potential application value in the fields of quantum communication, bond selection quantum chemistry and precision measurement.

TI Nonlocal Wavefront Correction: from Quantum to Classic to Computation
   (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Dispersion arises from the relative time delay caused by different propagation velocities of different angular frequency components (omega) in the medium, manifesting as temporal deformation of pulses. Diffraction stems from the divergence in propagation directions of angular wavenumber components (k), leading to spatial broadening of light beams. Both dispersion and aberration are wavefront distortions induced by the non-uniform response of the medium to the temporal and spatial modes of the optical field. Wavefront distortions fundamentally degrade performance across optical systems from astronomical telescopes and microscopes to communication networks and precision metrology. Classical correction methods operate locally, directly modulating the distorted wavefront. In contrast, nonlocal wavefront correction leverages correlations between photons separated in space or time to counteract distortions indirectly, offering unique advantages such as independence from the propagation path and resilience to certain types of noise. This approach not only challenges traditional paradigms of light control but also bridges quantum and classical optics, prompting profound discussions on the nature of correlations and their practical applications. Furthermore, the deep mathematical duality between dispersion and diffraction rooted in their shared formal structure under paraxial and narrowband approximations and their unification under Lorentz covariance in special relativity suggests the possibility of a unified theoretical framework for spatiotemporal wavefront control. We systematically review the research trajectory of nonlocal wavefront correction across two dimensions-temporal (dispersion) and spatial (aberration) domains. Progress The development of nonlocal wavefront correction has gone through three stages, each marked by conceptual and technical advances. The first stage begins with the experimental verification of Bell's inequalities and advances in entangled photon pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). In 1992, Franson proposed nonlocal dispersion cancellation by employing frequency-anti-correlated photon pairs, demonstrating that dispersion-induced broadening in one photon can be compensated by manipulating its entangled partner. Shortly after that, the HOM-interference-based scheme was developed, leveraging path symmetry to automatically cancel even-order dispersion without additional compensation. These principles were later extended to the spatial domain via quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT) and nonlocal aberration correction, with momentum anti-correlations and two-photon interference exploited to achieve dispersion-and aberration-free imaging with enhanced resolution. The second phase emerges from the recognition that classical correlation-as in pseudo-thermal light-can mimic certain quantum effects in second-order coherence. Inspired by the success of classical ghost imaging, researchers designed "nonlocal" dispersion and aberration cancellation schemes by adopting classical light sources. For instance, intensity-correlated beams with matched dispersion profiles can effectively cancel temporal broadening, while classical analogs of HOM interference are realized by leveraging chirped pulses. These studies clarify the boundaries between quantum and classical correlations. While classical schemes rely on statistical ensemble properties and often require symmetric setups, quantum methods exploit intrinsic entanglement, offering higher contrast and true nonlocality.
   The third stage represents the latest convergence of quantum-inspired concepts with computational imaging and adaptive optics. The emphasis shifts from physical compensation to algorithmic optimization. For example, computational wavefront shaping employs classical light and diffraction models to digitally emulate reference arms, enabling aberration correction without physical modulators. Meanwhile, adaptive quantum optics combines spatial light modulators with feedback control to correct unknown distortions in entangled systems, even in scattering media. These approaches benefit from the high flux and simplicity of classical light, with the conceptual advances of quantum information incorporated. Nonlocal wavefront correction has evolved into a vibrant multidisciplinary field bridging quantum physics, optical engineering, and information science. Its trajectory from quantum-inspired concepts to classical emulation and computational implementation reflects growing comprehension of optical correlations and coherence, paving the way for technologies in high-resolution imaging, secure communications, and remote sensing. Conclusions and Prospects A particularly promising direction lies in the integration of classical wave optics with computational imaging and machine learning. Techniques like computational wavefront shaping demonstrate that aberration correction can be achieved without physical reference beams-enabled entirely via algorithms. This synergy points toward the deeper convergence of quantum optics, computational science, and artificial intelligence, suggesting a paradigm shift toward intelligent hybrid sensing and imaging systems. Future efforts may focus on harnessing non-classical correlations for applications requiring extreme precision, such as remote time-frequency transfer, adaptive compensation in strongly scattering media, and quantum-enhanced imaging in low-light conditions. Additionally, further integration with machine learning can yield autonomous wavefront control systems capable of real-time compensation in dynamic environments. These advances will not only deepen our theoretical understanding but also enable disruptive technologies across metrology, communications, and adaptive optics.

TI Ultra-fast exposure enhanced imaging with SPAD arrays based on
   super-resolution deep learning
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, with wide spread applications of high-sensitivity single-photon detectors, especially in the fields of quantum imaging and optical imaging, many important achievements have been made. and micro light imaging technology based on single-photon level has gradually become an important branch of high-resolution imaging systems. At present, the main single-photon detectors are single-photon counting avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors and support pixel arrays of different sizes, ranging from single-pixel detector sizes to tens of thousands of pixel SPAD arrays. The process structure of single-pixel SPAD detectors is relatively simple, and they are often used as the first choice for low-light imaging due to their high sensitivity, small size, and low cost. However, due to the lack of spatial resolution, single-pixel SPADs can only detect signals at a single location and cannot provide spatial information, and they are usually used in conjunction with a spatial light modulator DMD or SLM with spatial resolution to reconstruct two-dimensional (2D) images through compressed sensing or quantum correlation. Although single-pixel detectors can provide ns-level or even ps-level temporal resolution, they are limited by the frame rate of the spatial light modulator (SLM). For example, the fastest digital micromirror device (DMD) is a type of SLM with a frame rate of 22 kHz, which means that the imaging rate of a single-pixel camera is typically limited to seconds, and this camera typically uses an SPAD and an SLM for single-photon imaging tasks. This makes it a challenge to significantly improve the imaging speed, especially when higher imaging resolution is required, such as those exceeding hundreds of thousands of pixels. Assuming that the imaged object is a fast-moving dynamic target, a few seconds of imaging rate will inevitably lead to dynamic blurring, which also poses a challenge to the fast real-time performance of single-photon imaging systems. The SPAD array sensor retains the excellent sensitivity, low dark count rate, and high temporal resolution of single-pixel SPAD sensors. Due to the improvement of the fabrication process, multiple sensors and readout circuits are fabricated on the same chip, thus leading to the development of spatially resolved SPAD array camera. However, the integrated design of SPAD arrays with multiple pixels and circuits inevitably leads to cross-crosstalk between pixels. This crosstalk can significantly affect the accuracy of the signal. Additionally, the fill factor of such array cameras is typically low. Although the fill factor can be improved by methods such as three-dimensional (3D) stacking and microlens arrays, the spatial utilization is still to be improved in comparison with single-pixel SPADs. However, it is undeniable that SPAD arrays perform well in high dynamic range photon flux detection and high frame rate photon counting measurements due to the parallel processing of multiple detectors. Currently, commercial SPAD arrays integrate hundreds of thousands of detector pixel units, thereby providing excellent spatial resolution. Unfortunately, due to manufacturing processes and various challenges, the SPAD array cameras have been used in high-quantification bit deep sampling mode to acquire high-resolution single-photon intensity imaging. Its exposure time is limited to milliseconds. It is difficult to avoid dynamic blurring during the imaging exposure time when the motion frequency of the dynamic target reaches kHz or higher.
   Although the quantification bit depth can be sacrificed to shorten the minimum exposure time of array camera to the ns level, too short an exposure time can result in the SPAD array capturing the sparse photon data contaminated by a large amount of noise. Therefore, reliable photon denoising methods need to be developed. These methods are essential for effectively separating background noise from the actual signals, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging system. Therefore, the real-time performance of the imaging system at the expense of quantification sampling accuracy still needs to be further optimized. In order to solve the problem of limited imaging quality and rate of SPAD arrays under very short exposure times, we propose a single-photon imaging enhanced deep neural network combined with super-resolution deep learning in this work. By constructing a single-photon image dataset with dynamic exposure times and conducting adaptive training, high-fidelity reconstruction of low signal-to-noise ratio single-photon images can be achieved under ultra-short exposure time. In the experiments, the enhanced reconstruction of low-quality fan images (PSNR/SSIM, 6.54 dB/0.18) under very low-light conditions is achieved, with an exposure time of only 1 mu s and an average photon number of less than 0.5 photons (PNSR/SSIM, 13.21 dB/ 0.34). And the images are effectively improved by +7.21 dB/+0.16 for PSNR and SSIM. The passive remote enhanced reconstruction is performed on the drone at a distance of 5.19 km, with an imaging exposure time of 5 mu s, and an effective PSNR and SSIM enhancement of +4.78 dB/+0.2. This method provides a new technical solution for SPAD arrays for achieving ultra-fast-exposure high-quality imaging.

TI Chiral Phenomena Related to Bound States in Continuum in Photonics
   (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance The light-matter interaction at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of miniaturized optoelectronic devices. These devices often encounter energy leakage and loss, stimulating researchers to explore non-Hermitian photonics. An exceptional point, a specific optical degenerate state with identical momentum and energy has emerged as a research hotspot in this field. In recent years, the research on physical mechanisms of phenomena like parity-time symmetry, geometric phase, asymmetric scattering, and bound states in the continuum (BICs) has all revolved around exceptional points. These unique physical mechanisms are expected to inject new energy into the advancement of fields such as quantum computing, advanced materials, and low-power optoelectronic devices. We primarily focus on the chiral phenomena associated with the BIC mode, a concept originating from quantum mechanics and first proposed by von Neumann and Wigner in 1929. They identified a unique solution to the Schrodinger equation: a spatially localized electronic state with zero linewidth and positive energy, despite existing within the continuum spectrum of the radiation. Theoretically, BICs are non- radiating solutions to the wave equation and can manifest in various systems such as acoustics and fluids. However, it was not until 2008 that this concept was introduced into optics by Borisov et al. Subsequently, Plotnik et al. utilized a single-mode optical waveguide array to achieve an initial experimental observation of BICs. In 2013, researchers from MIT detected optical BICs in periodic photonic crystal slabs, boosting further exploration of BIC modes in planar artificial nanostructures. Optical BICs not only squeeze light fields and enhance resonance Q-factors in real space but also exhibit diverse polarization topological properties in momentum space. By adjusting the interaction between BIC modes, individuals can precisely manipulate the distribution, polarization, and emission of the light fields. Over the past decade, owing to the easily fabricated metasurface platform with numerous degrees of freedom, optical BICs have rapidly evolved as a novel approach for controlling light fields in nanophotonics. Additionally, artificial nanostructures can offer chiroptical responses surpassing those of natural materials, with the involved intricate physical mechanisms catching significant attention. The momentum space characteristics of optical BICs provide fresh theoretical insights and design strategies for enhancing the chiroptical response of chiral metasurfaces. The ideal BIC mode is completely decoupled from the free space. By breaking the symmetry of the system, the topology charge of the ideal BIC in momentum space splits into two circularly polarized states, which enables precise control of the radiation process to maximize the chiroptical response. In approximately 2020, research teams from the Russian Academy of Science and the City University of New York independently verified that high-Q quasi-BIC resonances can manipulate the wavefront of circularly polarized light and optimize the chiroptical response of metasurfaces. Both studies utilized periodic chiral metasurfaces with dual tuning parameters, and it was easy to break the symmetry within and out of the structural plane by simultaneously controlling the two parameters. This transformation converted the ideal BIC (with an infinite Q-factor) into chiral quasi-BIC.
   This highlights that the often- disregarded longitudinal dimension of metasurfaces, particularly symmetry, plays a crucial role in their interaction with circularly polarized light. However, the experimental validation was hindered until 2022 due to constraints in fabricating multi- layer metasurfaces. Our team overcame this obstacle by employing a tilted etching scheme to break the out-of- plane symmetry and observe chiral quasi-BIC in the visible spectrum. Over the last decade, BICs have been identified in different photonic structures, particularly in the metasurfaces platform, which leads to numerous fascinating phenomena. By thoroughly investigating the properties of BICs in both real and momentum spaces, it is possible to reveal clearer physical mechanisms behind various intricate chiroptical phenomena.
   Progress The concept of BIC has been around for almost a century, with well- established basic theories and various property studies. We begin by briefly outlining the concept and characteristics of BIC (Fig. 1), and then discuss the topic of chiral quasi-BIC (Fig. 2). Subsequently, we explore the applications of chiral BIC and other chiroptical phenomena related to BIC. In Fig. 3, we summarize the methods for creating chiral BIC by breaking the structural symmetry. Figure. 4 illustrates instances of chiral BIC resulting from the disruption of the individual dimension symmetry of nanostructures (including the breaking of in-plane or out-of-plane symmetry), while Fig. 5 presents research on intrinsic chirality induced by slant-perturbation metasurfaces that completely break both in-plane and out-of-plane symmetries. In addition to the tilted etching method, out-of-plane symmetry can also be disrupted by grayscale electron beam lithography and multi- step nanofabrication methods (Fig. 6). We have included Table 1 to compare the specific features of chiral BIC nanodevices currently yielded in the laboratory. Furthermore, we present examples of other chiroptical phenomena related to BICs in Figs. 7. 9, corresponding to nonlinear circular dichroism, vortex beam generation, superchiral field enhancement, and the optical spin Hall effect, respectively. Finally, we address the current challenges and potential applications in this field.
   Conclusions and Prospects In photonics, BIC initially caught attention for its exceptional high- Q resonance and later was extensively studied due to its unique momentum space polarization characteristics. The high-Q BIC can significantly enhance the performance of applications that rely on strong light-matter interaction, with lowered laser thresholds and improved nonlinear conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, the polarization characteristics of BICs in momentum space have greatly expanded the application fields, thus achieving polarization conversion and enhancing chiral light-matter interaction. Furthermore, more attention is paid to exploring new applications and mechanisms of BIC in combination with novel materials or special photonic structural systems. Although research on BICs in nanostructures has rapidly developed from theory to experimental stages, it still faces many challenges. In terms of sample design, there is an urgent need to explore rapid design schemes using artificial intelligence or inverse design methods. In sample fabrication, tasks such as improving the fabrication precision, implementing double- layer metasurfaces, and incorporating active semiconductor materials are very difficult. In terms of sample characterization, the extreme high-Q resonances make it difficult to measure the physical properties of BICs. Generally, although the biggest challenge in this field is from sample fabrication, combining sophisticated fabrication steps with reasonable sample design can accelerate the development of BIC- assisted photonic devices.

TI Multiple Corner State Manipulation in Square-Lattice Photonic Crystals
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective In this study the field of topological photonics has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, particularly in the development of robust waveguiding systems based on topological edge states. However, the practical application of higher-order topological phenomena, especially topological corner states, remains significantly underdeveloped due to challenges in multimodal excitation and functional integration. This research addresses this critical gap by establishing a versatile square-lattice photonic crystal platform capable of simultaneous edge and corner state manipulation through geometric reconfiguration. Our work bridges fundamental topological physics with practical device engineering, enabling novel applications in integrated photonics and optical signal processing that leverage both the robustness of topological protection and the extreme light confinement of corner modes. The significance of this study lies in its potential to expand the functional scope of topological photonic systems beyond conventional waveguiding applications, opening new possibilities for compact optical devices with enhanced performance characteristics. Methods In this paper, the experimental and theoretical framework of this study employs a square-lattice photonic crystal architecture featuring an innovative eight-rod unit cell design. This configuration provides unprecedented control over topological properties through strategic displacement of dielectric rods while maintaining overall lattice symmetry. Two complementary configurations are engineered-one exhibiting topologically nontrivial characteristics and another serving as a trivial counterpart-through systematic variations in rod positioning. The methodology encompasses several key components: First, comprehensive band structure analysis and topological invariant calculations are performed to elucidate the phase transition mechanism underlying the system's reconfigurability. Second, supercell geometries combining both topological phases are constructed and characterized through advanced numerical simulations to investigate boundary phenomena. Third, the robustness of these states is experimentally verified through controlled defect-introduction studies in fabricated waveguide implementations. For corner state exploration, the research develops nested box structures with alternating topological phases and implements a waveguide-cavity coupling system specifically designed to probe state interactions. Finally, an innovative "#"-shaped heterostructure is fabricated to demonstrate multifunctional operation capabilities, representing a significant advancement in topological photonic device integration. Results and Discussions This paper presents experimental investigations reveal several groundbreaking findings in the manipulation of topological photonic states. The engineered symmetry breaking in our photonic crystal system induces distinct band inversion characteristics between the two configurations, as evidenced by comparative mode profile analysis at high-symmetry points (Fig. 2). This fundamental observation confirms the successful implementation of topological phase transitions through geometric modifications alone. Supercell measurements demonstrate the emergence of multiple topological edge states spanning a broad operational bandwidth, with transmission characteristics showing exceptional resilience against various forms of structural imperfections (Fig. 4).
   The implemented box structure exhibits rich corner state phenomena, where different geometric arrangements produce either single or dual groups of highly localized modes (Fig. 5, Fig. 7). These corner states maintain remarkable quality factors even when subjected to intentional structural perturbations, confirming their topological protection. A particularly significant achievement is the capability of the waveguide-cavity system for selective state excitation through precise frequency tuning (Fig. 6). This system enables dual operational modes within a single integrated platform, where edge states facilitate broadband transmission while corner states provide narrowband filtering functionality. The frequency-dependent switching between these operational modes represents a major advancement in reconfigurable topological photonic devices. The "#"-shaped architecture introduces additional functionality by supporting multiple corner state families with varying localization strengths (Fig. 8). This multi-state platform enables a novel filtering mechanism that combines broadband transmission characteristics with narrowband absorption capabilities (Fig. 9). The simultaneous control over both spatial and frequency domains achieved in this structure opens new possibilities for integrated photonic signal processing. Conclusions This work presents a transformative approach to topological state control in photonic crystal systems, achieving simultaneous command over both edge and corner phenomena through geometric reconfiguration. The developed platforms demonstrate practical device functionalities including tunable delay lines, optical attenuators, and frequency-selective filters, all of which leverage the inherent robustness of topological protection mechanisms while overcoming traditional limitations of corner state utilization. Our methodology enables precise engineering of light-matter interactions at multiple length scales, from extended edge channels to deeply subwavelength corner modes. The implications of this research extend across several domains: In fundamental physics, it provides new insights into higher-order topological phenomena in classical wave systems. For device engineering, it offers a versatile toolkit for creating robust, multifunctional photonic components. In system integration, the demonstrated architectures enable compact implementations of complex optical functionalities. Future research directions include investigating dynamic reconfiguration mechanisms through external stimuli, integrating with active photonic components for enhanced functionality, and exploring nonlinear effects in topological cavity systems. These findings significantly advance the field of higher-order topological photonics, providing both fundamental insights and practical tools for next-generation optical systems design. The successful demonstration of multimodal state control in square-lattice photonic crystals opens new possibilities for topological photonic devices in applications ranging from optical communications to quantum information processing.

TI Research Progress in Orbital Angular Momentum Recognition for Laser
   Beams Based on Artificial Intelligence ( Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Orbital angular momentum (OAM) offers a new degree of freedom for laser beams. The OAM beam has caught considerable attention in recent years due to its high- dimensional properties, demonstrating tremendous potential in cutting-edge fields such as super-capacity optical communication, rotational sensing, high-resolution imaging, optical information storage, and quantum technologies. The ability to diagnose OAM rapidly and precisely is crucial in these applications, involving OAM mode recognition and OAM spectral measurement. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) across various domains, leveraging AI technology has been considered a novel solution to OAM recognition. We review recent advances in OAM recognition based on AI technology from the perspective of AI model classification, with a focus on highlighting the research progress made by our team in this field. Additionally, we also discuss recent studies on AI- based OAM diagnosis under various disturbing scenarios.
   Progress Our review consists of three main sections. The first section provides a comprehensive overview of AI classifications, encompassing machine learning models, deep learning models, and hybrid learning models. It presents the fundamental characteristics of each category, providing relative information about the specific models of AI technology proposed in our study and numerical methods adopted in the hybrid learning models. Then, the basic OAM recognition principles are introduced, including the theory of identifying OAM modes within superposed OAM beams and the measurement of the constituent proportion coefficients for each mode, such as the OAM spectrum. This section serves as a foundational framework to provide readers with a thorough understanding of AI classifications and lay the groundwork for the subsequent review of OAM recognition.
   In the second section, a systematic review of AI-based OAM recognition schemes is presented to discuss the schemes from the perspective of AI-based model classification. Previous studies are categorized based on the employed model types of machine learning models (Fig. 1), deep learning models ( Fig. 2), and hybrid learning models (Fig. 3). We provide a comprehensive overview of previous approaches, analyze their strengths, and summarize the development trends. Additionally, we also concentrate on the contributions made by our team. Drawing inspiration from the powerful data processing capabilities of deep learning, we propose an adjusted ENN deep-learning model for OAM spectral measurement. A specially designed phase-only diffraction optical element is adopted to extract OAM features from the superposed OAM beam, and the neural network training is utilized to analyze the diffraction pattern to calculate the OAM spectrum. Under scenarios with seven superposed OAM modes, the OAM spectral measurement yields a root mean square (RMS) error as low as 10-6. Furthermore, we propose a deep residual network (DRN)-based deep learning methodology to analyze the complex spectrum of a superposed OAM beam. The methodology can process up to 50 overlapping OAM modes within the range of [ - 150, 150], demonstrating exceptional performance with RMS errors reaching 0.002 for intensity spectra and 0.016 for phase spectra. Notably, the computational speed is significantly enhanced, reducing the processing time to mere 0.02 s. This remarkable improvement represents a nearly thousandfold increase in processing time compared to traditional helical harmonic expansion. Additionally, a scheme to directly emit multi-partite non-separable states from a laser cavity is proposed in another study, where we leverage a DRN to extract the phase shifting from interference patterns and thus measure the fidelity of classical non-separability. The groundbreaking research lays the foundation for related state tomography endeavors, underscoring that AI technology can validate classical non-separable characteristics among degrees of freedom like OAM.
   The third section presents the recent advances in AI- based OAM recognition schemes under disturbances. It is recognized that the OAM beam can be distorted by disturbances during transmission, especially in non-uniform media such as the atmosphere and oceanic turbulences. However, in applications like optical communication and radar detection, it is essential to acquire the original emitted optical field information. Previous studies mitigate the influence of disturbances by introducing adaptive optics. Subsequent analysis and processing are then adopted to restore the original emitted optical field information. With the emergence of AI-based OAM recognition, leveraging AI technology to establish implicit representations between laser fields before and after disturbances holds the potential to provide a novel approach for obtaining the original optical information directly from distorted OAM beams. Additionally, we provide a summary of AIbased OAM modal sensing methods under disturbances, categorizing the discussions based on disturbance factors and utilization scenarios. Among these methodologies, our team demonstrated an AI- based distortion correction technique for vector vortex beams in 2020. The TACCNN network is designed and proposed for learning the mapping relationship between the intensity distribution of distorted vector vortex beams and the turbulent phase, which facilitates rapid and precise compensation. Notably, with a turbulence intensity parameter (D/ r0) of 5.28, this technique yields remarkable enhancement in mode purity which elevates from 19% to 70%.
   Conclusions and Prospects Leveraging the powerful computational and learning capabilities of AI technology allows us to extract information from more complex OAM superposed modes, and accelerate data processing. The AI- based OAM recognition method stimulates breakthroughs in high-dimensional OAM control technology in fields such as communication and lasers. Despite initial success in detecting OAM modes, challenges persist in the rapid and high- precision computation and analysis of wide-mode-range OAM control, such as OAM combs and optical spatio-temporal vortices. The introduction of AI technology is expected to overcome the efficiency and accuracy limitations in traditional methods, as the complex phase structure design and extensive data analysis involved in high-dimensional OAM tailoring are aligned with the AI capability. Finally, we hope this review will provide valuable insights for people who are interested in AI-based OAM recognition and its applications, and inspire more novel and remarkable ideas.

TI Energy Resolution Limit of Quantum Magnetometers (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Ultra-high sensitivity in magnetic sensing can be achieved using quantum magnetometers with quantum properties of micro-particles, such as discreteness and quantum coherence (e.g., entanglement). These properties are dominant factors that equip quantum magnetometers with state-of-the-art performance, i. e., ultra-high sensitivity (ultra-low noise), which is hardly achievable with classical magnetic sensors. To date, quantum magnetometers have found broad applications, including, but not limited to, the tests of fundamental symmetries of the universe, searches for exotic physics beyond the standard model of fundamental physics, non-invasively mapping brain activity in biomedicine, remote sensing of magnetic target, archaeological exploration, etc. Sensitivity is a critical performance metric for quantum magnetometers, reflecting the smallest detectable variation in magnetic field for a given time duration. Unveiling the sensitivity limit of magnetometers is one of the central topics in quantum magnetometry. Previous investigations into the sensitivity limit have largely centered on a number-constrained optimization problem: minimize the sensitivity in magnetic sensing using a limited number of the sensing particles, which is known as the standard problem of quantum metrology (SPQM). For a given number of N independent sensing particles, the sensitivity is fundamentally constrained by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and this leads to the well-established standard quantum limit (SQL), where delta B-SQL proportional to 1 root N. By employing sophisticated quantum resources such as squeezed states or specific entangled states like the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, it is possible to surpass the SQL and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL), where delta B-SQL proportional to 1 root N. This framework implies that sensitivity could, in principle, be improved indefinitely by simply increasing the number of sensing particles. However, for ensemble-based magnetometers such as atomic vapor magnetometers (AVM), the number of the sensing particles is not a fixed, limited resource but a tunable experimental parameter. Consequently, their sensitivity cannot be improved indefinitely simply by increasing the number of sensing particles. Across a wide variety of the most sensitive magnetometers, including AVM and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID), a common sensitivity limit is consistently observed in experiments (Fig. 1). This limit is not expressed in terms of particle number but focus on the constraint of the energy resolution per unit of bandwidth, known as the energy resolution limit (ERL). It is expressed as ( delta B ) 2 TV ( 2 mu(0) ) >= & hbar; , where ( delta B )(2) represents the estimated variance of the magnetic field, V is the sensor volume, T is the measurement duration, and mu 0 is the vacuum permeability. The relation describes the product of the magnetic field energy within a finite volume and the measurement duration, bounded by & hbar;. However, to date, the ERL has no widely accepted first-principles derivation. This paper focuses on the ERL, and systematically reviews and analyzes its physical mechanism: the density-coherence trade-off. This mechanism states that while higher particle density provides a statistical advantage, it also enhances decoherence-inducing inter-particle interactions which limit the sensitivity.
   Based on this, we discuss how certain magnetometers can potentially evade the ERL by suppressing or circumventing these adverse interactions, providing a novel physical perspective for understanding and designing magnetometers to achieve better sensitivity. Progress This paper critically examines the foundation of the SPQM, highlighting its limitations when applied to the magnetometers where the number of the sensing particles is not constrained. In ensemble-based magnetometers, such as AVM and ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometers, the number of the sensing particles within a fixed volume, i.e., the atomic density n, can be controlled and optimized. Because of the density-coherence trade-off, their sensitivity cannot be arbitrarily improved solely by increasing the number of the sensing particles. The density-coherence trade-off arises from two competing effects (Fig. 2). On one hand, increasing the atomic density n provides a clear statistical advantage. The statistical uncertainty, such as the spin projection noise (SPN) inherent in repeated measurements of the spin ensemble, is reduced as the number of the sensing particles increases. On the other hand, a higher atomic density inevitably leads to stronger inter-particle interactions. These interactions, such as spin-exchange or spin-destruction collisions in atomic vapor, or magnetic dipole-dipole coupling in NV center ensemble, are typically detrimental, as they induce decoherence and shorten the transverse relaxation time, which determines the maximum coherent evolution time available for sensing. The magnetometer reaches its minimal energy resolution at the optimal particle density where the statistical gain is perfectly balanced with the interaction-induced decoherence.In spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) atomic magnetometers, the dominant decoherence channel is spin-destruction collisions, which cause the predicted ERL value that closely matches the experimentally observed limit near & hbar;. Similarly, in dense NV center ensembles, the sensing spins are fixed in a crystal lattice, and the dominant decoherence channel is the magnetic dipole- dipole interaction between neighboring NV centers. The strength of this interaction also scales with NV density, once again resulting in a density-coherence trade-off and the ERL near & hbar; .As shown in Fig. 1, several well-designed systems have experimentally surpassed the ERL. One successful approach uses highly correlated spin systems such as levitated ferromagnetic magnetometer (LFM), the spins are rigidly coupled by strong exchange interactions. The collective, rigid motion effectively averages out the random, decohering dipole-dipole interactions. Another example is the single-domain spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (SDSBEC). Because of the ultracold temperatures and the quantum degeneracy, the inelastic two-body interactions are energetically forbidden and the elastic two-body interactions does not induce decoherence. A second, more direct approach is to evade inter - particle interactions by using single quantum systems. Magnetometers based on a single NV center in diamond or a single trapped ion are free from the density- coherence trade-off in ensemble-based magnetometers. Conclusions and Prospects This paper provides a systematic review of the sensitivity limits of quantum magnetometers, with particular attention to the ERL widely observed in experiments.
   Beginning with the quantum noise in magnetometry, we analyze the limitations of treating the number of the sensing particles as the sole finite resource in the SPQM. In ensemble-based magnetometers such as AVM, sensitivity is fundamentally constrained by the density-coherence trade-off: while increasing particle density within a finite volume reduces statistical uncertainty, it simultaneously enhances the decoherence-inducing inter-particle interactions which limit the sensitivity and lead to the ERL. Based on this, we discuss how certain magnetometers, such as LFM, SDSBEC, and single NV center, can potentially evade the ERL by suppressing or circumventing the decoherence-inducing inter-particle interactions. However, the density-coherence trade-off cannot explain the sensitivity limit of SQUID, which is not based on particle counting. Recent efforts have begun to derive the ERL from the quantum speed limit and information thermodynamics. However, a widely accepted first-principles derivation is still lacking, which calls for further investigation.

TI Analysis of Statistical Uncertainty of Optical Frequency Measurement Due
   to Measurement Dead Time of Hydrogen Maser
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Optical clocks have developed rapidly in the past 20 years and have achieved a systematic uncertainty of 9. 4x 10(-19) and frequency stability of 4. 8x10(-17) @1 s. Except for the generation of standard time and frequency, optical clocks have many important applications, such as verification of general relativity, measurement of possible variation of the fine structure constant with time, detection of ultralight bosonic dark matter, quantum simulation, and relativistic geodesy. As more and more systematic uncertainty of the optical clock enters the order of 10-18, and the absolute frequency measurement accuracy of the optical clock is fundamentally limited by the systematic uncertainty of the 133Cs fountain clock, it has been proposed to use optical frequency transition to redefine the second in the international system of units. The 27th General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) officially passed a resolution: The 28th CGPM will be held in 2026 to discuss the choice of optical clock types for redefining the second, and the optical frequency transition will be formally used to define the second expected in 2030. One of the main methods of absolute frequency measurement of optical clocks is to trace the international atomic time through a satellite link, and measurement uncertainty of less than 3x 10(-16) is a precondition for the redefinition of the second in the international system of units by the optical frequency transition. In this complex tracing link, the uncertainty caused by the measurement dead time of the hydrogen maser is one of the main sources of absolute frequency measurement uncertainty for most optical clocks. After removing the contribution of frequency drift of the hydrogen maser, the statistical uncertainty caused by the measurement dead time of the hydrogen maser can be obtained by numerical simulation. This method needs to know the relevant parameters of the noise model of the hydrogen maser accurately and then generate the relevant random noise sequences by software.
   Methods In this paper, the frequency comparison between the Sr-87 optical lattice clock and hydrogen maser is made by using an optical frequency comb. By calculating the stability of the frequency ratio and fitting with the function of y (tau)= root A(1)(2)tau(-2) + A(2)(2)tau(-1) + A(3)(2)tau(0) + A(4)(2)tau(1) (t is the measurement time, and A(1-4) indicate the amplitudes of phase white noise, frequency white noise, frequency flicker noise, and random walk noise, respectively), the values of A(1-4) are obtained. Finally, according to the noise model of the hydrogen maser, we use the software to generate random noise series of 86400x5 s, 86400x10 s, and 86400x30 s, respectively, and calculate the statistical uncertainty of optical frequency measurement under different effective operating rates ( the measurement dead time of the hydrogen maser) and total measurement durations.
   Results and Discussions The parameters of the noise model of the hydrogen maser are determined as A(1)= 2. 21x 10(-13) (tau/s)(-1), A(2)= 3. 05x10(-13) (tau/s)(-0.5), A(3)= 6. 01x10(-16), and A(4)= 4. 49x10(-19) (tau/s)(0.5), respectively after about 10-day measurement with an effective operating rate of 89% [Fig. 2(b)]. The frequency difference caused by the measurement dead time of the hydrogen maser is simulated 100 times by using the method of generating random noise sequences (using the software of Stable32) according to the noise model. Three types of random noise sequences are generated with a total measurement time of 86400x5 s, 86400x10 s, and 86400x30 s, respectively. The difference in the mean frequency from the total mean over partial times is calculated for the specific case. Each case is repeated by 100 times, and the measurement uncertainty caused by the measurement dead time of the hydrogen maser is represented by the 1 times standard deviation of these results. Figure 4 shows the calculation results of the measurement uncertainty as a function of the effective operating rate. The measurement uncertainty due to the measurement dead time decreases with the increase in the effective operating rate, and when the effective operating rate is less than 10% or so, increasing the total measurement time can significantly reduce the measurement uncertainty.
   Conclusions In this study, the frequency stability of the hydrogen maser is measured by comparing the Sr-87 optical lattice clock (with an 89% effective operating ratio and a total measurement time of about 10 days) with the hydrogen maser for a long time. By fitting the data of the frequency stability of the hydrogen maser with the noise model function, the influence of each noise of the hydrogen maser is determined as 2. 21x10(-13) (tau/s)(-1) for phase white noise, 3. 05x10(-13) (tau/ s)(-0.5) for frequency white noise, 6. 01x10(-16) for frequency flicker noise, and 4. 49x10(-19) (tau/s)(0.5) for random walk noise. The calculation results indicate that the measurement uncertainty caused by the measurement dead time of the hydrogen maser decreases with the increase in the effective operating rate, and when the effective operating rate is less than 10% or so, increasing the total measurement time can significantly reduce the uncertainty. This work can be widely used to measure the absolute frequency of optical clocks by tracing the international atomic time and provide an important reference for selecting the effective operating rate of the optical clock to reduce the measurement uncertainty caused by the measurement dead time of the hydrogen maser.

TI Electromagnetically Induced Non-Hermitian Diffraction Grating Assisted
   by Incoherent Pumping
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective A system with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian commutative with the parity- time operator, proposed by Bander et al., has a real eigenenergy spectrum and some novel properties under certain conditions. Due to the similarity between Schrodinger' s equation and the optical Helmholtz equation, the optical system with out-of- phase spatial modulation is a good platform to simulate a system with parity- time (PT) symmetry, which is named the non-Hermitian optical system. In recent years, non-Hermitian optical structures based on discrete systems such as optical waveguide, hybrid optical microcavity, electrical circuit resonators, and continuous optical media such as cold atomic ensemble with spatially periodic modulation, have been implemented successively in experimental and theoretical studies. Spectroscopic devices such as diffraction grating have been a significant branch of optical devices since Newton' s era. Electromagnetically induced grating (EIG) based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) makes it possible to tune the diffraction patterns dynamically. In recent years, combined with the non-Hermitian optical modulation, many schemes of one- or twodimensional asymmetric optical diffraction gratings have been proposed successively. However, due to rigid realization conditions of PT symmetry or PT antisymmetry, there is still a great hindrance to realizing precise and flexible dynamic operation, especially for some special optical diffractions. In most previous schemes, dual spatial periodic modulation (via amplitude, detuning of coupling field, or atomic density) has been adopted to achieve two goals, including the realization of PT symmetry or PT antisymmetry and the construction of a grating structure. This results in the lack of accurate modulation capabilities with the protection of PT symmetry or PT antisymmetry. Therefore, a method for preparing nonHermitian EIG with simple structures easy to analyze, dynamic control ability, and protection of optical non-Hermitian symmetry is necessary and desired.
   Method We consider an ensemble of cold Rb-87 atoms driven into a three- level Lambda configuration by two coherent fields with frequencies omega(p) and omega(c). The weak probe field.p interacts with transition |g > <-> |e >, while the strong control field omega(c) acts upon transition |m > <-> |e > The states |g > and are coupled by the incoherent pumping Lambda(icp) additionally. By periodically modulating the coupling field detuning Delta(c)(x), it is possible to get an asymmetric diffraction pattern in this system.
   Results and Discussions According to the study on far- field diffraction characteristics of probe field through the system, some results are as follows. 1) When the parameters are chosen as Delta(p)=- 2. 27x2 pi MHz, Delta(c0)=- 0. 1x2 pi MHz, delta(c0)= 1. 0x2 pi MHz and phi = 0, we can get the PT symmetric susceptibility. Then the modulations for the real part and imaginary part of the susceptibility are out-of-phase, and the lopsided diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 2(b). 2) When the parameters are chosen as Delta(p)=Delta(c0)=0, delta(c0)=1. 0x2 pi MHz, and phi= 0, we can get the PT antisymmetric susceptibility. The modulations for the real part and imaginary part of the susceptibility are still out- of-phase, resulting in the lopsided diffraction patterns shown in Figs. 3(b(1)) and 3(b(2)). 3) With increasing optical depth, the diffracted intensity is transferred from zero order to one order, while with increasing incoherent pumping, the diffracted intensity is transferred from one order to zero order in the PT antisymmetric grating as shown in Fig. 4. 4) The initial phase of coupling field detuning can modulate the diffraction in two ways. The first one is changing the diffraction direction from a negative angle to a positive angle by varying the initial phase of the coupling field detuning from 0 to pi. The other one is tuning the diffraction symmetries of the grating. When phi= m pi, we can get asymmetric diffraction patterns, and when phi= (2m-1)pi/2, we can get symmetric diffraction patterns shown in Fig. 5.
   Conclusions We propose a theoretical scheme of non- Hermitian electromagnetically induced grating based on incoherent pumping. The system consists of an ultra-cold atomic ensemble with the Lambda- type three-level structure and an incoherent pumping field. Combined with incoherent pumping, non- Hermitian symmetries of the system including optical PT symmetry and PT antisymmetry under the single spatial period modulation can be implemented. During the research on far-field diffraction characteristics of probe field through the system, we can draw the following conclusions. First, a switch between different non-Hermitian optical symmetries can be attained by controlling the detuning of the coupling field. Secondly, the diffraction efficiency is effectively modulated by incoherent pumping at a constant optical depth, which introduces a new degree of freedom of grating manipulation. In addition, tuning the initial phase of coupling field detuning can effectively modulate the diffraction symmetry and diffraction pattern of the system. The theoretical results not only can facilitate the research and development of non-Hermitian optics and scattering- type all-optical devices but also can be applied in quantum optics and quantum information processing.

TI Multi-Pixel Balanced Homodyne Detector
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective As an important tool for quantum optical measurement, the balanced homodyne detector (BHD) is highly sensitive to the amplitude and phase of the incident light. It can reliably extract quantum fluctuations, suppress classical common-mode noise, and amplify quantum fluctuations to the macro level. Additionally, it has been widely employed in quantum noise measurement, gravitational wave detection, high-sensitivity interferometric timing measurement, continuous variable quantum key distribution, and quantum random number generator. The common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), operating bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detector have been the research focuses. The optical frequency comb contains a large number of equally spaced longitudinal modes, which is a good multi-mode resource. The spectrum width of the optical frequency comb is in the order of nanometers. The quantum optical frequency comb which breaks the limit of shot noise can be generated by nonlinear processes. Quantum optical frequency comb has a great application prospect in quantum precision measurement. Spectrally resolved balanced homodyne detection is an important detection method of quantum optical frequency comb. We analyze the noise source of the balanced homodyne detector theoretically and design the multi-pixel balanced homodyne detector (MBHD) based on photodiode array and multi-channel inductance-capacitance (L-C) coupled transimpedance amplifier (TIA) circuit. These designs enable MBHD to meet multi-channel parallel and high-SNR quantum noise measurements.
   Methods The MBHD consists of two highly symmetrical multi-pixel photodetectors (MPDs) and a multi-channel subtracter (Fig. 1). Each MPD includes a photodiode array, a multi-channel L-C coupled structure, AC amplification, and DC amplification. The photocurrent generated by the corresponding pair of pixels in the two MPD flows through their respective AC amplification outputs, and the common-mode signal in the detection result is eliminated by the subtracter to complete the multi-pixel parallel balanced homodyne detection. Multi-channel DC output monitors the optical power of all pixels by a multi-function data acquisition card (DAQ). In the amplification circuit structure of the single pixel in MPD, the generated photocurrent signal is divided into DC signal and AC signal through the L-C coupled circuit. The AC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a TIA and is further adopted to measure the intensity noise power of the incident light. The DC signal is converted into a voltage signal by a load resistor and a isolation amplifier. Additionally, an equivalent noise model is built to analyze the electronic noise. Due to the multi-channel parallel structure of the MBHD, each channel is similar to each other and independent. The electronic noise of the single-pixel channel includes the noise generated by the dark current of the photodiode, the thermal noise generated by the feedback resistance in the transimpedance amplifier circuit, the noise generated by the input voltage noise of the transimpedance amplifier, and the noise generated by the input current noise of the transimpedance amplifier. Theoretical analysis shows that a reasonable selection of feedback resistance and inductance, photodiode with low dark current and low junction capacitance, and the TIA with low input noise can reduce the electronic noise of the detector. Meanwhile, the L-C coupled structure is better than the R-C coupled structure in experimental conditions (Fig. 2).
   Results and Discussions The device is constructed to test the performance of MBHD (Fig. 3). AC output of MBHD is connected to a spectrometer to measure the bandwidth and SNR. The DC signals of each pixel are measured by a DAQ to monitor the optical powers of each pixel. When the optical power is distributed on all pixel channels, the distribution of the shot noise power in each channel is proportional to the distribution of the incident optical power, which verifies that the multi-pixel BHD can achieve spectrally resolved multi-channel parallel balanced homodyne detection (Fig. 4). When the incident optical power is 1.660 mW, 0.834 mW, 0.418 mW, 0.208 mW, and 0.102 mW respectively, the shot noise spectrum and electronic noise spectrum of one pixel are measured at different analysis frequencies (Fig. 5). The test results show that the 3 dB bandwidth of MBHD is 5 MHz. The resolution bandwidth is set to 100 kHz, the video bandwidth is 100 Hz, and the number of averaging times is 10. When the incident optical power is 1.660 mW, the shot noise power is 23 dB higher than the electronic noise power at the analysis frequency of 2 MHz. By comparing the shot noise power under different incident optical power, the shot noise power decreases by 3 dB when the incident optical power decreases by half, which indicates that the detector has a good linear gain within 0.102 mW to 1.660 mW of the optical power.
   Conclusions Based on the noise model of the BHD, the electronic noise source is analyzed theoretically. The results indicate that the L-C coupled structure is better. By adopting the multi-pixel photodiode array and L-C coupled structure, a high-performance multi-pixel BHD is developed. In each pixel channel, when the 815 nm laser with optical power of 1.660 mW is incident, the shot noise power is 23 dB higher than the electronic noise at the analysis frequency of 2 MHz. By employing the grating to scatter the incident light horizontally, the shot noise power in each channel is proportional to the incident optical power. It is verified that the multi-pixel BHD can realize the spectrally resolved multi-channel parallel balanced homodyne detection. The detector provides a high-performance detection tool for quantum precision measurement based on quantum optical frequency comb.

TI On-Chip Photonic Lead Direct Writing Technology Based on Nano-Alignment
   Guide Star
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Integrated photonic chip is a key technology that combines laser light sources, modulators, waveguides, detectors, and other photonic devices into a compact, high-bandwidth, low-latency, and energy-efficient package. They hold significant importance in fields such as quantum information processing and optical communication and play a crucial role in the next generation of communication systems and data interconnectivity. The two-photon polymerization technology for three-dimensional micro and nanofabrication has pushed the resolution of laser direct writing (LDW) beyond the limit imposed by optical diffraction to achieve sub-hundred nanometer scales. Meanwhile, it has significant advantages such as simple processing workflow, minimal thermal effect, and low optical threshold damage, which makes it suitable for high-precision, high-density on-chip interconnections. Additionally, the exceptional flexibility of two-photon laser direct writing systems allows for effective adaptation to the varying spatial positions, dimensions, and orientations of interfaces in on-chip interconnections, substantially reducing the requirements for active alignment. In contrast to projection lithography which processes planar structures at one time, on-chip photonic interconnections demand high-precision positioning for the three-dimensional photonic lead at the tips of the waveguides. The writing position accuracy directly influences the signal coupling quality, emphasizing the need for high-precision alignment solutions.
   Methods We focus on the research on nanoscale alignment techniques in high-precision laser direct writing for on-chip photonic waveguides. In the context of a two-photon three-dimensional direct writing system (Fig. 1), machine vision and image processing technologies based on guide star nano-alignment are employed. Intelligent recognition and positioning of nano-alignment markers are carried out in Figs. 5 and 6 to enable the definition of the processing area and the establishment of a three-dimensional processing coordinate system. The two-photon laser writing beam is then precisely controlled, aided by a differential confocal system for axial spatial positioning. This approach facilitates the high-precision and high-density 3D direct writing of on-chip photonic lead interconnections within nanoscale structures between waveguides. By enabling intelligent recognition and alignment of specific markers or distinctive graphical features within the direct writing lithography system, the system is equipped with practical functions, including the fabrication of various complex structures. This has significant scientific and practical implications in high-precision processing areas such as chip packaging, multi-material functional structure fabrication, and complex structure modifications.
   Results and Discussions Due to limitations imposed by the field of view, the two-photon laser direct writing system cannot write photonic leads of approximately 270 mu m in length at one time. Consequently, each one is divided into three segments and written separately. Fig. 7(a) displays the result of a single writing operation, and Fig. 7(b) illustrates the combined photonic lead that results from three-time writing. To analyze the alignment accuracy of the photonic lead, we conduct six writing experiments using the writing program, with the results shown in Table 2. The analysis indicates that the algorithm achieves an average alignment accuracy of 29 nm, with a maximum deviation of approximately 50 nm in a single experiment. This ensures sub-hundred nanometer-level alignment precision, which aligns very closely with the theoretically expected accuracy. Among the results, the average angular deviation between the written photonic lead and the silicon waveguide is 0.19 degrees. This alignment level enables the precise writing of photonic lead and fulfills the requirements for high-precision on-chip waveguide connections.
   After analysis, the alignment deviation of this algorithm is mainly caused by the optical diffraction limit. Although the edge of visible light with hundreds of nanometers wavelength is blurred under the influence of optical diffraction limit, the algorithm can still achieve the recognition and positioning accuracy of tens of nanometers since the designed nano-guide star is an isotropic square. However, the optical diffraction limit still largely restricts the alignment limit of image processing. Additionally, the pixel size of the image, the measurement error of alignment accuracy, the instability of the equipment and the environment, and the close distance between the alignment marks also limit the alignment accuracy of the algorithm.
   Conclusions We address the nanoscale alignment requirements for on-chip photonic interconnection waveguides in the context of two-photon laser direct writing. Meanwhile, a method is proposed based on guide star digital matching and intelligent nano-alignment to achieve 3D laser direct writing for on-chip photonic lead nanostructures with low cost, high precision, and high density. In response to the background and demand for on-chip photonic interconnection waveguides, we design the optical system structure of the two-photon laser direct writing system. On the hardware side, the unique design of the guide star enables high-precision positioning and writing of photonic leads. On the algorithmic side, machine vision and image processing technologies are adopted for intelligent recognition, matching, and positioning. Differential confocal systems assist in axial alignment, creating a three-dimensional machining coordinate system. This system then controls the direct writing laser beam for high-precision displacement, which helps fabricate photonic leads that connect specific polymer waveguides. The experiments produce photonic leads with an average angular deviation of only 0.19 degrees from the polymer waveguides, achieving an average absolute positional alignment accuracy of 29 nm. Finally, our study holds scientific and practical significance in the fields of high-precision optical on-chip interconnections and complex structure modifications.

TI Principles and Applications for Optical Nonlinear Activation Function
   Devices
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance In recent years, with the development of computer technology, artificial intelligence has gradually penetrated many aspects of current human life. As the basic architecture of artificial intelligence, machine learning and neural networks have been given increasingly more attention to by researchers in recent years. At present, neural networks have been applied in matrix calculation, equation solving, data analysis, and many other fields, and have become a research field with great development potential in the 21st century. In conventional neural networks, linear functions are the primary mathematical tool. Nowadays, nonlinear activation functions (NAFs) can be employed to describe a large number of different systems, such as electric power systems, optical systems, economic systems, biological systems, computer networks, and communication systems. Nonlinear functions are a much more powerful mathematical tool than linear functions. Therefore, they are introduced into the neural networks to apply the neural networks to more nonlinear models.
   Currently, the application of nonlinear functions in neural networks is mainly realized through the nonlinear activation layers. The nonlinear activation layers of neural networks ( NNs) can alter the linear transformation relationship beteween multi-layer networks, and thus enabling the NNs to solve more complex and advanced learning with flexibility. In pursuit of faster processing speed and lower energy consumption, optical neural networks ( ONNs) have caught much attention from researchers in recent years. The response time of photons in ONNs is often picoseconds, and the energy loss of optical systems is often lower than that of electronic systems. Thus, the design of ONNs features high throughput and low power consumption. Therefore, except for electronic systems, photonic systems have shown a broad development prospect in computing. Additionally, the intelligent photonics represented by ONNs has also emerged and become an important development direction of information processing in the future. As an indispensable module in ONNs, a series of optical NAF devices have emerged. The nonlinear phenomena caused by the interaction between strong light and medium provide a powerful theoretical basis for applying NAF in photonic network architecture, and the integrated photonic device is also a feasible experimental platform for realizing NAFs. The NAFs broaden the application range of ONNs and provide a potential way to construct the next generation of integrated photonic devices on chip, which has a very broad development prospect. In this review, we summarize the recent studies that introduce optical NAFs to the systems and discuss their physical mechanisms and application capabilities. Meanwhile, this review also summarizes and discusses the challenges and future trends for the development in the research on optical NAF devices in ONNs, and provides outlooks related to such devices.
   Progress Methods and principles for generating various NAFs under optic-electro-optic (O-E-O) and all optical regimes, which are the two major regimes reported so far, are summarized with more emphasis on the later regime. The applications for NAFs are also presented. NAF modulators under the O-E-O regime can be dissected into electroabsorption-modulators (EAMs) and electro-optic-modulators (EOMs), both of which have distinct merits and drawbacks. EOM utilizes a Mach-Zehnder interferometer ( MZI) or the phase shifts in a micro-ring resonator (MRR) to modulate amplitude via interference. EAM can directly modulate the light amplitude without the need for interference and thus can be designed with a smaller footprint. However, the carrier- based EAM suffers from lower speed compared with the fielddriven EOM. More specific comparison can be seen in the main content (Fig. 14). Besides the aforementioned categories, O-E-O modulation can also be achieved by doping the MRR to make its transmission sensitive to electrical currents and thus can engender different NAFs under different biasing conditions. NAF modulators under the all optical regime can be dissected into three major categories including customized materials, semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), and MRR. Customized materials can be further divided into saturated absorption, reverse saturated absorption materials, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) materials, phase change materials (PCMs), and light matter interaction (LMI) material structure. Meanwhile, we provide the mathematical basis of the cross-phase and cross-gain modulation effects in SOA. Additionally, examples of how these nonlinear effects can be utilized to realize optical neural-network devices capable of simple operations are provided by chaining multiple semiconductor optical amplifiers together in certain configurations, such as optical " AND" logic gates and optical signal thresholders. For MRR, by utilizing the free carrier dispersion ( FCD) effect or thermo-optical ( TO) effect, NAFs with distinct responding times and threshold can be designed and optimized by incorporating materials like graphene or Ge and platforms like Si3N4. The Kerr effect in graphene can enhance the FCD in silicon, while Ge can be adopted to facilitate the TO process. In addition, the Si3N4 platform can be utilized to increase the processing speed by blocking FCD and turning to the Kerr effect. Performance parameters relevant to the threshold, responding time, and loss of these devices are also summarized and compared. The generated NAF can be leveraged to improve the performance in applications like pattern recognition and classification while adding reconfigurability to the NNs and facilitating real- time response NNs and efficient information processors. Finally, the prospects for NAF development, including reconfigurability, better performance, and developments in combination with quantum information processing are put forward.
   Conclusions and Prospects NAFs in the optical regime have been realized with various schemes and enhanced the performance of ONNs. In summary, the performance of optical NAFs still needs improvement in terms of faster responding time or lower threshold and loss whether by incorporating new materials or by deliberately designing the SOA or MRR systems. As a result, they can better serve ONN to perform more accurate and complex tasks.

TI Fabry-Perot Optical Microcavity and Its Application
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance In the 20th century, the research of the Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity mainly focused on basic optical properties and light source stabilization technology. However, with the development of quantum optics and nanotechnology, the research field of F-P microcavity has expanded rapidly in the 21st century. Nowadays, F-P microcavity is not only employed as an optical measurement tool, but also an important platform for studying the light-matter interactions to realize accurate parameter measurement, biological detection, and regulation for multi-dimensional light fields.
   The F-P microcavity is an ideal tool for measuring the frequency of the light source and stabilizing the laser frequency due to its interference properties. The spectrometer based on the F-P microcavity can achieve very accurate spectral resolution, which can meet the demand for a wide range of fields from astronomical observation to optical fiber communication.
   In terms of light-matter interactions, the F-P microcavity provides an ideal platform for exploring the coupling of photons and matter quantum systems. The photons in the microcavity can be strongly coupled with the material quantum systems such as atoms, molecules, or quantum dots, leading to some new physical phenomena. This provides possibilities for the development of new technologies such as quantum information processing based on light and ultra-low threshold lasers.
   In precision parameter measurement, F-P microcavity is widely applied to measure physical parameters such as temperature, pressure, refractive index, and pressure due to its high sensitivity to small changes in the environment. By accurately measuring the changing interference mode of light in the microcavity, accurate information about the microcavity environment can be obtained to achieve a very accurate measurement. In biological detection, F-P microcavity is adopted to detect the characteristics of cells, viruses, proteins, and other biomolecules due to its high sensitivity to small changes in tissues. This is of significance for early diagnosis of diseases, pathological research, and other applications in the biomedical field. Additionally, F-P microcavity also plays an important role in multi-dimensional light field control by precisely controlling the microcavity.
   Progress First, the principle of the F-P microcavity is introduced based on thin-film optical theory (Fig. 1). The work progress of linear variable filter, integrated F-P filter, and reconfigurable spectrometer based on the F-P microcavity is presented according to the sequence of research development. The research team at Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has carried out extensive research and application of linear gradient filter. In integrated F-P filter, Wang et al. from Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, proposed a method of combinatorial etching and deposition (Fig. 4) to prepare integrated F-P filter. As technology advances, nano-imprint lithography and grayscale lithography have also been applied to fabricate integrated F-P filter. F-P microcavities can be integrated with detectors, and the resulting spectrometers feature small size, light weight, and high stability. To overcome the difficulty in achieving high resolution in spectrometers based on F-P microcavities and the associated manufacturing challenges, spectral reconstruction algorithms have been introduced to significantly improve the spectral resolution of spectrometers. In the interactions between photons and low-dimensional materials in an all-dielectric F-P microcavity, low-dimensional semiconductor lasers based on all-dielectric F-P microcavities are introduced first. Based on the theory of cavity quantum electrodynamics, the weak and strong coupling interactions between light and low-dimensional materials are discussed. With the developing fabrication technology of two-dimensional materials, researchers continued to deepen the research on light-material interactions in microcavities, and strong coupling phenomena and research related to exciton-polariton lasers have gradually been reported.
   In F-P microcavity applications, its application in precision parameter measurement is first introduced. Due to the high-quality factor and strong resonance effect of the F-P microcavity, researchers have achieved precision measurement of parameters such as environmental refractive index, temperature, humidity, pressure, and sound through the utilization of optical fibers and corresponding sensing materials. Meanwhile, the teams of Lu Wei and Wang Shaowei from Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have further expanded the measurement field to achieve measurements of the complex refractive index of low-dimensional materials of tiny dimensions. In biological detection, the F-P microcavity can be employed to reveal the characteristics of cells and biomolecules, describe changes in internal molecular interactions, and aid in the detection, identification, and imaging of biomolecules. In multi-dimensional optical field control, by combining the high quality factor of the F-P microcavity, narrow spectral features, and introduction of emerging micro/nano devices such as metasurfaces, it is possible to achieve control and generation of polarization/spectrum, beam shaping, and vortex light fields. This lays the foundation for high-performance and multi-functional optical field control.
   Conclusions and Prospects This review summarizes the research progress in optical field control in F-P microcavities over the past 20 years. The research is focused on the introduction of spectroscopic structures and spectroscopic detection applications based on F-P microcavities, the interaction study of photons with low-dimensional materials in F-P microcavities, and potential applications of F-P microcavities in precision measurement of parameters, biological detection, and multi-dimensional optical field control. Further exploration and in-depth studies are essential for issues such as optimizing the design of the microcavity, accurately manipulating its parameters, and enhancing its stability. The research field of F-P microcavities will be further expanded.
