TI An Automata-Based Framework for Verification and Bug Hunting in Quantum
   Circuits
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB As quantum computing hardware advances, the demand for scalable, precise, and fully automated verification techniques for quantum circuits grows. This paper introduces a novel automata-based framework tailored for the verification of quantum circuits. In our approach, the problem is framed as a triple { P } C { S } , and the question is whether, given a set P of quantum states on the input of a circuit C , the set of quantum states on the output is equal to (or included in) a set S . Our framework leverages tree automata to compactly represent sets of quantum states and we develop transformers to implement the semantics of quantum gates over this representation. We implemented the proposed approach in a prototype tool and evaluated its performance against various benchmarks from the literature. The evaluation shows that our approach is quite scalable; for example, we managed to verify a large circuit with 40 qubits and 141,527 gates, or catch bugs injected into a circuit with 320 qubits and 1,758 gates, where all tools we compared with failed. Additionally, our work bridges quantum program verification and automata, opening new possibilities to exploit the richness of automata theory in quantum computing.

TI Absolutely maximally entangled states,
   quantum-maximum-distance-separable codes, and quantum repeaters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We address the relation between absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states and quantum- maximum-distance-separable (QMDS) codes by constructing whole families of QMDS codes from AME states that have stabilizer representations. We introduce a generic reduction-friendly form for the generator set of the stabilizer representation of an AME state, from which the stabilizer form for children codes, all QMDS, can be obtained. Our method would work for relevant high-dimensional codes as well as qubit-based codes. We then relate this to optimal codes for one-way quantum repeaters, by minimizing the short-term infrastructure cost as well as the long-term running cost of such quantum repeaters. This would allow us to obtain the optimal QMDS code, derived from an AME parent state, that can be used in such quantum repeaters.

AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is critical for reliable quantum computing, yet real-time decoding remains a challenge due to computational complexity. To address this, we propose a systolic array-based syndrome pruning architecture that enhances FPGA-based QEC decoders by reducing computational load and improving efficiency. Our design structures syndrome extraction into a systolic pipeline, enabling localized computations and efficient syndrome graph pruning. To quantify pruning effectiveness, we introduce the Edge Ratio metric, which measures the retained edges in the pruned subgraph relative to the original graph. Results show improved pruning efficiency at larger code distances, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining decoding accuracy. We evaluated our design on Intel Stratix 10, Agilex 7F, and Agilex 7M FPGAs. The optimized implementation achieves up to 49% reduction in Adaptive Logic Module (ALM) usage, 63% lower register utilization, and up to 78% improvement in operating frequency.

TI Testing the accuracy of qubit rotations on a public quantum computer
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We analyze the results of the test of pi/2 qubit rotations on a public quantum computer provided by IBM. We measure a single qubit rotated by pi/2 about a random axis, and we accumulate vast statistics of the results. The test performed on different devices shows systematic deviations from the theoretical predictions, which appear at level 10-3. Some of the differences, beyond 5 standard deviations, cannot be explained by simple corrections due to nonlinearities of pulse generations. The magnitude of the deviation is comparable with the randomized benchmarking of the gate, but we additionally observe a pronounced parametric dependence. We discuss other possible reasons for the deviations, including states beyond the single-qubit space. The deviations have a similar structure for various devices used at different times, so they can also serve as a diagnostic tool to eliminate imperfect gate implementations and a faithful description of the involved physical systems.

TI Discovering autonomous quantum error correction via deep reinforcement
   learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, standard methods relying on active measurements may introduce additional errors. Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) circumvents this by utilizing engineered dissipation and drives in bosonic systems, but identifying practical encoding remains challenging due to stringent Knill-Laflamme conditions. In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover bosonic codes under an approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons. We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states |4) and |7), considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also analyze the robustness of the code against phase damping and amplitude damping noise. Our work highlights the potential of curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning in discovering the optimal quantum error correction code especially in early fault-tolerant quantum systems.

TI Practical routing and criticality in large-scale quantum communication
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss trade-off for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting algorithms for multipath routing, we employ an efficient and practical multipath routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.

AB In this work, we present a solution to the critical limitation of qubit capacity in near-term quantum hardware by giving a hybrid framework that integrates the spectral element method (SEM) with distributed quantum computing. Using domain decomposition techniques, the additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods, the global problem is divided into smaller subproblems that each require significantly fewer qubits, making them suitable for current quantum devices. The HHL algorithm is applied locally to these subproblems, enabling quantum speedups without exceeding hardware constraints. Numerical results validate the approach, demonstrating a scalable and practical solution for high-accuracy simulations despite qubit limitations.

TI Directly Measuring a Multiparticle Quantum Wave Function via Quantum
   Teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a new method to directly measure a general multiparticle quantum wave function, a single matrix element in a multi-particle density matrix, by quantum teleportation. The density matrix element is embedded in a virtual logical qubit and is nondestructively teleported to a single physical qubit for readout. We experimentally implement this method to directly measure the wave function of a photonic mixed quantum state beyond a single photon using a single observable for the first time. Our method also provides an exponential advantage over the standard quantum state tomography in measurement complexity to fully characterize a sparse multiparticle quantum state.

TI A quantum machine learning-based predictive analysis of CERN collision
   events
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the advent of quantum computing, researchers have explored the applicability and any potential advantages of quantum algorithms. This study investigates the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models for regression tasks. Utilizing two distinct CERN datasets (Dielectron events and Proton collision), we investigate prediction accuracy using two QML algorithms, namely Quantum Neural Network (QNN) and Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM). We also discuss the comparative analysis and computational efficiency of QNN and QLSTM compared to classical regression methods. The results show that while the two QML models gave comparable accuracy scores to some of the classical models, the best scores were still achieved by some of the more advanced classical algorithms such as CatBoost. Further analysis of the QNN and QLSTM algorithms using multiple ans & auml;tz designs showed that increased circuit complexity did not yield substantial improvements in prediction accuracy. These findings suggest that QML models, especially QLSTM with simpler ans & auml;tz designs, offer a promising approach for modeling high-energy physics data, and highlight the importance of balancing circuit complexity with performance. The study also underscores the need for further evaluation of these algorithms on quantum hardware to better understand real-world applicability.

TI Reinforcement learning decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computation
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Topological error correcting codes, and particularly the surface code, currently provide the most feasible road-map towards large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. As such, obtaining fast and flexible decoding algorithms for these codes, within the experimentally realistic and challenging context of faulty syndrome measurements, without requiring any final read-out of the physical qubits, is of critical importance. In this work, we show that the problem of decoding such codes can be naturally reformulated as a process of repeated interactions between a decoding agent and a code environment, to which the machinery of reinforcement learning can be applied to obtain decoding agents. While in principle this framework can be instantiated with environments modelling circuit level noise, we take a first step towards this goal by using deepQ learning to obtain decoding agents for a variety of simplified phenomenological noise models, which yield faulty syndrome measurements without including the propagation of errors which arise in full circuit level noise models.

TI Quantum Algorithm for High Energy Physics Simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Simulating quantum field theories is a flagship application of quantum computing. However, calculating experimentally relevant high energy scattering amplitudes entirely on a quantum computer is prohibitively difficult. It is well known that such high energy scattering processes can be factored into pieces that can be computed using well established perturbative techniques, and pieces which currently have to be simulated using classical Markov chain algorithms. These classical Markov chain simulation approaches work well to capture many of the salient features, but cannot capture all quantum effects. To exploit quantum resources in the most efficient way, we introduce a new paradigm for quantum algorithms in field theories. This approach uses quantum computers only for those parts of the problem which are not computable using existing techniques. In particular, we develop a polynomial time quantum final state shower that accurately models the effects of intermediate spin states similar to those present in high energy electroweak showers with a global evolution variable. The algorithm is explicitly demonstrated for a simplified quantum field theory on a quantum computer.

SO QUANTUM
AB Mapping the decoding of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes to classical disordered statistical mechanics models allows one to determine critical error thresholds of QEC codes under phenomenological noise models. Here, we extend this mapping to admit realistic, multi-parameter noise models of faulty QEC circuits, derive the associated strongly correlated classical spin models, and illustrate this approach for a quantum repetition code with faulty stabilizer readout circuits. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study the resulting phase diagram and benchmark our results against a minimumweight perfect matching decoder. The presented method provides an avenue to assess fundamental thresholds of QEC circuits, independent of specific decoding strategies, and can thereby help guiding the development of near-term QEC hardware.

AB There are many problems in cellular communications cannot be resolved traditionally. The quantum communications can add new dimensions, safety, encryption and solution to the traditional networks because of its robust physical strength. However, it is not entirely realised how to adapt the quantum into the traditional communications because it is not entirely utilised. This paper addresses the necessary guidelines and assessments for future quantum solutions to the standard mobile cloud networks. In particular, using entanglement phenomenon to increase the performance of the X2 application (X2-AP) protocol by minimising the overhead signalling, represented by the time and energy consumption the conventional cloud encounters. We intended to offer a delay reduction while adapting the quantum technique into the cloud by modelling the latency of both paradigms. Finally, increasing the number of photons has decreased the delay to about 40% compared to the traditional network. In addition, the energy efficiency in the quantum case has been increased while decreasing the power consumption by about 10%.

TI Deterministic generation of shaped single microwave photons using a
   parametrically driven coupler
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A distributed quantum computing system requires a quantum communication channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting circuits, such a channel can be realized by using propagating microwave photons to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver node. Here we experimentally demonstrate a superconducting circuit that deterministically transfers the state of a data qubit into a propagating microwave mode, with a process fidelity of 94.5%. We use a time-varying parametric drive to shape the temporal profile of the propagating mode to be time symmetric and with constant phase, so that reabsorption by the receiving processor can be implemented as a time-reversed version of the emission. We demonstrate a self-calibrating routine to correct for time-dependent shifts of the emitted frequencies due to the modulation of the parametric drive. Our work provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer and remote entanglement operations in a distributed quantum computing network.

TI Coherence controlled generation of Gaussian quantum discord in a quantum
   beat laser
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum discord, an appropriate measure of quantum correlation, is analyzed in a two-mode Gaussian state of the cavity field evolved by a system of quantum beat laser. In the laser system, two arbitrary single-mode Gaussian states of the cavity fields and an external classical field couple to the atomic lasing medium. We calculate the time-dependent expression for the quantum discord both analytically and numerically, by following the reduced density matrix equation of the resulting cavity field. In this framework, we investigate the generation and control of Gaussian quantum discord in the two-mode Gaussian state of the cavity field at the output in terms of the purity and non-classicality of the two input cavity modes, the Rabi frequency of the classical driving field, the relative phase of the coupling parameters, and the damping rates of the cavity modes. The behaviour of quantum discord appears oscillatory due to the quantum beats in the output cavity field developed by the classical driving field in the medium as time passes. Moreover, we find that quantum discord switches on and off while adjusting the relative phase of the coupling parameters. Analysis of the analytical results agrees well with our numerical simulations.

   Information Paradox

AB We present the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) hypothesis, which addresses the longstanding Black Hole Information Paradox rooted in the apparent conflict between Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR). This paradox raises the question of how information is preserved during black hole formation and evaporation, given that Hawking radiation appears to result in information loss, challenging unitarity in quantum mechanics. The QMM hypothesis proposes that space-time itself acts as a dynamic quantum information reservoir, with quantum imprints encoding information about quantum states and interactions directly into the fabric of space-time at the Planck scale. By defining a quantized model of space-time and mechanisms for information encoding and retrieval, QMM aims to conserve information in a manner consistent with unitarity during black hole processes. We develop a mathematical framework that includes space-time quantization, definitions of quantum imprints, and interactions that modify quantum state evolution within this structure. Explicit expressions for the interaction Hamiltonians are provided, demonstrating unitarity preservation in the combined system of quantum fields and the QMM. This hypothesis is compared with existing theories, including the holographic principle, black hole complementarity, and loop quantum gravity, noting its distinctions and examining its limitations. Finally, we discuss observable implications of QMM, suggesting pathways for experimental evaluation, such as potential deviations from thermality in Hawking radiation and their effects on gravitational wave signals. The QMM hypothesis aims to provide a pathway towards resolving the Black Hole Information Paradox while contributing to broader discussions in quantum gravity and cosmology.

TI Quantum computing based state domain equations and feedback control
SO RESULTS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing is gaining popularity in a variety of engineering fields. Especially in the case of automated process control. In light of ever-increasing technological sophistication and complexity, as well as demands on computing resources, the need for quantum versions of basic mathematical modelling and control theory tools is imminent. This paper presents a quantum computing formulation of state domain equations, a new quantum computing-based solver of differential equations based on a single qubit state, and a validation on a DC motor drive illustrative example using Matlab-based quantum algorithm. The quantum formulation of state equations is carried out with the help of a qubit state expressed as a time varying quantum spin based on the Bloch representation. A new method for solving state domain equations is presented, as well as the concept of quantum state feedback control and the ability to maintain a qubit state in a desired state. Two state domain control strategies developed with quantum computing tools are presented and compared to the exact classical solution, highlighting the methods' effectiveness.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI Multiple Query Optimization Using a Gate-Based Quantum Computer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing promises to solve difficult optimization problems in chemistry, physics and mathematics more efficiently than classical computers. However, it requires fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits; a technological challenge still not mastered by engineers. To lower the barrier, hybrid algorithms combining classical and quantum computers are used, where quantum computing is only used for those parts of computation that cannot be solved efficiently otherwise. In this paper, we tackle the multiple query optimization problem (MQO), an important NP-hard problem in database research. We present an implementation based on a scheme called quantum approximate optimization algorithm to solve the MQO on a gate-based quantum computer. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of our implementation and compare its performance against a competing approach that employs a quantum annealer - another type of quantum computer. Our implementation shows a qubit efficiency of close to 99%, which is almost a factor of 2 higher than the state-of-the-art implementation. We emphasize that the problems we can solve with current gate-based quantum technology are fairly small and might not seem practical yet compared to state-of-the-art classical query optimizers. However, our experiments on using a hybrid approach of classical and quantum computing show that our implementation scales favourably with larger problem sizes. Hence, we conclude that our approach shows promising results for near-term quantum computers and thus sets the stage for a challenging avenue of novel database research.

TI Multidisk Clutch Optimization Using Quantum Annealing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we apply a quantum optimization algorithm to solve a combinatorial problem with significant practical relevance occurring in clutch manufacturing. It is demonstrated how quantum optimization can play a role in real industrial applications in the manufacturing sector. Using the quantum annealer provided by D-Wave Systems, we analyze the performance of the quantum and quantum-classical hybrid solvers and compare them to deterministic- and random-algorithm classical benchmark solvers. The continued evolution of the quantum technology, indicating an expectation for even greater relevance in the future, is discussed, and the revolutionary potential it could have in the manufacturing sector is highlighted.

TI Compilation of a simple chemistry application to quantum error
   correction primitives
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A number of exciting recent results have been seen in the field of quantum error correction. These include initial demonstrations of error correction on current quantum hardware and resource estimates which improve understanding of the requirements to run large-scale quantum algorithms for real -world applications. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two developments by performing careful estimation of the resources required to fault -tolerantly perform quantum phase estimation (QPE) on a minimal chemical example. Specifically, we describe a detailed compilation of the QPE circuit to lattice surgery operations for the rotated surface code, for a hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis set. We describe a number of optimizations at both the algorithmic and error correction levels. We find that implementing even a simple chemistry circuit requires 1000 qubits and 2300 quantum error correction rounds, emphasising the need for improved error correction techniques specifically targeting the early fault -tolerant regime.

TI Microwave Control of the Tin-Vacancy Spin Qubit in Diamond with a
   Superconducting Waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Group-IV color centers in diamond are promising candidates for quantum networks due to their dominant zero-phonon line and symmetry-protected optical transitions that connect to coherent spin levels. The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV) center possesses long electron spin lifetimes due to its large spin-orbit splitting. However, the magnetic dipole transitions required for microwave spin control are suppressed, and strain is necessary to enable these transitions. Recent work has shown spin control of strained emitters using microwave lines that suffer from Ohmic losses, restricting coherence through heating. We utilize a superconducting coplanar waveguide to measure SnV centers subjected to strain, observing substantial improvement. A detailed analysis of the SnV center electron spin Hamiltonian based on the angle-dependent splitting of the ground and excited states is performed. We demonstrate coherent spin manipulation and obtain a Hahn echo coherence time of up to T2 = 430 mu s. With dynamical decoupling, we can prolong coherence to T2 = 10 ms, about a sixfold improvement compared to earlier works. We also observe a nearby coupling 13C spin, which may serve as a quantum memory, thus substantiating the potential of SnV centers in diamond and demonstrates the benefit of superconducting microwave structures.

TI Demonstration of a switched CV-QKD network
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB A quantum channel is a physical media able to carry quantum signals. Quantum key distribution (QKD) requires direct quantum channels between every pair of prepare-and-measure modules. This requirement heavily compromises the scalability of networks of directly connected QKD modules. A way to avoid this problem is to introduce switches that can dynamically reconfigure the set of connections. The reconfiguration of a quantum channel implies that the modules using it can adapt to the new channel and peer. The maturity and flexibility of continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) qualifies it as a strong contender for integration into optical communication networks. Here we present the implementation of a switched CV-QKD network embedded in the Madrid quantum testbed. The optical switching of the quantum paths significantly reduces the amount of required QKD modules and facilitates the scalability of the network. This demonstration highlights the flexibility and ease of integration of this emerging technology.

TI Mitigating crosstalk errors by randomized compiling: Simulation of the
   BCS model on a superconducting quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We develop and apply an extension of the randomized compiling (RC) protocol that includes a special treatment of neighboring qubits and dramatically reduces crosstalk effects caused by the application of faulty gates on superconducting qubits in IBMQ quantum computers (ibm_lagos and ibmq_ehningen). Crosstalk errors, stemming from controlled-NOT (CNOT) two-qubit gates, are a crucial source of errors on numerous quantum computing platforms. For the IBMQ machines, their effect on the performance of a given quantum computation is often overlooked. Our RC protocol turns coherent noise due to crosstalk into a depolarizing noise channel that can then be treated using established error mitigation schemes, such as noise estimation circuits. We apply our approach to the quantum simulation of the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian for superconductivity, a particularly challenging model to simulate on quantum hardware because of the long-range interaction of Cooper pairs. With 135 CNOT gates, we work in a regime where crosstalk, as opposed to either Trotterization or qubit decoherence, dominates the error. Our twirling of neighboring qubits is shown to dramatically improve the noise estimation protocol without the need to add new qubits or circuits and allows for a quantitative simulation of the BCS model.

TI Quantum dots for photonic quantum information technology
SO ADVANCES IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
AB The generation, manipulation, storage, and detection of single photons play a central role in emerging photonic quantum information technology. Individual photons serve as flying qubits and transmit the relevant quantum information at high speed and with low losses, for example between individual nodes of quantum networks. Due to the laws of quantum mechanics, the associated quantum communication is fundamentally tap-proof, which explains the enormous interest in this modern information technology. On the other hand, stationary qubits or photonic states in quantum computers can potentially lead to enormous increases in performance through parallel data processing, to outperform classical computers in specific tasks when quantum advantage is achieved. In this review, we discuss in depth the great potential of semiconductor quantum dots in photonic quantum information technology. In this context, quantum dots form a key resource for the implementation of quantum communication networks and photonic quantum computers, because they can generate single photons on demand. Moreover, these solid -state quantum emitters are compatible with the mature semiconductor technology, so that they can be integrated comparatively easily into nanophotonic structures such as resonators and waveguide systems, which form the basis for quantum light sources and integrated photonic quantum circuits. After a thematic introduction, we present modern numerical methods and theoretical approaches to device design and the physical description of quantum dot devices. We then introduce modern methods and technical solutions for the epitaxial growth and for the deterministic nanoprocessing of quantum devices based on semiconductor quantum dots. Furthermore, we highlight the most promising device concepts for quantum light sources and photonic quantum circuits that include single quantum dots as active elements and discuss applications of these novel devices in photonic quantum information technology. We close with an overview of open issues and an outlook on future developments.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Effects of quantum noise on teleportation of arbitrary two-qubit state
   via five-particle Brown state
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We propose a new protocol for quantum teleportation (QT) which adopts the Brown state as the quantum channel. This work focuses on the teleportation of a single unknown two-qubit state via a Brown state channel in an ideal environment. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, we conduct experiments by using the quantum circuit simulator Quirk. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of four noisy channels, namely, the phase damping noise, the bit-flip noise, the amplitude damping noise, and the phase-flip noise. Notably, we employ Monte Carlo simulation to elucidate the fidelity density under various noise parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the fidelity of the protocol in a noisy environment is influenced significantly by the amplitude of the initial state and the noise factor.

TI Quantum simulation in Fock-state lattices
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB Fock-state lattices (FSLs) consist of the Fock states of photons and atoms, establishing a quantum photonic platform for simulating condensed matter physics.

Recent advancements in state-of-the-art superconducting circuits have enabled the observation of these topological quantum photonic phenomena. With scalable dimensions and flexible structure engineering, FSLs offer a novel tool for investigating high-dimensional topological physics and devising innovative devices for quantum information processing.

TI Reduced-order modeling on a near-term quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing is an advancing area of research in which computer hardware and algorithms are developed to take advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena. In recent studies, quantum algorithms have shown promise in solving linear systems of equations as well as systems of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Reducedorder modeling (ROM) algorithms for studying fluid dynamics have shown success in identifying linear operators that can describe flowfields, where dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a particularly useful method in which a linear operator is identified from data. In this work, DMD is reformulated as an optimization problem to propagate the state of the linearized dynamical system on a quantum computer. This reformulation was chosen as a means of facilitating implementation on a near-term quantum computer. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), a technique for optimizing quadratic polynomials in binary variables, allows for quantum annealing algorithms to be applied. A quantum circuit model (quantum approximation optimization algorithm, QAOA) is utilized to obtain predictions of the state trajectories. Results are shown for the quantum-ROM predictions for flow over a 2D cylinder at Re = 220 and flow over a NACA0009 airfoil at Re = 500 and alpha = 15 degrees. The quantum-ROM predictions are found to depend on the number of bits utilized for a fixed point representation and the truncation level of the DMD model. Comparisons with DMD predictions from a classical computer algorithm are made, as well as an analysis of the computational complexity and prospects for future, more fault-tolerant quantum computers.

AB Quantum error correction is necessary for large-scale quantum computing. A promising quantum error correcting code is the surface code. For this code, fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e., splitting and merging patches of code. Given the frequent use of certain lattice-surgery subroutines (LaS), it becomes crucial to optimize their design in order to minimize the overall spacetime volume of FTQC. In this study, we define the variables to represent LaS and the constraints on these variables. Leveraging this formulation, we develop a synthesizer for LaS, LaSsynth, that encodes a LaS construction problem into a SAT instance, subsequently querying SAT solvers for a solution. Starting from a baseline design, we can gradually invoke the solver with shrinking spacetime volume to derive more compact designs. Due to our foundational formulation and the use of SAT solvers, LaSsynth can exhaustively explore the design space, yielding optimal designs in volume. For example, it achieves 8% and 18% volume reduction respectively over two states-of-the-art human designs for the 15-to-1 T-factory, a bottleneck in FTQC.

TI Agile and Versatile Quantum Communication: Signatures and Secrets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Agile cryptography allows for a resource-efficient swap of a cryptographic core in case the security of an underlying classical cryptographic algorithm becomes compromised. Conversely, versatile cryptography allows the user to switch the cryptographic task without requiring any knowledge of its inner workings. In this paper, we suggest how these related principles can be applied to the field of quantum cryptography by explicitly demonstrating two quantum cryptographic protocols, quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret sharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform. Crucially, the protocols differ only in their classical postprocessing. The system is also suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with deployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature phase-shift keying encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first time, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver, enhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are inherently multipartite, and we prove that they are secure not only when a player internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external) eavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed. In our first proof-of-principle demonstration of an agile and versatile quantum communication system, the quantum states are distributed at GHz rates. A 1-bit message may be securely signed using our QDS protocols in less than 0.05 ms over a 2-km fiber link and in less than 0.2 s over a 20-km fiber link. To our knowledge, this also marks the first demonstration of a continuous-variable direct QSS protocol.

TI On-chip distribution of quantum information using traveling phonons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Distributing quantum entanglement on a chip is a crucial step toward realizing scalable quantum processors. Using traveling phonons-quantized guided mechanical wave packets-as a medium to transmit quantum states is now gaining substantial attention due to their small size and low propagation speed compared to other carriers, such as electrons or photons. Moreover, phonons are highly promising candidates to connect heterogeneous quantum systems on a chip, such as microwave and optical photons for long-distance transmission of quantum states via optical fibers. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of distributing quantum information using phonons by realizing quantum entanglement between two traveling phonons and creating a time-bin-encoded traveling phononic qubit. The mechanical quantum state is generated in an optomechanical cavity and then launched into a phononic waveguide in which it propagates for around 200 micrometers. We further show how the phononic, together with a photonic qubit, can be used to violate a Bell-type inequality.

TI 1-Bit RIS-Aided Index Modulation With Quantum Annealing
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we investigate a new index modulation (IM) scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications with 1-bit RIS phase resolution. In addition to the traditional modulated symbols, extra bits of information are embedded in the binary RIS phase vector by indexing the cardinality of the positive phases shifts. To maximize capacity, the IM-based RIS vector is selected so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. The proposed IM design requires the solution of a quadratic binary optimization problem with an equality constraint at the transmitter as well as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem at the receiver. Since commercial solvers cannot directly handle constraints, a penalty method that embeds the equality constraint in the objective function is investigated. To overcome the empirical tuning of the penalty parameter, an iterative Augmented Lagrangian optimization technique is also investigated where a QUBO problem is solved at each iteration. The proposed design and associated mathematical framework are tested in a real-world quantum annealing device provided by D-WAVE. Rigorous experimental results demonstrate that the D-WAVE heuristic efficiently solves the considered combinatorial problems. Furthermore, theoretical bounds on the average capacity are provided. Both experimental and theoretical results show that the proposed design outperforms conventional counterparts.

TI Two-step feedback preparation of entanglement for qubit systems with
   time delay
SO AUTOMATICA
AB Quantum entanglement plays a fundamental role in quantum computation and quantum communication. Feedback control has been widely used in stochastic quantum systems to generate given entangled states since it has good robustness, where the time required to compute filter states and conduct filter-based control usually cannot be ignored in many practical applications. This paper designed two control strategies based on the Lyapunov method to prepare a class of entangled states for qubit systems with a constant delay time. The first one is bang-bang-like control strategy, which has a simple form with switching between a constant value and zero, the stability of which is proved. Another control strategy is switching Lyapunov control, where a constant delay time is introduced in the filter-based feedback control law to compensate for the computation time. Numerical results on a two-qubit system illustrate the effectiveness of these two proposed control strategies. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI All-photonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill-qubit repeater using
   analog-information-assisted multiplexed entanglement ranking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Long-distance quantum communication will require the use of quantum repeaters to overcome the exponential attenuation of signal with distance. One class of such repeaters utilizes quantum error correction to overcome losses in the communication channel. Here we propose a strategy of using the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code in a two-way repeater architecture with multiplexing. The crucial feature of the GKP code that we make use of is the fact that GKP qubits easily admit deterministic two-qubit gates, hence allowing for multiplexing without the need for generating large cluster states as required in previous all-photonic architectures based on discrete-variable codes. Moreover, alleviating the need for such clique clusters entails that we are no longer limited to extraction of at most one end-to-end entangled pair from a single protocol run. In fact, thanks to the availability of the analog information generated during the measurements of the GKP qubits, we can design better entanglement swapping procedures in which we connect links based on their estimated quality. This enables us to use all the multiplexed links so that large number of links from a single protocol run can contribute to the generation of the end-to-end entanglement. We find that our architecture allows for high-rate end-to-end entanglement generation and is resilient to imperfections arising from finite squeezing in the GKP state preparation and homodyne detection inefficiency. In particular we show that long-distance quantum communication over more than 1000 km is possible even with less than 13 dB of GKP squeezing. We also quantify the number of GKP qubits needed for the implementation of our scheme and find that for good hardware parameters our scheme requires around 103-104 GKP qubits per repeater per protocol run.

TI Quantum algorithms and complexity in healthcare applications: a
   systematic review with machine learning-optimized analysis
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB This paper presents a systematic review of quantum computing approaches to healthcare-related computational problems, with an emphasis on quantum-theoretical foundations and algorithmic complexity. We adopt an optimized machine learning methodology-combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-to analyze the literature and identify key research themes at the intersection of quantum computing and healthcare. A total of 63 peer-reviewed studies were analyzed, with 41 categorized under the first domain and 22 under the second. This approach revealed two primary research directions: (1) quantum computing for artificial intelligence in healthcare, and (2) quantum computing for healthcare data security. We highlight the theoretical advances underlying these domains, from novel quantum machine learning algorithms for biomedical data to quantum cryptographic protocols for securing medical information. A gradient boosting classifier further validates our taxonomy by reliably distinguishing between the two categories of research, demonstrating the robustness of the identified themes, with an accuracy of 84.2%, a precision of 88.9%, a recall of 84.2%, an F1-score of 84.5%, and an area under the curve of 0.875. Interpretability analysis using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) exposes distinguishing features of each category (e.g., references to biomedical applications versus blockchain-based security frameworks), offering transparency into the literature-driven categorization, with the latter showing the most significant contributions to topic assignment (ranging from -0.133 to +0.128). Our findings underscore that quantum algorithms offer significant potential to enhance data security, optimize complex diagnostic computations, and provide computational speedups for health informatics. We also identify outstanding challenges-such as the need for scalable quantum algorithms and error-tolerant hardware integration-that must be addressed to translate these theoretical advancements into real-world clinical impact. This study emphasizes the importance of hybrid quantum-classical models and cross-disciplinary research to bridge the gap between cutting-edge quantum computing theory and its practical applications in healthcare.

We apply this concept to investigate a discrete meanvariance portfolio optimization problem, showing its usefulness in a key finance application. Our analysis shows a drastic improvement in the success probabilities of the resulting digital quantum algorithm when approximate counterdiabatic techniques are introduced. Along these lines, we discuss the enhanced performance of our methods over variational quantum algorithms like QAOA and DC-QAOA.

TI Fast quantum state transfer and entanglement for cavity-coupled many
   qubits via dark pathways
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum state transfer (QST) and entangled state generation (ESG) are important building blocks for modern quantum information processing. To achieve these tasks, convention wisdom is to consult the quantum adiabatic evolution, which is time-consuming, and thus is of low fidelity. Here, using the shortcut to adiabaticity technique, we propose a general method to realize high-fidelity fast QST and ESG in a cavity-coupled many qubits system via its dark pathways, which can be further designed for high-fidelity quantum tasks with different optimization purpose. Specifically, with a proper dark pathway, QST and ESG between any two qubits can be achieved without decoupling the others, which simplifies experimental demonstrations. Meanwhile, ESG among all qubits can also be realized in a single step. In addition, our scheme can be implemented in many quantum systems, and we illustrate its implementation on superconducting quantum circuits. Therefore, we propose a powerful strategy for selective quantum manipulation, which is promising in cavity coupled quantum systems and could find many convenient applications in quantum information processing.

TI Entanglement-based quantum key distribution with a blinking-free quantum
   dot operated at a temperature up to 20 K
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) promises enhanced robustness against eavesdropping and compatibility with future quantum networks. Among other sources, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can generate polarization-entangled photon pairs with near-unity entanglement fidelity and a multiphoton emission probability close to zero even at maximum brightness. These properties have been demonstrated under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE) and at operation temperatures below 10 K. However, source blinking is often reported under TPE conditions, limiting the maximum achievable photon rate. In addition, operation temperatures reachable with compact cryocoolers could facilitate the widespread deployment of QDs, e.g., in satellite-based quantum communication. We demonstrate blinking-free emission of highly entangled photon pairs from GaAs QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode. High fidelity entanglement persists at temperatures of at least 20 K, which we use to implement fiber-based QKD between two buildings with an average raw key rate of 55 bits/s and a qubit error rate of 8.4%. We are confident that by combining electrical control with already demonstrated photonic and strain engineering, QDs will keep approaching the ideal source of entangled photons for real world applications.

AB Quantum sensing is an important application of emerging quantum technologies. We explore whether a hybrid system of quantum sensors and quantum circuits can surpass the classical limit of sensing. In particular, we use optimization techniques to search for encoder and decoder circuits that scalably improve sensitivity under given application and noise characteristics.
   Our approach uses a variational algorithm that can learn a quantum sensing circuit based on platform-specific control capacity, noise, and signal distribution. The quantum circuit is composed of an encoder which prepares the optimal sensing state and a decoder which gives an output distribution containing information of the signal. We optimize the full circuit to maximize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Furthermore, this learning algorithm can be run on real hardware scalably by using the "parameter-shift" rule which enables gradient evaluation on noisy quantum circuits, avoiding the exponential cost of quantum system simulation. We demonstrate up to 13.12x SNR improvement over existing fixed protocol (GHZ), and 3.19x Classical Fisher Information (CFI) improvement over the classical limit on 15 qubits using IBM quantum computer. More notably, our algorithm overcomes the decreasing performance of existing entanglement-based protocols with increased system sizes.

AB Due to the beyond-classical capability of quantum computing, quantum machine learning is applied independently or embedded in classical models for decision making, especially in the field of finance. Fairness and other ethical issues are often one of the main concerns in decision making. In this work, we define a formal framework for the fairness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning decision models, where we adopt one of the most popular notions of fairness in the literature based on the intuition-any two similar individuals must be treated similarly and are thus unbiased. We show that quantum noise can improve fairness and develop an algorithm to check whether a (noisy) quantum machine learning model is fair. In particular, this algorithm can find bias kernels of quantum data (encoding individuals) during checking. These bias kernels generate infinitely many bias pairs for investigating the unfairness of the model. Our algorithm is designed based on a highly efficient data structure-Tensor Networks-and implemented on Google's TensorFlow Quantum. The utility and effectiveness of our algorithm are confirmed by the experimental results, including income prediction and credit scoring on real-world data, for a class of random (noisy) quantum decision models with 27 qubits (2(27)-dimensional state space) tripling (2(18) times more than) that of the state-of-the-art algorithms for verifying quantum machine learning models.

TI Restoring Quantum Communication Efficiency over High Loss Optical Fibers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In the absence of quantum repeaters, quantum communication proved to be nearly impossible across optical fibers longer than greater than or similar to 20 km due to the drop of transmissivity below the critical threshold of 1/2. However, if the signals fed into the fiber are separated by a sufficiently short time interval, memory effects must be taken into account. In this Letter, we show that by properly accounting for these effects it is possible to devise schemes that enable unassisted quantum communication across arbitrarily long optical fibers at a fixed positive qubit transmission rate. We also demonstrate how to achieve entanglement-assisted communication over arbitrarily long distances at a rate of the same order of the maximum achievable in the unassisted noiseless case.

TI Experimental demonstration of complete quantum information masking and
   generalization of quantum secret sharing
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum information masking (QIM) allows encoding quantum information in multipartite systems. Complete QIM is of great significance in quantum foundation and application. However, the realization of complete QIM, even for single-qubit encoded information, is still lacking. Here, we propose to demonstrate complete QIM with 4-qubit entangled states. The proposed QIM can be readily extended to multipartite systems with arbitrary number of subsystems, enabling quantum secret sharing (QSS) and quantum teleportation between multiplayers. In experiment, we build up a 4-qubit hyperentangled state to implement complete QIM. The trace distance of 16 encoded single-qubit states falls within the range of 0.12 +/- 0.02 to 0.03 +/- 0.02. Furthermore, we implement QSS between six players by expanding the 4-qubit state to a 6-qubit state entangled in hybrid manner, in which we observe an average fidelity 0.85 +/- 0.03 of the recovered states. Our results open the door towards QIM-enabled quantum information processing and provide applications in quantum communications.

TI RETRACTED: Cryptanalysis and Improvements on Quantum Key Agreement
   Protocol Based on Quantum Search Algorithm (Retracted Article)
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Recently, Huang et al. (2021) presented a quantum key agreement schemeto securely negotiate on a secret key employing the properties of a quantumsearch algorithm. First, the authors proposed the two-party quantum key agreement, and then they extended their work to the three-party case. Huang et al.'s protocol employs the unitary operation and single-particle measurements to negotiate on a secret key without using complex quantum technologies such as quantum memory or entangled quantum particles. The authors claimed that their protocol is secure and efficient. However, this work shows that Huang et al.'s protocol has a significant pitfall, where the private key of one user could be easily leaked to the attackers. Hence, the properties of security and fairness are not achieved. Accordingly, thetwo-party and three-party of Huang et al.'s protocol have been reviewed, and an improvementto address the shortcoming is suggested.

TI Quantum computing without quantum computers: Database search and data
   processing using classical wave superposition
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers are proven to be more efficient at solving a specific class of problems compared to traditional digital computers. Superposition of states and quantum entanglement are the two key ingredients that make quantum computing so powerful. However, not all quantum algorithms require quantum entanglement (e.g., search through an unsorted database). Is it possible to utilize classical wave superposition to speed up database searching as much as by using quantum computers? There were several attempts to mimic quantum computers using classical waves. It was concluded that the use of classical wave superposition comes with the cost of an exponential increase in resources. In this work, we consider the feasibility of building classical wave-based devices able to provide fundamental speedup over digital counterparts without the exponential overhead. We present experimental data on database searching through a magnetic database using spin wave superposition. The results demonstrate the same speedup as expected for quantum computers. Also, we present examples of numerical modeling demonstrating classical wave interference for period finding. This approach may not compete with quantum computers with efficiency but outperform classical digital computers. We argue that classical wave-based devices can perform some of the quantum algorithms with the same efficiency as quantum computers as long as quantum entanglement is not required.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information and quantum foundations are becoming popular topics for advanced undergraduate courses. Many of the fundamental concepts and applications in these two fields, such as delayed choice experiments and quantum encryption, are comprehensible to undergraduates with basic knowledge of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we show that the quantum eraser, usually used to study the duality between wave and particle properties, can also serve as a generic platform for quantum key distribution. We present a pedagogical example of an algorithm to securely share random keys using the quantum eraser platform and propose its implementation with quantum circuits.

TI Holonomic swap and controlled-swap gates of neutral atoms via selective
   Rydberg pumping
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Holonomic quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for quantum computation due to its error resistance and the ability to perform universal quantum computations. Here, we propose a scheme for the rapid implementation of a holonomic swap gate in neutral atomic systems, based on the selective Rydberg pumping mechanism. By employing time-dependent soft control, we effectively mitigate the impact of off-resonant terms even at higher driving intensities compared to time-independent driving. This approach accelerates the synthesis of logic gates and passively reduces the decoherence effects. Furthermore, by introducing an additional atom and applying the appropriate driving field, our scheme can be directly extended to implement a three-qubit controlled-swap gate. This advancement makes it a valuable tool for quantum state preparation, quantum switches, and a variational quantum algorithm in neutral atom systems.

TI Determining probability density functions with adiabatic quantum
   computing
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The two main approaches to quantum computing are gate-based computation and analog computation, which are polynomially equivalent in terms of complexity, and they are often seen as alternatives to each other. In this work, we present a method for fitting one-dimensional probability distributions as a practical example of how analog and gate-based computation can be used together to perform different tasks within a single algorithm. In particular, we propose a strategy for encoding data within an adiabatic evolution model, which accommodates the fitting of strictly monotonic functions, as it is the cumulative distribution function of a dataset. Subsequently, we use a Trotter-bounded procedure to translate the adiabatic evolution into a quantum circuit in which the evolution time t is identified with the parameters of the circuit. This facilitates computing the probability density as derivative of the cumulative function using parameter shift rules.

SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB By considering an arbitrary two-qubit state, it is shown that the Fisher information is intrinsically linked to the geometric discord which allows a measure for quantum correlations beyond entanglement. The complex amplitude of oscillations of the probability density function is upper bounded by the geometric discord which subsequently results in the Fisher information being bounded by the geometric discord. This gives an experimental observable which can be used to quantify quantum correlations beyond entanglement. This observable can be used to witness quantum correlations in an interferometry experiment, and provide another avenue for quantum technologies to continue to develop.

TI Superdense Coding Using Bragg Diffracted Hyperentangled Atoms
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superdense coding (SDC) is a popular protocol demonstrating the potential of using quantum mechanics to transfer data, where The sender (Alice) can transfer 2 bits of classical information over a single qubit. We present a scheme for quantum superdense coding through Bragg diffracted hyperentangled atoms generated using cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In our scheme, Alice transfers 2 bits of classical information over a single hyperentangled atom. This is achieved by introducing multiple quantum gates using resonant and off-resonant Bragg diffraction in cavity QED setup. This scheme uses multiple degrees of freedom to add an extra layer of security to the encoded information.

TI Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes via quasi-cyclic
   codes with complementary duals
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB It is known that entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs), a type of quantum error correction codes, can be easily constructed using linear codes that satisfy the property called linear complementary duals (LCD). For quasi-cyclic (QC) codes, which are a class of linear codes, we have already published the methods for constructing the codes with properties such as self-orthogonality, self-duality and reversibility according to the prime-factor decomposition of -1+xm\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$-1+x<^>m$$\end{document}, which reduce the amount of calculation by assembling several small generator polynomial matrices into a large generator polynomial matrix. In this paper, we propose a method to construct LCD-QC codes according to the prime-factor decomposition. The main idea of this method is to decompose the generator polynomial matrix of the QC code into several small generator polynomial matrices corresponding to the prime factors and perform LCD determination, which leads to a reduction in the amount of calculation. As an application of our construction method, we create EAQECCs from the constructed LCD-QC codes, compare those minimum weights with the maximum values of the minimum weights of existing EAQECCs and find 15 EAQECCs with larger minimum weights than the existing ones.

TI Boundary treatment for variational quantum simulations of partial
   differential equations on quantum computers
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB The paper presents a variational quantum algorithm to solve initial-boundary value problems described by second-order partial differential equations. The approach uses hybrid classical/quantum framework that is well suited for quantum computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport equations fora scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions. The results of this flexible approach display a robust behavior and a strong predictive accuracy in combination with a remarkable polylog complexity scaling in the number of qubits of the involved quantum circuits. Remaining challenges refer to adaptive ansatz strategies that speedup the optimization procedure.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The integration of lattice-based cryptography principles with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols is explored to enhance security in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. With the advent of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods are increasingly susceptible to attacks, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant approaches. By leveraging the inherent resilience of lattice-based cryptography, a synergistic fusion with QKD is proposed to establish secure and robust communication channels among IoT devices. Through comprehensive Qiskit simulations and theoretical analysis, the feasibility, security guarantees, and performance implications of this novel hybrid approach are thoroughly investigated. The findings not only demonstrate the efficacy of lattice-based QKD in mitigating quantum threats, but also highlight its potential to fortify IoT communications against emerging security challenges. Moreover, the authors provide valuable insights into the practical implementation considerations and scalability aspects of this fusion approach. This research contributes to advancing the understanding of quantum-resistant cryptography for IoT applications and paves the way for further exploration and development in this critical domain.

AB The classification of qubit channels is known since 2002. However, that of rebit channels has never been studied so far, maybe because of the scarcity of concrete rebit examples. In this paper we point out that the strategy used to classify qubit channels cannot be pursued in the rebit case and we propose an alternative which allows us to complete the rebit channel classification. This mathematical result has not only a purely abstract interest: as we shall briefly mention, it may have applications in the analysis of local properties and temporal evolution of real quantum systems and also in a recent color vision model based on quantum information.

TI Benchmarking the Ability of a Controller to Execute Quantum Error
   Corrected Non-Clifford Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on the successful implementation of non-Clifford circuits with quantum error correction (QEC). In QEC, quantum gates and measurements encode quantum information into an error-protected Hilbert space, while classical processing decodes the measurements into logical errors. QEC non-Clifford gates pose the greatest computation challenge from the classical controller's perspective, as they require mid-circuit decoding-dependent feed-forward-modifying the physical gate sequence based on the decoding outcome of previous measurements within the same circuit. In this work, we introduce the first benchmarks to holistically evaluate the capability of a combined controller-decoder system to run non-Clifford QEC circuits. We show that executing an error-corrected non-Clifford circuit, comprised of numerous non-Clifford gates, strictly hinges upon the classical controller-decoder system. Particularly, its ability to perform decoding-based feed-forward with low latency, defined as the time between the last measurement required for decoding and the dependent mid-circuit quantum operation. We analyze how the system's latency dictates the circuit's operational regime: latency divergence, classical-controller-limited runtime, or quantum-operation-limited runtime. Based on this understanding, we introduce latency-based benchmarks to set a standard for developing QEC control systems as the essential components of fault-tolerant quantum computation.

By combining quantum computing methods with classical neural network techniques we aim to foster an increase of performance in solving classification problems. Our algorithm is designed for existing and near-term quantum devices. We propose a novel hybrid variational quantum classifier that combines the quantum gradient descent method with steepest gradient descent to optimise the parameters of the network. By applying this algorithm to a resonance search in di-top final states, we find that this method has a better learning outcome than a classical neural network or a quantum machine learning method trained with a non-quantum optimisation method. The classifiers ability to be trained on small amounts of data indicates its benefits in data-driven classification problems.

TI In situ mixer calibration for superconducting quantum circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Mixers play a crucial role in superconducting quantum computing, primarily by facilitating frequency conversion of signals to enable precise control and readout of quantum states. However, imperfections, particularly local oscillator leakage and unwanted sideband signal, can significantly compromise control fidelity. To mitigate these defects, regular and precise mixer calibrations are indispensable, yet they pose a formidable challenge in large-scale quantum control. Here, we introduce an in situ and scalable mixer calibration scheme using superconducting qubits. Our method leverages the qubit's response to imperfect signals, allowing for calibration without modifying the wiring configuration. We experimentally validate the efficacy of this technique by benchmarking single-qubit gate error and qubit coherence time.

TI Rabi- and Blockade-Error-Resilient All-Geometric Rydberg Quantum Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a nontrivial two-qubit gate scheme in which Rydberg atoms are subject to designed pulses resulting from geometric evolution processes. By utilizing hybrid robust nonadiabatic and adiabatic geo-metric operations on the control atom and target atom, respectively, we improve the robustness of the two-qubit Rydberg gate against Rabi control errors as well as blockade errors in comparison with the conventional two-qubit blockade gate. Numerical results with the current state-of-the-art experimental parameters corroborates the above mentioned robustness. We also evaluate the influence induced by the motion-induced dephasing and the dipole-dipole interaction and imperfection-excitation-induced leakage errors, which both could decrease the gate fidelity. Our scheme provides a promising route towards sys-tematic control error (Rabi error) as well as blockade-error-resilient geometric quantum computation on neutral atom system.

   CryptographyKey Applied Protocols for Data Scienceand Web Security
SO JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING
AB Currently, data security is one of the most concerning research topics. The traditional RSA encryption system has become vulnerable to quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, leading to the development of new secu- rity systems for the quantum. As a result, quantum cryptography is gaining importance as a key element of future communication security. This study focuses on quantum key distribution protocols for data quantum encryption, aiming to achieve quantum robustness in all stages of quantum cryptography communication processes. Quantum cryptography communication requires robust quantum encryption not only between end-nodes but also between all components. Therefore, this study demonstrates the process of end-to-end data quantum encryption and proves the overall quantum robustness in this. process.

TI Mutual entity authentication of quantum key distribution network system
   using authentication qubits
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Entity authentication is crucial for ensuring secure quantum communication as it helps confirm the identity of participants before transmitting any confidential information. We propose a practical entity authentication protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) network systems that utilizes authentication qubits. In this protocol, authentication qubits that are encoded with pre-shared information are generated and exchanged to verify the legitimacy of each entity. By using the authentication qubit, participants can identify each other with enhanced security level through the quantum channel. The proposed protocol can be easily integrated with existing QKD systems without the need for additional hardware. In this study, we demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed scheme using a 1xN QKD network system and verified its stable operation over a deployed fiber network. Additionally, a security analysis of the proposed entity authentication protocol and architecture is provided.

TI Parameterized quantum circuits as universal generative models for
   continuous multivariate distributions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Parameterized quantum circuits are a key component of quantum machine learning models for regression, classification, and generative tasks. Quantum Circuit Born machines produce discrete distributions over bitstrings whose length is exactly the number of qubits. To allow for distributions on continuous variables, new models have been introduced where classical randomness is uploaded into quantum circuits and expectation values are returned with a dimensionality decoupled from qubit number. While these models have been explored experimentally, their expressivity remains underexplored. In this work, we formalize this family and establish its theoretical foundation. We prove the universality of several variational circuit architectures for generating continuous multivariate distributions and derive tight resource bounds to reach universality using tools related to the Holevo bound. Our results reveal a trade-off between the number of qubits and measurements. We further explore relaxed notions of universality and present a practical use case, outlining potential domains for quantum advantage.

TI A framework for quantum controlled teleportation in multi-hop networks:
   noise analysis and IBMQ evaluation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Multi-hop quantum teleportation is a fundamental technique for enabling scalable, long-distance quantum communication, making it a key building block for future quantum networks. In this paper, we present a generalized multi-hop quantum controlled teleportation (MQCT) protocol that enables more flexible transfer across complex network architectures. We perform a detailed analysis of the protocol's performance under realistic noise conditions, focusing on the impact of various noise sources on both the teleportation process and the underlying quantum channels. To assess its practical performance, we implemented the protocol on an IBM quantum (IBMQ) computer. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol in near-term quantum devices and provide valuable insights into its behavior under real-world quantum noise, paving the way for more reliable quantum communication systems.

TI Identity Rules-Based Decomposition, Optimization, and Spin-Torque
   Modeling of Controlled V and V plus Gates for Quantum Full Adder
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The quantum computing (QC) is emerging as one of the possibilities to replace the conventional computing to meet the complex computing challenges. Quantum gates are based on the quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. Moreover, there are several ways to realize the reversible full adder representing one of the building blocks of the reversible computing. One of the ways to realize the reversible full adder is by using the controlled V and V+ gates. Spintronics is one of the quantum technologies to realize the reversible computing physically. Therefore, there is need of spin-torque based modelling of controlled V and V+ gates for the quantum computing applications in the reversible computing domain. In this paper, the controlled V and V+ gates are modelled for the spin-torque based qubit architecture through the optimization at elementary single-qubit rotation and two-qubit entanglement level. Therefore, the key innovation or unique contribution is to realize the controlled V and V+ gates by using the minimum number of the elementary operations (single- and two-qubits). Moreover, a quantum full adder (QFA) composed of controlled V and V+ gates, is optimized and realized with the spin-torque models of the controlled V and V+ gates to achieve fault tolerant fidelity. Therefore, the novelty is that the optimization of the controlled V and V+ gates for the reversible full adders is carried out by using the identity rules.

TI Toward a Quantum Memory in a Fiber Cavity Controlled by Intracavity
   Frequency Translation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a quantum memory protocol based on trapping photons in a fiber-integrated cavity, comprised of a birefringent fiber with dichroic reflective end facets. Photons are switched into resonance with the fiber cavity by intracavity Bragg-scattering frequency translation, driven by ancillary control pulses. After the storage delay, photons are switched out of resonance with the cavity, again by intracavity frequency translation. We demonstrate storage of quantum-level THz-bandwidth coherent states for a lifetime up to 16 cavity round trips, or 200 ns, and a maximum overall efficiency of 73%.

TI Implementation of carrier-grade quantum communication networks over
   10000 km
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing poses a serious threat to classical cryptographic algorithms based on computational complexity. Quantum key distribution (QKD), utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, enables secure key exchange and has been proven to be an essential technology to resist the threat of quantum computing. China attaches great importance to the construction of QKD network to deal with this threat. In 2020, China established an integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network, which includes 32 backbone nodes and 4 metropolitan networks. Here we introduce China's latest progress in the deployment of QKD networks, called the China Quantum Communication Network (CN-QCN). CN-QCN is an operational, long-range, and trusted-relay-based QKD network spanning over 10,000 kilometers, incorporating 145 fiber backbone nodes, and 20 metropolitan networks, which cover 17 provinces and 80 cities. Moreover, the network has deployed 6 ground stations linked with Jinan-1 quantum microsatellite. CN-QCN has not only surpassed its predecessor in scale, but also made significant advancements in multi-type QKD hybrid networking and long-range quantum network operation and maintenance. We present the network architecture, QKD implementation, and long-term performance of CN-QCN in this paper. This work lays the foundation for widespread applications of QKD in China.

TI Analysis of multipartite entanglement distribution using a central
   quantum-network node
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the performance (rate and fidelity) of distributing multipartite entangled states ina quantum network through the use of a central node. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the multipartite entangled state is first prepared locally at a central node and then transmitted to the end nodes of the network through quantum teleportation. As our first result, we present leading-order analytical expressions and lower bounds for both the rate and fidelity at which a specific class of multipartite entangled states, namely, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, are distributed. Our analytical expressions for the fidelity accurately account for time-dependent depolarizing noise encountered by individual quantum bits while stored in quantum memory, as verified using Monte Carlo simulations. As our second result, we compare the performance to the case where the central node is an entanglement switch and the GHZ state is created by the end nodes in a distributed fashion. Apart from these two results, we outline how the teleportation-based scheme could be physically implemented using trapped ions or nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.

TI ERROR THRESHOLDS FOR ARBITRARY PAULI NOISE
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB The error threshold of a one-parameter family of quantum channels is defined as the largest noise level such that the quantum capacity of the channel remains positive. This in turn guarantees the existence of a quantum error correction code for noise modeled by that channel. Discretizing the single-qubit errors leads to the important family of Pauli quantum channels; curiously, multipartite entangled states can increase the threshold of these channels beyond the so-called hashing bound, an effect termed superadditivity of coherent information. In this work, we divide the simplex of Pauli channels into one-parameter families and compute numerical lower bounds on their error thresholds. We find substantial increases of error thresholds relative to the hashing bound for large regions in the Pauli simplex corresponding to biased noise, which is a realistic noise model in promising quantum computing architectures. The error thresholds are computed on the family of graph states, a special type of stabilizer state. In order to determine the coherent information of a graph state, we devise an algorithm that exploits the symmetries of the underlying graph, resulting in a substantial computational speed-up. This algorithm uses tools from computational group theory and allows us to consider symmetric graph states on a large number of vertices. Our algorithm works particularly well for repetition codes and concatenated repetition codes (or cat codes), for which our results provide the first comprehensive study of superadditivity for arbitrary Pauli channels. In addition, we identify a novel family of quantum codes based on tree graphs. The error thresholds of these tree graph states outperform repetition and cat codes in large regions of the Pauli simplex, and hence form a new code family with desirable error correction properties.

TI Adaptive-Optics-Enabled Quantum Communication: A Technique for Daytime
   Space-To-Earth Links
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Previous demonstrations of free-space quantum communication in daylight have been touted as significant for the development of global-scale quantum networks. Until now, no one has carefully tuned their atmospheric channel to reproduce the daytime sky radiance and slant-path turbulence conditions as they exist between space and Earth. In this article we report a quantum communication field experiment under conditions representative of daytime downlinks from space. Higher-order adaptive optics increased quantum channel efficiencies far beyond those possible with tip-tilt correction alone while spatial filtering at the diffraction limit rejected optical noise without the need for an ultranarrow spectral filter. High signal-to-noise probabilities and low quantum-bit-error rates are demonstrated over a wide range of channel radiances and turbulence conditions associated with slant-path propagation in daytime. The benefits to satellite-based quantum key distribution are quantified and discussed.

AB In order to realize large scale quantum error correction (QEC), resource states, such as |T >, must be prepared which is expensive in both space and time. In order to circumvent this problem, alternatives have been proposed, such as the production of continuous angle rotation states [1, 6, 34]. However, the production of these states is non-deterministic and may require multiple repetitions to succeed. The original proposals suggest architectures which do not account for realtime (or dynamic) management of resources to minimize total execution time. Without a realtime scheduler, a statically generated schedule will be unnecessarily expensive. We propose RESCQ (pronounced rescue), a realtime scheduler for programs compiled onto these continuous angle systems. Our scheme actively minimizes total cycle count by on-demand redistribution of resources based on expected production rates. Depending on the underlying hardware, this can cause excessive classical control overhead. We further address this by dynamically selecting the frequency of our recomputation. RESCQ improves over baseline proposals by an average of 2x in cycle count.

TI On the Differential Topology of Expressivity of Parameterized Quantum
   Circuits
SO APPLIEDMATH
AB Parameterized quantum circuits play a key role in quantum computing. Measuring the suitability of such a circuit for solving a class of problems is needed. One such promising measure is the expressivity of a circuit, which is defined in two main variants. The variant in focus of this contribution is the so-called dimensional expressivity, which measures the dimension of the submanifold of states produced by the circuit. Understanding this measure needs a lot of background from differential topology, which makes it hard to comprehend. In this article, we provide this background in a vivid as well as pedagogical manner. Especially, it strives towards being self-contained for understanding expressivity, e.g., the required mathematical foundations are provided, and examples are given. Also, the literature makes several statements about expressivity, the proofs of which are omitted or only indicated. In this article, we give proof for key statements from dimensional expressivity, sometimes revealing limits for generalizing them, and sketching how to proceed in practice to determine this measure.

TI Quantum storage of entangled photons at telecom wavelengths in a crystal
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum storage and distribution of entanglement are the key ingredients for realizing a global quantum internet. Compatible with existing fiber networks, telecom-wavelength entangled photons and corresponding quantum memories are of central interest. Recently, 167Er3+ ions have been identified as a promising candidate for an efficient telecom quantum memory. However, to date, no storage of entangled photons, the crucial step of quantum memory using these promising ions, 167Er3+, has been reported. Here, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of the entangled state of two telecom photons generated from an integrated photonic chip. Combining the natural narrow linewidth of the entangled photons and long storage time of 167Er3+ ions, we achieve storage time of 1.936 mu s, more than 387 times longer than in previous works. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is certified using entanglement witness measurements. These results pave the way for realizing quantum networks based on solid-state devices.
   Storage of photon entanglement at telecommunication wavelength is an important milestone for the development of the quantum internet. Here, the authors demonstrate storage and retrieval of entangled telecom photons-generated through SWFM in a silicon nitride microring resonator-in an Erbium doped crystal.

Further, the influences of device parameter variations caused by the fabrication process can be taken into the model.

TI Quantum steering based weak entanglement detection
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum entanglement is a unique phenomenon of quantum mechanics and the core of many quantum technologies. Although entanglement is often observed in small-scale systems, detecting weak entanglement in large or noisy systems remains a major challenge, as experimental flaws can easily destroy fragile quantum correlations. A new weak entanglement detection criterion based on quantum steering has recently been proposed as a potential alternative to traditional entanglement witnesses. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis by comparing the detection capabilities of the steering-based criterion with those of traditional entanglement witnesses under realistic measurement errors. The results show that the steering-based approach offers improved sensitivity for detecting weak entanglement. We further experimentally verify the feasibility of this steering-based criterion by using a linear optical setup. The experimental results align well with theoretical predictions, confirming the practicality and reliability of the method. These findings provide the steering-based criterion as a promising and accessible tool for detecting weak entanglement, and are expected to have potential applications in quantum communication, quantum computing, and other areas of quantum information science.

In trapped ions, nested layers of continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) by means of radio-frequency field dressing can cancel dominant magnetic and electric shifts and therefore provide highly prolonged coherence times of electronic states. Exploiting this enhancement for frequency metrology, quantum simulation or quantum computation, poses the challenge to combine the decoupling with laser-ion interactions for the quantum control of electronic and motional states of trapped ions. Ultimately, this will require running quantum gates on qubits from dressed decoupled states. We provide here a compact representation of nested CDD in trapped ions, and apply it to electronic S and D states and optical quadrupole transitions. Our treatment provides all effective transition frequencies and Rabi rates, as well as the effective selection rules of these transitions. On this basis, we discuss the possibility of combining CDD and Molmer-Sorensen gates.

AB The last few years have seen many new ways to get hands-on with quantum computing, including publicly accessible prototype hardware and software frameworks. Such tools provide new education opportunities, not just for quantum computing specifically, but also more broadly for quantum information science and even quantum physics as a whole. In this paper we present a case study of one education resource which aims to take advantage of the opportunities: the open-source online textbook 'Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit'. This blends traditional text with executable code and interactive elements. We give an overview of the form taken by the textbook in 2020, summary of the topics covered and an explanation of the approach taken.

TI All-Optical Tripartite Entanglement Swapping (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective In quantum information science, quantum entanglement enables quantum information processing and communication beyond classical limits through its unique nonlocal property. Consequently, quantum entanglement has been widely applied in quantum communications, including quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, and quantum state sharing. Among these, entanglement swapping serves as the core technology for quantum repeaters and a critical component in building quantum networks, allowing two initially independent particles without direct interaction to establish entanglement. Since its proposal in 1993, entanglement swapping has been extensively studied in both discrete variable and continuous variable (CV) systems. In 2004, based on the entangled state generated from a non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA), unconditional quantum entanglement swapping was first achieved in the CV system through Bell-state measurement. In 2016, further entanglement swapping between two independent multipartite entangled states was successfully accomplished via Bell-state measurement. However, the Bell-state measurement process requires optic-electro and electro-optic conversions, which inherently limit the bandwidth of quantum entanglement swapping. To avoid this limitation, in 2022, a low-noise OPA based on a four-wave mixing process (FWM) was experimentally demonstrated to achieve measurement-free all-optical entanglement swapping between two optical fields. This approach replaces optic-electro and electro-optic conversions with a low-noise OPA, providing a methodology for all-optical entanglement swapping among independent multipartite entangled states. Here, we theoretically propose an all-optical tripartite entanglement swapping scheme based on this framework. Our results not only offer an all-optical approach to multipartite entanglement swapping but also provide theoretical foundations for constructing measurement-free all-optical broadband quantum networks. Methods In present study, a low-noise OPA based on the FWM is used to replace the Bell-state measurement procedure in conventional entanglement swapping schemes, thereby realizing all-optical tripartite entanglement swapping. This approach avoids the bandwidth limitations introduced by optic-electro and electro-optic conversions in traditional entanglement swapping scheme. The tripartite entangled state is generated by combining two amplitude-squeezed states and one phase-squeezed state in orthogonal quadratures. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that all-optical tripartite entanglement swapping can be achieved through two distinct schemes: one utilizing a pair of EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) entangled states as the quantum channel, and the other one employing two pairs of EPR entangled states. In our scheme, the positivity under partial transposition (PPT) criterion, which serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for bipartite and tripartite entanglement in the CV regime, is used to verify whether entanglement exists in the system. The PPT criterion checks for entanglement via the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of its transposed covariance matrix. For tripartite entangled states, it is generally common to partition all subsystems into two parts to analyze the correlations between each subsystem. A tripartite system has three types of 1x2 partitions. When the smallest symplectic eigenvalues u1, u2, and u3 of these three partitions are all less than 1, it confirms the presence of tripartite entanglement in the system.
   Results and Discussions For the entanglement swapping scheme using a pair of EPR entangled states as the quantum channel (Fig. 4), tripartite entanglement only exists among Alice, Bob, and Claire when G > 1. At this point, the smallest symplectic eigenvalues u1, u2, and u3 are less than 1 and decrease with the increase of G, indicating that all-optical tripartite entanglement swapping can be accomplished when G > 1 and its performance exhibits positive correlation with G. While this scheme successfully establishes tripartite entanglement among Alice, Bob, and Claire, it's crucial to note that Alice and Bob were already correlated prior to the entanglement swapping. Therefore, this approach cannot achieve our fundamental objective: creating tripartite entanglement among three initially independent systems without direct interaction. To accomplish this goal, we implemented an alternative scheme using two pairs of EPR entangled states as quantum channels (Fig. 5). In this configuration, tripartite entanglement among Alice, Bob, and Claire emerges under the condition G > 1.0145.As G increases, the smallest symplectic eigenvalues u1, u2, and u3 gradually decrease. It means that all-optical tripartite entanglement swapping of the second scheme can be successfully accomplished only under the condition G > 1.0145, and its performance maintains a positive correlation with G. Conclusions We propose two feasible all-optical tripartite entanglement swapping schemes by replacing the function of Bell-state measurement with a low-noise OPA. The one using a pair of EPR entangled states as the quantum channel enables three systems that do not initially share tripartite entanglement to establish entanglement. The other, using two pairs of EPR entangled states as the quantum channel, establishes tripartite entanglement among three initially independent systems without direct interaction. By PPT criterion, we analyze the tripartite entanglement characteristics among Alice, Bob, and Claire. Theoretical investigations into the influence of gain on all-optical quantum entanglement swapping further improve the existed theoretical framework. These results provide critical theoretical support for the development of all-optical quantum networks and multi-node all-optical quantum communication.

TI Parallel transport in rotating frames and projective holonomic quantum
   computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation is a promising approach for implementing quantum gates that offers both efficiency and robustness against certain types of errors. A key element of this approach is a geometric constraint known as the parallel transport condition. According to the principle of covariance, this condition must be appropriately modified when changing reference frames. In this paper, we detail how to adjust the parallel transport condition when transitioning from the laboratory frame to a rotating reference frame. Furthermore, building on gauge invariance considerations, we develop a framework for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with projective gates. The parallel transport condition of this framework effectively addresses the problem of global dynamical phases inherent in conventional nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation. We extend the isoholonomic inequality, which provides a fundamental bound on the efficiency of protocols used to implement holonomic quantum gates, to encompass projective quantum gates. We also determine a minimum execution time for projective holonomic quantum gates and show that this time can be attained when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large.

TI Robust nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation by dynamical
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Besides the intrinsic noise resilience property, nonadiabatic geometric phases are of the fast evolution nature, and thus can naturally be used in constructing quantum gates with excellent performance, i.e., the so-called nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation (NGQC). However, previous single-loop NGQC schemes are sensitive to the operational control error, i.e., the X error, due to the limitations of the implementation. Here, we propose a robust scheme for NGQC combining with the dynamical correction technique, which still uses only simplified pulses, and thus being experimental friendly. We numerically show that our scheme can greatly improve the gate robustness in previous protocols, retaining the intrinsic merit of geometric phases. Furthermore, to fight against the dephasing noise, due to the Z error, we can incorporate the decoherence-free subspace encoding strategy. In this way, our scheme can be robust against both types of errors. Finally, we also propose how to implement the scheme with encoding on superconducting quantum circuits with experimentally demonstrated technology. Therefore, due to the intrinsic robustness, our scheme provides a promising alternation for the future scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Quantum Communication over Atmospheric Channels: A Framework for
   Optimizing Wavelength and Filtering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Despite quantum networking concepts, designs, and hardware becoming increasingly mature, there is no consensus on the optimal wavelength for free-space systems. We present an in-depth analysis of a daytime free-space quantum channel as a function of wavelength and atmospheric spatial coherence (the Fried coherence length). We choose decoy-state quantum key distribution bit yield as a performance metric in order to reveal the ideal wavelength choice for an actual qubit-based protocol under realistic atmospheric conditions. Our analysis represents a rigorous framework to analyze requirements for spatial, spectral, and temporal filtering. These results will help guide the development of free-space quantum communication and networking systems. In particular, our results suggest that shorter wavelengths in the optical band should be considered for free-space quantum communication systems. Our results are also interpreted in the context of atmospheric compensation by higher-order adaptive optics.

TI NetQASM-a low-level instruction set architecture for hybrid
   quantum-classical programs in a quantum internet
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce NetQASM, a low-level instruction set architecture for quantum internet applications. NetQASM is a universal, platform-independent and extendable instruction set with support for local quantum gates, powerful classical logic and quantum networking operations for remote entanglement generation. Furthermore, NetQASM allows for close integration of classical logic and communication at the application layer with quantum operations at the physical layer. This enables quantum network applications to be programmed in high-level platform-independent software, which is not possible using any other QASM variants. We implement NetQASM in a series of tools to write, parse, encode and run NetQASM code, which are available online. Our tools include a higher-level software development kit (SDK) in Python, which allows an easy way of programming applications for a quantum internet. Our SDK can be used at home by making use of our existing quantum simulators, NetSquid and SimulaQron, and will also provide a public interface to hardware released on a future iteration of Quantum Network Explorer.

TI BeSnake: A Routing Algorithm for Scalable Spin-Qubit Architectures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As quantum computing devices increase in size with respect to the number of qubits, two-qubit interactions become more challenging, necessitating innovative and scalable qubit routing solutions. In this work, we introduce beSnake, a novel algorithm specifically designed to address the intricate qubit routing challenges in scalable spin-qubit architectures. Unlike traditional methods in superconducting architectures that solely rely on swap operations, beSnake also incorporates the shuttle operation to optimize the execution time and fidelity of quantum circuits and achieves fast computation times of the routing task itself. Employing a simple breadth-first search approach, beSnake effectively manages the restrictions created by diverse topologies and qubit positions acting as obstacles for up to 72% qubit density. It also has the option to adjust the level of optimization and to dynamically tackle parallelized routing tasks, all the while maintaining noise awareness. Our simulations demonstrate beSnake's advantage over an existing routing solution on random circuits and real quantum algorithms with up to 1000 qubits, showing an average improvement of up to 80% in gate overhead, 54% in depth overhead, and up to 8.33 times faster routing times.

TI Toward Realization of Universal Quantum Teleportation Using Weak
   Measurements
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB In this manuscript, universal quantum teleportation in the presence of memory or memory-less dynamics with applications of partial collapse measurement operators is analyzed. These results show that the combined effects of memory or non-Markovianity, and weak measurements can lead to universal quantum teleportation (UQT). This study involves noise models of physical importance having characteristic Markovian and non-Markovian regions, allowing one to observe a transition in quantum properties as one switches from non-Markovian to Markovian dynamics. For this, the effects of different types of non-Markovianity are characterized for efficient UQT, both due to the retention of correlations for a longer duration and due to information backflow. The memory effects arising from a correlated channel with or without weak measurements are analyzed further. Interestingly, this analysis for a correlated amplitude damping channel shows that memory effects are of significant advantage in minimizing the fidelity deviation. The presence of weak measurements further enhances the realization of UQT in the presence of memory. The ability of memory effects to achieve zero fidelity deviation at non-zero time is interesting and of experimental importance.
   The article analyzes universal quantum teleportation in memory or memory-less dynamics using partial collapse measurement operators. This study examines different noise models of physical significance with distinct Markovian and non-Markovian regions. The study shows that weak measurements and memory or non-Markovianity, can lead to universal quantum teleportation.image

TI Erasing Doppler dephasing error in Rydberg quantum gates
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Doppler dephasing error due to residual thermal motion of atoms is a major cause of infidelity in neutral-atom quantum gates. Besides cooling and trapping advancements, few effective methods exist to mitigate this error. In the present work, we first propose an error-erasing strategy that utilizes a pair of off-resonant fields to continuously dress the protected Rydberg state with an auxiliary state, which can induce an opposite but enhanced sensitivity to the same source of Doppler dephasing error. Combining with the optimal control of laser pulses, we have realized a family of Rydberg two-qubit controlled-NOT gates in Rb and Cs atoms that are fully immune to the Doppler dephasing error. We numerically simulate this gate operation with fidelity F approximate to 0.9906 at any temperature for a lower-excited auxiliary state, and a higher fidelity of F approximate to 0.9960 can be attained for a ground auxiliary state even at a temperature of 500 mu K. Finally, we predict a super-high fidelity of F > 0.9999 for 50 mu K is possible by using the robust pulses with a larger amplitude. Our results significantly reduce atomic temperature requirements for high-fidelity quantum gates, and may provide fundamental guidance to practical fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.

TI Quantum entanglement for continuous variables sharing in an expanding
   spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Detecting the structure of spacetime with quantum technologies has always been one of the frontier topics of relativistic quantum information. Here, we analytically study the generation and redistribution of Gaussian entanglement of the scalar fields in an expanding spacetime. We consider a two-mode squeezed state via a Gaussian amplification channel that corresponds to the time-evolution of the state from the asymptotic past to the asymptotic future. Therefore, the dynamical entanglement of the Gaussian state in an expanding universe encodes historical information about the underlying spacetime structure, suggesting a promising application in observational cosmology. We find that quantum entanglement is more sensitive to the expansion rate than the expansion volume. According to the analysis of quantum entanglement, choosing the particles with the smaller momentum and the optimal mass is a better way to extract information about the expanding universe. These results can guide the simulation of the expanding universe in quantum systems.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum tunneling is a fundamental quantum-mechanical effect involved in plenty of physical phenomena. Its control would impact these phenomena and the technologies based on them. We show that the quantum tunneling probability through a potential barrier can be increased to approach unity in a quantum Zeno dynamics undergone by the tunneling particle in which the direction of the momentum is frequently monitored. We first model the measurements of the momentum direction as selective von Neumann projections, and then as nonselective, direction-sensitive interactions of the particle with probe particles. Nonselective measurements are more efficient than selective measurements in enhancing the quantum tunneling probability.

The resulting type-and-effect system is fully expressive for irreversible quantum computing, including measurement. We provide universal categorical constructions that semantically interpret this arrow metalanguage with choice, starting with any rig groupoid interpreting the reversible base language. Several properties of quantum measurement follow in general, and we translate (noniterative) quantum flow charts into our language. The semantic constructions turn the category of unitaries between Hilbert spaces into the category of completely positive trace-preserving maps, and they turn the category of bijections between finite sets into the category of functions with chosen garbage. Thus they capture the fundamental theorems of classical and quantum reversible computing of Toffoli and Stinespring.

TI Thermally driven quantum refrigerator autonomously resets a
   superconducting qubit
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22 mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.

TI Protecting nonlocal quantum correlations in correlated squeezed
   generalized amplitude damping channel
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nonlocal quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement, quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality, are crucial resources for quantum information tasks. How to protect these quantum resources from decoherence is one of the most urgent problems to be solved. Here, we investigate the evolution of these correlations in the correlated squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel and propose a scheme to protect them with weak measurement (WM) and quantum measurement reversal (QMR). Compared with the results of the uncorrelated SGAD channel, we find that when n = 1, correlation and squeezing effects can prolong the survival time of quantum entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and quantum steering by about 152 times, 207 times, and 10 times, respectively. In addition, local WM and QMR can effectively recover the disappeared nonlocal quantum correlations either in uncorrelated or completely correlated SGAD channels. Moreover, we find that these initial nonlocal quantum correlations could be drastically amplified under the correlated channel. And the steering direction can be flexibly manipulated either by changing the channel parameters or the strength of WM and QMR. These results not only make a step forward in suppressing decoherence and enhancing quantum correlation in noise channels, but also help to develop relevant practical applications.

TI Fast generation of three-atom singlet state with Rydberg superatom
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum entanglement is a basic resource of quantum information processing and quantum computation. The simple and efficient generation of entangled states is always one of the hot research topics. As one of the ideal carriers of quantum information encoding, neutral Rydberg atom occupies a place in the field of generation of entangled state with its unique advantages. For example, Rydberg atom has a large volume and is easily ionized by an external electric field, so it is very sensitive to the change in the external electric field. Therefore, the interaction strength between Rydberg atoms can be changed by altering the external electric field. Rydberg state is a highly excited state, but its radiation attenuation is very small: the radiation lifetime can reach a millisecond level or even longer. The distance between the atomic kernel and the outermost electron is relatively long, and the electric dipole moment is very large. In this paper, the four-level inverted "Y"-type Rydberg atomic system is introduced into the Rydberg blocking ball to form a superatom, and the quantum information is encoded on the effective energy level of the superatom under the condition of weak cavity field. We construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage in a three-superatom system. Combined with quantum Zeno dynamics and shortcuts to adiabatic passage, the three-particle singlet state is simply and effectively generated. In addition, the influence of decoherence factors (including cavity decay and spontaneous emission of superatoms) on the fidelity is considered in this scheme. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme can obtain high fidelity without precisely controlling the evolution time, and the fidelity of singlet state is robust to decoherence factors, since no cavity-photon population is involved in the whole process because of the quantum Zeno dynamics.

TI Simulating quantum circuits with tree tensor networks using
   density-matrix renormalization group algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS are efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework employs a variational compression scheme that optimizes the TTN to approximate the evolved quantum state. To benchmark the method, we simulate random circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise treelike gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a naive TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that the DMRG algorithm with TTNs provides a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.

AB There is an inherent lack of knowledge and technology to test a quantum program properly. In this paper, building on the definition of syntactically equivalent quantum gates, we describe our efforts in developing a tool, coined QMutPy, leveraging the well-known open-source mutation tool MutPy. We further discuss the design and implementation of QMutPy, and the usage of a novel set of mutation operators that generate mutants for qubit measurements and gates. To evaluate QMutPy's performance, we conducted a preliminary study on 11 real quantum programs written in the IBM's Qiskit library. QMutPy has proven to be an effective quantum mutation tool, providing insight into the current state of quantum tests. QMutPy is publicly available at https://github.com/danielfobooss/mutpy.

TI Noisy qudit vs multiple qubits: conditions on gate efficiency for
   enhancing fidelity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB As qubit-based platforms face near-term technical challenges in terms of scalability, qudits, d-level bases of quantum information, are being implemented in multiple platforms as an alternative for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). We compare the infidelity scalings of single qudit and multiqubit systems within identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments in the Lindblad formalism. We find them to be gate-independent to first-order and present an analytically-derived critical curve ( d 2 - 1 ) / 3 log 2 ( d ) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$({d}<^>{2}-1)/3{\log }_{2}(d)$$\end{document} that benchmarks the operational time efficiency of qudits and qubits relative to their decoherence times. This comparison reveals conditions under which qudits offer competitive gate efficiencies compared to leading qubit platforms. Our findings, supported by numerical simulations testing the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism, highlight the relevance of qudits in near-term QIP. This provides a benchmark for evaluating qudit platforms, specifically those with lower dimensionality, in terms of their operational efficiency relative to the qubit state-of-the-art.

TI Ancilla-entangling Floquet kicks for accelerating quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulation with adiabatic annealing can provide insight into difficult problems that are impossible to study with classical computers. However, it deteriorates when the systems scale up due to the shrinkage of the excitation gap and thus places an annealing rate bottleneck for high success probability. Here, we accelerate quantum simulation using digital multiqubit gates that entangle primary system qubits with ancillary qubits. The practical benefits originate from tuning the ancillary gauge degrees of freedom to enhance the quantum algorithm's original functionality in the system registry. For simple but nontrivial short-ranged, infinite long-ranged transverse-field Ising models, and the hydrogen molecule model after qubit encoding, we show improvement in the time to solution by one hundred percent but with higher accuracy through exact state-vector numerical simulation in a digital-analog setting. The findings are further supported by time-averaged Hamiltonian theory.

This can be attributed to its capacity to increase resilience to noise and its ease of integration into current optical communication networks. In this article, we review and survey existing work on CV-QKD post-processing techniques, privacy amplification, and key reconciliation, with the aim of identifying research gaps and areas for further improvement. We also classify protocols based on transmission, preparation, and measurement, which allows for a more systematic and organized understanding of protocols, as well as identifying potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in each component and allowing for targeted improvements to enhance the overall security and efficiency of protocols. Finally, we outline potential research directions and future challenges that require attention to advance the optimization of CV-QKD technology.

TI Sample-Efficient Adaptive Calibration of Quantum Networks Using Bayesian
   Optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB All physical systems employed for quantum information tasks must act as unbiased carriers of encoded quantum states. Ensuring such indistinguishability of information carriers is a major challenge in many quantum information applications, including advanced quantum communication protocols. For photons, the workhorses of quantum communication networks, it is difficult to obtain and maintain their indistinguishability because of environment-induced transformations and loss imparted by communication channels, especially in noisy scenarios. Conventional strategies to mitigate these transformations often require hardware or software overhead that is restrictive (e.g., adding noise), infeasible (e.g., on a satellite), or time-consuming for deployed networks. Here we propose and develop resource-efficient Bayesian optimization techniques to rapidly and adaptively calibrate the indistinguishability of individual photons for quantum networks using only information derived from their measurement. To experimentally validate our approach, we demonstrate the optimization of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between two photons-a central task in quantum networking- finding rapid, efficient, and reliable convergence towards maximal photon indistinguishability in the presence of high loss and shot noise. We expect our resource-optimized and experimentally friendly methodology will allow fast and reliable calibration of indistinguishable quanta, a necessary task in distributed quantum computing, communications, and sensing, as well as for fundamental investigations.

TI Parallel quantum computing simulations via quantum accelerator platform
   virtualization
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Quantum circuit execution is a central task in quantum computation. Due to inherent quantum -mechanical constraints, quantum computing workflows often involve a considerable number of independent measurements over a large set of slightly different quantum circuits. Here we discuss a simple model for parallelizing such quantum circuit executions that is based on introducing a large array of virtual quantum processing units (mapped to HPC nodes in our case) as a parallel quantum computing platform. Implemented within the XACC framework, the model can readily take advantage of its backend-agnostic features, enabling parallel quantum computing/simulation over any target backend supported by XACC. We illustrate the performance of this approach by demonstrating strong scaling in two pertinent domain science problems, namely in computing the gradients for the multi -contracted variational quantum eigensolver and in data -driven quantum circuit learning, where we vary the number of qubits and the number of circuit layers. The latter simulation leverages the cuQuantum library to run efficiently on GPU-accelerated HPC platforms.

TI Hardness of Braided Quantum Circuit Optimization in the Surface Code
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Large-scale quantum information processing requires the use of quantum error-correcting codes to mitigate the effects of noise in quantum devices. Topological error-correcting codes, such as surface codes, are promising candidates, as they can be implemented using only local interactions in a 2-D array of physical qubits. Procedures, such as defect braiding and lattice surgery, can then be used to realize a fault-tolerant universal set of gates on the logical space of such topological codes. However, error correction also introduces a significant overhead in computation time, the number of physical qubits, and the number of physical gates. While optimizing fault-tolerant circuits to minimize this overhead is critical, the computational complexity of such optimization problems remains unknown. This ambiguity leaves room for doubt surrounding the most effective methods for compiling fault-tolerant circuits for a large-scale quantum computer. In this article, we show that the optimization of a special subset of braided quantum circuits is NP-hard by a polynomial-time reduction of the optimization problem into a specific problem called PlanarRectilinear3SAT.

TI Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance
SO NATURE
AB Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize(1) and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods(2,3) break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications(4,5).

TI An Enhanced Architecture to Resolve Public-Key Cryptographic Issues in
   the Internet of Things (IoT), Employing Quantum Computing Supremacy
SO SENSORS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) strongly influences the world economy; this emphasizes the importance of securing all four aspects of the IoT model: sensors, networks, cloud, and applications. Considering the significant value of public-key cryptography threats on IoT system confidentiality, it is vital to secure it. One of the potential candidates to assist in securing public key cryptography in IoT is quantum computing. Although the notion of IoT and quantum computing convergence is not new, it has been referenced in various works of literature and covered by many scholars. Quantum computing eliminates most of the challenges in IoT. This research provides a comprehensive introduction to the Internet of Things and quantum computing before moving on to public-key cryptography difficulties that may be encountered across the convergence of quantum computing and IoT. An enhanced architecture is then proposed for resolving these public-key cryptography challenges using SimuloQron to implement the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) and one-time pad (OTP). The proposed model prevents eavesdroppers from performing destructive operations in the communication channel and cyber side by preserving its state and protecting the public key using quantum cryptography and the BB84 protocol. A modified version is introduced for this IoT situation. A traditional cryptographic mechanism called "one-time pad" (OTP) is employed in hybrid management.

It is interesting to note that the quantum discord of three qubits and five qubits is the same, as is the quantum discord of two qubits and six qubits. We discover that the quantum discord of this family of states can be classified into three categories. The level surfaces of the quantum discord in the three categories are shown through images. Furthermore, we investigated the dynamic behavior of quantum discord under decoherence. For the odd partite systems, we prove the frozen phenomenon of quantum discord does not exist under the phase flip channel, while it can be found in the even partite systems.

TI A quantum machine learning framework for predicting drug sensitivity in
   multiple myeloma using proteomic data
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we introduce QProteoML, a new quantum machine learning (QML) framework for predicting drug sensitivity in Multiple Myeloma (MM) using high-dimensional proteomic data. MM, an extremely heterogeneous condition, displays often mixed responses to treatment, with a large number of patients showing drug resistance to proteasome inhibitors and immune modulatory agents. However, the methods previously used for genomic and proteomic data analysis techniques are plagued by issues of high dimensionality, imbalanced class distribution and feature redundancy, which work against the accurate predictability and generalizability of such methods. These are compounded by the so-called "curse of dimensionality", with dimensions far outnumbering samples, hence classical model overfitting. In this work, we present QProteoML as an integration of quantum techniques purposefully developed to deal with high-dimensional, imbalanced and redundant data. The framework integrates a combination of Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), Quantum Principal Component Analysis (qPCA), Quantum Annealing (QA) for feature selection and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for data augmentation. These quantum algorithms exploit certain quantum phenomena (superposition and entanglement) to perform modelling of nonlinear relationships, dimensionality reduction, and class-imbalance issues. QSVM employs quantum kernels to map data into a higher-dimensional Hilbert space, so that the model can detect complex patterns in MM drug resistance. qPCA reduces dimensionality without loss of important variance, and thus improves computation efficiency. In addition, Quantum Annealing successfully extracts the most informative biomarkers with low redundancy. QProteoML was experimentally tested by comparing accuracy, F1 score and AUC ROC between classical machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Our results demonstrate that QProteoML performs better than classical models, particularly in identifying the drug resistant minority class of patients. Additionally, the model is interpretable and stresses important biomarkers of drug sensitivity in MM. This research opens the possibility of quantum machine learning in personalised medicine for Multiple Myeloma. It demonstrates that quantum algorithms can perform complex biological data suggesting more reliable and accurate drug sensitivity predictions.

TI Enhancement of quantum entanglement between twin beams via a four-wave
   mixing process with double feedback
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Two-port feedback has been theoretically studied and proved to be effective in enhancing the degree of entanglement of the output beams for a four-wave mixing process. Here, to further consider the loss effects and phase delays, we use a model that is closer to practical implementation. By reasonably tuning the feedback coefficients, we find that a higher degree of entanglement and higher power of the output beams can be achieved, and a loose requirement for phase-locking accuracy can be obtained. This scheme may have promising applications in practical quantum computation and quantum communication.

TI Quantum control of bosonic modes with superconducting circuits
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Bosonic modes have wide applications in various quantum technologies, such as optical photons for quantum communication, magnons in spin ensembles for quantum information storage and mechanical modes for reversible microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. There is emerging interest in utilizing bosonic modes for quantum information processing, with circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) as one of the leading architectures. Quantum information can be encoded into subspaces of a bosonic superconducting cavity mode with long coherence time. However, standard Gaussian operations (e.g., beam splitting and two-mode squeezing) are insufficient for universal quantum computing. The major challenge is to introduce additional nonlinear control beyond Gaussian operations without adding significant bosonic loss or decoherence. Here we review recent advances in universal control of a single bosonic code with superconducting circuits, including unitary control, quantum feedback control, drivendissipative control and holonomic dissipative control. Various approaches to entangling different bosonic modes are also discussed. (c) 2021 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum internet needs to ensure timely provision of entangled qubits to be used in tasks that involve distributed quantum computing or sensing. This has been addressed by a top-down approach of optimized quantum networks [21], in which entanglement is distributed prior to receiving tasks. Upon the task arrival, the desired entanglement state is attained with local operations and classical communication. The pre-distribution of entanglements should aim to minimize the amount of qubits used, as this decreases the risk of decoherence and thus degradation of the entangled state. The optimized quantum networks consider a multi-hop optical network and in this work we are supplementing it with Satellite-aided Entanglement Distribution (SED). The motivation is that satellites can shortcut the topology and place the entanglement at two nodes not directly connected through the optical network. We devise an algorithm for strategic placement of entanglements with SED, which results in a decrease in the number of qubits used in pre-distribution of entanglement. The numerical results show that SED can significantly enhance the performance of small quantum networks, while Entanglement-sharing Constraints (EC) are critical for large networks.

TI Gaussian conversion protocol for heralded generation of generalized
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the field of fault-tolerant quantum computing, continuous-variable systems can be utilized to protect quantum information from noise through the use of bosonic codes. These codes map qubit-type quantum information onto the larger bosonic Hilbert space, and can be divided into two main categories: translationalsymmetric codes, such as Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, and rotational-symmetric codes, including cat and binomial codes. The relationship between these families of codes has not yet been fully understood. We present an iterative protocol for converting between two instances of these codes-generalized GKP (so-called qunaught) states and fourfold-symmetric binomial states corresponding to a zero-logical encoded qubit-using only Gaussian operations. This conversion demonstrates the potential for universality of binomial states for all-Gaussian quantum computation and provides a method for the heralded preparation of GKP states. Through numerical simulation, we obtain GKP qunaught states with a fidelity of over 98% and a probability of approximately 3.14%, after only two steps of our iterative protocol, though higher fidelities can be achieved with additional iterations at the cost of lower success probabilities.

TI Adaptive pruning-based optimization of parameterized quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are powerful tools to maximize the use of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. While past studies have developed powerful and expressive ansatze, their near-term applications have been limited by the difficulty of optimizing in the vast parameter space. In this work, we propose a heuristic optimization strategy for such ansatze used in variational quantum algorithms, which we call 'parameter-efficient circuit training (PECT)'. Instead of optimizing all of the ansatz parameters at once, PECT launches a sequence of variational algorithms, in which each iteration of the algorithm activates and optimizes a subset of the total parameter set. To update the parameter subset between iterations, we adapt the Dynamic Sparse Reparameterization scheme which was originally proposed for training deep convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate PECT for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, in which we benchmark unitary coupled-cluster ansatze including UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD, as well as the Low-Depth Circuit Ansatz (LDCA), to estimate ground state energies of molecular systems. We additionally use a layerwise variant of PECT to optimize a hardware-efficient circuit for the Sycamore processor to estimate the ground state energy densities of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. From our numerical data, we find that PECT can enable optimizations of certain ansatze that were previously difficult to converge and more generally can improve the performance of variational algorithms by reducing the optimization runtime and/or the depth of circuits that encode the solution candidate(s).

TI Simulation of memristive synapses and neuromorphic computing on a

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB One of the major approaches to spike-based neuromorphic computing is using memristors as analog synapses. We propose unitary quantum gates that exhibit memristive behaviors, including Ohm's law, pinched hysteresis loop and synaptic plasticity. Hysteresis depending on the quantum phase and long-term plasticity that encodes the quantum state are observed. We also propose a three-layer neural network with the capability of universal quantum computing. Quantum state classification on the memristive neural network is demonstrated. These results pave the way towards quantum spiking neural network built on unitary processes. We obtain these results in numerical simulations and experiments on the superconducting quantum computer ibmq_vigo.

TI Quantum-memory-enhanced dissipative entanglement creation in
   nonequilibrium steady states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This article investigates dissipative preparation of entangled nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). We con-struct a collision model where the open system consists of two qubits which are coupled to heat reservoirs with different temperatures. The baths are modeled by sequences of qubits interacting with the open system. The model can be studied in different dynamical regimes: with and without environmental memory effects. We report that only a certain bath temperature range allows for entangled NESS. Furthermore, we obtain minimal and maximal critical values for the heat current through the system. Surprisingly, quantum memory effects play a crucial role in the long-time limit. First, memory effects broaden the parameter region where quantum correlated NESS may be dissipatively prepared and, second, they increase the attainable concurrence. Most remarkably, we find a heat current range that does not only allow, but even guarantees that the NESS is entangled. Thus, the heat current can witness entanglement of nonequilibrium steady states.

In this paper, the efficiency of quantum teleportation and dense coding protocols is examined in two-level atoms with two-photon transitions via the Stark shift effect, where each atom is separately coupled to a dissipative reservoir at zero temperature. Our results show that non-Markovianity and Stark shift can play constructive roles in restoring the quantum advantages of these protocols after they are diminished. These findings could offer a potential solution to preserving the computational and communicative advantages of quantum technologies.

TI Quantum computer-aided design of quantum optics hardware
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The parameters of a quantum system grow exponentially with the number of involved quantum particles. Hence, the associated memory requirement to store or manipulate the underlying wavefunction goes well beyond the limit of the best classical computers for quantum systems composed of a few dozen particles, leading to serious challenges in their numerical simulation. This implies that the verification and design of new quantum devices and experiments are fundamentally limited to small system size. It is not clear how the full potential of large quantum systems can be exploited. Here, we present the concept of quantum computer designed quantum hardware and apply it to the field of quantum optics. Specifically, we map complex experimental hardware for high-dimensional, many-body entangled photons into a gate-based quantum circuit. We show explicitly how digital quantum simulation of Boson sampling experiments can be realized. We then illustrate how to design quantum-optical setups for complex entangled photonic systems, such as high-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and their derivatives. Since photonic hardware is already on the edge of quantum supremacy and the development of gate-based quantum computers is rapidly advancing, our approach promises to be a useful tool for the future of quantum device design.

AB Quantum computing holds promise for addressing previously unsolvable problems, particularly within complex energy systems driven by big data. This research employs a semi-systematic literature analysis to identify and categorise popular quantum algorithms with potential applications in these systems. The algorithms are divided into two main groups: quantum chemical simulation algorithms and quantum optimisation algorithms. Quantum chemical simulations can model molecules, facilitating the discovery of advanced materials and technologies for complex energy systems. Meanwhile, quantum optimisation algorithms aim to enhance energy production efficiency by optimising the grid's energy flow and smart energy storage. A significant challenge across all algorithms is the current hardware limitations, as they require more processing power than is presently available. Additionally, these algorithms necessitate precise initial parameter settings, necessitating accurate representation of real-world scenarios. Overcoming these challenges could enable quantum computing to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of complex energy systems significantly.

TI Comparing one- and two-way quantum repeater architectures
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced hardware. Recent increases in memory availability and advances in multiplexed entanglement generation motivate a fresh comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures. In this work, we present a two-way repeater protocol that combines multiplexing with application-aware distillation, designed for a setting where sufficient high-quality memory resources are available-reflecting architectural assumptions expected in large-scale network deployments. We introduce a recursive formulation to track the full probability distribution of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, enabling the performance analysis of multiplexed repeater schemes which use probabilistic n-to-k distillation. Using this framework, we compare the proposed two-way protocol with one-way schemes in parameter regimes previously believed to favour the latter, and find that the two-way architecture consistently outperforms one-way protocols while requiring lower technological and resource overheads.

TI Quantum computation of the electronic structure of some prototype solids
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Over the last decade, researchers have been working to improve a crucial aspect of quantum computing to predict Hamiltonian energy of solids. Quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) have been used to study the molecular systems. However, there is growing interest in adapting and applying these methods to periodic solid-state materials. In this work, we have integrated first-principles density functional theory with VQE and VQD algorithms and utilizing the Wannier Tight-Binding Hamiltonian (WTBH) method to predict the electronic characteristics of solids. We demonstrate that VQE and VQD algorithms can be used to accurately predict electronic characteristics in a variety of multi-component prototype solid-state materials such as - Silicon (semiconductor), Gold (metallic), Boron Nitrile (insulator), Graphene (semi-metal). Efficient SU2 performs well among all the predefined ansatz used in the study. COBYLA is the fastest optimizer among the classical optimizers with minimum number of iterations for convergence. Results of noise models help to understand the band structure when calculated on real quantum hardware. As quantum hardware advances, our method might be a starting point for using quantum computers to study materials and could help make material discovery more automatic in the future.

We propose a sender-controlled measurement-device-independent multiparty quantum communication protocol. The sender Alice divides a private message into several parts and delivers them to different receivers for secret sharing with imperfect measurement devices and untrusted ancillary nodes. Furthermore, Alice acts as an active controller and checks the security of quantum channels and the reliability of each receiver before she encodes her private message for secret sharing, which makes the protocol convenient for multiparity quantum communication.

Quantum coherence is the basis for multi-particle interference and quantum entanglement. It is also the essential ingredient for various physical phenomena in quantum optics, quantum information, etc. In recent years, with the proposal of a quantum coherence measurement scheme based on a resource theory framework, quantum coherence as a quantum resource has been extensively investigated.

TI Universal terminal for cloud quantum computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB To bring the quantum computing capacities to the personal edge devices, the optimum approach is to have simple non-error-corrected personal devices that offload the computational tasks to scalable quantum computers via edge servers with cryogenic components and fault-tolerant schemes. Hence the network elements deploy different encoding protocols. This article proposes quantum terminals that are compatible with different encoding protocols; paving the way for realizing mobile edge-quantum computing. By accommodating the atomic lattice processor inside a cavity, the entangling mechanism is provided by the Rydberg cavity-QED technology. The auxiliary atom, responsible for photon emission, senses the logical qubit state via the long-range Rydberg interaction. In other words, the state of logical qubit determines the interaction-induced level-shift at the central atom and hence derives the system over distinguished eigenstates, featuring photon emission at the early or late times controlled by quantum interference. Applying an entanglement-swapping gate on two emitted photons would make the far-separated logical qubits entangled regardless of their encoding protocols.

AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an amalgamation of quantum computing paradigms with machine learning models, providing significant prospects for solving complex problems. However, with the expansion of numerous third-party vendors in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing, the security of QML models is of prime importance, particularly against reverse engineering, which could expose sensitive parameters and proprietary algorithms embedded within the models. We assume the untrusted third-party quantum cloud provider is an adversary having white-box access to the transpiled version of the user-designed trained QML model during inference. Although the adversary can steal and use the model without any modification, reverse engineering (RE) to extract the pre-transpiled copy of the QML circuit will enable re-transpilation and usage of the model for various hardware with completely different native gate sets and even different qubit technology. The information about the parameters (e.g., number of parameters, their placements, and optimized values) can allow further training of the QML model if the adversary plans to alter the QML model to tamper with the watermark and/or embed their own watermark or refine the model for other purposes. In this first effort to investigate the RE of QML circuits, we examine quantum classifiers by comparing the training accuracy of original and reverse-engineered models across various sizes (i.e., number of qubits and number of parametric layers) of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). We note that multi-qubit classifiers can be reverse-engineered under specific conditions with a mean error of order 10(-2) in a reasonable time. We also propose adding dummy rotation gates in the QML model with fixed parameters to increase the RE overhead for defense. For instance, an addition of 2 dummy qubits and 2 layers increases the overhead by similar to 1.76 times for a classifier with 2 qubits and 3 layers with a performance overhead of less than 9%. We note that RE is a very powerful attack model which warrants further efforts on defenses.

TI Planar and tunable quantum state transfer in a splicing Y-junction
   Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a feasible scheme to implement a planar and tunable quantum state transfer (QST) via topologically protected zero-energy mode in a splicing Y-junction Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. The introduction of the elaborate nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping enables one to generate a topological interface at the central site of the Y-junction. By modulating the NN hopping adiabatically in the chain, the quantum state initially prepared at the central site can be simultaneously transferred to the three endpoints of the Y-junction with the equal/unequal probabilities. The planar distribution of QST is expected to realize a quantum router, whose function is to make the quantum information on the central site (input port) appear equally/unequally at the three endpoints (output ports) with different directions. Moreover, the numerical simulations demonstrate that the scheme possesses the robustness on the fluctuations of the NN hopping and the on-site potential in the system. Furthermore, we show that the number of the output ports with different directions can be flexibly increased in an extended X-junction SSH chain, and the experimental feasibility for implementing special QST in a superconducting qubit-resonator system is briefly discussed. Our work extends the space distribution of QST from linear distribution to planar distribution and promotes the construction of large-scale quantum networks.

TI Continuous variable quantum teleportation with noiseless linear
   amplifier
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Continuous variable quantum teleportation (CVQT) plays an important role in practical quantum communication. However, the noise and loss in the actual environment will lead to the degradation ofentanglement, which has an effect on the performance of the system in terms of the transmission distance andhence hinders its implementations. In this paper, we suggest an approach to improving the performance of theCVQT system with an embedded noiseless linear amplifier (NLA). By using the NLA, one can amplify thedegenerated entangled source to compensate for the attenuation of the fiber. Then we consider the influences ofthe available gains of the NLA on the performance of the proposed scheme under different lossy channels andentangled sources. The simulation results show that the performance is improved in fidelity and transmissiondistance, which may provide a feasible and effective method of putting the long-distance CVQT into practical application

TI Unconditional Preparation of Squeezed Vacuum from Rabi Interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Squeezed states of harmonic oscillators are a central resource for continuous-variable quantum sensing, computation, and communication. Hem, we propose a method for the generation of very good approximations to highly squeezed vacuum states with low excess antisqueezing using only a few oscillator-qubit coupling gates through a Rabi-type interaction Hamiltonian. This interaction can be implemented with several different methods, which has previously been demonstrated in superconducting circuit and trapped-ion platforms. The protocol is compatible with other protocols manipulating quantum harmonic oscillators, thus facilitating scalable continuous-variable fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Single-shot quantum machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum machine learning aims to improve learning methods through the use of quantum computers. If it is to ever realize its potential, many obstacles need to be overcome. A particularly pressing one arises at the prediction stage because the outputs of quantum learning models are inherently random. This creates an often considerable overhead, as many executions of a quantum learning model have to be aggregated to obtain an actual prediction. In this work, we analyze when quantum learning models can evade this issue and produce predictions in a near-deterministic way-paving the way to single-shot quantum machine learning. We give a rigorous definition of single shotness in quantum classifiers and show that the degree to which a quantum learning model is near deterministic is constrained by the distinguishability of the embedded quantum states used in the model. Opening the black box of the embedding, we show that if the embedding is realized by quantum circuits, a certain depth is necessary for single shotness to be even possible. We conclude by showing that quantum learning models cannot be single shot in a generic way and trainable at the same time.

TI A Sigmoid-Based Optimization Approach for Multi-UAV-Aided IRS-Assisted
   Quantum Entanglement Distribution in FSO Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum networks connect devices to facilitate the transmission of quantum bits (qubits), harnessing quantum mechanics for groundbreaking telecommunications applications. The quantum state exchange rely on quantum entangled particles which have to be sent from a Quantum Base Station (QBS) to Quantum Nodes (QNs) through an optical channel. Free Space Optical (FSO) links promise flexibility and cost advantages over the classical fiber-based infrastructure. However, the absence of Line of Sight (LoS) between the QBS and QNs may completely disrupt the communication. Therefore, this work focuses on an Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS)-assisted Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided FSO quantum network. An optimization problem is formulated to fairly maximize qubit reception at QNs by optimizing UAV hovering locations, constrained by fidelity and link-per-IRS limits. The intractability of the original problem is first tackled with a sigmoid-based approximations, subsequently split into three sub-problems, sequentially solved applying the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results (i) validate the approximation accuracy, and (ii) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposal against three baseline approaches, showing an order of magnitude increase in terms of fairness.

TI Quantum teleportation with imperfect quantum dots
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Efficient all-photonic quantum teleportation requires fast and deterministic sources of highly indistinguishable and entangled photons. Solid-state-based quantum emitters-notably semiconductor quantum dots-are a promising candidate for the role. However, despite the remarkable progress in nanofabrication, proof-of-concept demonstrations of quantum teleportation have highlighted that imperfections of the emitter still place a major roadblock in the way of applications. Here, rather than focusing on source optimization strategies, we deal with imperfections and study different teleportation protocols with the goal of identifying the one with maximal teleportation fidelity. Using a quantum dot with sub-par values of entanglement and photon indistinguishability, we show that the average teleportation fidelity can be raised from below the classical limit to 0.842(14), adopting a polarization-selective Bell state measurement and moderate spectral filtering. Our results, which are backed by a theoretical model that quantitatively explains the experimental findings, loosen the very stringent requirements set on the ideal entangled-photon source and highlight that imperfect quantum dots can still have a say in teleportation-based quantum communication architectures.

TI Partonic collinear structure by quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a systematic quantum algorithm, which integrates both the hadronic state preparation and the evaluation of real-time light-front correlators, to study parton distribution functions (PDFs). As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the first direct simulation of the PDFs in the 1 ?? 1 dimensional Nambu-JonaLasinio model. We show the results obtained by exact diagonalization and by quantum computation using classical hardware. The agreement between these two distinct methods and the qualitative consistency with QCD PDFs validate the proposed quantum algorithm. Our work suggests the encouraging prospects of calculating QCD PDFs on current and near-term quantum devices. The presented quantum algorithm is expected to have many applications in high energy particle and nuclear physics.

TI Classical Computer Assisted Analysis of Small Multiqudit Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computation model is regarded as a model which can overcome barriers in calculations efficiency of problems which appear in modern science. In spite of hardware development, in particular a recent emergence of several different physical installations of the pioneering quantum machines, the contemporary and numerical analysis of problems concerning quantum computing is very important. In the first part of this article, some useful computing techniques for quantum registers processed by a quantum circuits are presented. Applied classical parallel computational techniques are utilised to shorten the whole computational time. New methods of processing state vectors for qudits and density matrices are presented, indicating which operations may be performed in parallel in the context of the implementation of local unitary operations. There is also shown, how to use the reduction operation in parallel implementation of the von Neumann measurement by performing local measurements on a system of qudits. In addition to the purely technical results as described above, the paper includes also a bunch of purely theoretical results which substitute a solid mathematical ground for the computations performed with the help of the computational routines as described in Section III. In particular, a discussion concerning general multi-qudit quantum states through the prism of Entropy and Negativity measures of entanglement included in has been presented. Additionally, the notion of the total entanglement has been introduced. For certain classes of popular multi-qudit states, the introduced deficits of entanglement defined with the use of von Neumann Entropy and Negativity have been discussed. In particular, by the use of Gram matrix technique, the corresponding deficits of entanglement in the analysed states have been computed in an explicite way. Additionally, some new results on AME states for some multiqudit systems are also included in Section V. The last part of the article presents some numerical experiments on multi-qudit entanglement and determination of total entanglement values for convex combinations of GHZ and W states. Some details concerning technical nature of results are included in the attached Appendix.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this work, we prove that quantum error correcting codes do not fix isotropic errors (Theorem 5), even assuming that their correction circuits do not introduce new errors. We say that a quantum code does not fix a quantum computing error if its application does not reduce the variance of the error. We also prove for isotropic errors that, if the correction circuit of a quantum code detects an error, the corrected logical m-qubit has uniform distribution (Theorem 3) and as a result, it already loses all the computing information.

TI Security in quantum cryptography
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Quantum cryptography exploits principles of quantum physics for the secure processing of information. A prominent example is secure communication, i.e., the task of transmitting confidential messages from one location to another. The cryptographic requirement here is that the transmitted messages remain inaccessible to anyone other than the designated recipients, even if the communication channel is untrustworthy. In classical cryptography, this can usually be guaranteed only under computational hardness assumptions, such as when factoring large integers is infeasible. In contrast, the security of quantum cryptography relies entirely on the laws of quantum mechanics. Here this physical notion of security is reviewed, with a focus on quantum key distribution and secure communication.

TI Optimization of Modified Quantum Discord in Projector Space
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In a pair of correlated quantum systems, a measurement in one corresponds to a change in the state of the other. Measurement along which set of projectors would accompany minimum loss in information content is the optimization problem of quantum discord and is an important aspect of a classical to quantum transition because it asks us to look for the most classical states. This optimization problem is known to be NP-complete and is important because discord is defined through it making it a major obstacle on every computation. The standard zero discord condition helps us move to a stronger measure for correlated observables; in such a context, we show that discord minimizes at the diagonal basis of the reduced density matrices and derive an analytical expression.

TI QELPS Algorithm: A Novel Dynamic Optimization Technology for Quantum
   Circuits Scheduling Engineering Problems
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In the noisy medium-scale quantum era, quantum computers are constrained by a limited number of qubits, restricted physical topological structures, and interference from environmental noise, making efficient and stable circuit scheduling a significant challenge. To improve the feasibility of quantum computing, it is essential to optimize the scheduling of quantum gates and the insertion of SWAP gates, reducing running time and enhancing computational efficiency. We propose a collaborative optimization framework that integrates the Quantum Exchange Lock Parallel Scheduler (QELPS) with the Full-level Joint Optimization SWAP Algorithm (FJOSA). In QELPS, SWAP conflict characteristics are used to adjust the layout of quantum gates across different levels while considering physical constraints and dynamically adapting to the circuit's execution state. Quantum lock parallel technology enables the selective postponement of certain quantum gates, minimizing circuit depth and mitigating inefficiencies caused by excessive SWAP gate insertions. Meanwhile, FJOSA employs a cross-layer optimization strategy that combines heuristic algorithms with cost functions to improve gate scheduling at a global level. This approach effectively reduces quantum gate conflicts found in traditional methods and optimizes execution order, leading to better computational efficiency and circuit performance. Experimental results show that, compared to the traditional 2QAN algorithm, QELPS and FJOSA reduce additional gate insertions by 85.59% and 89.38%, respectively, while decreasing running time by 56.32% and 66.47%. These improvements confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances circuit scheduling efficiency and reduces resource consumption, making it a promising approach for optimizing quantum computation.

TI Quantum sensing tools to characterize physical, chemical and biological
   processes with magnetic resonance
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE OPEN
AB Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) plays a central role in developing quantum information sciences and technologies. Key features such as its non-invasive nature and the ability to process information on nuclear spins by versatile quantum control designs with electromagnetic fields, have made NMR to become a powerful technique for sensing systems from atomic and molecular scales with spectroscopy to millimeters in imaging. This brief overview provides quantum sensing tools with which we are contributing from Latin America, by combining quantum dynamical control and estimation strategies with NMR methods to probe physical, chemical, and biological processes. It introduces the basic and key concepts on how controlled spin-sensors can monitor the correlation dynamics of their environment, and selectively and optimally infer its relevant parameters. Then these concepts are illustrated with state-of-the-art implementations for characterizing (i) biological tissue microstructure with diffusion weighting imaging, (ii) quantum information dynamics and scrambling in out-of-equilibrium systems with solid-state NMR quantum simulations, and (iii) molecular structures by selective estimation of spin-spin couplings and online learning control designs with experimental proposals. We expect these concepts will motivate the development of quantum dynamical control of spin sensors to monitor systems in a variety of fields, and in particular to exploit the non-invasive strength of NMR, e.g. in biomedical diagnosis.

TI Hierarchical Quantum Error Correction with Hypergraph Product Code and
   Rotated Surface Code
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB We propose and analyze a hierarchical quantum error correction (QEC) scheme that concatenates hypergraph product (HGP) codes with rotated surface codes and that is compatible with quantum computers with only nearest-neighbor interactions. The outer code employs (3,4)-random HGP codes, known for their constant encoding rate and favorable distance scaling, while the inner code consists of a rotated surface code with distance 5, allowing hardware compatibility through lattice surgery. To address the decoding bottleneck, we utilize a soft-decision decoding strategy that combines belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding, enhanced by a syndrome-conditioned logical error probability computed via a tailored lookup table for the inner code. Numerical simulations under a code capacity noise model demonstrate that our hierarchical codes achieve logical error suppression below the threshold. Furthermore, we derive explicit conditions under which the proposed codes surpass surface codes as a QEC code in both qubit efficiency and error rate. In particular, for the size parameter $s \ge 4$ (which corresponds to 16 logical qubits) and the distance $d\ge 25$, our construction outperforms the rotated surface code in practical regimes with physical error rates around or less than $10<^>{-2}$. These results suggest that concatenated quantum low-density parity-check surface architectures can offer a scalable and resource-efficient path toward near-term fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Zero-Added-Loss Entangled-Photon Multiplexing for Ground- and
   Space-Based Quantum Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a scheme for optical entanglement distribution in quantum networks based on a quasideter-ministic entangled photon-pair source. By combining heralded photonic Bell-pair generation with spectral mode conversion to interface with quantum memories, the scheme eliminates switching losses due to multiplexing in the source. We analyze this "zero-added-loss multiplexing" (ZALM) Bell-pair source for the particularly challenging problem of long-baseline entanglement distribution via satellites and ground -based memories, where it unlocks additional advantages: (i) the substantially higher channel efficiency eta of downlinks versus uplinks with realistic adaptive optics, and (ii) photon loss occurring before interaction with the quantum memory-i.e., Alice and Bob receiving rather than transmitting-improve entangle-ment generation rate scaling by O(root eta). Based on numerical analyses, we estimate our protocol to achieve > 10 ebit/s at memory multiplexing of 102 spin qubits for ground distance > 102 km, with the spin-spin Bell-state fidelity exceeding 99%. Our architecture presents a blueprint for realizing global-scale quantum networks in the near term.

TI Efficient Control of a Transmon Qudit Using Effective Spin-7/2 Rotations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Qudits hold great promise for efficient quantum computation and the simulation of high-dimensional quantum systems [1]. However, existing control and measurement schemes for qudit systems scale unfavorably with qudit dimension since they decompose SU(d) operations into series of qubitlike rotations and perform measurements on a small number of states [2-6]. Here, we address these challenges by employing simultaneous multifrequency drives to generate rotations and projections in an effective spin-7/2 system mapped onto the energy eigenstates of a superconducting circuit. We implement single-shot readout of the eight states using a multitone dispersive readout (Fassignment = 88.3%) and exploit the strong nonlinearity in a high-EJ/ECtransmon to simultaneously address each transition and realize a spin displacement operator. Combining this displacement operator with a virtual SNAP gate, we realize arbitrary single-qudit unitary operations in O(d) physical pulses and extract spin displacement gate fidelities ranging from 0.997 to 0.989 for virtual spins of size j = 1 to j = 7/2. We demonstrate the potential of our control scheme in three ways: the direct measurement of the spin qudit Wigner function, randomized benchmarking of a logical qubit encoded into the qudit state, and randomized bench-marking of the full qudit Clifford group. In the latter experiment, we implement the d-dimensional quantum Fourier transform with an average gate fidelity of 0.91(6) in d = 8. Our multifrequency approach to qudit control and measurement can be readily extended to other physical platforms that realize a multilevel system coupled to a cavity and can become a building block for efficient qudit-based quantum computation and simulation.

TI On the capability of a class of quantum sensor
SO AUTOMATICA
AB Quantum sensors may provide extremely high sensitivity and precision to extract key information in a quantum or classical physical system. A fundamental question is whether a quantum sensor is capable of uniquely inferring unknown parameters in a system for a given structure of the quantum sensor and admissible measurement on the sensor. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a class of quantum sensors which consist of either a single qubit or two qubits. A quantum sensor is coupled to a spin chain system to extract information of unknown parameters in the system. With given initialization and measurement schemes, we employ the similarity transformation approach and the Grobner basis method to prove that a single-qubit quantum sensor cannot effectively estimate the unknown parameters in the spin chain system while the two-qubit quantum sensor can. The work demonstrates that it is a feasible method to enhance the capability of quantum sensors by increasing the number of qubits in the quantum sensors for some practical applications.

TI Timing and Resource-Aware Mapping of Quantum Circuits to Superconducting
   Processors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB Quantum algorithms need to be compiled to respect the constraints imposed by quantum processors, which is known as the mapping problem. The mapping procedure will result in an increase of the number of gates and of the circuit latency, decreasing the algorithm's success rate. It is crucial to minimize mapping overhead, especially for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors that have relatively short qubit coherence times and high gate error rates. Most of prior mapping algorithms have only considered constraints, such as the primitive gate set and qubit connectivity, but the actual gate duration and the restrictions imposed by the use of shared classical control electronics have not been taken into account. In this article, we present a mapper called Qmap to make quantum circuits executable on scalable processors with the objective of achieving the shortest circuit latency. In particular, we propose an approach to formulate the classical control restrictions as resource constraints in a conventional list scheduler with polynomial complexity. Furthermore, we implement a routing heuristic to cope with the connectivity limitation. This router finds a set of movement operations that minimally extends circuit latency. To analyze the mapping overhead and evaluate the performance of different mappers, we map 56 quantum benchmarks onto a superconducting processor named Surface-17. Compared to a prior mapping strategy that minimizes the number of operations, Qmap can reduce the latency overhead (LtyOH) up to 47.3% and operation overhead up to 28.6%, respectively.

TI Unconditionally secure digital signatures implemented in an eight-user
   quantum network*
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The ability to know and verifiably demonstrate the origins of messages can often be as important as encrypting the message itself. Here we present an experimental demonstration of an unconditionally secure digital signature (USS) protocol implemented for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, on a fully connected quantum network without trusted nodes. We choose a USS protocol which is secure against forging, repudiation and messages are transferrable. We show the feasibility of unconditionally secure signatures using only bi-partite entangled states distributed throughout the network and experimentally evaluate the performance of the protocol in real world scenarios with varying message lengths.

TI Quantum encryption of superposition states with quantum permutation pad
   in IBM quantum computers
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present an implementation of Kuang and Bettenburg's Quantum Permutation Pad (QPP) used to encrypt superposition states. The project was conducted on currently available IBM quantum systems using the Qiskit development kit. This work extends previously reported implementation of QPP used to encrypt basis states and demonstrates that application of the QPP scheme is not limited to the encryption of basis states. For this implementation, a pad of 56 2-qubit Permutation matrices was used, providing 256 bits of entropy for the QPP algorithm. An image of a cat was used as the plaintext for this experiment. The plaintext was randomized using a classical XOR function prior to the state preparation procedure. To create corresponding superposition states, we applied a novel operator defined in this paper. These superposition states were then encrypted using QPP, with 2-qubit Permutation Operators, producing superposition ciphertext states. Due to the lack of a quantum channel, we omitted the transmission and executed the decryption procedure on the same IBM quantum system. If a quantum channel existed, the superposition ciphertext states could be transmitted as qubits, and be directly decrypted on a different quantum system. We provide a brief discussion of the security, although the focus of the paper remains on the implementation. Previously we have demonstrated QPP operating in both classical and quantum computers, offering an interesting opportunity to bridge the security gap between classical and quantum systems. This work broadens the applicability of QPP for the encryption of basis states as well as superposition states. We believe that quantum encryption schemes that are not limited to basis states will be integral to a secure quantum internet, to reduce vulnerabilities introduced by using two separate algorithms for secure communication between a quantum and a classical computer.

TI Controlling the photon number coherence of solid-state quantum light
   sources for quantum cryptography
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum communication networks rely on quantum cryptographic protocols including quantum key distribution (QKD) based on single photons. A critical element regarding the security of QKD protocols is the photon number coherence (PNC), i.e., the phase relation between the vacuum and one-photon Fock state. To obtain single photons with the desired properties for QKD protocols, optimal excitation schemes for quantum emitters need to be selected. As emitters, we consider semiconductor quantum dots, that are known to generate on-demand single photons with high purity and indistinguishability. Exploiting two-photon excitation of a quantum dot combined with a stimulation pulse, we demonstrate the generation of high-quality single photons with a controllable degree of PNC. The main tuning knob is the pulse area giving full control from minimal to maximal PNC, while without the stimulating pulse the PNC is negligible in our setup for all pulse areas. Our approach provides a viable route toward secure communication in quantum networks.

TI Error-Mitigation-Aided Optimization of Parameterized Quantum Circuits:
   Convergence Analysis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer the most promising path to obtaining quantum advantages via noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Such systems leverage classical optimization to tune the parameters of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). The goal is minimizing a cost function that depends on measurement outputs obtained from the PQC. Optimization is typically implemented via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). On NISQ computers, gate noise due to imperfections and decoherence affects the stochastic gradient estimates by introducing a bias. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques can reduce the estimation bias without requiring any increase in the number of qubits, but they in turn cause an increase in the variance of the gradient estimates. This work studies the impact of quantum gate noise on the convergence of SGD for the variational eigensolver (VQE), a fundamental instance of VQAs. The main goal is ascertaining conditions under which QEM can enhance the performance of SGD for VQEs. It is shown that quantum gate noise induces a nonzero error-floor on the convergence error of SGD (evaluated with respect to a reference noiseless PQC), which depends on the number of noisy gates, the strength of the noise, as well as the eigenspectrum of the observable being measured and minimized. In contrast, with QEM, any arbitrarily small error can be obtained. Furthermore, for error levels attainable with or without QEM, QEM can reduce the number of required iterations, but only as long as the quantum noise level is sufficiently large, and a sufficiently large number of measurements is allowed at each SGD iteration. Numerical examples for a max-cut problem corroborate the main theoretical findings.

TI Solving larger maximum clique problems using parallel quantum annealing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum annealing has the potential to find low energy solutions of NP-hard problems that can be expressed as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. However, the hardware of the quantum annealer manufactured by D-Wave Systems, which we consider in this work, is sparsely connected and moderately sized (on the order of thousands of qubits), thus necessitating a minor-embedding of a logical problem onto the physical qubit hardware. The combination of relatively small hardware sizes and the necessity of a minor-embedding can mean that solving large optimization problems is not possible on current quantum annealers. In this research, we show that a hybrid approach combining parallel quantum annealing with graph decomposition allows one to solve larger optimization problem accurately. We apply the approach to the Maximum Clique problem on graphs with up to 120 nodes and 6395 edges.

TI Geometric correspondence of noisy quantum dynamics and universal robust
   quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum information processing faces a significant hurdle: noise. Different noise sources induce varying errors in quantum operations depending on the underlying dynamics. To gain a deeper understanding of these error mechanisms, we introduce the concept of quantum error evolution diagrams (QEEDs). QEEDs establish a dual correspondence between driven noisy quantum dynamics and geometric space curves, providing quantitative geometric metrics to assess the severity of the noises. This framework enables the design of universal robust quantum gates that correct errors induced by generic noise. Additionally, we present a protocol for constructing a universal set of single-and two-qubit robust quantum gates with simple and smooth control pulses of arbitrary length and fidelities exceeding 99.99% across a wide range of noise strengths. Our work provides new insights into the geometric nature of noisy quantum dynamics and paves the way for developing strategies to dynamically correct quantum errors.

To detect attacks on the classic communication channel, the authentication procedure is used. Information-theoretic authentication guarantees the detection of attacks on the classical communication channel regardless of the computational and technical capabilities of an eavesdropper, including the quantum computer.

TI Quantum Computing with Majorana Kramers Pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a universal gate set acting on a qubit formed by the degenerate ground states of a Coulombblockaded time-reversal invariant topological superconductor island with spatially separated Majorana Kramers pairs: the "Majorana Kramers qubit." All gate operations are implemented by coupling the Majorana Kramers pairs to conventional superconducting leads. Interestingly, in such an allsuperconducting device, the energy gap of the leads provides another layer of protection from quasiparticle poisoning independent of the island charging energy. Moreover, the absence of strong magnetic fieldswhich typically reduce the superconducting gap size of the island-suggests a unique robustness of our qubit to quasiparticle poisoning due to thermal excitations. Consequently, the Majorana Kramers qubit should benefit from prolonged coherence times and may provide an alternative route to a Majorana-based quantum computer.

TI Detection and Generation of Quantum Steering in Multipartite and
   High-Dimensional Systems (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen pointed out one of the most counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics: by measuring particle A, the state of a distant particle B can be influenced nonlocally. Schrodinger then introduced the term "steering" to refer to such a phenomenon. Today, steering is recognized as a special form of quantum correlation between distant systems, lying between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It allows entanglement to be verifiable even if one party is untrusted. This means that quantum information processing tasks (such as entanglement-based quantum key distribution and randomness generation) that rely on entanglement can be properly carried out without assuming trust at any station. The rapid advancement of quantum technology necessitates moving beyond simple bipartite and two-qubit systems. Exploring quantum phenomena in complex architectures, specifically multipartite (involving three or more particles/subsystems) and high-dimensional (qudits) systems, often exhibiting non-Gaussian statistics, is paramount. Quantum states engineered within these complex frameworks offer compelling advantages. They possess exponentially larger information capacity, enable intrinsically faster computation pathways, exhibit potentially enhanced resilience to noise and decoherence, and provide richer structures for sophisticated quantum communication tasks. Consequently, investigating quantum correlations like steering within these advanced platforms is central to pushing the boundaries of quantum information science and achieving the promised capabilities of next-generation quantum technologies. Progress Significant progress in understanding quantum steering has been achieved over the past few decades. However, its extension to multipartite and high-dimensional systems remains an emerging field of research. We outline the latest conceptual and experimental advances in the characterization and generation of quantum steering, ranging from the bipartite case to multipartite, high-dimensional systems. First, we explain the most commonly used quantifiers of steering along with their underlying assumptions. Then, we provide an overview of the current developments in experimental demonstrations of quantum steering in various platforms such as photonic systems and linear optical networks. In particular, we emphasize the detection and manipulation of monogamy constraints among multiple nodes, as well as the realization of genuine high-dimensional one-way steering. These are unique features that distinguish such systems from ordinary bipartite and two-qubit systems. Finally, we present a discussion on challenges and possible directions of future developments in the study of quantum steering. Conclusions and Prospects Addressing the challenges of characterizing, quantifying, distributing, and experimentally realizing controllable multipartite and high-dimensional steering is crucial to harnessing the full potential of quantum mechanics in future technologies. In these settings, the inherent asymmetry of steering grows more complex yet potentially exploitable, offering novel ways to control and distribute quantum information and correlations. We highlight the necessary understanding of steering in these complex systems and shed light on new technical developments, such as a prospective quantum internet with many users or quantum communication tasks involving multilevel quantum particles.

TI Quantum circuits with many photons on a programmable nanophotonic chip
SO NATURE
AB Growing interest in quantum computing for practical applications has led to a surge in the availability of programmable machines for executing quantum algorithms(1,2). Present-day photonic quantum computers(3-7) have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware-software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity(8). These demonstrations validate the platform as a launchpad for scaling photonic technologies for quantum information processing.

TI Hamiltonian formulations of centroid-based clustering
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Clustering is a fundamental task in data science that aims to group data based on their similarities. However, defining similarity is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the most appropriate objective function for a given dataset. Traditional clustering methods, such as the k -means algorithm and weighted maximum k -cut, focus on specific objectives-typically relying on average or pairwise characteristics of the data-leading to performance that is highly data-dependent. Moreover, incorporating practical constraints into clustering objectives is not straightforward, and these problems are known to be NP-hard. In this study, we formulate the clustering problem as a search for the ground state of a Hamiltonian, providing greater flexibility in defining clustering objectives and incorporating constraints. This approach enables the application of various quantum simulation techniques, including both circuit-based quantum computation and quantum annealing, thereby opening a path toward quantum advantage in solving clustering problems. We propose various Hamiltonians to accommodate different clustering objectives, including the ability to combine multiple objectives and incorporate constraints. We evaluate the clustering performance through numerical simulations and implementations on the D-Wave quantum annealer. The results demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach to a variety of clustering problems on current quantum devices. Furthermore, we find that Hamiltonians designed for specific clustering objectives and constraints impose different requirements for qubit connectivity, indicating that certain clustering tasks are better suited to specific quantum hardware. Our experimental results highlight this by identifying the Hamiltonian that optimally utilizes the physical qubits available in the D-Wave System.

TI Ternary logic design in topological quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A quantum computer can perform exponentially faster than its classical counterpart. It works on the principle of superposition. But due to the decoherence effect, the superposition of a quantum state gets destroyed by the interaction with the environment. It is a real challenge to completely isolate a quantum system to make it free of decoherence. This problem can be circumvented by the use of topological quantum phases of matter. These phases have quasiparticles excitations called anyons. The anyons are charge-flux composites and show exotic fractional statistics. When the order of exchange matters, then the anyons are called non-abelian anyons. Majorana fermions in topological superconductors and quasiparticles in some quantum Hall states are non-abelian anyons. Such topological phases of matter have a ground state degeneracy. The fusion of two or more non-abelian anyons can result in a superposition of several anyons. The topological quantum gates are implemented by braiding and fusion of the non-abelian anyons. The fault-tolerance is achieved through the topological degrees of freedom of anyons. Such degrees of freedom are non-local, hence inaccessible to the local perturbations. In this paper, the Hilbert space for a topological qubit is discussed. The Ising and Fibonacci anyonic models for binary gates are briefly given. Ternary logic gates are more compact than their binary counterparts and naturally arise in a type of anyonic model called the metaplectic anyons. The mathematical model, for the fusion and braiding matrices of metaplectic anyons, is the quantum deformation of the recoupling theory. We proposed that the existing quantum ternary arithmetic gates can be realized by braiding and topological charge measurement of the metaplectic anyons.

TI Improved Entanglement-Based High-Dimensional Optical Quantum Computation
   with Linear Optics
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Quantum gates are the essential block for quantum computers. High-dimensional quantum gates exhibit remarkable advantages over their 2D counterparts for some quantum information processing tasks. Here, a family of entanglement-based optical controlled-SWAP gates on C-2 circle times C-d circle times C-d is presented. With the hybrid encoding, the control qubits and target qudits are encoded in photonic polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, respectively. The circuit is constructed using only (2+3d) (d >= 2) linear optics, beating an earlier result of 14 linear optics with d=2. The circuit depth five is much lower than an earlier result of 11 with d=2. Besides, the fidelity of the presented circuit can reach 99.4%, and it is higher than the previous counterpart with d=2. The scheme is constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Moreover, the approach allows d>2.

TI Quantum Communication Network Routing With Circuit and Packet Switching
   Strategies
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum network extends the ability to transmit information securely from two-party communication to multi-party communication with arbitrarily long distances. The efficiency of secure communication in a quantum network depends on both the topology of the network and the strategy of communication relays. In this paper, we propose a strategy to build a quantum network integrating various types of quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) schemes. A cost optimization model is presented to measure the cost of transmitting secure messages in a quantum network. Within the model, two types of quantum network strategies, the quantum circuit switching strategy and the quantum packet switching strategy, are proposed and compared. Numerical simulations in a specific network show that the quantum packet switching strategy is more favorable in future quantum networks taking into account robustness and cost required when using different types of QSDC schemes.

TI Slowing quantum decoherence of oscillators by hybrid processing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information encoded into the superposition of coherent states is an illustrative representation of practical applications of macroscopic quantum coherence possessing. However, these states are very sensitive to energy loss, losing their non-classical aspects of coherence very rapidly. An available deterministic strategy to slow down this decoherence process is to apply a Gaussian squeezing transformation prior to the loss as a protective step. Here, we propose a deterministic hybrid protection scheme utilizing strong but feasible interactions with two-level ancillas immune to spontaneous emission. We verify the robustness of the scheme against the dephasing of qubit ancilla. Our scheme is applicable to complex superpositions of coherent states in many oscillators, and remarkably, the robustness to loss is enhanced with the amplitude of the coherent states. This scheme can be realized in experiments with atoms, solid-state systems, and superconducting circuits.

TI Enhancement of multimode entanglement and asymmetric steering by
   noiseless linear amplification
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an important resource for quantum information. However, it is very fragile and prone to decoherence. Recently, it has been shown that the noiseless linear amplification (NLA) which can be applied to any channel with loss and noise can effectively counteract the effect of quantum decoherence. Besides, the initial quantum correlation can even be exceed by using this method. Thus, it is a useful tool in enhancing quantum entanglement. In this paper, we apply NLA to the tripartite GHZ entangled state and analyze quantum entanglement and steering after NLA. The results showed that the NLA can effectively improve quantum entanglement and expand the range of quantum steering. Simultaneously, they also provide useful direction for the distillation of quantum state using NLA in practical quantum communication.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Classical Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) approximate solutions to PDEs with the help of deep neural networks trained to satisfy the differential operator and the relevant boundary conditions. We revisit this idea in the quantum computing realm, using parameterised random quantum circuits as trial solutions. We further adapt recent PINN-based techniques to our quantum setting, in particular Gaussian smoothing. Our analysis concentrates on the Poisson, the Heat and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, which are ubiquitous in most areas of science. On the theoretical side, we develop a complexity analysis of this approach, and show numerically that random quantum networks can outperform more traditional quantum networks as well as random classical networks.

TI Quantum machine learning based wind turbine condition monitoring: State
   of the art and future prospects
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Wind energy, as a popular renewable resource, has gained extensive development and application in recent decades. Effective condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of wind turbines. While conventional machine learning methods have been widely used in wind turbine condition monitoring, these approaches often face challenges such as complex feature extraction, limited model generalization, and high computational costs when dealing with large-scale, high-dimensional, and complex datasets. The emergence of quantum computing has opened up a new paradigm of machine learning algorithms. Quantum machine learning combines the advantages of quantum computing and machine learning, with the potential to surpass classical computational capabilities. This paper firstly reviews applications and limitations of the state-of-the-art machine learning-based condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines. It then reviews the fundamentals of quantum computing, quantum machine learning algorithms and their applications, covering quantum-based feature extraction, classification and regression for fault detection and the use of quantum neural networks for predictive maintenance. Through comparison, it is observed that quantum machine learning methods, even without extensive optimization, can achieve accuracy levels comparable to those of optimized conventional machine learning approaches. The challenges of applying quantum machine learning are also addressed, along with the future research and development prospects. The objective of this review is to fill a gap in the published literature by providing a new paradigm approach for wind turbine condition monitoring. By promoting quantum machine learning in this field, the reliability and efficiency of wind power systems are ultimately sought to be enhanced.

TI Real-time decoding for fault-tolerant quantum computing: progress,
   challenges and outlook
SO NANO FUTURES
AB Quantum computing is poised to solve practically useful problems which are computationally intractable for classical supercomputers. However, the current generation of quantum computers are limited by errors that may only partially be mitigated by developing higher-quality qubits. Quantum error correction (QEC) will thus be necessary to ensure fault tolerance. QEC protects the logical information by cyclically measuring syndrome information about the errors. An essential part of QEC is the decoder, which uses the syndrome to compute the likely effect of the errors on the logical degrees of freedom and provide a tentative correction. The decoder must be accurate, fast enough to keep pace with the QEC cycle (e.g. on a microsecond timescale for superconducting qubits) and with hard real-time system integration to support logical operations. As such, real-time decoding is essential to realize fault-tolerant quantum computing and to achieve quantum advantage. In this work, we highlight some of the key challenges facing the implementation of real-time decoders while providing a succinct summary of the progress to-date. Furthermore, we lay out our perspective for the future development and provide a possible roadmap for the field of real-time decoding in the next few years. As the quantum hardware is anticipated to scale up, this perspective article will provide a guidance for researchers, focusing on the most pressing issues in real-time decoding and facilitating the development of solutions across quantum, nano and computer science.

TI Landau-type sudden transitions of quantum correlations
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Sudden changes of quantum correlations in the Bell-diagonal states are well-known effects. They occur when the set of optimal parameters that determine the quantum correlation consists of isolated points and optimal parameters during the evolution of the system jump from one such point to another (e.g., the optimal measurement angle of the quantum discord changes discontinuously from zero to pi/2 or vice versa). However, when considering more general X quantum states, we found that quantum discord and one-way quantum work deficit can experience sudden changes of other kinds. Namely, the optimal measurement angle may suddenly start to shift continuously from its stationary value 0 or pi/2 to an intermediate optimal measurement angle theta is an element of (0, pi/2). This leads to a new behavior of quantum correlations, which is mathematically described by the Landau phenomenological theory of second-order phase transitions. In addition, for the one-way quantum work deficit, we found cases where the optimal measurement angle jumps from zero to a nonzero step less than pi/2, and then continuously changes its value. This behavior of quantum correlation is similar to a first-order phase transition in Landau's theory. Dependencies of quantum discord and one-way quantum work deficit near the boundaries, which separate regions with state-dependent (variable) and state-independent (stationary, constant) optimal measurement angles, are examined in detail on an example of the XXZ spin model in an external field at thermal equilibrium.

TI Potential and limitations of random Fourier features for dequantizing
   quantum machine learning
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum machine learning is arguably one of the most explored applications of near-term quantum devices. Much focus has been put on notions of variational quantum machine learning where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are used as learning models. These PQC models have a rich structure which suggests that they might be amenable to efficient dequantization via random Fourier features (RFF). In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which RFF does indeed provide an efficient dequantization of variational quantum machine learning for regression. We build on these insights to make concrete suggestions for PQC architecture design, and to identify structures which are necessary for a regression problem to admit a potential quantum advantage via PQC based optimization.

TI Atomic Quantum Technologies for Quantum Matter and Fundamental Physics
   Applications
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB Physics is living an era of unprecedented cross-fertilization among the different areas of science. In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that state-of-the-art cold and ultracold-atomic platforms can have in fundamental and applied science through the development of platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, unveil foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, and advance quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. In this journey, we take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e., creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum computer to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We wish to convey three main messages. First, this atom-based quantum technology enterprise is signing a new era in the way quantum technologies are used for fundamental science, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is unavoidably taking center stage in frontier's science. Third, quantum science and technology progress will have capillary impact on society, meaning this effect is not confined to isolated or highly specialized areas of knowledge, but is expected to reach and have a pervasive influence on a broad range of society aspects: while this happens, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all the above reflections, this perspective review is thus aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where cold and ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation.

TI Noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulation of the one-dimensional wave

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as O(n2) for n qubits representing the solution on 2n grid points, and leads to infidelities of O(2-4nt2) for simulation time t assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.

TI Enhancing Minimum-Consumption Discrimination of Two-Qubit Quantum States
   via Entangling Measurements (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Reducing the average number of copies consumed in quantum state discrimination under a given error rate is referred to as minimum-consumption quantum state discrimination. Minimum-consumption quantum state discrimination allows the saved resources to be utilized for subsequent quantum tasks, and it holds significant practical value in tasks such as quantum cryptography. In this paper, we investigate minimum-consumption quantum state discrimination of two-qubit quantum states. The theoretical results indicate that even when two-qubit quantum states only possess classical correlations and no quantum entanglement, entangled measurements still far outperform the effects of performing local measurements on the two qubits individually. Experimental results confirm that when the error rate requirement is low enough, the average number of copies consumed by entangled measurement device is only one-twelfth of that consumed by local measurements, while still meeting the error rate requirement. Our research results highlight the role of entangled measurements in minimum-consuption quantum state discrimination, demonstrating the importance of entanglement in quantum measurements.

TI Passive Environment-Assisted Quantum Communication with GKP States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Bosonic pure-loss channel, which represents the process of photons decaying into a vacuum environment, has zero quantum capacity when the channel's transmissivity is less than 50%. Modeled as a beam splitter interaction between the system and its environment, the performance of bosonic pure-loss channel can be enhanced by controlling the environment state. We show that by choosing the ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states for the system and its environment, perfect transmission of quantum information through a beam splitter is achievable at arbitrarily low transmissivities. Our explicit constructions allow for experimental demonstration of the improved performance of a quantum channel through passive environment assistance, which is potentially useful for quantum transduction where the environment state can be naturally controlled. In practice, it is crucial to consider finite-energy constraints, and high-fidelity quantum communication through a beam splitter remains achievable with GKP states at the few-photon level.

TI Quantum Entanglement to Extract a True Ground State from an Approximate
   Ground State
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB We propose a procedure to extract a true ground state from an approximate ground state by using quantum entanglement. We use plural ancilla qubits with hierarchical structure, intending to gradually improve the precision of the approximation. We demonstrate the procedure for quantum systems with a few qubits that derive from the (1+1)-dimensional Schwinger model by classically emulated digital quantum simulation. Although we use for simplicity an approximate ground state prepared by adiabatic quantum computation, our procedure is applicable to any approximate ground state that is a superposition of a true ground state and excited states. Our procedure is applicable for an N-qubits Hamiltonian with a nondegenerate ground state.

TI Nontrivial evolution and geometric phase for an orbital angular momentum
   qutrit
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) offers a promising platform for highdimensional quantum information processing. While geometric phase (GP) is the crucial tool in enabling intrinsically fault -tolerant quantum computation, the measurement of GP using linear optics remains relatively unexplored in the OAM state space. Here, we propose an experimental scheme to detect GP shifts resulting from the cyclic evolution of OAM qutrit states. Distinguished with the conventional evolution along cyclic path on the Poincar & eacute; sphere (PS), the nontrivial evolution in our theoretical scheme is along a cyclic path residing within the SU(3)/U(2) parameter space. By employing a combination of X -gates, dove prisms, and double cylindrical lenses, we achieve the cyclic evolution and analyse the resultant GP through our designed Sagnac interferometer. Our theoretical study may find potential in high -dimensional quantum computation using twisted photons and in exploring the geometric structure of such optical systems.

TI Non-ambiguous and simplified quantum teleportation protocol
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, a new version of the quantum teleportation protocol is presented, which does not require a Bell state measurement (BSM) module on the sender side (Alice), a unitary transform to reconstruct the teleported state on the receiver side (Bob), neither a disambiguation process through two classic bits that travel through a classic disambiguation channel located between sender and receiver. The corresponding theoretical deduction of the protocol, as well as the experimental verification of its operation for several examples of qubits through implementation on an optical table, complete the present study. Both the theoretical and experimental outcomes show a marked superiority in the performance of the new protocol over the original version, with more simplicity and lower implementation costs, and identical fidelity in its most complete version.

TI Set of holonomic and protected gates on topological qubits for a
   realistic quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In recent years qubit designs such as transmons have approached fidelities of up to 0.999. However, even these devices are still insufficient for realizing quantum error correction requiring better than 0.9999 fidelity. Topologically protected superconducting qubits are arguably the most prospective for building a realistic quantum computer as they are intrinsically protected from noise and leakage errors that occur in transmons. We propose a topologically protected qubit design based on a pi-periodic Josephson element and a universal set of gates: A protected Clifford group and highly robust (with infidelity less than or similar to 10(-4)) nondiscrete holonomic phase gate. The qubit is controlled via charge Q and flux Phi biases. The holonomic gate is realized by quickly, but adiabatically, going along a particular closed path in the two-dimensional {Phi, Q} space-a path where computational states are always degenerate but Berry curvature is localized inside the path. This gate is robust against currently achievable noise levels. This qubit architecture allows building a realistic scalable superconducting quantum computer with leakage and noise-induced errors below 10(-4), which allows performing realistic error correction codes with currently available fabrication techniques.

TI Permutation invariant encodings for quantum machine learning with point
   cloud data
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing offers a potentially powerful new method for performing machine learning. However, several quantum machine learning techniques have been shown to exhibit poor generalisation as the number of qubits increases. We address this issue by demonstrating a permutation invariant quantum encoding method, which exhibits superior generalisation performance, and apply it to point cloud data (three-dimensional images composed of points). Point clouds naturally contain permutation symmetry with respect to the ordering of their points, making them a natural candidate for this technique. Our method captures this symmetry in a quantum encoding that contains an equal quantum superposition of all permutations and is therefore invariant under point order permutation. We test this encoding method in numerical simulations using a quantum support vector machine to classify point clouds drawn from either spherical or toroidal geometries. We show that a permutation invariant encoding improves in accuracy as the number of points contained in the point cloud increases, while non-invariant quantum encodings decrease in accuracy. This demonstrates that by implementing permutation invariance into the encoding, the model exhibits improved generalisation.

AB Most quantum computing architectures to date natively support multi-valued logic, albeit being typically operated in a binary fashion. Multi-valued, or qudit, quantum processors have access to much richer forms of quantum entanglement, which promise to significantly boost the performance and usefulness of quantum devices. However, much of the theory as well as corresponding design methods required for exploiting such hardware remain insufficient and generalizations from qubits are not straightforward. A particular challenge is the compilation of quantum circuits into sets of native qudit gates supported by state-of-the-art quantum hardware. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a complete workflow for compiling any two-qudit unitary into an arbitrary native gate set. Case studies demonstrate the feasibility of both, the proposed approach as well as the corresponding implementation (which is freely available at github.com/cda-tum/qudit-entanglementcompilation).

TI A novel image classification framework based on variational quantum
   algorithms
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Image classification is a crucial task in machine learning with widespread practical applications. The existing classical framework for image classification typically utilizes a global pooling operation at the end of the network to reduce computational complexity and mitigate overfitting. However, this operation often results in a significant loss of information, which can affect the performance of classification models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel image classification framework that leverages variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical computing paradigms within quantum machine learning. The major advantage of our framework is the elimination of the need for the global pooling operation at the end of the network. In this way, our approach preserves more discriminative features and fine-grained details in the images, which enhances classification performance. Additionally, employing VQAs enables our framework to have fewer parameters than the classical framework, even in the absence of global pooling, which makes it more advantageous in preventing overfitting. We apply our method to different state-of-the-art image classification models and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed quantum architecture over its classical counterpart through a series of state vector simulation experiments on public datasets. Our experiments show that the proposed quantum framework achieves up to a 9.21% increase in accuracy and up to a 15.79% improvement in F1 score, compared to the classical framework. Additionally, we explore the impact of shot noise on our method through shot-based simulation and find that increasing the number of measurements does not always lead to better results. Selecting an appropriate number of measurements can yield optimal results, even surpassing those obtained from state vector simulation.

AB In this paper, we discuss how certain radio access network optimization problems can be modelled using the concept of constraint satisfaction problems in artificial intelligence, and solved at scale using a quantum computer. As a case study, we discuss root sequence index (RSI) assignment problem - an important LTE/NR physical random access channel configuration related automation use-case. We formulate RSI assignment as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem constructed using data ingested from a commercial mobile network, and solve it using a cloud-based commercially available quantum computing platform. Results show that quantum annealing solver can successfully assign conflict-free RSIs. Comparison with well-known heuristics reveals that some classic algorithms are even more effective in terms of solution quality and computation time. The non-quantum advantage is due to the fact that current implementation is a semi-quantum proof-of-concept algorithm. Also, the results depend on the type of quantum computer used. Nevertheless, the proposed framework is highly flexible and holds tremendous potential for harnessing the power of quantum computing in mobile network automation.

TI Integrated Distributed Sensing and Quantum Communication Networks
SO RESEARCH
AB The integration of sensing and communication can achieve ubiquitous sensing while enabling ubiquitous communication. Within the gradually improving global communication, the integrated sensing and communication system based on optical fibers can accomplish various functionalities, such as urban structure imaging, seismic wave detection, and pipeline safety monitoring. With the development of quantum communication, quantum networks based on optical fiber are gradually being established. In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and quantum network (ISAQN) scheme, which can achieve secure key distribution among multiple nodes and distributed sensing under the standard quantum limit. The continuous variables quantum key distribution protocol and the round-trip multiband structure are adopted to achieve the multinode secure key distribution. Meanwhile, the spectrum phase monitoring protocol is proposed to realize distributed sensing. It determines which node is vibrating by monitoring the frequency spectrum and restores the vibration waveform by monitoring the phase change. The scheme is experimentally demonstrated by simulating the vibration in a star structure network. Experimental results indicate that this multiuser quantum network can achieve a secret key rate of approximately 0.7 Mbits/s for each user under 10-km standard fiber transmission, and its network capacity is 8. In terms of distributed sensing, it can achieve a vibration response bandwidth ranging from 1 Hz to 2 kHz, a strain resolution of 0.50 n epsilon/Hz, and a spatial resolution of 0.20 m under shot-noise-limited detection. The proposed ISAQN scheme enables simultaneous quantum communication and distributed sensing in a multipoint network, laying a foundation for future large-scale quantum networks and high-precision sensing networks.

TI Optimal quantum network decongestion strategies
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study clarifies the problem of decongestion in quantum networks, with a specific focus on the crucial task of entanglement distribution. Entangled particles are a valuable resource in quantum networks, as they are used for most quantum protocols. As such, ensuring that nodes in quantum networks are supplied with entanglement efficiently is mandatory. Many times, parts of a quantum network are contested by multiple entanglement resupply processes and the distribution of entanglement becomes a challenge. The most common network intersection topology, the star-shape and it's various generalizations, are analyzed, and effective decongestion strategies, in order to achieve optimal entanglement distribution, are proposed. The analysis is comprehensive and relies on rigorous mathematical calculations which aids in selecting the most appropriate strategy for different scenarios optimally.

TI Tangling Schedules Eases Hardware Connectivity Requirements for Quantum
   Error Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Error corrected quantum computers have the potential to change the way we solve computational problems. Quantum error correction involves repeated rounds of carefully scheduled gates to measure the stabilizers of a code. A set of scheduling rules is typically imposed on the order of gates to ensure that the circuit can be rearranged into an equivalent circuit that can be easily seen to measure the stabilizers. In this work, we ask what would happen if we break these rules and instead use circuit schedules that we describe as tangled. We find that tangling schedules generates long-range entanglement not accessible using nearest -neighbor two-qubit gates. Our tangled -schedule method provides a new tool for building quantum error -correction circuits and we explore applications to design new architectures for fault -tolerant quantum computers. Notably, we show that, for the widely used Pauli -based model of computation (achieved by lattice surgery), this access to longer -range entanglement can reduce the device connectivity requirements, without compromising on circuit depth.

AB Resource-efficient and high-precision approximate synthesis of quantum circuits expressed in the Clifford+T gate set is vital for Fault-Tolerant quantum computing. Efficient optimal methods are known for single-qubit RZ unitaries, otherwise the problem is generally intractable. Search-based methods, like simulated annealing, empirically generate low resource cost approximate implementations of general multi-qubit unitaries so long as low precision (Hilbert-Schmidt distances of epsilon >= 10-2) can be tolerated. These algorithms build up circuits that directly invert target unitaries. We instead leverage search-based methods to first approximately diagonalize a unitary, then perform the inversion analytically. This lets difficult continuous rotations be bypassed and handled in a post-processing step. Our approach improves both the implementation precision and run time of synthesis algorithms by orders of magnitude when evaluated on unitaries from real quantum algorithms. On benchmarks previously synthesizable only with analytical techniques like the Quantum Shannon Decomposition, diagonalization uses an average of 95% fewer non-Clifford gates.

TI Global Roots and Poles Finding Algorithm on Quantum Computer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, the implementation of the global roots and poles finding algorithm for a complex-valued function of a complex variable on a quantum computer, which allows for solving general nonlinear algebraic equations, is presented. The considered function is sampled with the use of Delaunay's triangulation on the complex plane and a phase quadrant, in which the value of the function is located, is computed on a classical computer for all of the sampling nodes. Then, if the real and imaginary parts of the function simultaneously change signs for both ends of the same edge in the mesh, then a zero of the function is located in the region around this edge. In order to detect such edges, the mesh is transformed into a one-dimensional array and the required edges, where the sign simultaneously changes for real and imaginary parts of the function, are found with the use of quantum Grover's algorithm. If the mesh consists of P edges, the computational overhead of this operation, in terms of oracle queries, is equal to O(root P) on a quantum computer, instead of O(P) on a classical one. Finally, the existence of function zeros and poles is proved with the use of Cauchy's argument principle on a classical computer, and the output results are computed, based on the mesh refinement, with the assumed numerical precision of computations. Our method is implemented in Python with the use of the Qiskit software development kit and its applicability is proved by quantum emulations.

TI Entanglement measures based on the complete information of reduced
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement has been verified experimentally and applied in quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum networks. It is of great significance to find measures to characterize the quantum entanglement faithfully. In this work, by exploiting the Schmidt decomposition of bipartite states, we first establish a one-to-one correspondence between the characteristic polynomial of the reduced state of a bipartite pure state and the trace of the reduced state. We introduce a family of entanglement measures based on the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices. Specific measures called informationally complete entanglement measures (ICEMs) are presented. It is demonstrated that such ICEMs can characterize better the entanglement than the existing well-known entanglement measures. The ICEMs also give rise to criteria of state transformations under local operation and classical communication. Moreover, it is shown that the ICEMs can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer. The full separability, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement can be detected faithfully on quantum devices.

TI Enhancing Quantum Literacy in Secondary Education Through Quantum
   Computing and Quantum Key Distribution
SO EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB In the current era of rapid technological change, where artificial intelligence and quantum computing are reshaping knowledge, quantum literacy in high schools is becoming increasingly relevant. An understanding of quantum science is now important for fostering future readiness to prepare students for the future, as it directly affects research, technology and innovation. Introducing quantum computing through educational tools and interactive platforms in schools will make quantum science accessible, equipping students with the necessary skills to understand and participate in future developments. This work investigates the necessity of quantum literacy among secondary education students, as well as their perceptions and understanding of basic concepts of quantum physics. Prior to data collection, students participated in two 90 min educational presentations that introduced fundamental principles of quantum physics through quantum computing and its applications, with an emphasis on cryptography and key distribution. Then, through the application of a specially designed questionnaire, data were collected from 78 students of different kind of schools and background and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results showed positive trends in students' responses regarding their familiarity with quantum literacy and their understanding of fundamental principles such as superposition and entanglement. In addition, the analysis highlighted students' interest in quantum computing and technology and its potential applications. This study highlights the need to integrate quantum literacy into the secondary education curriculum in order to foster scientific thinking and prepare students for the challenges of the quantum era. The educational intervention with the two presentations seemed to contribute positively to the development of students' quantum literacy.

TI Transversal diagonal logical operators for stabiliser codes
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Storing quantum information in a quantum error correction code can protect it from errors, but the ability to transform the stored quantum information in a fault tolerant way is equally important. Logical Pauli group operators can be implemented on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a commonly-studied category of codes, by applying a series of physical Pauli X and Z gates. Logical operators of this form are fault-tolerant because each qubit is acted upon by at most one gate, limiting the spread of errors, and are referred to as transversal logical operators. Identifying transversal logical operators outside the Pauli group is less well understood. Pauli operators are the first level of the Clifford hierarchy which is deeply connected to fault-tolerance and universality. In this work, we study transversal logical operators composed of single- and multi-qubit diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates. We demonstrate algorithms for identifying all transversal diagonal logical operators on a CSS code that are more general or have lower computational complexity than previous methods. We also show a method for constructing CSS codes that have a desired diagonal logical Clifford hierarchy operator implemented using single qubit phase gates. Our methods rely on representing operators composed of diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates as diagonal XP operators and this technique may have broader applications.

TI Open-Air Microwave Entanglement Distribution for Quantum Teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Microwave technology plays a central role in current wireless communications, including mobile com-munication and local area networks. The microwave range shows relevant advantages with respect to other frequencies in open-air transmission, such as low absorption losses and low-energy consumption, and in addition, it is the natural working frequency in superconducting quantum technologies. Entangle-ment distribution between separate parties is at the core of secure quantum communications. Therefore, understanding its limitations in realistic open-air settings, especially in the rather unexplored microwave regime, is crucial for transforming microwave quantum communications into a mainstream technology. Here, we investigate the feasibility of an open-air entanglement distribution scheme with microwave two -mode squeezed states. First, we study the reach of direct entanglement transmission in open air, obtaining a maximum distance of approximately 500 m with parameters feasible for state-of-the-art experiments. Subsequently, we adapt entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping protocols to microwave technology in order to reduce the environment-induced entanglement degradation. The employed entan-glement distillation helps to increase quantum correlations in the short-distance low-squeezing regime by up to 46%, and the reach of entanglement increases by 14% with entanglement swapping. Importantly, we compute the fidelity of a continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol using open-air-distributed entanglement as a resource. Finally, we adapt this machinery to explore the limitations of quantum com-munication between satellites, where the impact of thermal noise is substantially reduced and diffraction losses are dominant.

TI Quantum simulation of a general anti-PT-symmetric Hamiltonian with a
   trapped ion qubit
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Non-Hermitian systems satisfying parity-time ( PT ) symmetry have aroused considerable interest owing to their exotic features. Anti -PT symmetry is an important counterpart of the PT symmetry, and has been studied in various classical systems. Although a Hamiltonian with anti -PT symmetry only differs from its PT-symmetric counterpart in a global +/- i phase, the information and energy exchange between systems and environment are different under them. It is also suggested theoretically that anti -PT symmetry is a useful concept in the context of quantum information storage with qubits coupled to a bosonic bath. So far, the observation of anti -PT symmetry in individual quantum systems remains elusive. Here, we implement an anti -PT-symmetric Hamiltonian of a single qubit in a single trapped ion by a designed microwave and optical control-pulse sequence. We characterize the anti -PT phase transition by mapping out the eigenvalues at different ratios between coupling strengths and dissipation rates. The full information of the quantum state is also obtained by quantum state tomography. Our work allows quantum simulation of genuine open-system feature of an anti -PT-symmetric system, which paves the way for utilizing non-Hermitian properties for quantum information processing.

AB We analyze an experimentally accessible Lindblad master equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator. It approximately stabilizes finite-energy periodic grid states called Gottesman- Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, that can be used to encode and protect a logical qubit. We give explicit upper bounds for the energy of the solutions of the Lindblad master equation. Using three periodic observables to define the Bloch sphere coordinates of a logical qubit, we show that their dynamics is governed by a diffusion partial differential equation on a 2D-torus with a Witten Laplacian. We show that the evolution of these logical coordinates is exponentially slow even in presence of small diffusive noise processes along the two quadratures of the phase space. Numerical simulations indicate similar results for other physically relevant noise processes. Copyright (c) 2023 The Authors.

TI A Quantum Convolution Autoencoder for Handwritten Letters and Digits: A
   Case Study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The concept of an autoencoder is a key element of modern machine learning methods. It is used, e.g., to compress the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, which is later employed in other machine learning algorithms. In the area of quantum computing application methods, quantum machine learning is also developing dynamically, with the concept of a quantum autoencoder also present. In the article, we discuss a variant of building a quantum autoencoder based on a quantum convolutional network. The proposed autoencoder is characterized by an architecture based on adjacent quantum gates, which is especially important for the near-future noisy intermediate-scale hardware implementation of such a type of quantum circuits. The proposed circuits are built with an elementary set of gates, i.e., controlled negation gates and rotation gates. The described architecture of a quantum autoencoder properly uses the quantum phenomenon called quantum exponential capacitys, i.e., a linear number of qubits which allow encoding an exponential amount of classical information. In our case, for n qubit, it is possible to encode a classical gray coloured image with dimensionality 2n x 2n. The conducted numerical experiments on a set image of handwritten characters and letters show that, for a small number of parameters, the quantum autoencoder offers a reconstruction quality comparable to the currently used classical autoencoders. An important assumption is the omission of additional dimensionality reduction techniques, e.g., PCA, for the preparation of classical data. In the discussed experiment, the data after reconstruction can be read directly from the quantum register, through a series of quantum register measurements.

TI Blueprint for a Scalable Photonic Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer
SO QUANTUM
AB Photonics is the platform of choice to build a modular, easy-to-network quantum computer operating at room temperature. However, no concrete architecture has been presented so far that exploits both the advantages of qubits encoded into states of light and the modern tools for their generation. Here we propose such a design for a scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer informed by the latest developments in theory and technology. Central to our architecture is the generation and manipulation of three-dimensional resource states comprising both bosonic qubits and squeezed vacuum states. The proposal exploits state-of-the-art procedures for the non-deterministic generation of bosonic qubits combined with the strengths of continuous-variable quantum computation, namely the implementation of Clifford gates using easy-to-generate squeezed states. Moreover, the architecture is based on two-dimensional integrated photonic chips used to produce a qubit cluster state in one temporal and two spatial dimensions. By reducing the experimental challenges as compared to existing architectures and by enabling room-temperature quantum computation, our design opens the door to scalable fabrication and operation, which may allow photonics to leap-frog other platforms on the path to a quantum computer with millions of qubits.

TI Fusion of deterministically generated photonic graph states
SO NATURE
AB Entanglement has evolved from an enigmatic concept of quantum physics to a key ingredient of quantum technology. It explains correlations between measurement outcomes that contradict classical physics and has been widely explored with small sets of individual qubits. Multi-partite entangled states build up in gate-based quantum-computing protocols and-from a broader perspective-were proposed as the main resource for measurement-based quantum-information processing(1,2). The latter requires the ex-ante generation of a multi-qubit entangled state described by a graph(3-6). Small graph states such as Bell or linear cluster states have been produced with photons(7-16), but the proposed quantum-computing and quantum-networking applications require fusion of such states into larger and more powerful states in a programmable fashion(17-21). Here we achieve this goal by using an optical resonator(22) containing two individually addressable atoms(23,24). Ring(25) and tree(26) graph states with up to eight qubits, with the names reflecting the entanglement topology, are efficiently fused from the photonic states emitted by the individual atoms. The fusion process itself uses a cavity-assisted gate between the two atoms. Our technique is, in principle, scalable to even larger numbers of qubits and is the decisive step towards, for instance, a memory-less quantum repeater in a future quantum internet(27-29).

TI Crystalline Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Random quantum circuits continue to inspire a wide range of applications in quantum information science and many-body quantum physics, while remaining analytically tractable through probabilistic methods. Motivated by an interest in deterministic circuits with similar applications, we construct classes of nonrandom unitary Clifford circuits by imposing translation invariance in both time and space. Further imposing dual unitarity, our circuits effectively become crystalline spacetime lattices whose vertices are SWAP or iSWAP two-qubit gates and whose edges may contain one-qubit gates. One can then require invariance under (subgroups of) the crystal's point group. Working on the square and kagome lattices, we use the formalism of Clifford quantum cellular automata to describe operator spreading, entanglement generation, and recurrence times of these circuits. A full classification on the square lattice reveals, of particular interest, a "nonfractal good scrambling class" with dense operator spreading that generates codes with linear contiguous code distance and high performance under erasure errors at the end of the circuit. We also break unitarity by adding spacetime translation-invariant measurements and find a class of such circuits with fractal dynamics.

These latter include a loading module, a tool-kit of basic quantum arithmetic operations and a read-out module. We briefly discuss the loading and read-out modules, while the arithmetic module is analyzed in more depth. Eventually, we give explicit examples regarding the manipulation of generic oracles and hint at possible applications.

TI Exchanging Quantum Correlations and Non-Local Information Between Three
   Qubit-Syatem
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The possibility of exchanging the quantum correlations and the non-local information between three qubits interact directly or indirectly via Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)is discussed. The initial state settings and the interaction strength represent control parameters on the exchanging phenomena. The non-local information that encoded on the different partitions doesn't exceed the initial one. It is shown that, the ability of DM interaction to generate entanglement is larger than that displayed for the dipole interaction. The possibility of maximizing the quantum correlations between the three qubits increases as one increase the strength of interaction and starting with large initial quantum correlations. The long-lived quantum correlations could be achieved by controlling the strength of the dipole interaction.

TI TCEP-Based Synchronization for Practical Communication Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Precise time synchronization is a fundamental challenge in distributed quantum systems, with direct implications for secure communication, quantum sensing, and next-generation quantum network technologies. In this work, we present an field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)-based implementation of a synchronization system using time-correlated entangled photons (TCEP), achieving timing precision below 200 ps across 10- and 20-km deployed fiber links using spectral filtering (SF) and dispersion compensation. The system exploits the intrinsic temporal correlations of entangled photon pairs to estimate synchronization offsets between remote nodes. A modular architecture is developed, featuring optimized OpenCL kernels for real-time correlation, timestamp aggregation, and peak normalization. This enables high-throughput performance with efficient utilization of hardware resources. Experimental validation confirms that the FPGA processes entangled photon timestamps and computes cross-correlation functions significantly faster than conventional CPU-based methods, achieving execution times in the range of a few milliseconds for datasets containing up to 10(5) timestamped events per node. Resource utilization analysis further demonstrates the scalability of the design, with the system operating reliably at a 397.5-MHz clock frequency while maintaining efficient logic, register, and memory usage. Our results illustrate the feasibility of deploying FPGA-based TCEP synchronization in real-world quantum networks, supporting applications in ultra-reliable low-latency communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced localization and sensing. This work bridges foundational quantum photonic principles and hardware-level deployment, laying the groundwork for timing infrastructure in future quantum internet and 6G networks.

TI Correlated collective excitation and quantum entanglement between two
   Rydberg superatoms in steady state
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Owing to the unique physical characteristics of Rydberg atoms, which play an important role in quantum information and quantum computation, the theoretical and applied research of Rydberg atoms have become the hot spots of scientific research in recent years. With the large polarizability of Rydberg atoms, even a small electric field could cause a considerable electric dipole moment, resulting in a strong dipole-dipole interaction between Rydberg atoms. The multiple excitations of the Rydberg states are strongly inhibited because of the strong dipole interaction between atoms within a mesoscopic interaction (blockade) region. We call this phenomenon the dipole blockade effect. The dipole blockade effect makes it possible to build single-photon quantum devices, implement quantum gates, generate quantum entanglement, and simulate many-body quantum problems, etc.A Rydberg atomic ensemble in the same blockade region can be regarded as a superatom. In the same way, if these atoms trapped in two optical dipole traps, each sub-ensemble can be considered as a sub-superatom which is closely related to the superatom. According to the fact that two Rydberg sub-superatoms can be strongly correlated due to sharing no more than one excited Rydberg atom, we study correlated collective excitation and quantum entanglement between two Rydberg sub-superatoms in a steady state. With the superatom model, the problem of exponentially increasing system size with the number of atoms can be circumvented to a certain extent in studying many-body physics. By solving the two-body Lindblad's master equation accurately, we obtain the analytical expressions for the collective excitation probabilities of the two sub-superatoms, and the concurrence measuring the bipartite entanglement between them. Our results show that they are all sensitive to the number of atoms in each Rydberg superatom: the bigger (including more atoms) the Rydberg superatom, the higher the collective Rydberg excitation probability is. And that the maximally entangled state can only be obtained with two equal-sized Rydberg superatoms. When this condition is fulfilled, the mesoscopic entanglement can be generated by adding the number of atoms in each Rydberg superatom. This may provide an attractive platform for studying the quantum-classical correspondence and have potential promising applications in quantum information processing.

TI Quantum sensing of photonic spin density using a single spin qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as promising room-temperature quantum sensors for probing condensed matter phenomena ranging from spin liquids, two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, and magnons to hydrodynamic flow of current. Here we propose and demonstrate that the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be used as a quantum sensor for detecting the photonic spin density, the spatial distribution of light's spin angular momentum. We exploit a single spin qubit on an atomic force microscope tip to probe the spinning field of an incident Gaussian light beam. The spinning field of light induces an effective static magnetic field in the single spin qubit probe. We perform room-temperature sensing using Bloch sphere operations driven by a microwave field (XY8 protocol). This nanoscale quantum magnetometer can measure the local polarization of light in ultra-sub-wavelength volumes. We also put forth a rigorous theory of the experimentally measured phase change using the NV center Hamiltonian and perturbation theory involving only virtual photon transitions. The direct detection of the photonic spin density at the nanoscale using NV centers in diamond opens interesting quantum metrological avenues for studying exotic phases of photons, nanoscale properties of structured light as well as future on-chip applications in spin quantum electrodynamics.

TI Manipulations of a transmon qubit with a null-biased electro-optic fiber
   link
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of superconducting quantum circuits, particularly in improving the complexity of quantum processors for large-scale quantum computing and quantum simulation tasks. To enable the execution of quantum information processing tasks on large-scale quantum circuits containing millions of qubits, it is essential to minimize thermal effects on control and measurement lines, ensuring that circuit components are superconducting and that qubits are not significantly thermally excited. Recent studies have shown that a quadrature-biased electro-optic fiber link can operate qubits with a much reduced thermal load, thereby facilitating the simultaneous operation of a large number of qubits. Expanding on this, here we propose and demonstrate that coherent manipulations of superconducting qubits can also be achieved by setting the bias point of the electro-optic modulator at the null point instead of the quadrature point. Major advantages of our null-point bias method include further reduction of the thermal load and improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio, and relaxed requirement for experimental implementations. Simultaneous control of two qubits is also demonstrated using the proposed null-biased fiber-optic link, which is the first time to the best of our knowledge.

TI Mapping a 50-spin-qubit network through correlated sensing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spins associated to optically accessible solid-state defects have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring quantum simulation, quantum sensing and quantum communication. Pioneering experiments have shown the sensing, imaging, and control of multiple nuclear spins surrounding a single electron spin defect. However, the accessible size of these spin networks has been constrained by the spectral resolution of current methods. Here, we map a network of 50 coupled spins through high-resolution correlated sensing schemes, using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We develop concatenated double-resonance sequences that identify spin-chains through the network. These chains reveal the characteristic spin frequencies and their interconnections with high spectral resolution, and can be fused together to map out the network. Our results provide new opportunities for quantum simulations by increasing the number of available spin qubits. Additionally, our methods might find applications in nano-scale imaging of complex spin systems external to the host crystal.
   The ability to characterize large and complex nuclear-spin networks could enable quantum applications, such as quantum simulations of many-body physics. Here the authors develop a high-resolution quantum-sensing method and use it to image a network of 50 nuclear spins surrounding a single NV center in diamond.

TI Qubit sensing by optimal narrowband pulses: Demonstration for Rabi
   frequency sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Narrowband optimal control is proposed as a protocol of optimal quantum sensing, providing maximum accuracy for given resources. The procedure is demonstrated on the IBM quantum computer to estimate the amplitude of the qubit Rabi frequency. It is based on optimizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) when it becomes equal to the classical Fisher information. This scenario offers a practical quantum sensing because it only involves population transfer to the excited state as the target without dynamical phases, which would otherwise be difficult to control and measure. The protocol uses the single-shot-shaped pulse method and an inverse optimization, to design a pulse that results in the optimal QFI in terms of energy or equivalently operating time, referred to in short as local narrowband inverse optimization (NIO). Multiple pi pulses are shown to be particular cases of this protocol. An alternative semiglobal optimal NIO procedure producing a partially nonoscillatory profile is also demonstrated. Our approach also offers application to optimal atomic selective excitation in an array of atoms for quantum technology.

TI Excitons in quantum technologies: The role of strain engineering
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB As quantum communication channels, single photons render an excellent platform, which is why they are called flying qubits. They are easily transported over long distances via fibers or even satellites due to their remarkably weak interaction with each other. Therefore, some sort of link between photons is required to carry out quantum operations. Ideally, this process is carried out on a robust solid-state chip infrastructure. In this context, excitons (i.e., bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors) are an ideal connection between photons and the solid state. Due to their mostly strong dipole character, excitons can be efficiently created by photons and inversely create photons upon recombination. This makes excitons in various semiconductor platforms key players in modern quantum technology approaches. While in extended crystal systems, excitons can be transported, their confinement to quasi-0D is used to create stationary solid-state qubits. In addition, excitons provide interactions with other degrees of freedom that can be harnessed in quantum technologies (i.e., spin or mechanical excitations of the host crystal lattice). Here, we review different approaches that use static or dynamic strain to tailor the optical properties of excitons or provide transport channels for excitons. We highlight approaches in traditional bulk semiconductor platforms and modern van der Waals semiconductors.

AB Over the past few years, the concept of quantum routers and their usefulness in quantum communication networks (e.g., in the BB84 protocol [5]) has been popularized in quantum information theory. While quite some work has been done on the theoretical implementation of quantum routers using multiplexing, most of it is constrained to the bipartite case [2, 9]. We extend this setup to quantum routers used in multipartite conference key agreement protocols so as to distribute a secret key among N parties. We formalize the general quantum entanglement matching problem, and show it's NP-completeness. We then study special cases for which we found efficient algorithms. Finally, we consider the weighted case where the weights represent the qubit ages.

TI Experimental self-testing for photonic graph states
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Graph states-one of the most representative families of multipartite entangled states-are important resources for multiparty quantum communication, quantum error correction, and quantum computation. Device-independent certification of highly entangled graph states plays a prominent role in quantum information processing tasks. Here we have experimentally demonstrated device-independent certification for multipartite graph states by adopting the robust self-testing scheme based on scalable Bell inequalities. Specifically, the prepared multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and linear cluster states achieve a high degree of Bell violation, which are beyond the nontrivial bounds of the robust self-testing scheme. Furthermore, our work paves the way to the device-independent certification of complex multipartite quantum states.

TI Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in
   ultrastrongly light-matter-coupled systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This work presents a scheme for engineering quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering with Gaussian measurements based on the quantum Hopfield model that incorporates a common thermal reservoir. We begin by examining quantum correlations, specifically quantum entanglement and EPR steering, in the ground state. These quantum correlations primarily stem from squeezing interactions in weak-coupling and normal strong-coupling regimes. As the coupling strength increases, especially upon entering the ultrastrong-coupling regime, the correlations emerge from the combined effect of squeezing and mix-mode interactions. Importantly, this scenario enables the realization of two-way EPR steering. Moreover, lower optical frequencies enhance both quantum entanglement and EPR steering. Further, when considering thermal effects, the ultrastrong-coupling and deep strong-coupling regimes, paired with lower optical frequencies, lead to improved entanglement. The one-way EPR steering for the resonant case can be effectively controlled in the ultrastrong-coupling and deep strong-coupling regimes which originate from the asymmetry of the subsystem and reservoir coupling induced by the diamagnetic term. Additionally, one-way EPR steering can also be produced for the nonresonant case. In this case, the asymmetry of the subsystem and reservoir originates from the combined effect of nonresonant frequencies and the diamagnetic term. Our findings have the potential to inspire further research into quantum information processing that leverages light-matter entanglement and EPR steering.

TI Physics-informed neural networks for an optimal counterdiabatic quantum
   computation
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A novel methodology that leverages physics-informed neural networks to optimize quantum circuits in systems with N Q qubits by addressing the counterdiabatic (CD) protocol is introduced. The primary purpose is to employ physics-inspired deep learning techniques for accurately modeling the time evolution of various physical observables within quantum systems. To achieve this, we integrate essential physical information into an underlying neural network to effectively tackle the problem. Specifically, the imposition of the solution to meet the principle of least action, along with the hermiticity condition on all physical observables, among others, ensuring the acquisition of appropriate CD terms based on underlying physics. This approach provides a reliable alternative to previous methodologies relying on classical numerical approximations, eliminating their inherent constraints. The proposed method offers a versatile framework for optimizing physical observables relevant to the problem, such as the scheduling function, gauge potential, temporal evolution of energy levels, among others. This methodology has been successfully applied to 2-qubit representing H 2 molecule using the STO-3G basis, demonstrating the derivation of a desirable decomposition for non-adiabatic terms through a linear combination of Pauli operators. This attribute confers significant advantages for practical implementation within quantum computing algorithms.

TI Deterministic manipulation of steering between distant quantum network
   nodes
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a key resource in a quantum network. Although EPR steering between spatially separated regions of ultracold atomic systems has been observed, deterministic manipulation of steering between distant quantum network nodes is required for a secure quantum communication network. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to deterministically generate, store, and manipulate one-way EPR steering between distant atomic cells by a cavity-enhanced quantum memory approach. While optical cavities effectively suppress the unavoidable noises in electromagnetically induced transparency, three atomic cells are in a strong Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state by faithfully storing three spatially separated entangled optical modes. In this way, the strong quantum correlation of atomic cells guarantees one-to-two node EPR steering is achieved, and can perserve the stored EPR steering in these quantum nodes. Furthermore, the steerability can be actively manipulated by the temperature of the atomic cell. This scheme provides the direct reference for experimental implementation for one-way multipartite steerable states, which enables an asymmetric quantum network protocol.

TI Quantum Communication Scheme Described by a Regular Four-Dimensional
   Complex Polytope
SO MOSCOW UNIVERSITY PHYSICS BULLETIN
AB At present, generalizations of quantum communication protocols from qubits to systems with higher-dimensional state spaces (qudits) commonly employ mutually unbiased bases (MUB), the construction of which is known for any dimension equal to a prime power. However, in low dimensions, there also exist formally more symmetric state systems described by regular complex polytopes, which are a generalization of the concept of regular polytopes to complex spaces. This work considers the application of a model originally proposed by R. Penrose and based on the geometry of the dodecahedron and two entangled particles with spin 3/2. In a more general case, two arbitrary quantum systems with four basis states (ququarts) can be used instead. It was subsequently shown that this system of 40 states is equivalent to the Witting configuration and is related to the four-dimensional complex polytope described by Coxeter. The paper proposes a quantum key distribution protocol based on contextuality, utilizing this configuration.

TI EXPLICIT QUANTUM CIRCUITS FOR BLOCK ENCODINGS OF CERTAIN SPARSE MATRICES
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Many standard linear algebra problems can be solved on a quantum computer by using recently developed quantum linear algebra algorithms that make use of block encodings and quantum eigenvalue/singular value transformations. A block encoding embeds a properly scaled matrix of interest A in a larger unitary transformation U that can be decomposed into a product of simpler unitaries and implemented efficiently on a quantum computer. Although quantum algorithms can potentially achieve exponential speedup in solving linear algebra problems compared to the best classical algorithm, such a gain in efficiency ultimately hinges on our ability to construct an efficient quantum circuit for the block encoding of A, which is difficult in general, and not trivial even for well structured sparse matrices. In this paper, we give a few examples on how efficient quantum circuits can be explicitly constructed for some well structured sparse matrices and discuss a few strategies used in these constructions. We also provide implementations of these quantum circuits in MATLAB.

TI Robust parallel laser driving of quantum dots for multiplexing of

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Deterministic sources of quantum light (i.e. single photons or pairs of entangled photons) are required for a whole host of applications in quantum technology, including quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and the long-distance transfer of quantum information in future quantum networks. Semiconductor quantum dots are ideal candidates for solid-state quantum emitters as these artificial atoms have large dipole moments and a quantum confined energy level structure, enabling the realization of single photon sources with high repetition rates and high single photon purity. Quantum dots may also be triggered using a laser pulse for on-demand operation. The naturally-occurring size variations in ensembles of quantum dots offers the potential to increase the bandwidth of quantum communication systems through wavelength-division multiplexing, but conventional laser triggering schemes based on Rabi rotations are ineffective when applied to inequivalent emitters. Here we report the demonstration of the simultaneous triggering of >10 quantum dots using adiabatic rapid passage. We show that high-fidelity quantum state inversion is possible in a system of quantum dots with a 15 meV range of optical transition energies using a single broadband, chirped laser pulse, laying the foundation for high-bandwidth, multiplexed quantum networks.

TI Narrowband and passband composite rotational quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB High-precision, robust quantum gates are essential components in quantum computation and information processing. In this study, we present an alternative perspective, exploring the potential applicability of quantum gates that exhibit heightened sensitivity to errors. We investigate such sensitive quantum gates, which, beyond their established use in in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and polarization optics, may offer significant utility in the other areas where selectivity, filtering, sensing, localization, or addressing properties are of interest. Utilizing the composite pulses technique, we derive three fundamental quantum gates with narrowband and passband characteristics-the X (NOT) gate, the HADAMARD gate, and gates enabling arbitrary rotations. To systematically design these composite pulse sequences, we introduce the SU(2), modified-SU(2), and regularization random search methodologies. These approaches demonstrate superior performance compared to established sequences in the literature, including NB1, SK1, and PB1.

TI Estimating Algorithmic Information Using Quantum Computing for Genomics
   Applications
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Inferring algorithmic structure in data is essential for discovering causal generative models. In this research, we present a quantum computing framework using the circuit model, for estimating algorithmic information metrics. The canonical computation model of the Turing machine is restricted in time and space resources, to make the target metrics computable under realistic assumptions. The universal prior distribution for the automata is obtained as a quantum superposition, which is further conditioned to estimate the metrics. Specific cases are explored where the quantum implementation offers polynomial advantage, in contrast to the exhaustive enumeration needed in the corresponding classical case. The unstructured output data and the computational irreducibility of Turing machines make this algorithm impossible to approximate using heuristics. Thus, exploring the space of program-output relations is one of the most promising problems for demonstrating quantum supremacy using Grover search that cannot be dequantized. Experimental use cases for quantum acceleration are developed for self-replicating programs and algorithmic complexity of short strings. With quantum computing hardware rapidly attaining technological maturity, we discuss how this framework will have significant advantage for various genomics applications in meta-biology, phylogenetic tree analysis, protein-protein interaction mapping and synthetic biology. This is the first time experimental algorithmic information theory is implemented using quantum computation. Our implementation on the Qiskit quantum programming platform is copy-left and is publicly available on GitHub.

TI Quantifying the performance of multipulse quantum sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quality of a quantum operation determines the performance of quantum information processing, such as the sensitivity of quantum sensing. Different from the fidelity of quantum operation in quantum computation, we present an effective function to evaluate the performance and diagnose the imperfection of operations in multipulse based quantum sensing. The evaluation function directly links the realistic sensitivity with intrinsic sensitivity in a simple way. Moreover, guided by this evaluation function, we optimize a composite-pulse sequence for high sensitivity nitrogen-vacancy-center based magnetometry against spectrum inhomogeneities and control errors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance by one order of magnitude. It marks an important step towards quantitative quantum sensing with imperfect quantum control in practical applications.

TI A Novel Scalable Quantum Protocol for the Dining Cryptographers Problem
SO DYNAMICS
AB This paper presents an innovative entanglement-based protocol to address the Dining Cryptographers problem, utilizing maximally entangled |GHZn > tuples as its core. This protocol aims to provide scalability in terms of both the number of cryptographers n and the amount of anonymous information conveyed, represented by the number of qubits m within each quantum register. The protocol supports an arbitrary number of cryptographers n, enabling scalability in both participant count and the volume of anonymous information transmitted. While the original Dining Cryptographers problem focused on a single bit of information-whether a cryptographer paid for dinner-the proposed protocol allows m, the number of qubits in each register, to be any arbitrarily large positive integer. This flexibility allows the transmission of additional information, such as the cost of the dinner or the timing of the arrangement. Another noteworthy aspect of the introduced protocol is its versatility in accommodating both localized and distributed versions of the Dining Cryptographers problem. The localized scenario involves all cryptographers gathering physically at the same location, such as a local restaurant, simultaneously. In contrast, the distributed scenario accommodates cryptographers situated in different places, engaging in a virtual dinner at the same time. Finally, in terms of implementation, the protocol accomplishes uniformity by requiring that all cryptographers utilize identical private quantum circuits. This design establishes a completely modular quantum system where all modules are identical. Furthermore, each private quantum circuit exclusively employs the widely used Hadamard and CNOT quantum gates, facilitating straightforward implementation on contemporary quantum computers.

TI TAQNet: Traffic-Aware Minimum-Cost Quantum Communication Network
   Planning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a secure method to exchange encrypted information between two parties in a quantum communication infrastructure (QCI). The primary challenge in deploying a QCI is the cost of using optical fibers and trusted repeater nodes (TRNs). Practical systems combine quantum and classical channels on the same fiber to reduce the cost of fibers dedicated to QKD. In such a system with quantum-classical coexistence, the optimal distribution of QKD requests with minimal deployment cost and power usage on the multiplexed links is challenging due to the diverse key rate demands of the requests, number of classical and quantum channels, guard band spacing between classical and quantum channels, and secret key rate of the quantum channels that decreases with distance. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Steiner tree-based approach for constructing a QCI that connects all quantum nodes with minimum TRNs. In addition, we propose a genetic algorithm-based solution to optimally distribute the end-to-end QKD requests over the QCI. We also determine feasible optical bypass routes to reduce the overall energy consumption in the network further. The proposed approach reduces the QCI deployment cost by 19.42% compared to the benchmark MST-Baseline. Also, on average, TAQNet with optical bypass achieves 4.69 kbit per Joule more energy efficiency compared to the nonbypass approach.

TI Robust excitation of C-band quantum dots for quantum communication
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Building a quantum internet requires efficient and reliable quantum hardware, from photonic sources to quantum repeaters and detectors, ideally operating at telecommunication wavelengths. Thanks to their high brightness and single-photon purity, quantum dot (QD) sources hold the promise to achieve high communication rates for quantum-secured network applications. Furthermore, it was recently shown that excitation schemes such as longitudinal acoustic phonon-assisted (LA) pumping provide security benefits by scrambling the coherence between the emitted photon-number states. In this work, we investigate further advantages of LA-pumped quantum dots with emission in the telecom C-band as a core hardware component of the quantum internet. We experimentally demonstrate how varying the pump power and spectral detuning with respect to the excitonic transition can improve quantum-secured communication rates and provide stable emission statistics regardless of network-environment fluctuations. These findings have significant implications for general implementations of QD single-photon sources in practical quantum communication networks. (C) 2023 Author(s).

TI High-dimensional SO(4)-symmetric Rydberg manifolds for quantum
   simulation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We develop a toolbox for manipulating arrays of Rydberg atoms prepared in high-dimensional hydrogen-like manifolds in the regime of linear Stark and Zeeman effect. We exploit the SO(4) symmetry to characterize the action of static electric and magnetic fields as well as microwave and optical fields on the well-structured manifolds of states with principal quantum number n. This enables us to construct generalized large-spin Heisenberg models for which we develop state-preparation and readout schemes. Due to the available large internal Hilbert space, these models provide a natural framework for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories, which we illustrate for the case of the sine-Gordon and massive Schwinger models. Moreover, these high-dimensional manifolds also offer the opportunity to perform quantum information processing operations for qudit-based quantum computing, which we exemplify with an entangling gate and a state-transfer protocol for the states in the neighborhood of the circular Rydberg level.

TI Quantum generative adversarial imitation learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Investigating quantum advantage in the NISQ era is a challenging problem whereas quantum machine learning becomes the most promising application that can be resorted to. However, no proposal has been investigated for arguably challenging inverse reinforcement learning to demonstrate the potential advantage. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on the variational quantum circuit with the generative adversarial framework. We find an important connection between the quantum gradient anomaly and the performance degradation, which suggest a gradient clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. In light of the algorithm, we study three classic control problems and the Hamiltonian parameter estimation in quantum sensing with shallow quantum circuits. The numerical results showcase that the control-enhanced quantum sensor can saturate quantum Cramer-Rao bound only with a single variational layer, empirically demonstrating a parameter complexity advantage over the classical learning control. The proposed generative adversarial reinforcement learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in classical and quantum sensor control in terms of required number of parameters.

TI Clustering bike sharing stations using Quantum Machine Learning: A case
   study of Toronto, Canada
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a field that combines the principles of Quantum Computing (QC) and Machine Learning (ML). QC works by taking advantage of the properties of quantum physics, such as superposition and entanglement. To fully realize the potential of this technology, more research is necessary, as the field of QML is still in its early stages. Since QC technologies and devices continue to develop quickly, it is important to identify the use cases and applications that benefit the most. This paper investigates the potentials of QC, and more specifically, Quantum Annealing (QA), for clustering real-world data in transportation systems. The Bike Sharing System (BSS) is used as a case study applying a clustering model on QA computers. The main contribution of this research is to introduce a hybrid model to cluster stations in a BSS by solving it as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) problem with different methods on a QA computer using a real-time dataset. In addition to the practical contribution, this research also offers theoretical advancements in the field of computational optimization by defining a new topology for the input data that is compatible with QC topology (e.g., Chimera topology). The goal of real-time clustering BSS stations based on dynamic and static datasets is, in fact, to assist decision-makers in better managing and minimizing the risk of bike unavailability at each station and rebalancing bikes shared. Three different methods have been used to determine the number of clusters, and Euclidean, Manhattan, Pearson, and Spearman dissimilarity functions have been applied to cluster the stations. The evaluation is done using the magnitude vs. cardinality approach. The distribution of the stations, magnitude, and cardinality of the results indicate the potential to use QC for clustering for a real-world application, e.g., BSS.

Like the logic gates in a classical processor, quantum gates serve as the fundamental building blocks for quantum processors. The main goal of the present paper is to deduce the matrix of the main one- and two-qubit quantum gates from the Schrodinger equation. The mathematical formalism is kept as comfortable as possible for electronics engineers. This paper does not cover topics such as dissipations, state density, coherence, and state purity. In a similar manner, this paper also deals with the quantum nature of a quantum processor by leveraging the concept of a finite-state machine, which is a background notion for any electronics engineer.

   networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Predicting the output of quantum circuits is a hard computational task that plays a pivotal role in the development of universal quantum computers. Here we investigate the supervised learning of output expectation values of random quantum circuits. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to predict single-qubit and two-qubit expectation values using databases of classically simulated circuits. These circuits are built using either a universal gate set or a continuous set of rotations plus an entangling gate, and they are represented via properly designed encodings of these gates. The prediction accuracy for previously unseen circuits is analyzed, also making comparisons with small-scale quantum computers available from the free IBM Quantum program. The CNNs often outperform these quantum devices, depending on the circuit depth, on the network depth, and on the training set size. Notably, our CNNs are designed to be scalable. This allows us exploiting transfer learning and performing extrapolations to circuits larger than those included in the training set. These CNNs also demonstrate remarkable resilience against noise, namely, they remain accurate even when trained on (simulated) expectation values averaged over very few measurements.

TI GPU-accelerated simulations of quantum annealing and the quantum

SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We study large-scale applications using a GPU-accelerated version of the massively parallel Julich universal quantum computer simulator (JUQCS-G). First, we benchmark JUWELS Booster, a GPU cluster with 3744 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. Then, we use JUQCS-G to study the relation between quantum annealing (QA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We find that a very coarsely discretized version of QA, termed approximate quantum annealing (AQA), performs surprisingly well in comparison to the QAOA. It can either be used to initialize the QAOA, or to avoid the costly optimization procedure altogether. Furthermore, we study the scaling of the success probability when using AQA for problems with 30 to 40 qubits. We find that the case with the largest discretization error scales most favorably, surpassing the best result obtained from the QAOA. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Characterizing Midcircuit Measurements on a Superconducting Qubit Using
   Gate Set Tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Measurements that occur within the internal layers of a quantum circuit-midcircuit measurements are a useful quantum-computing primitive, most notably for quantum error correction. Midcircuit measurements have both classical and quantum outputs, so they can be subject to error modes that do not exist for measurements that terminate quantum circuits. Here we show how to characterize midcircuit measurements, modeled by quantum instruments, using a technique that we call quantum instrument linear gate set tomography (QILGST). We then apply this technique to characterize a dispersive measurement on a superconducting transmon qubit within a multiqubit system. By varying the delay time between the measurement pulse and subsequent gates, we explore the impact of residual cavity photon population on measurement error. QILGST can resolve different error modes and quantify the total error from a measurement; in our experiment, for delay times above 1000 ns we measure a total error rate (i.e., half diamond distance) of epsilon(0) = 8.1 +/- 1.4%, a readout fidelity of 97.0 +/- 0.3%, and output quantum-state fidelities of 96.7 +/- 0.6% and 93.7 +/- 0.7% when measuring 0 and 1, respectively.

TI Channel capacity of relativistic quantum communication with rapid
   interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this work we study nonperturbatively the transmission of classical and quantum information in globally hyperbolic spacetimes, where the communication channel is between two qubit detectors interacting with a quantized massless scalar field via delta-coupling interaction. This interaction approximates very rapid detector-field interaction, effectively occurring at a single instant in time for each detector. We show that when both detectors interact via delta-coupling, one can arrange and tune the detectors so that the channel capacity is (at least) as good as the quantum channel constructed nonperturbatively using gapless detectors by Landulfo [Phys. Rev. D 93, 104019 (2016) ]. Furthermore, we prove that this channel capacity is in fact optimal, i.e., both nonperturbative methods give essentially the same channel capacity; thus there is a sense in which the two methods can be regarded as equivalent as far as relativistic quantum communication is concerned.

TI Quantum entanglement of photons on free electrons
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The quantum entanglement of photons is one of the interesting and important manifestations of the quantum world, which is already being used in quantum technologies. The study of new methods of quantum entanglement of photons is one of the promising areas of quantum optics. In this work, it is shown that photons, in a two-mode electromagnetic field, can be quantum entangled when they interact with free electrons. It is shown that the quantum entanglement of such photons can be very large and such photons can be a good source of high quantum entanglement. In addition, it is shown that free electrons can be a beam splitter for a two-mode electromagnetic field.

TI Efficient implementation of multicontrolled quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present an implementation of multicontrolled (MC) quantum gates that provides significant reductions of cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. The operator applied on the target qubit is a unitary, special unitary, or the Pauli X operator (multicontrolled Toffoli), and requires one clean ancilla, no ancilla, or one dirty ancilla, respectively. We generalize our methods for any number of target qubits, and provide further cost reductions if additional ancilla qubits are available. For each type of MC gate, we provide implementations for unrestricted (all-to-all) connectivity and for linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) connectivity. All of the methods use a linear cost of gates from the Clifford+T (fault-tolerant) set. In the context of LNN architecture, the cost and depth of our circuits scale linearly irrespective of the position of the qubits on which the gate is applied. Our methods directly improve the compilation process of many quantum algorithms, providing optimized circuits. Given the scale of our improvements, for example, the quadratic-to-linear controlled-NOT count for LNN, they will naturally result in a large reduction of errors.

AB Quantum computers promise polynomial or exponential speed-up in solving certain problems compared to classical computers. However, in practical use, there are currently a number of fundamental technical challenges. One of them concerns the loading of data into quantum computers, since they cannot access common databases. In this vision paper, we develop a hybrid data management architecture in which databases can serve as data sources for quantum algorithms. To test the architecture, we perform experiments in which we assign data points stored in a database to clusters. For cluster assignment, a quantum algorithm processes this data by determining the distances between data points and cluster centroids.

Converting the Schrodinger equation in the Madelung hydrodynamic-like form, the quantum mechanics is extended to open quantum systems by adding Ohmic friction forces. The dissipative evolution confirms the correlation decay over time, but a new integral of motion is discovered, being appropriate for storing everlasting quantum information.

TI Parallel trusted node approach for satellite quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) via satellite links is widely regarded as a viable near-term solution to create quantum-backed secure communication at a global scale. To achieve intercontinental coverage with available technology one must adopt a "flying trusted node" paradigm, in which users fully trust the satellite platform. Here, inspired by the concept of distributed secret sharing and the imminent projected launch of several QKD-equipped satellites, we propose a parallel trusted node approach, in which key distribution is mediated by several satellites in parallel. This has the effect of distributing the trust, removing single points of failure and reducing the necessary assumptions. In addition, we discuss the versatility that an optical ground station should provide to execute such a protocol and, in general, to be fully integrated into a multi-party global quantum network.

TI Usefulness of adaptive strategies in asymptotic quantum channel
   discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Adaptiveness is a key principle in information processing including statistics and machine learning. We investigate the usefulness adaptive methods in the framework of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel and observing outputs. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is a fundamental distinction between adaptive and nonadaptive strategies with respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test strategies. The following results are obtained: (1) We prove that for classical-quantum channels, adaptive and nonadaptive strategies lead to the same error exponents both in the symmetric (Chernoff) and asymmetric (Hoeffding, Stein) settings. (2) The first separation between adaptive and nonadaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for nonadaptive strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking channels. (3) We prove, in some sense generalizing the previous statement, that for general channels adaptive strategies restricted to classical feed-forward and product state channel inputs are not superior in the asymptotic limit to nonadaptive product state strategies. (4) As an application of our findings, we address the discrimination power of an arbitrary quantum channel and show that adaptive strategies with classical feedback and no quantum memory at the input do not increase the discrimination power of the channel beyond nonadaptive tensor product input strategies.

AB Quantum key agreement requires all participants to recover the shared key together, so it is crucial to resist the participant attack. In this paper, we propose a verifiable multi-party quantum key agreement protocol based on the six-qubit cluster states. A verifiable distributor who preserves some subsequences of the six-qubit cluster states is introduced into this protocol, thus the participants cannot obtain the shared key in advance. Besides, the correctness and simultaneity of the shared key are guaranteed by the trusted design combiner and homomorphic hash function. Furthermore, the security analysis shows that the new protocol can resist the external and internal attacks.

TI Development of a Boston-area 50-km fiber quantum network testbed
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Distributing quantum information between remote systems will necessitate the integration of emerging quantum components with existing communication infrastructure. This requires understanding the channel -induced degradations of the transmitted quantum signals, beyond the typical characterization methods for classical communication systems. Here we report on a comprehensive characterization of a Boston -Area Quantum Network (BARQNET) telecom fiber testbed, measuring the time -of -flight, polarization, and phase noise imparted on transmitted signals. We further design and demonstrate a compensation system that is both resilient to these noise sources and compatible with integration of emerging quantum memory components on the deployed link. These results have utility for future work on the BARQNET as well as other quantum network testbeds in development, enabling near -term quantum networking demonstrations and informing what areas of technology development will be most impactful in advancing future system capabilities.

TI The Mathematical Foundation of Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO RESEARCH
AB In 1994, P. Shor discovered quantum algorithms that can break both the RSA cryptosystem and the ElGamal cryptosystem. In 2007, a Canadian company D-Wave demonstrated the first quantum computer. These events and quick further developments have brought a crisis to secret communication. In 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced 4 candidates-CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and Sphincs+-for post-quantum cryptography standards. The first 3 are based on lattice theory and the last on Hash functions. In 2024, NIST announced 3 standards: FIPS 203 based on CRYSTALS-Kyber, FIPS 204 based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and FIPS 205 based on Sphincs+. The fourth standard based on Falcon is on the way. It is well known that the security of the lattice-based cryptosystems relies on the hardness of the shortest vector problem (SVP), the closest vector problem (CVP), and their generalizations. In fact, the SVP is a ball packing problem and the CVP is a ball covering problem. Furthermore, both SVP and CVP are equivalent to arithmetic problems for positive definite quadratic forms. There are several books and survey papers dealing with the computational complexity of the lattice-based cryptography for classical computers. However, there is no review article to demonstrate the mathematical foundation of the complexity theory. This paper will briefly introduce post-quantum cryptography and demonstrate its mathematical roots in ball packing, ball covering, and positive definite quadratic forms.

TI A quantum-network register assembled with optical tweezers in an optical

SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum computation and quantum communication are expected to provide users with capabilities inaccessible by classical physics. However, scalability to larger systems with many qubits is challenging. One solution is to develop a quantum network consisting of small-scale quantum registers containing computation qubits that are reversibly interfaced to communication qubits. In this study, we report on a register that uses both optical tweezers and optical lattices to deterministically assemble a two-dimensional array of atoms in an optical cavity. Harnessing a single atom-addressing beam, we stimulate the emission of a photon from each atom and demonstrate multiplexed atom-photon entanglement with a generation-to-detection efficiency approaching 90%. Combined with cavity-mediated quantum logic, our approach provides a possible route to distributed quantum information processing.

TI Mitigation of microwave crosstalk with parameterized single-qubit gate

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In superconducting qubit systems, microwave crosstalk among the qubit control lines is a prominent source of errors for gate operations, particularly when implemented simultaneously in a multiqubit system. In this work, we present an experimental study of crosstalk mitigation for the case of single-qubit gate operation, which involves the universal U3 gate decomposition into two X(pi/2 )gates and three virtual Z gates. We demonstrate that by optimizing the virtual Z gate parameters, the crosstalk can be effectively mitigated, with the single-qubit gate fidelity recovered to the level comparable to that in the absence of crosstalk.

AB Hyper-entanglement between two or more photonic degrees of freedom (DOF) can enhance and enable new quantum protocols by allowing each DOF to perform the task it is optimally suited for. Here we demonstrate the generation of photon pairs hyper-entangled between pulse modes and frequency bins. The pulse modes are generated via parametric downconversion in a domain-engineered crystal and subsequently entangled to two frequency bins via a spectral mapping technique. The resulting hyper-entangled state is characterized and verified via measurement of its joint spectral intensity and non-classical two-photon interference patterns from which we infer its spectral phase. The protocol combines the robustness to loss, intrinsic high dimensionality and compatibility with standard fiber-optic networks of the energy-time DOF with the ability of hyper-entanglement to increase the capacity and efficiency of the quantum channel, already exploited in recent experimental applications in both quantum information and quantum computation.

AB Each day more and more data is produced by different sources including humans and machines, and they are stored mainly in Cloud Service Providers (CSP) in huge data storages known as big data or data lakes. Many situations warrant users to spread their data in a distributed way between the different CSP. When this happens, they have to relay the inter-cloud communication security to each cloud vendor. This can cause data leakage in the transmission channel thereby compromise information security. Quantum computing has shown some promises to address this issue. One well known algorithm in quantum cryptography is the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. This enables the sender and receiver of a message to know when a third party eavesdropped any data from the insecure quantum channel. There are studies integrating this QKD protocol with cloud storage and data transmission inside one CSP. However, there is no research that studies the data lake security concern for distributed multi-cloud communications taking advantage of quantum mechanisms. This research proposal aims to address this gap in distributed data lake security by using the QKD protocol in the multi-cloud distributed data transmission. The achieved results show over 91% detection of eavesdropping cases and over 99% correct authorisation detection in multi-cloud environments.

TI Representation Matching For Remote Quantum Computing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Many quantum computational tasks have inherent symmetries, suggesting a path to enhancing their efficiency and performance. Exploiting this observation, we propose representation matching, a generic probabilistic protocol for reducing the cost of quantum computation in a quantum network. We show that the representation-matching protocol is capable of reducing the communication or memory cost to almost the minimum in various tasks, including remote execution of unitary gate arrays, permutation gates, and unitary conjugation, as well as the storage and retrieval of unitary gates.

TI A Step-by-Step HHL Algorithm Walkthrough to Enhance Understanding of
   Critical Quantum Computing Concepts
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB After learning basic quantum computing concepts, it is desirable to reinforce the learning using an important and relatively complex algorithm through which students can observe and appreciate how qubits evolve and interact with each other. Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm, which can solve linear system problems with exponential speed-up over the classical method and is the basis of many important quantum computing algorithms, is used to serve this purpose. The HHL algorithm is explained analytically followed by a 4-qubit numerical example in bra-ket notation. Matlab code corresponding to the numerical example is available for students to gain a deeper understanding of the HHL algorithm from a pure matrix point of view. A quantum circuit programmed using qiskit is also provided for real hardware execution in IBM quantum computers. After going through the material, students are expected to have a better appreciation of the concepts such as basis transformation, bra-ket and matrix representations, superposition, entanglement, controlled operations, measurement, quantum Fourier transformation, quantum phase estimation, and quantum programming. To help readers review these basic concepts, brief explanations augmented by the HHL numerical examples in the main text are provided in the Appendix.

AB By leveraging quantum-mechanical properties like superposition, entanglement, and interference, quantum computing (QC) offers promising solutions for problems that classical computing has not been able to solve efficiently, such as drug discovery, cryptography, and physical simulation. Unfortunately, adopting QC remains difficult for potential users like QC beginners and application-specific domain experts, due to limited theoretical and practical knowledge, the lack of integrated interface-wise support, and poor documentation. For example, to use quantum computers, one has to convert conceptual logic into low-level codes, analyze quantum program results, and share programs and results. To support the wider adoption of QC, we, as designers and QC experts, propose interaction techniques for QC through design iterations. These techniques include writing quantum codes conceptually, comparing initial quantum programs with optimized programs, sharing quantum program results, and exploring quantum machines. We demonstrate the feasibility and utility of these techniques via use cases with high-fidelity prototypes.

TI Efficient realization of quantum primitives for Shor's algorithm using
   PennyLane library
SO PLOS ONE
AB Efficient realization of quantum algorithms is among main challenges on the way towards practical quantum computing. Various libraries and frameworks for quantum software engineering have been developed. Here we present a software package containing implementations of various quantum gates and well-known quantum algorithms using PennyLane library. Additoinally, we used a simplified technique for decomposition of algorithms into a set of gates which are native for trapped-ion quantum processor and realized this technique using PennyLane library. The decomposition is used to analyze resources required for an execution of Shor's algorithm on the level of native operations of trapped-ion quantum computer. Our original contribution is the derivation of coefficients needed for implementation of the decomposition. Templates within the package include all required elements from the quantum part of Shor's algorithm, specifically, efficient modular exponentiation and quantum Fourier transform that can be realized for an arbitrary number of qubits specified by a user. All the qubit operations are decomposed into elementary gates realized in PennyLane library. Templates from the developed package can be used as qubit-operations when defining a QNode.

TI Phase flip code with semiconductor spin qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The fault-tolerant operation of logical qubits is an important requirement for realizing a universal quantum computer. Spin qubits based on quantum dots have great potential to be scaled to large numbers because of their compatibility with standard semiconductor manufacturing. Here, we show that a quantum error correction code can be implemented using a four-qubit array in germanium. We demonstrate a resonant SWAP gate and by combining controlled-Z and controlled-S-1 gates we construct a Toffoli-like three-qubit gate. We execute a two-qubit phase flip code and find that we can preserve the state of the data qubit by applying a refocusing pulse to the ancilla qubit. In addition, we implement a phase flip code on three qubits, making use of a Toffoli-like gate for the final correction step. Both the quality and quantity of the qubits will require significant improvement to achieve fault-tolerance. However, the capability to implement quantum error correction codes enables co-design development of quantum hardware and software, where codes tailored to the properties of spin qubits and advances in fabrication and operation can now come together to advance semiconductor quantum technology.

   correlation of system states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Optimal measurement is required to obtain the quantum and classical correlations of a quantum state, and the crucial difficulty is how to acquire the maximal information about one system by measuring the other part; in other words, getting the maximum information corresponds to preparing the best measurement operators. Within a general setup, we designed a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to achieve classical and quantum correlations for system states under the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum technology. To employ, first, we map the density matrix to the vector representation, which displays it in a doubled Hilbert space, and it is converted to a pure state. Then, we apply the measurement operators to a part of the subsystem and use variational principle and a classical optimization for the determination of the amount of correlation. We numerically test the performance of our algorithm at finding a correlation of some density matrices, and the output of our algorithm is compatible with the exact calculation.

TI Lattice Surgery for Dummies
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) plays a crucial role in correcting noise and paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum computing. This field has seen significant advancements, with new quantum error correction codes emerging regularly to address errors effectively. Among these, topological codes, particularly surface codes, stand out for their low error thresholds and feasibility for implementation in large-scale quantum computers. However, these codes are restricted to encoding a single qubit. Lattice surgery is crucial for enabling interactions among multiple encoded qubits or between the lattices of a surface code, ensuring that its sophisticated error-correcting features are maintained without significantly increasing the operational overhead. Lattice surgery is pivotal for scaling QECCs across more extensive quantum systems. Despite its critical importance, comprehending lattice surgery is challenging due to its inherent complexity, demanding a deep understanding of intricate quantum physics and mathematical concepts. This paper endeavors to demystify lattice surgery, making it accessible to those without a profound background in quantum physics or mathematics. This work explores surface codes, introduces the basics of lattice surgery, and demonstrates its application in building quantum gates and emulating multi-qubit circuits.

TI Phonon engineering of atomic-scale defects in superconducting quantum
   circuits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Noise within solid-state systems at low temperatures can typically be traced back to material defects. In amorphous materials, these defects are broadly described by the tunneling two-level systems (TLSs) model. TLS have recently taken on further relevance in quantum computing because they dominate the coherence limit of superconducting quantum circuits. Efforts to mitigate TLS impacts have thus far focused on circuit design, material selection, and surface treatments. Our work takes an approach that directly modifies TLS properties. This is achieved by creating an acoustic bandgap that suppresses all microwave-frequency phonons around the operating frequency of a transmon qubit. For embedded TLS strongly coupled to the transmon qubit, we measure a pronounced increase in relaxation time by two orders of magnitude, with the longest T1 time exceeding 5 milliseconds. Our work opens avenues for studying the physics of highly coherent TLS and methods for mitigating noise within solid-state quantum devices.

TI Line-Graph Qubit Routing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB One limitation of current quantum hardware is the restricted connectivity between qubits, as described by the hardware's coupling graph. To overcome this limitation, efficient qubit routing strategies are necessary. We introduce line-graph qubit routing, which routes circuits defined on line graphs to hardware with a heavy coupling graph. We implement line-graph qubit routing and demonstrate its effectiveness in mapping quantum circuits defined kagome, checkerboard, and shuriken lattices to hardware with heavy-hex, heavy-square, and heavy-square-octagon coupling graphs, respectively. Benchmarking shows the ability of line-graph qubit routing to outperform established general-purpose methods in a fraction of the computational time, while offering a depth reduction by up to a factor of 5. Line-graph qubit routing has direct applications in the quantum simulation of lattice-based models, serves as a suitable benchmark for other routing methods, and aids the exploration of the capabilities of near-term quantum hardware.

TI Implementing semiclassical Szegedy walks in classical-quantum circuits
   for homomorphic encryption
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB As cloud services continue to expand, the security of private data stored and processed in these environments has become paramount. This work delves into quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE), an emerging technology that facilitates secure computation on encrypted quantum data without revealing the underlying information. We reinterpret QHE schemes through classical-quantum circuits (CQC), enhancing efficiency and addressing previous limitations related to key computations. Our approach eliminates the need for exponential key preparation by calculating keys in real-time during simulation, leading to a linear complexity in classically controlled gates. We also investigate the T/T dagger-gate complexity associated with various quantum walks, particularly Szegedy quantum and semiclassical algorithms, demonstrating efficient homomorphic implementations across different graph structures. Our simulations, conducted in Qiskit, validate the effectiveness of QHE for both standard and semiclassical walks. The rules for the homomorphic evaluation of the reset and intermediate measurement operations have also been included to perform the QHE of semiclassical walks. Additionally, we introduce the CQC-QHE library, a comprehensive tool that simplifies the construction and simulation of CQC tailored for QHE. Future work will focus on optimizing classical functions within this framework and exploring broader graph types to enhance QHE applications in practical scenarios.

AB Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER) was recently proposed as a fast and robust single-qubit gate mechanism in 87Sr. Here, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that ONER can be extended to single-qudit control, addressing multiple one-level hyperfine transitions within the ten-dimensional nuclear-spin manifold. We identify suitable operating regimes and show that ONER enables high-fidelity spin manipulations, with simulated pi-gate fidelities exceeding 99.9%, while maintaining coherence under realistic parameter fluctuations. These results establish a proof of principle for optical qudit control in 87Sr and delineate practical parameter ranges for future experiments, highlighting ONER as a promising pathway toward high-dimensional quantum information processing.

TI Characterizing privacy in quantum machine learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Ensuring data privacy in machine learning models is critical, especially in distributed settings where model gradients are shared among multiple parties for collaborative learning. Motivated by the increasing success of recovering input data from the gradients of classical models, this study investigates the analogous challenge for variational quantum circuits (VQC) as quantum machine learning models. We highlight the crucial role of the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) in determining privacy vulnerabilities. While the DLA has been linked to the trainability and simulatability of VQC models, we establish its connection to privacy for the first time. We show that properties conducive to VQC trainability, such as a polynomial-sized DLA, also facilitate extracting detailed snapshots of the input, posing a weak privacy breach. We further investigate conditions for a strong privacy breach, where original input data can be recovered from snapshots by classical or quantum-assisted methods. We establish properties of the encoding map, such as classical simulatability, overlap with DLA basis, and its Fourier frequency characteristics that enable such a privacy breach of VQC models. Our framework thus guides the design of quantum machine learning models, balancing trainability and robust privacy protection.

TI Error Correction of Quantum Reference Frame Information
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The existence of quantum error-correcting codes is one of the most counterintuitive and potentially technologically important discoveries of quantum-information theory. In this paper, we study a problem called "covariant quantum error correction", in which the encoding is required to be group covariant. This problem is intimately tied to fault-tolerant quantum computation and the well-known Eastin-Knill theorem. We show that this problem is equivalent to the problem of encoding reference-frame information. In standard quantum error correction, one seeks to protect abstract quantum information, i.e., information that is independent of the physical incarnation of the systems used for storing the information. There are, however, other forms of information that are physical-one of the most ubiquitous being reference-frame information. The basic question we seek to answer is whether or not error correction of physical information is possible and, if so, what limitations govern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for transmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them, must necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that obey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. Equivalently, there may not exist covariant quantum error-correcting codes. Indeed, we prove a no-go theorem showing that no finite-dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes exist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator [e.g., U(1), SU(2), and SO(3)]. We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using infinite-dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant quantum error-correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1). Finally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite-dimensional codes, giving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction with exponentially better parameters. Our results imply that one can, in principle, circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem.

TI Quantum information science and technology high school outreach:
   Conceptual progression for introducing principles and programming skills
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB National data have shown the need to expand and diversify the talent pool of the quantum technologies workforce. This article describes a newly designed 25-h summer quantum information science and technology (QIST) program for high school students in grades 10-12; the goal is to advance physical science literacy and diversify the STEM pipeline through novel quantum science and quantum computing access and learning. This partnership between Stony Brook University and the New York Hall of Science was designed by quantum physicists and physics education researchers. This manuscript describes the rationale and progression of quantum ideas and computing skills introduced in the outreach program. The program design scaffolded physics, mathematics, and computer science concepts to engage high school students in the excitement of quantum information science and technology fields. The disciplinary content included the limitations of classical computing, classical and quantum physics principles (diffraction, polarization, wave-particle duality), the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, superposition, quantum thought experiments (Schrodinger's cat and Wigner's friend), entanglement and Bell's inequality, quantum key distribution, and basic quantum computing skills. Students also spent time visiting laboratories and museum exhibits and learning about academic progressions and career pathways in quantum technologies. This university-based science outreach model may be replicated by other quantum educators and adapted for learning in formal contexts.

We describe quantum circuits and convey an understanding of their inherent combinatorial nature and the exponential blow-up that makes them hard to analyze. Then, we show how weighted model counting (#SAT) can be used to solve hard analysis tasks for quantum circuits.
   This tutorial is aimed at everyone in the formal methods community with an interest in quantum computing. Familiarity with quantum computing is not required, but basic linear algebra knowledge (particularly matrix multiplication and basis vectors) is a prerequisite.

TI Fast Quantum Gates with Electric Field Pulses and Optical Tweezers in

SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a two-qubit phase gate based on trapped ions that uses fast electric field pulses and spin-dependent local traps generated by optical tweezers. The phases are engineered by spin-dependent coherent evolution, interspersed with momentum kicks. We derive a set of commensurability conditions and expressions for the spin-dependent accumulated phase that, when satisfied, realize the target two-qubit phase gate within tens of microseconds. We study the scalability of our proposal in larger-ion crystals and demonstrate the existence of solutions with up to four ions. Gates in larger crystals should also be possible but will require more commensurability conditions to be fulfilled.

TI Request Scheduling in Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum networking is emerging as a new research area to explore the opportunities of interconnecting quantum systems through end-to-end entanglement of qubits at geographical distance via quantum repeaters. A promising architecture has been proposed in the literature that decouples entanglement between adjacent quantum nodes/repeaters from establishing end-to-end paths by adopting a time slotted approach. Within this model, we destructure further end-to-end path establishment into two subproblems: path selection and scheduling. The former is set to determine the best repeaters to connect two end nodes, provided that all their local entanglements have succeeded. On the other hand, scheduling is concerned with deciding, which pairs of end nodes are served in the current time slot, while the others remain queued for later time slots. Unlike path selection, scheduling has not been investigated so far in the literature, particularly in presence of quantum noise, which makes both problems even more challenging. In this article, we propose to address it via a general framework of heuristic algorithms, for which we propose three illustrative instances with the objective of keeping the application delay small while achieving a good system utilization, in terms of high entanglement rate and fidelity of remotely entangled qubits. The system proposed is evaluated extensively via event-driven quantum network simulations, with noisy repeaters, in different node topologies under a Poisson arrival of requests from quantum applications. The results show the existence of a fundamental tradeoff between system- and application-level metrics, such as fairness versus entanglement and fidelity, which lays the foundations for further studies in this thriving research area.

TI Quantum Computing in Finance: Regulatory Readiness, Legal Gaps, and the
   Future of Secure Tech Innovation
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB Quantum computing is rapidly advancing from a theoretical possibility to a transformative force in financial systems. With its high-dimensional computational capacity, quantum technology is promising for enhancing risk modelling, fraud detection and transaction efficiency. However, it also seriously threatens cryptographic security, regulatory coherence and systemic stability. This paper critically analyses the risks introduced by cryptographically relevant quantum computers and assesses the readiness of legal and institutional frameworks to respond. Focusing on the UK financial regulatory environment, the study proposes a quantum-safe integration roadmap grounded in post-quantum cryptography, adaptive regulatory models and sector-wide governance strategies. The paper argues for anticipatory regulation that embeds enforceable standards and strategic collaboration across public and private stakeholders through an interdisciplinary approach combining legal analysis and financial risk modelling. The UK's leadership in quantum policy positions it to shape international norms in secure quantum adoption. Finally, the paper offers an analytical framework to ensure that quantum innovation reinforces rather than destabilises data integrity, financial resilience and public trust.

TI Modeling and Simulation of a Quantum Thermal Noise on the Qubit
SO FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS
AB Quantum noise or decoherence is a major factor impacting the performance of quantum technologies. On the qubit, an important quantum noise, often relevant in practice, is the thermal noise or generalized amplitude damping noise, describing the interaction with a thermal bath at an arbitrary temperature. A qubit thermal noise however cannot be modeled nor directly simulated with a few elementary Pauli operators, but instead requires specific operators. Our main goal here is to construct a circuit model for simulating the thermal noise from standard elementary qubit operators. Starting from a common quantum-operation model based on Kraus operators and an associated qubit-environment model, we derive a proper Stinespring dilated representation for the thermal noise. This dilated unitary model is then decomposed in terms of simple elementary qubit operators, and converted into a circuit based on elementary quantum gates. We arrive at our targeted simulator circuit for the thermal noise, coming with built-in easy control on the noise parameters. The noise simulator is then physically implemented and tested on an IBM-Q quantum processor. The simulator represents a useful addition to existing libraries of quantum circuits for quantum processors, and it offers a new tool for investigating quantum signal and information processing having to cope with thermal noise.

TI Opportunities and challenges of quantum computing for climate modeling
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SCIENCE
AB Adaptation to climate change requires robust climate projections, yet the uncertainty in these projections performed by ensembles of Earth system models (ESMs) remains large. This is mainly due to uncertainties in the representation of subgrid-scale processes such as turbulence or convection that are partly alleviated at higher resolution. New developments in machine learning-based hybrid ESMs demonstrate great potential for systematically reduced errors compared to traditional ESMs. Building on the work of hybrid (physics + AI) ESMs, we here discuss the additional potential of further improving and accelerating climate models with quantum computing. We discuss how quantum computers could accelerate climate models by solving the underlying differential equations faster, how quantum machine learning could better represent subgrid-scale phenomena in ESMs even with currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, how quantum algorithms aimed at solving optimization problems could assist in tuning the many parameters in ESMs, a currently time-consuming and challenging process, and how quantum computers could aid in the analysis of climate models. We also discuss hurdles and obstacles facing current quantum computing paradigms. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and quantum computing experts could help overcome these hurdles and harness the potential of quantum computing for this urgent topic.

TI Validating large-scale quantum machine learning: efficient simulation of
   quantum support vector machines using tensor networks
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present an efficient tensor-network-based approach for simulating large-scale quantum circuits exemplified by quantum support vector machines (QSVMs). Experimentally, leveraging the cuTensorNet library on multiple GPUs, our method effectively reduces the exponential runtime growth to near-quadratic scaling with respect to the number of qubits in practical scenarios. Traditional state-vector simulations become computationally infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits; in contrast, our simulator successfully handles QSVMs with up to 784 qubits, executing simulations within seconds on a single high-performance GPU. Furthermore, utilizing the message passing interface for multi-GPU environments, our method demonstrates strong linear scalability, effectively decreasing computation time as dataset sizes increase. We validate our framework using the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving successful multiclass classification and highlighting the potential of QSVMs for high-dimensional data analysis. By integrating tensor-network techniques with advanced high-performance computing resources, this work demonstrates both the feasibility and scalability of simulating large-qubit quantum machine learning models, providing a valuable validation tool within the emerging Quantum-HPC ecosystem.

TI Graph state extraction from two-dimensional cluster states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose schemes to extract arbitrary graph states from two-dimensional cluster states by locally manipulating the qubits solely via single-qubit measurements. We introduce graph state manipulation tools that allow one to increase the local vertex degree and to merge subgraphs. We utilize these tools together with the previously introduced zipper scheme that generates multiple edges between distant vertices to extract the desired graph state from a two-dimensional cluster state. We show how to minimize overheads by avoiding multiple edges, and compare with a local manipulation strategy based on measurement-based quantum computation together with transport. These schemes have direct applications in entanglement-based quantum networks, sensor networks, and distributed quantum computing in general.

   learning-assisted quantum architecture search
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In the field of quantum computing, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a pivotal category of quantum solutions across a broad spectrum of applications. These algorithms demonstrate significant potential for realising quantum computational advantage. A fundamental aspect of VQAs involves formulating expressive and efficient quantum circuits (namely ansatz), and automating the search of such ansatz is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). Recently reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is utilized to automate the search for ansatzes, know as RL-QAS. This study investigates RL-QAS for crafting ansatz tailored to the variational quantum state diagonalisation problem. Our investigation includes a comprehensive analysis of various dimensions, such as the entanglement thresholds of the resultant states, the impact of initial conditions on the performance of RL-agent, the phase transition behaviour of correlation in concurrence bounds, and the discrete contributions of qubits in deducing eigenvalues through conditional entropy metrics. We leverage these insights to devise an entanglement-guided admissible ansatz in QAS to diagonalise random quantum states using optimal resources. Furthermore, the methodologies presented herein offer a generalised framework for constructing reward functions within RL-QAS applicable to variational quantum algorithms.

TI Recycling reflections for perfect photon capture

We introduce a two-pass "pitch-and-catch" method that recycles initial reflections to achieve perfect capture of arbitrary pulses in the noiseless regime and enhances fidelity under intrinsic losses. The method extends to photon emission, enabling arbitrary pulse shaping. This advance offers significant improvements for quantum repeaters, memories, and transduction, enhancing the toolkit for quantum information processing.

TI Equivalence Checking of Quantum Circuits With the ZX-Calculus
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB As state-of-the-art quantum computers are capable of running increasingly complex algorithms, the need for automated methods to design and test potential applications rises. Equivalence checking of quantum circuits is an important, yet hardly automated, task in the development of the quantum software stack. Recently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely different perspectives. One of them is based on the ZX-calculus, a graphical rewriting system for quantum computing. However, the power and capability of this equivalence checking method has barely been explored. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ZX-calculus as a tool for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. To this end, it is demonstrated how the ZX-calculus based approach for equivalence checking can be expanded in order to verify the results of compilation flows and optimizations on quantum circuits. It is also shown that the ZX-calculus based method is not complete-especially for quantum circuits with ancillary qubits. In order to properly evaluate the proposed method, we conduct a detailed case study by comparing it to two other state-of-the-art methods for equivalence checking: one based on path-sums and another based on decision diagrams. The proposed methods have been integrated into the publicly available QCEC tool (https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec) which is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT).

TI Quantum error correction with an Ising machine under circuit-level noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient decoding to estimate error locations from outcomes of syndrome measurements is the prerequisite for quantum error correction. Decoding in the presence of circuit-level noise including measurement errors should be considered in case of actual quantum computing devices. In this paper, we develop a decoder for circuit-level noise that solves the error estimation problems as Ising-type optimization problems. We confirm that the threshold theorem in the surface code under circuit-level noise is reproduced with an error threshold of approximately 0.4%. We also demonstrate the advantage of the decoder through which the Y error detection rate can be improved compared with other matching-based decoders. Our results reveal that a lower logical error rate can be obtained using our algorithm compared with that of the minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm.

TI Unlocking early fault-tolerant quantum computing with mitigated magic
   dilution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime, quantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and enabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits will initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks like magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle rotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these constraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an approach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error mitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded magic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis techniques in the number of noisy encoded magic states required for square lattices up to size 8x8. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage that is quantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements for small-angle rotations over classical simulators. This work paves the way for early fault-tolerant demonstrations on devices supporting millions of quantum operations, the so-called MegaQuOp regime.

TI Cyclic quantum annealing: searching for deep low-energy states in
   5000-qubit spin glass
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computers promise a qualitative speedup in solving a broad spectrum of practical optimization problems. The latter can be mapped onto the task of finding low-energy states of spin glasses, which is known to be exceedingly difficult. Using D-Wave's 5000-qubit quantum processor, we demonstrate that a recently proposed iterative cyclic quantum annealing algorithm can find deep low-energy states in record time. We also find intricate structures in a low-energy landscape of spin glasses, such as a power-law distribution of connected clusters with a small surface energy. These observations offer guidance for further improvement of the optimization algorithms.

TI RF simulation platform of qubit control using FDSOI technology for
   quantum computing
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB In this paper, we report on simulations of an Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) RF control line for semiconductor electron spin qubits. The simulation includes both the ESR line characteristics (geometry and configuration, stack and material properties) and the electromagnetic (EM) environment at the vicinity of the qubits such as gates and interconnect network. With the accurate assessment of the magnetic and electric field distribution, we found that the EM environment of the qubits contributes significantly to the ESR line efficiency for spin control characterized by the magnetic over electric field ratio generated at the qubit location.

TI Quantum Contextual Hypergraphs, Operators, Inequalities, and
   Applications in Higher Dimensions
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum contextuality plays a significant role in supporting quantum computation and quantum information theory. The key tools for this are the Kochen-Specker and non-Kochen-Specker contextual sets. Traditionally, their representation has been predominantly operator-based, mainly focusing on specific constructs in dimensions ranging from three to eight. However, nearly all of these constructs can be represented as low-dimensional hypergraphs. This study demonstrates how to generate contextual hypergraphs in any dimension using various methods, particularly those that do not scale in complexity with increasing dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce innovative examples of hypergraphs extending to dimension 32. Our methodology reveals the intricate structural properties of hypergraphs, enabling precise quantifications of contextuality. Additionally, we investigate several promising applications of hypergraphs in quantum communication and quantum computation, paving the way for future breakthroughs in the field.

TI A Quantum-Enhanced Artificial Neural Network Model for Efficient Medical
   Image Compression
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The ability to effectively store and transmit high-resolution images such as MRI and CT scans without losing quality is critical to modernizing medical imaging. Traditional compression methods risk losing essential medical image data, which requires perfect detail for diagnosis. Quantum algorithms use superposition and entanglement to compress faster while preserving important information. This research presents a Quantum-enhanced Artificial Neural Network (QANN) model that combines quantum feature extraction with classical neural network topologies to improve image compression. Our approach consists of converting standardized classical data into quantum states, controlling these states using parameterized quantum circuits, and measuring the resulting states to produce enhanced feature vectors. The quantum-enhanced features are fed into a traditional neural network for image compression. The experimental results clearly show that our QANN framework outperforms standard models in terms of accurate reconstructed images, reduced size, and increased space-saving percentage, especially when dealing with large and complicated datasets. The QANN model demonstrates how quantum computing can significantly enhance the effectiveness of medical image processing solutions. Kaggle brain CT and MRI datasets and COVID-CXNet chest x-ray images are used. The proposed QANN model improves peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM). Using quantum technology, the image size is reduced for MRI (73.3 %), X-ray (74.1%), and CT-SCAN (71.8%) to save space.

TI Securing the future internet of things with post-quantum cryptography
SO SECURITY AND PRIVACY
AB Traditional and lightweight cryptography primitives and protocols are insecure against quantum attacks. Thus, a real-time application using traditional or lightweight cryptography primitives and protocols does not ensure full-proof security. Post-quantum cryptography is important for the Internet of things (IoT) due to its security against quantum attacks. This paper offers a broad literature analysis of post-quantum cryptography for IoT networks, including the challenges and research directions to adopt in real-time applications. The work draws focus towards post-quantum cryptosystems that are useful for resource-constraint devices. Further, those quantum attacks are surveyed, which may occur over traditional and lightweight cryptographic primitives.

TI Efficiently Characterizing the Quantum Information Flow, Loss, and
   Recovery in the Central Spin System
SO ENTROPY
AB Understanding the flow, loss, and recovery of the information between a system and its environment is essential for advancing quantum technologies. The central spin system serves as a useful model for a single qubit, offering valuable insights into how quantum systems can be manipulated and protected from decoherence. This work uses the stimulated echo experiment to track the information flow between the central spin and its environment, providing a direct measure of the sensitivity of system/environment correlations to environmental dynamics. The extent of mixing and the growth of correlations are quantified through autocorrelation functions of the noise and environmental dynamics, which also enable the estimation of nested commutators between the system/environment and environmental Hamiltonians. Complementary decoupling experiments offer a straightforward measure of the strength of the system Hamiltonians. The approach is experimentally demonstrated on a spin system.

TI Scalable Authenticated Group Key Establishment in Quantum and
   Post-Quantum Networks
SO INFORMATICA
AB Establishing secure keys over untrusted networks is one of the most fundamental cryptographic tasks. While two-party key establishment protocols are available for many scenarios, even offering resistance to potential adversaries equipped with quantum computing resources, the multiparty scenario is not as well understood. In particular, there is a need to find designs that can make the most of the technologies available to each party involved in a cooperative n-party key establishment. We propose an authenticated key establishment protocol involving n >= 2 parties, assuming that some-possibly all-network nodes have the potential to implement quantum key distribution (in pairs), while others only have access to standard technology. The protocol allows for the cooperative construction of a shared secret key from partial keys established by quantum and post-quantum solutions, which in turn can be implemented by different building blocks. We give a formal security analysis of our proposal using a hybrid security model simultaneously capturing quantum and classical actions and capabilities.

TI Secure delegated quantum computation based on Z-rotation encryption
SO EPL
AB Quantum computing on encrypted data allows a client Who has limited quantum capacity to delegate his or her private computation to an untrusted quantum server, while the input and output are encrypted by the quantum one-time pad and only the client can correctly decrypt them. Generally, the client is required to have ability to prepare some single qubits and perform some basic gates. In this work, we consider a further restricted situation where the client can only prepare one single qubit and perform one basic gate. Specifically, we show that as long as the client can prepare a fixed qubit vertical bar+> and perform a fixed phase gate P, then he or she can still achieve the secure delegated quantum computation. Besides, our protocol can provide a more rigorous security for any quantum computation. For example, even if some encryption keys about the computation are leaked, it can still guarantee the privacy of the input and output. Finally, our protocol experimentally has a great significance in reducing the device complexity of the client's side. Copyright (C) 2022 The author(s)

TI Entanglement-assisted quantum communication with simple measurements
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Dense coding is the seminal example of how entanglement can boost qubit communication, from sending one bit to sending two bits. This is made possible by projecting separate particles onto a maximally entangled basis. We investigate more general communication tasks, in both theory and experiment, and show that simpler measurements enable strong and sometimes even optimal entanglement-assisted qubit communication protocols. Using only partial Bell state analysers for two qubits, we demonstrate quantum correlations that cannot be simulated with two bits of classical communication. Then, we show that there exists an established and operationally meaningful task for which product measurements are sufficient for the strongest possible quantum predictions based on a maximally entangled two-qubit state. Our results reveal that there are scenarios in which the power of entanglement in enhancing quantum communication can be harvested in simple and scalable optical experiments.

TI Logical qubit implementation for quantum annealing: augmented Lagrangian
   approach
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Solving optimization problems on quantum annealers (QA) usually requires each variable of the problem to be represented by a connected set of qubits called a logical qubit or a chain. Chain weights, in the form of ferromagnetic coupling between the chain qubits, are applied so that the physical qubits in a chain favor taking the same value in low energy samples. Assigning a good chain-strength value is crucial for the ability of QA to solve hard problems, but there are no general methods for computing such a value and, even if an optimal value is found, it may still not be suitable by being too large for accurate annealing results. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based approach for producing suitable logical qubits representations that results in smaller chain weights and show that the resulting optimization problem can be successfully solved using the augmented Lagrangian method. Experiments on the D-Wave Advantage system and the maximum clique problem on random graphs show that our approach outperforms both the default D-Wave method for chain-strength assignment as well as the quadratic penalty method.

TI Generalized Toric Codes on Twisted Tori for Quantum Error Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Grobner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters [[n, k, d]] for n <= 400, yielding novel codes such as [[120, 8, 12]], [[186, 10, 14]], [[210, 10, 16]], [[248, 10, 18]], [[254, 14, 16]], [[294, 10, 20]], [[310, 10, <= 22]], and [[340, 16, 18]]. Moreover, we present a new realization of the [[360, 12, <= 24]] quantum code using the (3, 3)-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors (0,30) and (6, 6), improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

TI Benefits of Open Quantum Systems for Quantum Machine Learning
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is a discipline that holds the promise of revolutionizing data processing and problem-solving. However, dissipation and noise arising from the coupling with the environment are commonly perceived as major obstacles to its practical exploitation, as they impact the coherence and performance of the utilized quantum devices. Significant efforts have been dedicated to mitigating and controlling their negative effects on these devices. This perspective takes a different approach, aiming to harness the potential of noise and dissipation instead of combating them. Surprisingly, it is shown that these seemingly detrimental factors can provide substantial advantages in the operation of QML algorithms under certain circumstances. Exploring and understanding the implications of adapting QML algorithms to open quantum systems opens up pathways for devising strategies that effectively leverage noise and dissipation. The recent works analyzed in this perspective represent only initial steps toward uncovering other potential hidden benefits that dissipation and noise may offer. As exploration in this field continues, significant discoveries are anticipated that could reshape the future of quantum computing.

TI Emulation of satellite up-link quantum communication with entangled
   photons
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum communication rates in terrestrial quantum networks are fundamentally limited by fiber loss, even in the presence of quantum repeaters. Satellites offer a solution for long-distance communication, with the most commonly explored scenario involving prepare-and-measure protocols connecting from orbit to a trusted-node ground station via free-space down-links. In contrast, up-link scenarios allow for entanglement to be distributed between a satellite and remote end-users in terrestrial networks, eliminating any trust requirement on the ground station. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-bright source of far-non-degenerate entangled photons and perform quantum key distribution in emulated high-loss satellite scenarios. With a loss profile corresponding to that of one of the pioneering Micius up-link experiments, and a terrestrial end-user separated by 10 km of telecom fiber, we achieve secure key bit accumulation of 5.2 kbit in a single emulated overpass in the asymptotic limit. Our results confirm the viability of upcoming low-Earth orbit receiver satellite missions. Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

As the number of qubits in a quantum register increases, it is necessary to maintain high-fidelity detection to accurately measure the multiqubit state.

TI New parameterized quantum gates design and efficient gradient solving
   based on variational quantum classification algorithm
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Currently, variational quantum classification algorithms (VQCAs) generally rely on traditional optimization techniques such as Powell and SLSQP in the parameter optimization session. However, the performance of these methods shows limitations in practical applications. Although the parameter-shift rule can efficiently compute the parameter gradient with quantum circuits, it needs to run the quantum circuit twice repeatedly, which significantly reduces the computation efficiency. In order to overcome this challenge, this paper innovatively integrates the principle of unitary operation in quantum mechanics with the technical characteristics of superconducting quantum chips and elaborately designs some new parameterized quantum gates (PQGs). These PQGs strictly follow the rules of unitary operation, which ensures the stability and accuracy of quantum state evolution while realizing an efficient solution to the parameter gradient. Especially for the gradient calculation of a single qubit and single-angle PQGs, the new method can be completed with only a single quantum circuit run, which greatly improves the computation efficiency. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets such as breast cancer and iris shows that the method proposed in this paper exhibits excellent performance on quantum classification tasks. Compared with the parameter-shift rule, the computation efficiency of the new method is improved by 40%. And the classification accuracy, precision, and other key performance metrics are improved by an average of 5% in comparison with traditional optimization algorithms. This work not only enriches the methodology of quantum machine learning theoretically but also demonstrates its remarkable superiority in practical applications, which indicates that the method has great potential in scientific research and industrial applications.

TI Hybrid quantum algorithms for flow problems
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB For quantum computing (QC) to emerge as a practically indispensable computational tool, there is a need for quantum protocols with end-to-end practical applications-in this instance, fluid dynamics. We debut here a high-performance quantum simulator which we term QFlowS (Quantum Flow Simulator), designed for fluid flow simulations using QC. Solving nonlinear flows by QC generally proceeds by solving an equivalent infinite dimensional linear system as a result of linear embedding. Thus, we first choose to simulate two well-known flows using QFlowS and demonstrate a previously unseen, full gate-level implementation of a hybrid and high precision Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms (QLSA) for simulating such flows at low Reynolds numbers. The utility of this simulator is demonstrated by extracting error estimates and power law scaling that relates T-0 (a parameter crucial to Hamiltonian simulations) to the condition number kappa of the simulation matrix and allows the prediction of an optimal scaling parameter for accurate eigenvalue estimation. Further, we include two speedup preserving algorithms for a) the functional form or sparse quantum state preparation and b) in situ quantum postprocessing tool for computing nonlinear functions of the velocity field. We choose the viscous dissipation rate as an example, for which the end-to-end complexity is shown to be O(polylog(N/epsilon)k/epsilon(QPP)), where N is the size of the linear system of equations, e is the solution error, and epsilon(QPP) is the error in postprocessing. This work suggests a path toward quantum simulation of fluid flows and highlights the special considerations needed at the gate-level implementation of QC.

   Multi-Agent Energy Systems
SO ENERGIES
AB The increasing digitization and decentralization of modern energy systems have heightened their vulnerability to sophisticated cyber threats, necessitating advanced, scalable, and privacy-preserving detection frameworks. This paper introduces a novel Federated Quantum Machine Learning (FQML) framework tailored for anomaly detection in multi-agent energy environments. By integrating parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) at the local agent level with secure federated learning protocols, the framework enhances detection accuracy while preserving data privacy. A trimmed-mean aggregation scheme and differential privacy mechanisms are embedded to defend against Byzantine behaviors and data-poisoning attacks. The problem is formally modeled as a constrained optimization task, accounting for quantum circuit depth, communication latency, and adversarial resilience. Experimental validation on synthetic smart grid datasets demonstrates that FQML achieves high detection accuracy (>= 96.3%), maintains robustness under adversarial perturbations, and reduces communication overhead by 28.6% compared to classical federated baselines. These results substantiate the viability of quantum-enhanced federated learning as a practical, hardware-conscious approach to distributed cybersecurity in next-generation energy infrastructures.

TI Realism-based nonlocality: Invariance under local unitary operations and
   asymptotic decay for thermal correlated states
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The realism-based nonlocality (RBN) is a recently introduced measure that differs from the well-known Bell's nonlocality. For bipartite states, the RBN concerns how much an element of reality associated with a given observable is affected upon local measurements on the other subsystem. Here, we present an analytical proof for the unitary invariance of the RBN and that it presents a monotonous behavior upon the action of unital and non-unital local quantum noise. We illustrate our results by employing the two-qubit Werner state and thermal quantum correlated states. We show how the RBN is limited by the initial equilibrium temperature and, especially, that it decays asymptotically with it. These results also corroborate the hierarchy relationship between the quantifiers of RBN and global quantum discord, showing that RBN can capture undetectable nonlocal aspects even for non-discordant states.

TI Quantum computation for predicting electron and phonon properties of
   solids
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Quantum chemistry is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers. Quantum algorithms such as variational quantum eigen solver (VQE) and variational quantum deflation (VQD) algorithms have been mainly applied for molecular systems and there is a need to implement such methods for periodic solids. Using Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonian (WTBH) approaches, we demonstrate the application of VQE and VQD to accurately predict both electronic and phonon bandstructure properties of several elemental as well as multi-component solid-state materials. We apply VQE-VQD calculations for 307 spin-orbit coupling based electronic WTBHs and 933 finite-difference based phonon WTBHs. Also, we discuss a workflow for using VQD with lattice Green's function that can be used for solving dynamical mean-field theory problems. The WTBH model solvers can be used for testing other quantum algorithms and models also.

TI Spooky action at a distance? A two-phase study into learners' views of
   quantum entanglement
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum entanglement is a challenging concept within the field of physics education, often eluding a full grasp by both educators and learners alike. In this paper, we report findings from a two-phase empirical study into the views of entanglement held by pre-service physics teachers and physics students from various universities. In the first phase, we utilized a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions which was completed by 31 pre-service physics teachers. The study participants' ideas were explored using qualitative content analysis which led to the creation of rating scale items used in study phase 2. These items were administered to a broader cohort including 73 physics university students in order to capture the learners' agreement or disagreement with the questionnaire statements, and hence, helped to validate and substantiate the in-depth insights from study phase 1. Key findings revealed widespread accurate notions, like the need to consider the entire system when examining entangled states. However, less elaborated views were also identified, including ideas such as that measurements of entangled states always show perfect (anti-)correlation. Another striking observation was the confusion between quantum entanglement and superposition. In the case of quantum teleportation, many participants seemed to have a basic grasp of the concept, although a number of misconceptions were apparent, notably the idea that quantum entanglement enables faster-than-light communication. Practically, the findings can assist educators in anticipating and addressing widespread (mis-)conceptions, paving the way for more effective instruction in quantum mechanics and its real-world applications, such as quantum cryptography and computing.

TI Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of
   fermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence, provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here, we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error-correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry-protected fermion matter.

TI Quantum Vulnerability Analysis to Guide Robust Quantum Computing System
   Design
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB While quantum computers provide exciting opportunities for information processing, they currently suffer from noise during computation that is not fully understood. Incomplete noise models have led to discrepancies between quantum program success rate (SR) estimates and actual machine outcomes. For example, the estimated probability of success (ESP) is the state-of-the-art metric used to gauge quantum program performance. The ESP suffers poor prediction since it fails to account for the unique combination of circuit structure, quantum state, and quantum computer properties specific to each program execution. Thus, an urgent need exists for a systematic approach that can elucidate various noise impacts and accurately and robustly predict quantum computer success rates, emphasizing application and device scaling. In this article, we propose quantum vulnerability analysis (QVA) to systematically quantify the error impact on quantum applications and address the gap between current success rate (SR) estimators and real quantum computer results. The QVA determines the cumulative quantum vulnerability (CQV) of the target quantum computation, which quantifies the quantum error impact based on the entire algorithm applied to the target quantum machine. By evaluating the CQV with well-known benchmarks on three 27-qubit quantum computers, the CQV success estimation outperforms the estimated probability of success state-of-the-art prediction technique by achieving on average six times less relative prediction error, with best cases at 30 times, for benchmarks with a real SR rate above 0.1%. Direct application of QVA has been provided that helps researchers choose a promising compiling strategy at compile time.

TI Quantum Circuits for Sparse Isometries
SO QUANTUM
AB We consider the task of breaking down a quantum computation given as an isometry into C-nots and single-qubit gates, while keeping the number of C-not gates small. Although several decompositions are known for general isometries, here we focus on a method based on Householder reflections that adapts well in the case of sparse isometries. We show how to use this method to decompose an arbitrary isometry before illustrating that the method can lead to significant improvements in the case of sparse isometries. We also discuss the classical complexity of this method and illustrate its effectiveness in the case of sparse state preparation by applying it to randomly chosen sparse states.

TI Comparing two-qubit and multiqubit gates within the toric code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In some quantum computing architectures, entanglement of an arbitrary number of qubits can be generated in a single operation. This property has many potential applications, and may specifically be useful for quantum error correction (QEC). Stabilizer measurements can then be implemented using a single multiqubit gate instead of several two-qubit gates, thus reducing circuit depth. In this study, the toric code is used as a benchmark to compare the performance of two-qubit and five-qubit gates within parity-check circuits. We consider trapped ion qubits that are controlled via Raman transitions, where the primary source of error is assumed to be spontaneous photon scattering. We show that a five-qubit Molmer-Sorensen gate offers an approximately 40% improvement over two-qubit gates in terms of the fault tolerance threshold. This result indicates an advantage of using multiqubit gates in the context of QEC.

TI Quantum computation protocol for dressed spins in a global field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin qubits are contenders for scalable quantum computation because of their long coherence times demonstrated in a variety of materials, but individual control by frequency-selective addressing using pulsed spin resonance creates severe technical challenges for scaling up to many qubits. This individual resonance control strategy requires each spin to have a distinguishable frequency, imposing a maximum number of spins that can be individually driven before qubit crosstalk becomes unavoidable. Here we describe a complete strategy for controlling a large array of spins in quantum dots dressed by an on-resonance global field, namely, a field that is constantly driving the spin qubits, to dynamically decouple from the effects of background magnetic field fluctuations. This approach-previously implemented for the control of single electron spins bound to electrons in impurities-is here harmonized with all other operations necessary for universal quantum computing with spins in quantum dots. We define the logical states as the dressed qubit states and discuss initialization and readout utilizing Pauli spin blockade, as well as single- and two-qubit control in the new basis. Finally, we critically analyze the limitations imposed by qubit variability and potential strategies to improve performance.

AB Variational quantum circuits are being used as versatile quantum machine learning models. Some empirical results exhibit an advantage in supervised and generative learning tasks. However, when applied to reinforcement learning, less is known. In this work, we considered a variational quantum circuit composed of a low-depth hardware-efficient ansatz as the parameterized policy of a reinforcement learning agent. We show that an epsilon-approximation of the policy gradient can be obtained using a logarithmic number of samples concerning the total number of parameters. We empirically verify that such quantum models behave similarly to typical classical neural networks used in standard benchmarking environments and quantum control, using only a fraction of the parameters. Moreover, we study the barren plateau phenomenon in quantum policy gradients using the Fisher information matrix spectrum.

TI Entanglement-Based Artificial Topology: Neighboring Remote Network Nodes
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Thus, the possibility of implementing unparalleled network functionalities by exploiting entanglement is gaining huge attention. However, the research efforts in this context are mainly focused on bipartite entanglement, often discarding the wide unexplored classes of entanglement shared among more than two parties, known as multipartite entanglement. In this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic demands. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.

TI Quantum machine learning enhanced laser speckle analysis for precise
   speed prediction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical technique used to assess blood flow perfusion by modeling changes in speckle intensity, but it is generally limited to qualitative analysis due to difficulties in absolute quantification. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) enhance the quantitative performance of LSCI by excelling at extracting spatiotemporal features from speckle data. However, excessive downsampling techniques can lead to significant information loss. To address this, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical 3D CNN framework that leverages variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to enhance the performance of classical models. The proposed framework employs variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to replace the 3D global pooling layer, enabling the model to utilize the complete 3D information extracted by the convolutional layers for feature integration, thereby enhancing velocity prediction performance. We perform cross-validation on experimental LSCI speckle data and demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid models over their classical counterparts in terms of prediction accuracy and learning stability. Furthermore, we evaluate the models on an unseen test set and observe that the hybrid models outperform the classical models with up to 14.8% improvement in mean squared error (MSE) and up to 26.1% improvement in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) evaluation metrics. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows that the hybrid models offer substantial improvements over classical models in predicting blood flow at both low and high velocities. These results indicate that the hybrid models possess more powerful learning and generalization capabilities.

They are paramount in emerging quantum technologies such as quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and measurement-based quantum computing. Many such systems have been reported in the last three decades, from rubidium atoms coupled to cavities to semiconductor quantum dots and color centers implanted in waveguides. This review article highlights different solid-state and atomic systems with on-demand and controlled single-photon generation. We discuss and compare the performance metrics, such as purity and indistinguishability, for these sources and evaluate their potential for different applications. Finally, a new potential single-photon source, based on the Rydberg exciton in solid-state metal oxide thin films, is introduced, where we discuss its promising features and unique advantages in fabricating quantum chips for quantum photonic applications.

TI Qunity
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked bqp subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQasm, proving the realizability of our design.

AB In recent years, quantum computing has demonstrated the potential to revolutionize specific algorithms and applications by solving problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, its widespread adoption for general computing remains a future prospect. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing within High -Performance Computing (HPC) environments, focusing on a resource management framework designed to streamline quantum simulators' use and enhance runtime performance and efficiency. The proposed framework facilitates hybrid applications' transition from simulation backends to real quantum hardware, optimizing resource utilization and providing a flexible infrastructure for developing and testing quantum algorithms.

TI Quantum Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Survey
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB By using the quantum mechanics phenomenon, quantum computers provide a new dimension of computational power that drastically accelerates solving complex and resource-intensive problems. One of the most evolving but, due to the computation power of standard computers, reasonably limited application domain is natural language processing (NLP). NLP seeks to give interactive systems the ability to understand and manipulate human language. Making systems understand and manipulate human languages requires large amounts of data and computational power during learning as well as during the execution of NLP. For handling these amounts of data like text and audio recordings and the complexity of classical NLP algorithms, quantum computation has emerged as a promising solution. This work gives an extensive overview of this new field, known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). Introducing the basics of quantum computing, we discuss its use in NLP by explaining the different proposed embedding models, quantum algorithms, and other methods of QNLP. As QNLP is still in its infancy, this comprehensive overview is the foundation that points to the upcoming research direction.

TI Quantum memories and the double-slit experiment: implications for
   astronomical interferometry
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Thomas Young's slit experiment lies at the heart of classical interference and quantum mechanics. Over the last 50 years, it has been shown that particles (e.g., photons, electrons, large molecules), even individual particles, generate an interference pattern at a distant screen after passage through a double slit, thereby demonstrating wave-particle duality. We revisit this famous experiment by replacing both slits with single-mode fiber inputs to two independent quantum memories that are capable of storing the incident electromagnetic field's amplitude and phase as a function of time. At a later time, the action is reversed: the quantum memories are read out in synchrony, and the single-mode fiber outputs are allowed to interact, consistent with the original observation. In contrast to any classical memory device, the write and read processes of a quantum memory are non-destructive and hence preserve the photonic quantum states. In principle, with sufficiently long storage times and sufficiently high photonic storage capacity, quantum memories operating at widely separated telescopes can be brought together to achieve optical interferometry over arbitrarily long baselines.

TI Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with classical
   Bob and no joint measurement
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) provides a method for secret communication whose security does not rely on trusted measurement devices. In all existing MDI-QKD protocols, the participant Charlie has to perform Bell state measurement or other joint measurements. Here, we propose an MDI-QKD protocol which requires individual measurements only. Meanwhile, all operations of the receiver Bob are classical, without the need for preparing and measuring quantum systems. Thus, the implementation of the protocol has a lower technical requirement on Bob and Charlie.

TI Optimization Strategies in Quantum Machine Learning: A Performance
   Analysis
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This study presents a comprehensive comparison of multiple optimization algorithms applied to a quantum classification model, utilizing the Cleveland dataset. Specifically, the research focuses on three prominent optimizers-COBYLA, L-BFGS-B, and ADAM-each employing distinct methodologies and widely recognized in the domain of quantum machine learning. The performance of predictive models using these optimizers is rigorously evaluated through key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The findings reveal that the COBYLA optimizer outperforms the L-BFGS-B and ADAM optimizers across all performance metrics, achieving an accuracy of 92%, precision of 89%, recall of 97%, and F1 score of 93%. Furthermore, the COBYLA optimizer exhibits superior computational efficiency, requiring only 1 min of training time compared to 6 min for L-BFGS-B and 10 min for ADAM. These results underscore the critical role played by optimizer selection in enhancing model performance and efficiency in quantum machine learning applications, offering valuable insights for practitioners in the field.

TI A deterministic qudit-dependent high-dimensional photonic quantum gate
   with weak cross-kerr nonlinearity
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB High-dimensional quantum systems expand the Hilbert space, enabling the processing of more intricate information and the execution of wider quantum operations. The development of high-dimensional quantum systems relies significantly on the implementation of high-dimensional gates. In the paper, we propose a deterministic 4 x 4-dimensional controlled-not (CNOT) gate for a three-photon system, where encoding on the polarization-spatial state of a single photon acts as a 4-dimensional control qudit, meanwhile the polarized state of the remaining two photons serves as a 4-dimensional target qudit. The implementation of the gate leverages weak cross-kerr nonlinearities and X-homodyne detectors, which impose lower requirements on the interaction strength and demonstrate robustness against photon loss. In accordance with the measurement of the coherent state, the relevant classical feed-forward operations are employed to make high-dimensional CNOT gate effective. Additionally, the proposed scheme demonstrates a high successful probability as a result of the utilization of mature measurement methods and straightforward optical elements. Further, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is robust against photon loss and is approximate to 1 with the existing technology. Consequently, our deterministic protocol presents a promising approach for the practical realization of high-dimensional quantum computation for photon systems.

TI Benchmarking the performance of a high-Q cavity qudit using random
   unitaries
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB High-coherence cavity resonators are excellent resources for encoding quantum information in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, moving beyond traditional qubit-based platforms. A natural strategy is to use the Fock basis to encode information in qudits. One can perform quantum operations on the cavity mode qudit by coupling the system to a non-linear ancillary transmon qubit. However, the performance of the cavity-transmon device is limited by the noisy transmons. It is, therefore, important to develop practical benchmarking tools for these qudit systems in an algorithm-agnostic manner. We gauge the performance of these qudit platforms using sampling tests such as the heavy output generation test as well as the linear cross-entropy benchmark, by way of simulations of such a system subject to realistic dominant noise channels. We use selective number-dependent arbitrary phase and unconditional displacement gates as our universal gateset. Our results show that contemporary transmons comfortably enable controlling a few tens of Fock levels of a cavity mode. This framework allows benchmarking even higher dimensional qudits as those become accessible with improved transmons.

TI Noise-Resilient Quantum Machine Learning for Stability Assessment of
   Power Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB Transient stability assessment (TSA) is a cornerstone for resilient operations of today's interconnected power grids. This paper is a confluence of quantum computing, data science and machine learning to potentially address the power system TSA issue. We devise a quantum TSA (QTSA) method to enable efficient data-driven transient stability prediction for bulk power systems, which is the first attempt to tackle the TSA issue with quantum computing. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) A high expressibility, low-depth quantum circuit (HELD) is designed for accurate and noise-resilient TSA; 2) A quantum natural gradient descent algorithm is developed for efficient HELD training and 3) A systematical analysis on QTSA's performance under various quantum factors is performed. QTSA underpins a foundation of quantum machine learning-enabled power grid stability analytics. It renders the intractable TSA straightforward and effortless in the Hilbert space, and therefore provides stability information for power system operations. Extensive experiments on quantum simulators and real quantum computers verify the accuracy, noise-resilience, scalability and universality of QTSA.

TI Criticality-enhanced quantum sensor at finite temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Conventional criticality-based quantum metrological schemes work only at zero or very low temperature because the quantum uncertainty around the quantum phase-transition point is generally erased by thermal fluctuations with the increase of temperature. Such an ultralow-temperature requirement severely restricts the development of quantum critical metrology. In this paper, we propose a thermodynamic-criticality-enhanced quantum sensing scenario at finite temperature. In our scheme, a qubit is employed as a quantum sensor to estimate parameters of interest in the Dicke model which experiences a thermodynamic phase transition. It is revealed that the thermodynamic criticality of the Dicke model can significantly improve the sensing precision. Enriching the scope of quantum critical metrology, our finding provides a possibility to realize highly sensitive quantum sensing without cooling.

TI Data compression for quantum machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The advent of noisy-intermediate scale quantum computers has introduced the exciting possibility of achieving quantum speedups in machine learning tasks. These devices, however, are composed of a small number of qubits and can faithfully run only short circuits. This puts many proposed approaches for quantum machine learning beyond currently available devices. We address the problem of compressing classical data into efficient representations on quantum devices. Our proposed methods allow both the required number of qubits and depth of the quantum circuit to be tuned. We achieve this by using a correspondence between matrix-product states and quantum circuits and further propose a hardware-efficient quantum circuit approach, which we benchmark on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Finally, we demonstrate that a quantum circuit-based classifier can achieve competitive accuracy with current tensor learning methods using only 11 qubits.

TI Scalable Quantum Spin Networks from Unitary Construction
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Spin network (SN) systems can be used to achieve quantum state transfer with high fidelity and to generate entanglement. A new approach to design spin-chain-based spin network systems, for short-range quantum information processing and phase-sensing, has been proposed recently in Advanced Quantum Technologies. In this paper, the scalability of such systems is investigated, by designing larger SN systems that can be used for longer-range quantum information tasks, such as connecting together quantum processors. Furthermore, more complex SN designs, which can produce different types of entangled states, are presented. Simulations of disorder effects show that even such larger SN systems are robust against realistic levels of disorder.
   A unitary-based design of quantum spin networks (SNs) allows the generation of various quantum information processing. Such SNs are scalable and have applications for routing quantum information, for generation of bipartite and multipartite entangled states, and for quantum sensing. Modelling investigations of disorder demonstrate that all these applications are very robust and can be achieved even against significant errors.image

TI Quantum Computer-Aided Design: Digital Quantum Simulation of Quantum
   Processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB With the increasing size of quantum processors, submodules that constitute the processor hardware will become too large to accurately simulate on a classical computer. Therefore, one would soon have to fabricate and test each new design primitive and parameter choice in time-consuming coordination between design, fabrication, and experimental validation. Here we show how one can design and test the performance of next-generation quantum hardware-by using existing quantum computers. Focusing on superconducting transmon processors as a prominent hardware platform, we compute the static and dynamic properties of individual and coupled transmons. We show how the energy spectra of transmons can be obtained by variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that are well suited for near-term noisy quantum computers. In addition, single-and two-qubit gate simulations are demonstrated via Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Our methods pave a promising way towards designing candidate quantum processors when the demands of calculating submodule properties exceed the capabilities of classical computing resources.

TI Multi-client distributed blind quantum computation with the Qline
   architecture
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Universal blind quantum computing allows users with minimal quantum resources to delegate a quantum computation to a remote quantum server, while keeping intrinsically hidden input, algorithm, and outcome. State-of-art experimental demonstrations of such a protocol have only involved one client. However, an increasing number of multi-party algorithms, e.g. federated machine learning, require the collaboration of multiple clients to carry out a given joint computation. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a lightweight multi-client blind quantum computation protocol based on a recently proposed linear quantum network configuration (Qline). Our protocol originality resides in three main strengths: scalability, since we eliminate the need for each client to have its own trusted source or measurement device, low-loss, by optimizing the orchestration of classical communication between each client and server through fast classical electronic control, and compatibility with distributed architectures while remaining intact even against correlated attacks of server nodes and malicious clients.
   Multi-client demonstrations of blind quantum computation are still missing, due to their high resource overhead. Here, the authors fill this gap, by proposing a more scalable solution based on a recently introduced linear quantum network structure with high modularity, and demonstrating it in the two-client case.

TI Decoherence mitigation for geometric quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Geometric phases depend only on the evolution path determined by the closed circuit in the projective Hilbert space but not on evolution details of the quantum system, leading to geometric quantum computation possessing some intrinsic robustness against control errors. Coordinated with dynamical decoupling, geometric quantum computation admits additional resilience to the environment-induced decoherence. However, the previous schemes of geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling require multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit, which undoubtedly increases the consumption of physical-qubit resources and the difficulty in the implementation of the logical-qubit manipulation based on physical-qubit driving. In this work, we put forward a scheme of decoherence-mitigated geometric quantum computation based only on physical qubits rather than logical qubits, hence avoiding the additional overhead of physical-qubit resources for logical-qubit encoding as well as the difficulty in the manipulation of logical qubits. Moreover, our scheme focuses on the most general interaction between an individual qubit and its environment so that it mitigates not just dephasing noise but rather regular decoherence. Our proposal thus represents a more realistic and effective approach towards the realization of geometric control with decoherence mitigation.

TI Simultaneous Execution of Quantum Circuits on Current and Near-Future
   NISQ Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, the idea of quantum multiprogramming, running multiple quantum circuits (QCs) simultaneously on the same hardware, helps to improve the throughput of quantum computation. However, the crosstalk, unwanted interference between qubits on NISQ processors, may cause performance degradation when using multiprogramming. To address this challenge, we introduce palloq (parallel allocation of QCs), a novel compilation protocol. Palloq improves the performance of quantum multiprogramming on NISQ processors, while paying attention to 1) the combination of QCs chosen for parallel execution and 2) the assignment of program qubit variables to physical qubits, to reduce unwanted interference among the active set of QCs. We also propose a software-based crosstalk detection protocol using a new combination of randomized benchmarking methods. Our method successfully characterizes the suitability of hardware for multiprogramming with relatively low detection costs. We found a tradeoff between the success rate and execution time of the multiprogramming. Our results will be of value when device throughput becomes a significant bottleneck. Until service providers have enough quantum processors available to more than meet demand, this approach will be attractive to the service providers and users who want to optimize job management and throughput of the processor.

TI Superposition-Based Abstractions for Quantum Data Encoding Verification
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Many quantum algorithms operate on classical data, by first encoding classical data into the quantum domain using quantum data encoding circuits. To be effective for large data sets, encoding circuits that operate on large data sets are required. However, as the size of the data sets increases, the encoding circuits quickly become large, complex and error prone. Errors in the encoding circuit will provide incorrect inputs to quantum algorithms, making them ineffective. To address this problem, a formal method is proposed for verification of encoding circuits. The key idea to address scalability is the use of abstractions that reduce the verification problem to bit-vector space. The major outcome of this work is that using this approach, the authors have been able to verify encoding circuits with up to 8191 qubits with very low memory (85 MB) and time (0.29s), demonstrating that the proposed approach can easily be employed to verify even much larger encoding circuits. The results are very significant because, traditional verification approaches that rely on modelling quantum circuits in Hilbert space have only demonstrated verification scalability up to 250 qubits. Also, this is the first approach to tackle the verification of quantum encoding circuits.

TI Quantum machine learning for image classification
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Image classification, a pivotal task in multiple industries, faces computational challenges due to the burgeoning volume of visual data. This research addresses these challenges by introducing two quantum machine learning models that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics for effective computations. Our first model, a hybrid quantum neural network with parallel quantum circuits, enables the execution of computations even in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where circuits with a large number of qubits are currently infeasible. This model demonstrated a record-breaking classification accuracy of 99.21% on the full MNIST dataset, surpassing the performance of known quantum-classical models, while having eight times fewer parameters than its classical counterpart. Also, the results of testing this hybrid model on a Medical MNIST (classification accuracy over 99%), and on CIFAR-10 (classification accuracy over 82%), can serve as evidence of the generalizability of the model and highlights the efficiency of quantum layers in distinguishing common features of input data. Our second model introduces a hybrid quantum neural network with a Quanvolutional layer, reducing image resolution via a convolution process. The model matches the performance of its classical counterpart, having four times fewer trainable parameters, and outperforms a classical model with equal weight parameters. These models represent advancements in quantum machine learning research and illuminate the path towards more accurate image classification systems.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Signal Denoising
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB This letter presents a novel quantum algorithm for signal denoising, which performs a thresholding in the frequency domain through amplitude amplification and using an adaptive threshold determined by local mean values. The proposed algorithm is able to process both classical and quantum signals. It is parametrically faster than previous classical and quantum denoising algorithms. Numerical results show that it is efficient at removing noise of both classical and quantum origin, significantly outperforming existing quantum algorithms in this respect, especially in the presence of quantum noise.

TI Digital reconstruction of squeezed light for quantum information
   processing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Squeezed light plays a vital role in quantum information processing. However, its highly sensitive nature presents significant practical challenges, particularly in remote detection, which traditionally requires complex systems such as active phase locking, clock synchronization, and polarization control. Here, we propose and demonstrate an asynchronous detection method for squeezed light eliminating the need for these complex systems. By employing radio-frequency heterodyne detection with a locally generated local oscillator and applying a series of digital unitary transformations, we successfully reconstruct squeezed states of light. We validate our approach in two key applications: the distribution of squeezed light over a 10 km fiber channel, and passive continuous-variables quantum key distribution based on squeezed vacuum states between two labs connected via deployed fiber. This demonstrates a practical digital reconstruction method for squeezed light, opening new avenues for practical distributed quantum sensing networks and high-performance, long-distance quantum communication using squeezed states.

TI Quantum Compressive Sensing: Mathematical Machinery, Quantum Algorithms,
   and Quantum Circuitry
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Compressive sensing is a sensing protocol that facilitates the reconstruction of large signals from relatively few measurements by exploiting known structures of signals of interest, typically manifested as signal sparsity. Compressive sensing's vast repertoire of applications in areas such as communications and image reconstruction stems from the traditional approach of utilizing non-linear optimization to exploit the sparsity assumption by selecting the lowest-weight (i.e., maximum sparsity) signal consistent with all acquired measurements. Recent efforts in the literature consider instead a data-driven approach, training tensor networks to learn the structure of signals of interest. The trained tensor network is updated to "project" its state onto one consistent with the measurements taken, and is then sampled site by site to "guess" the original signal. In this paper, we take advantage of this computing protocol by formulating an alternative "quantum" protocol, in which the state of the tensor network is a quantum state over a set of entangled qubits. Accordingly, we present the associated algorithms and quantum circuits required to implement the training, projection, and sampling steps on a quantum computer. We supplement our theoretical results by simulating the proposed circuits with a small, qualitative model of LIDAR imaging of earth forests. Our results indicate that a quantum, data-driven approach to compressive sensing may have significant promise as quantum technology continues to make new leaps.

TI Programmable nonlinear quantum photonic circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The lack of interactions between single photons prohibits direct nonlinear operations in quantum optical circuits, representing a central obstacle in photonic quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate multi-mode nonlinear photonic circuits where both linear and direct nonlinear operations can be programmed with high precision at the single-photon level. Nonlinear interaction is realised with a tunable quantum dot embedded in a nanophotonic waveguide mediating interactions between individual photons within a temporal linear optical interferometer. We demonstrate the capability to reprogramme the nonlinear photonic circuits and implement protocols where strong nonlinearities are required, in particular for quantum simulation of anharmonic molecular dynamics, thereby showcasing the new key functionalities enabled by our technology.

TI An Innovative Algorithm for Attacking Symmetric Ciphers Using D-Wave
   Quantum Annealing
SO TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing is generally considered non-threatening to symmetric ciphers. Quantum attacks on symmetric ciphers require a thorough analysis of their internal structures, posing considerable difficulties and challenges. As of 2023, Google's quantum supremacy chip, Sycamore, is still incapable of cryptanalysis. Leveraging D-Wave's quantum annealing exploits the unique quantum tunneling effect, providing an edge in solving combinatorial optimization problems. It can be regarded as a class of artificial intelligence algorithm that can achieve global optimization. We propose a quantum heuristic symmetric cipher attack algorithm for substitution-permutation network (SPN) symmetric ciphers, which transforms the plaintext-ciphertext propagation rules within SPN structure into the problem of solving a constrained quadratic model (CQM). A novel reduction algorithm is employed to eliminate redundant constraint conditions. The D-Wave Advantage quantum computer is used to recover the encryption sub-keys. Using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, IBM Q Experience can only recover two rounds of the Heys Cipher sub-key, whereas D-Wave Advantage achieves complete key recovery, validating its potential in quantum symmetric cipher attacks.

By employing a partially entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state as the quantum channel and an optimal positive operator-valued measure based on an improved reciprocal state formulation, we achieve unambiguous state discrimination. The scheme has been generalized to support various entangled state configurations and demonstrates a notable reduction in classical communication costs for these states compared to standard Bell-basis teleportation. Its capacity for integration with conventional protocols is pivotal, enhancing quantum hop-by-hop communication security by allowing strategic choices in quantum channel and teleportation strategy.

TI Probing Quantum Telecloning on Superconducting Quantum Processors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum information can not be perfectly cloned, but approximate copies of quantum information can be generated. Quantum telecloning combines approximate quantum cloning, more typically referred as quantum cloning, and quantum teleportation. Quantum telecloning allows approximate copies of quantum information to be constructed by separate parties, using the classical results of a Bell measurement made on a prepared quantum telecloning state. Quantum telecloning can be implemented as a circuit on quantum computers using a classical co-processor to compute classical feed forward instructions using if statements based on the results of a mid-circuit Bell measurement in real time. We present universal, symmetric, optimal 1 -> M telecloning circuits, and experimentally demonstrate these quantum telecloning circuits for M=2 up to M=10, natively executed with real time classical control systems on IBM Quantum superconducting processors, known as dynamic circuits. We perform the cloning procedure on many different message states across the Bloch sphere, on 7 IBM Quantum processors, optionally using the error suppression technique X-X sequence digital dynamical decoupling. Two circuit optimizations are utilized, one which removes ancilla qubits for M=2,3, and one which reduces the total number of gates in the circuit but still uses ancilla qubits. Parallel single qubit tomography with MLE density matrix reconstruction is used in order to compute the mixed state density matrices of the clone qubits, and clone quality is measured using quantum fidelity. These results present one of the largest and most comprehensive NISQ computer experimental analyses on (single qubit) quantum telecloning to date. The clone fidelity sharply decreases to 0.5 for M>5, but for M=2 we are able to achieve a mean clone fidelity of up to 0.79 using dynamical decoupling.

TI Quantum Relay Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Communication over a fully quantum relay channel is considered. We establish three bounds based on different coding strategies, i.e., partial decode-forward, measure-forward, and assist-forward. Using the partial decode-forward strategy, the relay decodes part of the information, while the other part is decoded without the relay's help. The result by Savov et al. (2012) for a classical-quantum relay channel is obtained as a special case. Based on our partial decode-forward bound, the capacity is determined for Hadamard relay channels. In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.

AB Ensembles of dopants have widespread applications in quantum technology. The miniaturization of corresponding devices is however hampered by dipolar interactions that reduce the coherence at increased dopant density. We theoretically and experimentally investigate this limitation. We find that dynamical decoupling can alleviate, but not fully eliminate, the decoherence in crystals with strong anisotropic spin-spin interactions that originate from an anisotropic g tensor. Our findings can be generalized to many quantum systems used for quantum sensing, microwave-to-optical conversion, and quantum memory.

TI Hardware requirements for trapped-ion-based verifiable blind quantum
   computing with a measurement-only client
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In blind quantum computing (BQC), a user with a simple client device can perform a quantum computation on a remote quantum server such that the server cannot gain knowledge about the computation. Here, we numerically investigate hardware requirements for verifiable BQC using an ion trap as server and a distant measurement-only client. While the client has no direct access to quantum-computing resources, it can remotely execute quantum programs on the server by measuring photons emitted by the trapped ion. We introduce a numerical model for trapped-ion quantum devices in NetSquid, a discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. Using this, we determine the minimal hardware requirements on a per-parameter basis to perform the verifiable BQC protocol. We benchmark these for a five-qubit linear graph state, with which any single-qubit rotation can be performed, where client and server are separated by 50 km. Current state-of-the-art ion traps satisfy the minimal requirements on a per-parameter basis, but all current imperfections combined make it impossible to perform the blind computation securely over 50 km using existing technology. Using a genetic algorithm, we determine the set of hardware parameters that minimises the total improvements required, finding directions along which to improve hardware to reach our threshold error probability that would enable experimental demonstration. In this way, we lay a path for the near-term experimental progress required to realise the implementation of verifiable BQC over a 50 km distance.

TI Broad-band spectroscopy of a vanadyl porphyrin: a model electronuclear
   spin qudit
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We explore how to encode more than a qubit in vanadyl porphyrin molecules hosting a S = 1/2 electronic spin coupled to a I = 7/2 nuclear spin. The spin Hamiltonian and its parameters, as well as the spin dynamics, have been determined via a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance, heat capacity, magnetization and on-chip magnetic spectroscopy experiments performed on single crystals. We find low temperature spin coherence times of micro-seconds and spin relaxation times longer than a second. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields (B > 0.1 T, corresponding to resonance frequencies of 9-10 GHz) these properties make vanadyl porphyrin molecules suitable qubit realizations. The presence of multiple equispaced nuclear spin levels then merely provides 8 alternatives to define the '1' and '0' basis states. For lower magnetic fields (B < 0.1 T), and lower frequencies (<2 GHz), we find spectroscopic signatures of a sizeable electronuclear entanglement. This effect generates a larger set of allowed transitions between different electronuclear spin states and removes their degeneracies. Under these conditions, we show that each molecule fulfills the conditions to act as a universal 4-qubit processor or, equivalently, as a d = 16 qudit. These findings widen the catalogue of chemically designed systems able to implement non-trivial quantum functionalities, such as quantum simulations and, especially, quantum error correction at the molecular level.

TI Quantum Internet protocol stack: A comprehensive survey
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Classical Internet evolved exceptionally during the last five decades, from a network comprising a few static nodes in the early days to a leviathan interconnecting billions of devices. This has been possible by the separation of concern principle, for which the network functionalities are organized as a stack of layers, each providing some communication functionalities through specific network protocols. In this survey, we aim at highlighting the impossibility of adapting the classical Internet protocol stack to the Quantum Internet, due to the marvels of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the design of the Quantum Internet requires a major paradigm shift of the whole protocol stack for harnessing the peculiarities of quantum entanglement and quantum information. In this context, we first overview the relevant literature about Quantum Internet protocol stack. Then, stemming from this, we sheds the light on the open problems and required efforts toward the design of an effective and complete Quantum Internet protocol stack. To the best of authors' knowledge, a survey of this type is the first of its own. What emerges from this analysis is that the Quantum Internet, though still in its infancy, is a disruptive technology whose design requires an inter-disciplinary effort at the border between quantum physics, computer and telecommunications engineering.

In dispersive media, dissipation appears in the Schr & ouml;dinger representation of classical Maxwell equations as a sparse diagonal operator occupying an r-dimensional subspace. A first order Suzuki-Trotter approximation for the evolution operator enables us to isolate the non-unitary operators (associated with dissipation) from the unitary operators (associated with lossless media). The unitary operators can be implemented through qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) on n qubits, based on the discretization and the dimensionality of the pertinent fields. However, the non-unitary-dissipative part poses a challenge both physically and computationally on how it should be implemented on a quantum computer. In this paper, two probabilistic dilation algorithms are considered for handling the dissipative operators. The first algorithm is based on treating the classical dissipation as a linear amplitude damping-type completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum channel where an unspecified environment interacts with the system of interest and produces the non-unitary evolution. Therefore, the combined system-environment is now closed, and must undergo unitary evolution in the dilated space. The unspecified environment can be modeled by just one ancillary qubit, resulting in an implementation scaling of O (2 n -1 n 2 ) elementary gates for the total systemenvironment unitary evolution operator. The second algorithm approximates the non-unitary operators by the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU). On exploiting the diagonal structure of the dissipation, we obtain an optimized representation of the non-unitary part, which requires O (2 n ) elementary gates. Applying the LCU method for a simple dielectric medium with homogeneous dissipation rate, the implementation scaling can be further reduced into O [ poly ( n )] basic gates. For the particular case of weak dissipation we show that our proposed post-selective dilation algorithms can efficiently delve into the transient evolution dynamics of dissipative systems by calculating the respective implementation circuit depth. A connection of our results with the non-linear-in-normalization-only (NINO) quantum channels is also presented.

TI Quantum Entanglement of Photon-Added Coherent States on a Beam Splitter

AB The study of new quantum states and methods for their generation is an important part of the current development of quantum technologies. One of the most important characteristics of such states is their quantum entanglement.

The quantum entanglement of such states passing through a beam splitter has been considered for the first time in this work.

It has been shown that new quantum states have good prospects for their use in quantum technologies.

TI Asymptotic Theory of Quantum Channel Estimation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The quantum Fisher information (QFI), as a function of quantum states, measures the amount of information that a quantum state carries about an unknown parameter. The (entanglement-assisted) QFI of a quantum channel is defined to be the maximum QFI of the output state assuming an entangled input state over a single probe and an ancilla. In quantum metrology, people are interested in calculating the QFI of N identical copies of a quantum channel when N -> infinity, which is called the asymptotic QFI. Over the years, researchers found various types of upper bounds of the asymptotic QFI, but they were proven achievable only in several specific situations. It was known that the asymptotic QFI of an arbitrary quantum channel grows either linearly or quadratically with N. Here we show that a simple criterion can determine whether the scaling is linear or quadratic. In both cases, the asymptotic QFI and a quantum error correction protocol to achieve it are computable via a semidefinite program. When the scaling is quadratic, the Heisenberg limit, a feature of noiseless quantum channels, is recovered. When the scaling is linear, we show that the asymptotic QFI is still in general larger than N times the single-channel QFI and, furthermore, that sequential estimation strategies provide no advantage over parallel ones.

TI Non-Gaussian two mode squeezed thermal states in continuous variable
   quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We consider a practical scheme for the implementation of non-Gaussian operation, viz., photon subtraction, photon addition, and photon catalysis, on two-mode squeezed thermal state. The generated states are employed as resources in continuous-variable quantum teleportation. The results show that the three non-Gaussian operations can enhance the teleportation fidelity. Considering the success probability of the non-Gaussian operations, we identify single-photon catalysis and single photon subtraction to be optimal for teleporting input coherent states and squeezed vacuum states, at low and intermediate squeezing levels, respectively.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We construct a primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of the 48-element binary octahedral (BO) group. This non-Abelian discrete group better approximates SU(2) lattice gauge theory than previous work on the binary tetrahedral group at the cost of one additional qubit-for a total of six-per gauge link. The necessary primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the BO Fourier transform.

TI Digital simulation of convex mixtures of Markovian and non-Markovian
   single qubit Pauli channels on NISQ devices
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum algorithms for simulating quantum systems provide a clear and provable advantage over classical algorithms in fault-tolerant settings. There is also interest in quantum algorithms and their implementation in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) settings. In these settings, various noise sources and errors must be accounted for when executing any experiments. Recently, NISQ devices have been verified as versatile testbeds for simulating open quantum systems and have been used to simulate simple quantum channels. Our goal is to solve the more complicated problem of simulating convex mixtures of single qubit Pauli channels on NISQ devices. We consider two specific cases: mixtures of Markovian channels that result in a non-Markovian channel (M + M = nM) and mixtures of non-Markovian channels that result in a Markovian channel (nM + nM = M). For the first case, we consider mixtures of Markovian single qubit Pauli channels; for the second case, we consider mixtures of Non-Markovian single qubit depolarising channels, which is a special case of the single qubit Pauli channel. We show that efficient circuits, which account for the topology of currently available devices and current levels of decoherence, can be constructed by heuristic approaches that reduce the number of CNOT gates used in our circuit. We also present a strategy for regularising the process matrix so that the process tomography yields a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) channel.Key pointsThis work simulates the convex mixtures of single qubit Markovian and non-Markovian quantum channels on NISQ devices provided by the IMBQE.The circuits used to implement the channels take into account the topolgy of the quantum device used as well as the number of CNOT gates used.We present a strategy for regularising the process matrix to ensure the quantum process tomography yields a CPTP channel. Something that is not correctly implemented in Qiskit.A method is outlined for finding mixtures of non-Markovian depolarising channels that yield a Markovian depolarising channel. It is also shown that, one cannot convexly mix two Markovian depolarising channels that leads to a non-Markovian depolarising channel.

TI High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution by a Spin-Orbit Microlaser
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum key distribution offers a promising avenue for establishing secure communication networks. However, its performance is significantly hampered by the conventional two-level information carriers (i.e., qubits) due to their limited information capacity and noise resilience. A fundamental approach to overcoming these limitations involves the adoption of high-dimensional qudits. Practical qudit platforms require robust propagation, outstanding controllability, and extreme compactness, to which integrated photonics provides a promising solution. Here, we achieved, for the first time, microlaser-enabled highdimensional quantum communication through leveraging spin-orbit photon qudits, where the dynamical generation and manipulation of these multi-degrees-of-freedom complex quantum state are realized by a non-Hermitian-physics-driven integrated microlaser quantum transmitter. Such a microlaser photon manipulation, as a novel route towards high-dimensional quantum state generation, promises high energy efficiency, along with fast, compact, and precise qudit state reconfigurability. The four spin-orbit eigenstates emitted by the microlaser possess the same spatial-temporal structures, ensuring homogeneity between all qudit states used for key distribution, which effectively eliminates propagation dephasing and walk-off problems, thereby delivering the high-dimensional spin-orbit secret key generation to construct a robust quantum link. The demonstrated long-term system stability showcases the practical potential of the microlaser quantum transmitter, providing a critical step towards compact, high-information-capacity quantum communication networks.

TI Multipartite generalization of geometric measure of discord
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Radhakrishnan et al. (2020) proposed a generalization of quantum discord to multipartite systems, which is consistent with the conventional definition of discord in bipartite systems, and derived explicit formulae for any multipartite state. These results are significant in capturing quantum correlations for multi-qubit systems. We propose a generalization of the geometric measure of bipartite quantum discord to the multipartite case in the same manner. We find generic forms of the generalization of the geometric measure of quantum discord in a general N-partite quantum state. Further, we obtain computable exact formulas for the generalization of the geometric measure of quantum discord in an N-qubit quantum state, which includes the results obtained in [arXiv:2104.12344].

TI Optimizing Stabilizer Parities for Improved Logical Qubit Memories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study variants of Shor's code that are adept at handling single-axis correlated idling errors, which are commonly observed in many quantum systems. By using the repetition code structure of the Shor's code basis states, we calculate the logical channel applied to the encoded information when subjected to coherent and correlated single qubit idling errors, followed by stabilizer measurement. Changing the signs of the stabilizer generators allows us to change how the coherent errors interfere, leading to a quantum error correcting code which performs as well as a classical repetition code of equivalent distance against these errors. We demonstrate a factor of 3.78 +/- 1.20 improvement of the logical T2* in a distance-3 logical qubit implemented on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Even-distance versions of our Shor-code variants are decoherence-free subspaces and fully robust to identical and independent coherent idling noise.

TI Hardware-efficient stabilization of entanglement via engineered
   dissipation in superconducting circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Generation and preservation of quantum entanglement are among the primary tasks in quantum information processing. State stabilization via quantum bath engineering offers a resource-efficient approach to achieve this objective. However, current methods for engineering dissipative channels to stabilize target entangled states often require specialized hardware designs, complicating experimental realization and hindering their compatibility with scalable quantum computation architectures. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a stabilization protocol readily implementable in the mainstream integrated superconducting quantum circuits. The approach utilizes a Raman process involving a resonant (or nearly resonant) superconducting qubit array and the qubits' dedicated readout resonators to effectively develop nonlocal dissipative channels. Leveraging individual controllability of the qubits and resonators, the protocol stabilizes two-qubit Bell states with a fidelity of 90.7%, marking the highest reported value in solid-state platforms to date. Furthermore, by extending this strategy to include three qubits, an entangled W state is achieved with a fidelity of 86.2%. This demonstrates the protocol's extensibility beyond two-qubit systems. Notably, the protocol is of practical interest since it only utilizes existing hardware common to standard operations in the underlying superconducting circuits, thereby facilitating the exploration of many-body quantum entanglement with dissipative resources.

TI Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation with shortened path on
   superconducting circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Recently, nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation has received much attention due to its fast manipulation and intrinsic error-resilience characteristics. However, to obtain universal geometric quantum control, only limited and special evolution paths have been proposed, which usually require longer gate-time and more operational steps, and thus lead to lower quality of the implemented quantum gates. Here, we present an effective scheme to find the shortest geometric path under conventional conditions of geometric quantum computation, where high-fidelity and robust geometric gates can be realized by only single-loop evolution, and the gate performances are better than the corresponding dynamical ones. Furthermore, we can optimize the pulse shapes in our scheme to further shorten the gate-time, which is determined by how fast the path is traveled. In addition, we also present its physical implementation on superconducting circuits, consisting of capacitively coupled transmon qubits, where fidelities of geometric single- and two-qubit gates can be higher than 99.95% and 99.80% within the current state-of-the-art experimental technologies, respectively. These results indicate that our scheme is promising for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The long distance entanglement in finite size open Fermi-Hubbard chains, together with the end-to-end quantum teleportation are investigated. We show the peculiarity of the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model to support maximum long distance entanglement, which allows it to operate as a quantum resource for high fidelity long distance quantum teleportation. We determine the physical properties and conditions for creating scalable long distance entanglement and analyze its stability under the effect of the Coulomb interaction and the hopping amplitude. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the measurement basis in the protocol can drastically affect the fidelity of quantum teleportation and we argue that perfect information transfer can be attained by choosing an adequate basis reflecting the salient properties of the quantum channel, i.e. Hubbard projective measurements.

TI Compression of Entanglement Improves Quantum Communication
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Shared entanglement can significantly amplify classical correlations between systems interacting over a limited quantum channel. A natural avenue is to use entanglement of the same dimension as the channel because this allows for unitary encodings, which preserve global coherence until a measurement is performed. Contrasting this, a distributed task based on a qubit channel is demonstrated, for which irreversible encoding operations can outperform any possible coherence-preserving protocol. This corresponds to using high-dimensional entanglement and encoding information by compressing one of the subsystems into a qubit. Demonstrating this phenomenon requires the preparation of a 4D maximally entangled state, the compression of two qubits into one and joint qubit-ququart entangled measurements, with all modules executed at near-optimal fidelity. A proof-of-principle experiment is reported that achieves the advantage by realizing separate systems in distinct and independently controlled paths of a single photon. This result demonstrates the relevance of high-dimensional entanglement and non-unitary operations for enhancing the communication capabilities of standard qubit transmissions.

TI Demonstrating multi-round subsystem quantum error correction using

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum error correction offers a promising path for performing high fidelity quantum computations. Although fully fault-tolerant executions of algorithms remain unrealized, recent improvements in control electronics and quantum hardware enable increasingly advanced demonstrations of the necessary operations for error correction. Here, we perform quantum error correction on superconducting qubits connected in a heavy-hexagon lattice. We encode a logical qubit with distance three and perform several rounds of fault-tolerant syndrome measurements that allow for the correction of any single fault in the circuitry. Using real-time feedback, we reset syndrome and flag qubits conditionally after each syndrome extraction cycle. We report decoder dependent logical error, with average logical error per syndrome measurement in Z(X)-basis of similar to 0.040 (similar to 0.088) and similar to 0.037 (similar to 0.087) for matching and maximum likelihood decoders, respectively, on leakage post-selected data.

TI Symmetries of Multipartite Weyl Quantum Channels

AB Quantum channels define key objects in quantum information theory. They are represented by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps in matrix algebras. We analyze a family of quantum channels defined through the use of the Weyl operators. Such channels provide generalization of the celebrated qubit Pauli channels. Moreover, they are covariant with respective to the finite group generated by Weyl operators. In what follows, we study self-adjoint Weyl channels by providing a special Hermitian representation. For a prime dimension of the corresponding Hilbert space, the self-adjoint Weyl channels contain well-known generalized Pauli channels as a special case. We propose multipartite generalization of Weyl channels. In particular, we analyze the power of prime dimensions using finite fields and study the covariance properties of these objects.

TI Light-Cone Feature Selection for Quantum Machine Learning
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Feature selection plays an essential role in improving the predictive performance and interpretability of trained models in classical machine learning. On the other hand, the usability of conventional feature selection can be limited for quantum machine learning (QML) tasks; the technique may not provide a clear interpretation on embedding quantum circuits for classical data tasks and, more importantly, is not applicable to quantum data tasks. In this work, a feature selection method is proposed with a specific focus on QML. This scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. Its versatility is numerically demonstrated for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data. The proposed framework paves the way toward applications of QML to practical tasks. Also, this technique could be used to practically test if the QML tasks really need quantumness, while it is beyond the scope of this work.

AB The overheads of classical decoding for quantum error correction in cryogenic quantum systems grow rapidly with the number of logical qubits and their correction code distance. Decoding at room temperature is bottlenecked by refrigerator I/O bandwidth while cryogenic on-chip decoding is limited by area/power/thermal budget.
   To overcome these overheads, we are motivated by the observation that in the common case (over 90% of the time), error correction 'syndromes' are fairly trivial with high redundancy / sparsity, since the error correction codes are over-provisioned to be able to correct for uncommon worst-case complex scenarios (to ensure substantially low logical error rates). If suitably exploited, these trivial scenarios can be handled with insignificant overhead, thereby alleviating any bottlenecks towards handling the worst-case scenarios by state-of-the-art means.
   We propose Better Than Worst-Case Decoding for Quantum Error Correction, targeting cryogenic quantum systems and Surface Code, consisting of:
   On-chip Clique Decoder: An extremely lightweight decoder for correcting trivial common-case errors, designed for the cryogenic domain. The decoder is implemented and evaluated for SFQ logic.
   Statistical Off-chip Bandwidth Allocation: Astatistical confidence-based technique for allocation of off-chip decoding bandwidth, to efficiently handle the rare complex decodes that are not covered by the Clique Decoder.
   Decode-Overflow Execution Stalling: A method to stall circuit execution, for the worst-case scenarios in which the provisioned off-chip bandwidth is insufficient to complete all requested off-chip decodes.
   In all, BTWC decoding achieves 70-99+% off-chip bandwidth elimination across a range of logical and physical error rates, without significantly sacrificing the accuracy of a state-of-the-art off-chip decoder. Further, it achieves 10-1000x bandwidth reduction over prior bandwidth reduction techniques, as well as 15-37x resource overhead reduction compared to prior on-chip decoding.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for dual-threshold image segmentation
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB The intrinsic high parallelism and entanglement characteristics of quantum computing have made quantum image processing techniques a focus of great interest. One of the most widely used techniques in image processing is segmentation, which in one of their most basic forms can be carried out using thresholding algorithms. In this paper, a fault-tolerant quantum dual-threshold algorithm has been proposed. This algorithm has been built using only Clifford+T gates for compatibility with error detection and correction codes. Because fault-tolerant implementation of T gates has a much higher cost than other quantum gates, our focus has been on reducing the number of these gates. This has allowed adding noise tolerance, computational cost reduction, and fault tolerance to the state-of-the-art dual-threshold segmentation circuits. Since the dual-threshold image segmentation involves the comparison operation, as part of this work we have implemented two full comparator circuits. These circuits optimize the metrics T-count and T-depth with respect to the best circuit comparators currently available in the literature.

TI Toward deterministic sources: Photon generation in a fiber-cavity
   quantum memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate the generation of photons within a fiber-cavity quantum memory, followed by later on-demand readout. Signal photons are generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a fiber cavity comprising a birefringent fiber with dichroic reflective end facets. The detection of the partner herald photon indicates the creation of the stored signal photon. After a delay, the signal photon is switched out of resonance with the fiber cavity by intracavity frequency translation using Bragg scattering four-wave mixing, driven by ancillary control pulses. We measure sub-Poissonian statistics in the output signal mode, with g(AC)((2)) = 0.54(1) in the first readout bin and a readout frequency translation efficiency of approximate to 80%. The 1/e memory lifetime is approximate to 67 cavity cycles, or 1.68 mu s. In an alternate fiber cavity, we show a strategy for noise reduction and measure g(AC)((2)) = 0.068(10) after one cavity cycle.

TI Protecting qubit coherence by spectrally engineered driving of the spin
   environment
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Modern quantum technologies rely crucially on techniques to mitigate quantum decoherence; these techniques can be either passive, achieved for example via materials engineering, or active, typically achieved via pulsed monochromatic driving fields applied to the qubit. Using a solid-state defect spin coupled to a microwave-driven spin bath, we experimentally demonstrate a decoherence mitigation method based on spectral engineering of the environmental noise with a polychromatic drive waveform, and show that it outperforms monochromatic techniques. Results are in agreement with quantitative modeling, and open the path to active decoherence protection using custom-designed waveforms applied to the environment rather than the qubit.

AB 6G will lay its foundations on new paradigms and requirements. This new technology is expected to provide global coverage, exploring a huge spectral chunk (sub-6 GHz, mmWave, THz and optical frequency bands) to further increase data rates and connection density. In addition, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data technologies and the emerging paradigms of Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning. This paper focuses on these new paradigms and proposes an indoor location method based on the well known Euclidean Distance in its quantum version. Specifically, an example of this use case is shown, which is executed in one quantum computer from IBM Quantum Experience.The paper analyses the obtained results while exploring new challenges and fields of application of the technology. Results show that the quantum approach is accurate enough to calculate Euclidean Distance between two vectors while outperforming classical computation if vector size is big enough.

TI Deterministic Generation of Multipartite Entanglement via Causal
   Activation in the Quantum Internet
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Entanglement represents "the" key resource for several applications of quantum information processing, ranging from quantum communications to distributed quantum computing. Despite its fundamental importance, deterministic generation of maximally entangled qubits represents an on- going open problem. Here, we design a novel generation scheme exhibiting two attractive features, namely, i) deterministically generating different classes - particularly, GHZ-like, W-like and graph states - of genuinely multipartite entangled states, ii) not requiring any direct interaction between the qubits. Indeed, the only necessary condition is the possibility of coherently controlling - according to the indefinite causal order framework - the causal order among the unitaries acting on the qubits. Through the paper, we analyze and derive the conditions on the unitaries for deterministic generation, and we provide examples for unitaries practical implementation. We conclude the paper by discussing the scalability of the proposed scheme to higher dimensional genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) states and by introducing some possible applications of the proposal for quantum networks.

TI Thermally-induced qubit coherence in quantum electromechanics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum coherence, the ability of a quantum system to be in a superposition of orthogonal quantum states, is a distinct feature of the quantum mechanics, thus marking a deviation from classical physics. Coherence finds its applications in quantum sensing and metrology, quantum thermodynamics and computation. A particularly interesting is the possibility to observe coherence arising in counter-intuitive way from thermal energy that is without implementation of intricate protocols involving coherent driving sequences. In this manuscript, we investigate quantum coherence emerging in a hybrid system composed of a two-level system (qubit) and a thermal quantum harmonic oscillator (a material mechanical oscillator), inspired by recent experimental progress in fabrication of such systems. We show that quantum coherence is created in such a composite system solely from the interaction of the parts and persists under relevant damping. Implementation of such scheme will demonstrate previously unobserved mechanisms of coherence generation and can be beneficial for hybrid quantum technologies with mechanical oscillators and qubits.

TI Optimizing Variational Quantum Neural Networks Based on Collective
   Intelligence
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum machine learning stands out as one of the most promising applications of quantum computing, widely believed to possess potential quantum advantages. In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum, the scale and quality of quantum computers are limited, and quantum algorithms based on fault-tolerant quantum computing paradigms cannot be experimentally verified in the short term. The variational quantum algorithm design paradigm can better adapt to the practical characteristics of noisy quantum hardware and is currently one of the most promising solutions. However, variational quantum algorithms, due to their highly entangled nature, encounter the phenomenon known as the "barren plateau" during the optimization and training processes, making effective optimization challenging. This paper addresses this challenging issue by researching a variational quantum neural network optimization method based on collective intelligence algorithms. The aim is to overcome optimization difficulties encountered by traditional methods such as gradient descent. We study two typical applications of using quantum neural networks: random 2D Hamiltonian ground state solving and quantum phase recognition. We find that the collective intelligence algorithm shows a better optimization compared to gradient descent. The solution accuracy of ground energy and phase classification is enhanced, and the optimization iterations are also reduced. We highlight that the collective intelligence algorithm has great potential in tackling the optimization of variational quantum algorithms.

TI Cryogenic microwave link for quantum local area networks

AB Scalable quantum information processing with superconducting circuits is expected to advance from individual processors located in single dilution refrigerators to more powerful distributed quantum computing systems. The realization of hardware platforms for quantum local area networks (QLANs) compatible with superconducting technology is of high importance in order to achieve a practical quantum advantage. Here, we present a fundamental prototype platform for a microwave QLAN based on a cryogenic link connecting two separate dilution cryostats over a distance of 6.6 m with a base temperature of 52 mK in the center. Superconducting microwave coaxial cables are employed to form a quantum communication channel between the distributed network nodes. We demonstrate the continuous-variable entanglement distribution between the remote dilution refrigerators in the form of two-mode squeezed microwave states, reaching squeezing of 2.10 +/- 0.02 dB and negativity of 0.501 +/- 0.011. Furthermore, we show that quantum entanglement is preserved at channel center temperatures up to 1 K, paving the way towards microwave quantum communication at elevated temperatures. Consequently, such a QLAN system can form the backbone for future distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits.

AB Concerted efforts are underway to establish an infrastructure for a global quantum Internet to realise a spectrum of quantum technologies. This will enable more precise sensors, secure communications, and faster data processing. Quantum communications are a front-runner with quantum networks already implemented in several metropolitan areas. A number of recent proposals have modelled the use of space segments to overcome range limitations of purely terrestrial networks. Rapid progress in the design of quantum devices have enabled their deployment in space for in-orbit demonstrations. We review developments in this emerging area of space-based quantum technologies and provide a roadmap of key milestones towards a complete, global quantum networked landscape. Small satellites hold increasing promise to provide a cost effective coverage required to realise the quantum Internet. The state of art in small satellite missions is reviewed and the most current in-field demonstrations of quantum cryptography are collated. The important challenges in space quantum technologies that must be overcome and recent efforts to mitigate their effects are summarised. A perspective on future developments that would improve the performance of space quantum communications is included. The authors conclude with a discussion on fundamental physics experiments that could take advantage of a global, space-based quantum network.

AB Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a promising quantum computing paradigm that performs computation through "one-way" measurements on entangled quantum qubits. It is widely used in photonic quantum computing (PQC), where the computation is carried out on photonic cluster states (i.e., a 2-D mesh of entangled photons). In MBQC-based PQC, the cluster state depth (i.e., the length of one-way measurements) plays an important role in the overall execution time and circuit error. In this paper, we propose FMCC, a compilation framework that employs dynamic programming with heuristics to efficiently minimize the cluster state depth. Experimental results on six quantum applications show that FMCC achieves 51.7%, 57.4%, and 56.8% average depth reductions in small, medium, and large qubit counts compared to the state-of-the-art MBQC compilations.

TI Feasibility study of quantum computing using trapped electrons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the feasibility of using electrons in a linear Paul trap as qubits in a future quantum computer. We discuss the necessary experimental steps to realize such a device through a concrete design proposal, including trapping, cooling, electronic detection, spin readout, and single-and multiqubit gate operations. Numeric simulations indicate that two-qubit Bell-state fidelities of order 99.99% can be achieved assuming reasonable experimental parameters.

TI Entanglement protection in higher-dimensional systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The inevitable dissipative interaction of an entangled quantum system with its environment causes degradation in quantum correlations present in the system. This can lead to a finite-time disappearance of entanglement, which is known as Entanglement Sudden Death (ESD). Here, we consider an initially entangled qubit-qutrit system and a dissipative noise which leads to ESD, and propose a set of local unitary operations, which when applied on the qubit, qutrit, or both subsystems during the decoherence process, cause ESD to be hastened, delayed, or avoided altogether, depending on its time of application. Delay and avoidance of ESD may find practical application in quantum information processing protocols that would otherwise suffer due to short lifetime of entanglement. The physical implementation of these local unitaries is discussed in the context of an atomic system. The simulation results of such ESD manipulations are presented for two different classes of initially entangled qubit-qutrit systems. A prescription for generalization of this scheme to a qutrit-qutrit system is given. This technique for entanglement protection in the noisy environment is compared with other related techniques such as weak measurement reversal, dynamic decoupling, and quantum Zeno effect.

TI Computable Model-Independent Bounds for Adversarial Quantum Machine
   Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum machine learning (QML) opens doors to novel approaches in machine learning (ML) and offers potential speedup. However, ML models are well documented to be vulnerable to malicious manipulations, and this susceptibility extends to the models of QML. This situation necessitates a thorough understanding of QML's resilience against adversarial attacks, particularly in an era where quantum computing capabilities are expanding. In this regard, this article examines model-independent bounds on adversarial performance for QML. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first computation of an approximate lower bound for adversarial error when evaluating model resilience against sophisticated quantum-based adversarial attacks. Experimental results are compared to the computed bound, demonstrating the potential of QML models to achieve high robustness. In the best case, the experimental error is only 10% above the estimated bound, offering evidence of the inherent robustness of quantum models. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of quantum model resilience but also provides a precise reference bound for the future development of robust QML algorithms.

TI About Implementation of Magic State Injection in Heavy-Hexagon Structure
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Implementing fault-tolerant quantum computing necessitates the realization of logical non-Clifford gates, which requires the preparation of specific quantum states known as magic states. However, IBM's heavy-hexagon structure, which has limited qubit connectivity, presents challenges in adapting quantum error correction codes such as the surface code. Several methods have been proposed to address these challenges by adapting the surface code to the heavy-hexagon architecture. In this study, we implement the magic state injection process within two distinct implementations of surface codes (standard and rotated methods) suitable for the heavy-hexagon structure and compare their logical error rates. Furthermore, we propose initialization methods to enhance the performance of magic state injection in the heavy-hexagon structure, thereby efficiently achieving logical non-Clifford gates with reduced error rates.

TI Bifurcation-Based Quantum Annealing with Nested Spins
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB We study a bifurcation mechanism of quantum annealing. Using spins with quantum number S = 1, we construct a simple model to make a bifurcation. The qutrit can be composed by nesting two qubits. We numerically solve the Schrodinger equation to confirm that the bifurcation-based quantum annealing (BQA) works well and the ground state can be found efficiently. The result is compared with that by the standard quantum annealing (QA) using qubits. We find that the performance of the BQA is comparable to the standard QA, or gives better results in some cases.

TI Long-lived optical coherence and spin lifetimes in

   memories
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Rare earth ions (REI) in solid materials are among the leading systems for quantum technology applications. However, developing practical REI quantum devices with long-lived coherent states remains challenging due to great difficulties in growing high-quality REI materials and incomplete understanding of their decoherence mechanisms. In this work, we report a long optical coherence time of 422 +/- 11 mu s for the 7F0 -> 5D0 transition, as well as a lifetime exceeding 30 hours for the 7F0 hyperfine spin states in Eu3+:Y2O3 optical ceramics. We identify the absence of two-level-system induced optical decoherence in short-range-ordered crystals and a decoherence mechanism caused by perturbing magnetic centers that were not detected previously below 1.5 K. Furthermore, we demonstrate coherent light storage over 5 mu s by using the atomic frequency comb protocol. These results provide a promising proof-of-principle demonstration of quantum memory using Eu3+:Y2O3 optical ceramic system, highlighting its significant potential for practical quantum applications.

TI Bosonic quantum error correction with neutral atoms in optical dipole
   traps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bosonic quantum error correction codes encode logical qubits in the Hilbert space of one or multiple harmonic oscillators. A prominent class of bosonic codes is that of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes of which implementations have been demonstrated with trapped ions and microwave cavities. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the preparation and error correction of a GKP qubit in a vibrational mode of a neutral atom stored in an optical dipole trap. This platform has recently shown remarkable progress in simultaneously controlling the motional and electronic degrees of freedom of trapped atoms. The protocols we develop make use of motional states and, additionally, internal electronic states of the trapped atom to serve as an ancilla qubit. We compare optical tweezer arrays and optical lattices and find that the latter provide more flexible control over the confinement in the out-of-plane direction, which can be utilized to optimize the conditions for the implementation of GKP codes. Concretely, the different frequency scales that the harmonic oscillators in the axial and radial lattice directions exhibit and a small oscillator anharmonicity prove to be beneficial for robust encodings of GKP states. Finally, we underpin the experimental feasibility of the proposed protocols by numerically simulating the preparation of GKP qubits in an optical lattice with realistic parameters.

TI Dynamically Corrected Nonadiabatic Holonomic Quantum Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The key for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation lies in maintaining the coherence of all qubits so that high-fidelity and robust quantum manipulations on them can be achieved. One of the promising approaches is to use geometric phases in the construction of universal quantum gates, due to their intrinsic robustness against certain types of local noise. However, due to limitations in previous implementations, the noise-resilience feature of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) still needs to be improved. Here, in combination with the dynamical-correction technique, we propose a general protocol of universal NHQC with simplified control, which can greatly suppress the effect of the accompanied X errors, retaining the main merit of geometric quantum operations. Numerical simulation shows that the performance of our gate can be much better than that of previous protocols. Remarkably, when incorporating a decoherence-free subspace encoding for the collective dephasing noise, our scheme can also be robust against the involved Z errors. In addition, we also outline the physical implementation of the protocol, which is insensitive to both X and Z errors. Therefore, our protocol provides a promising strategy for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Tutorial: calibration refinement in quantum annealing
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum annealing has emerged as a powerful platform for simulating and optimizing classical and quantum Ising models. Quantum annealers, like other quantum and/or analog computing devices, are susceptible to non-idealities including crosstalk, device variation, and environmental noise. Compensating for these effects through calibration refinement or "shimming" can significantly improve performance but often relies on ad-hoc methods that exploit symmetries in both the problem being solved and the quantum annealer itself. In this tutorial, we attempt to demystify these methods. We introduce methods for finding exploitable symmetries in Ising models and discuss how to use these symmetries to suppress unwanted bias. We work through several examples of increasing complexity and provide complete Python code. We include automated methods for two important tasks: finding copies of small subgraphs in the qubit connectivity graph and automatically finding symmetries of an Ising model via generalized graph automorphism. We conclude the tutorial by surveying additional methods, providing practical implementation tips, and discussing limitations and remedies of the calibration procedure. Code is available at: https://github.com/dwavesystems/shimming-tutorial.

TI Quantum magnonics: When magnon spintronics meets quantum information
   science
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Spintronics and quantum information science are two promising candidates for innovating information processing technologies. The combination of these two fields enables us to build solid-state platforms for studying quantum phenomena and for realizing multi-functional quantum tasks. For a long time, however, the intersection of these two fields was limited due to the distinct properties of the classical magnetization, that is manipulated in spintronics, and quantum bits, that are utilized in quantum information science. This situation has changed significantly over the last few years because of the remarkable progress in coding and processing information using magnons. On the other hand, significant advances in understanding the entanglement of quasi-particles and in designing high-quality qubits and photonic cavities for quantum information processing provide physical platforms to integrate magnons with quantum systems. From these endeavours, the highly interdisciplinary field of quantum magnonics emerges, which combines spintronics, quantum optics and quantum information science. Here, we give an overview of the recent developments concerning the quantum states of magnons and their hybridization with mature quantum platforms. First, we review the basic concepts of magnons and quantum entanglement and discuss the generation and manipulation of quantum states of magnons, such as single-magnon states, squeezed states and quantum many-body states including Bose-Einstein condensation and the resulting spin superfluidity. We discuss how magnonic systems can be integrated and entangled with quantum platforms including cavity photons, superconducting qubits, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and phonons for coherent information transfer and collaborative information processing. The implications of these hybrid quantum systems for non-Hermitian physics and parity-time symmetry are highlighted, together with applications in quantum memories and high-precision measurements. Finally, we present an outlook on some of the challenges and opportunities in quantum magnonics.

TI Engineering bosonic codes with quantum lattice gates
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. However, previous quantum gates lack analytical methods for decomposing quantum circuits and require complex implementation techniques. In this paper, we introduce a universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate. We develop a systematic analytical framework for engineering bosonic code states based on Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s), and apply our method to single code state preparation, code space embedding, and transformation. We also explore the application of our method to autonomous quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of the Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.

   electromagnetically-induced-transparency memory on the Cs D1 line
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum memories promise to enable global quantum repeater networks. For field applications, alkali-metal vapors constitute an exceptional storage platform, as neither cryogenics, nor strong magnetic fields are required. We demonstrate a technologically simple, in principle satellite-suited quantum memory based on electromagnetically induced transparency on the cesium D1 line, and focus on the tradeoff between end-to-end efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, both being key parameters in applications. For coherent pulses containing one photon on average, we achieve storage and retrieval with end-to-end efficiencies of eta e2e = 13(2)%, which correspond to internal memory efficiencies of eta mem = 33(1 )%. Simultaneously, we achieve a noise level corresponding to mu 1 = 0.07(2) signal photons. This noise is dominated by spontaneous Raman scattering, with contributions from fluorescence. Four-wave mixing noise is negligible, allowing for further minimization of the total noise level.

TI One qubit as a universal approximant
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A single-qubit circuit can approximate any bounded complex function stored in the degrees of freedom defining its quantum gates. The single-qubit approximant presented in this work is operated through a series of gates that take as their parametrization the independent variable of the target function and an additional set of adjustable parameters. The independent variable is re-uploaded in every gate while the parameters are optimized for each target function. The output state of this quantum circuit becomes more accurate as the number of re-uploadings of the independent variable increases, i.e., as more layers of gates parameterized with the independent variable are applied. In this work, we provide two proofs of this claim related to both the Fourier series and the universal approximation theorem for neural networks, and we benchmark both methods against their classical counterparts. We further implement a single-qubit approximant in a real superconducting qubit device, demonstrating how the ability to describe a set of functions improves with the depth of the quantum circuit. This work shows the robustness of the re-uploading technique on quantum machine learning.

TI Witnessing entanglement in trapped-ion quantum error correction under
   realistic noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) exploits redundancy by encoding logical information into multiple physical qubits. In current implementations of QEC, sequences of nonperfect two-qubit entangling gates are used to codify the information redundantly into multipartite entangled states. Also, to extract the error syndrome, a series of two-qubit gates are used to build parity-check readout circuits. In the case of noisy gates, both steps cannot be performed perfectly, and an error model needs to be provided to assess the performance of QEC. We present a detailed microscopic error model to estimate the average gate infidelity of two-qubit light-shift gates used in trapped-ion platforms. We analytically derive leading-error contributions in terms of microscopic parameters and present effective error models that connect the error rates typically used in phenomenological accounts to the microscopic gate infidelities hereby derived. We then apply this realistic error model to quantify the multipartite entanglement generated by circuits that act as QEC building blocks. We do so by using entanglement witnesses, complementing in this way the recent studies in Ref. [Phys. Rev. X 12, 011032 (2022); PRX Quantum 2, 020304 (2021)] by exploring the effects of a more realistic microscopic noise.

In this work, quantum circuits for the exact and approximate preparation of total spin eigenfunctions on quantum computers are presented. Two different strategies are discussed and compared: exact recursive construction of total spin eigenfunctions based on the addition theorem of angular momentum, and heuristic approximation of total spin eigenfunctions based on the variational optimization of a suitable cost function. The construction of these quantum circuits is illustrated in detail, and the preparation of total spin eigenfunctions is demonstrated on IBM quantum devices, focusing on three- and five-spin systems on graphs with triangle connectivity.

TI Certification of a non-projective qudit measurement using multiport
   beamsplitters
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The most common form of measurement in quantum mechanics projects a wavefunction onto orthogonal states that correspond to definite outcomes. However, generalized quantum measurements that do not fully project quantum states are possible and have an important role in quantum information tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to certify that an experiment harvests the advantages made possible by generalized measurements, especially beyond the simplest two-level qubit system. Here we show that multiport beamsplitters allow for the robust realization of high-quality generalized measurements in higher-dimensional systems with more than two levels. Using multicore optical fibre technology, we implement a seven-outcome generalized measurement in a four-dimensional Hilbert space with a fidelity of 99.7%. We present a practical quantum communication task and demonstrate a success rate that cannot be simulated in any conceivable quantum protocol based on standard projective measurements on quantum messages of the same dimension. Our approach, which is compatible with modern photonic platforms, showcases an avenue for faithful and high-quality implementation of genuinely non-projective quantum measurements beyond qubit systems.

TI Quantum entanglement in a four-partite hybrid system containing three
   macroscopic subsystems
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB In this work, we consider a setup consisting of an atomic ensemble enclosed within a laser-driven optomechanical cavity, having the moving mirror further (capacitively) coupled to a low-frequency LC circuit. This constitutes a four-partite optoelectromechanical quantum system containing three macroscopic quantum subsystems of a different nature, viz, the atomic ensemble, the massive mirror and the LC circuit. The quantized cavity field plays the role of an auxiliary system that allows the coupling of two other quantum subsystems. We show that for experimentally achievable parameters, it is possible to generate steady-state bipartite Gaussian entanglement between pairs of macroscopic systems. In particular, we find under which conditions it is possible to obtain a reasonable amount of entanglement between the atomic ensemble and the LC circuit, systems that might be suitable for constituting a quantum memory and for quantum processing, respectively. For complementarity, we discuss the effect of the environmental temperature on quantum entanglement.

TI Chromatic Quantum Contextuality
SO ENTROPY
AB Chromatic quantum contextuality is a criterion of quantum nonclassicality based on (hyper)graph coloring constraints. If a quantum hypergraph requires more colors than the number of outcomes per maximal observable (context), it lacks a classical realization with n-uniform outcomes per context. Consequently, it cannot represent a "completable" noncontextual set of coexisting n-ary outcomes per maximal observable. This result serves as a chromatic analogue of the Kochen-Specker theorem. We present an explicit example of a four-colorable quantum logic in dimension three. Furthermore, chromatic contextuality suggests a novel restriction on classical truth values, thereby excluding two-valued measures that cannot be extended to n-ary colorings. Using this framework, we establish new bounds for the house, pentagon, and pentagram hypergraphs, refining previous constraints.

TI Low-Overhead Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction with the
   Surface-GKP Code
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fault-tolerant quantum error correction is essential for implementing quantum algorithms of significant practical importance. In this work, we propose a highly effective use of the surface Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, i.e., the surface code consisting of bosonic GKP qubits instead of bare two-level qubits. In our proposal, we use error-corrected two-qubit gates between GKP qubits and introduce a maximum-likelihood decoding strategy for correcting shift errors in the two-GKP-qubit gates. Our proposed decoding reduces the total CNOT failure rate of the GKP qubits, e.g., from 0.87% to 0.36% at a GKP squeezing of 12 dB, compared to the case where the simple closest-integer decoding is used. Then, by concatenating the GKP code with the surface code, we find that the threshold GKP squeezing is given by 9.9 dB under the the assumption that finite squeezing of the GKP states is the dominant noise source. More importantly, we show that a low logical failure rate p(L) < 10(-7) can be achieved with moderate hardware requirements, e.g., 291 modes and 97 qubits at a GKP squeezing of 12 dB as opposed to 1457 bare qubits for the standard rotated surface code at an equivalent noise level (i.e., p = 0.36%). Such a low failure rate of our surface-GKP code is possible through the use of space-time correlated edges in the matching graphs of the surface-code decoder. Further, all edge weights in the matching graphs are computed dynamically based on analog information from the GKP error correction using the full history of all syndrome measurement rounds. We also show that a highly squeezed GKP state of GKP squeezing greater than or similar to 12 dB can be experimentally realized by using a dissipative stabilization method, namely, the big-small-big method, with fairly conservative experimental parameters. Lastly, we introduce a three-level ancilla scheme to mitigate ancilla decay errors during a GKP state preparation.

TI Noise Robustness and Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum Generative
   Adversarial Network for Continuous Distributions
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The potential advantage of machine learning in quantum computers is a topic of intense discussion in the literature. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental explorations will most likely be required to understand its power. There have been different algorithms proposed to exploit the probabilistic nature of variational quantum circuits for generative modeling. In this paper, a hybrid architecture for quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) is employed and their robustness in the presence of noise is studied. A simple way of adding different types of noise to the quantum generator circuit is devised, and the noisy hybrid QGANs (HQGANs) are simulated numerically to learn continuous probability distributions, and to show that the performance of HQGANs remains unaffected. The effect of different parameters on the training time is also investigated to reduce the computational scaling of the algorithm and simplify its deployment on a quantum computer. The training on Rigetti's Aspen-4-2Q-A quantum processing unit is then performed, and the results from the training are presented. The authors' results pave the way for experimental exploration of different quantum machine learning algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Drive-Loss Engineering and Quantum Discord Probing of Synchronized
   Optomechanical Squeezing
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In an optomechanical system (OMS), the dynamics of quantum correlations, e.g., quantum discord, can witness synchronized squeezing between the cavity and mechanical modes. We investigate an OMS driven by two coherent fields, and demonstrate that optimal quantum correlations and squeezing synchronization can be achieved by carefully tuning key parameters: the cavity-laser detunings, loss rates, and the effective coupling ratio between the optomechanical interaction and the amplitude drive. By employing the steady-state solution of the covariance matrix within the Lyapunov framework, we identify the conditions under which squeezing becomes stabilized. Furthermore, we demonstrate that synchronized squeezing of the cavity and mechanical modes can be effectively controlled by tuning the loss ratio between the cavity and mechanical subsystems. Alternatively, in the case where the cavity is driven by a single field, we demonstrate that synchronized squeezing in the conjugate quadratures of the cavity and mechanical modes can still be achieved, provided that the cavity is coupled to a squeezed reservoir. The presence of this engineered reservoir compensates the absent driving field, by injecting directional quantum noise, thereby enabling the emergence of steady-state squeezing correlations between the two modes. A critical aspect of our study reveals how the interplay between dissipative and driven-dispersive squeezing mechanisms governs the system's bandwidth and robustness against decoherence. Our findings provide a versatile framework for manipulating quantum correlations and squeezing in OMS, with applications in quantum metrology, sensing, and the engineering of nonclassical states. This work advances the understanding of squeezing synchronization and offers new strategies for enhancing quantum-coherent phenomena in dissipative environments.

   Many quantum systems have access to higher levels, expanding the computational space for a device. We develop higher level qudit communication circuits, compilation pipelines, and circuits that take advantage of this extra space by temporarily pushing qudits into these higher levels. We show how these methods are able to more efficiently use the device, and where they see diminishing returns.

TI Performance Analysis of Different Quantum Key Distribution Protocols for
   Optimised Security and Efficiency
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are techniques that use the laws of quantum physics to safely distribute cryptographic keys. QKD protocols are able to identify attempts at eavesdropping during the distribution of keys, possibly providing a better level of security than traditional encryption. We present a comparative evaluation of the three QKD protocols, namely, BB84, E91 and an enhanced BB84 (EBB84) with the goal of identifying the best balance between security and efficiency for practical quantum communication systems. Motivated by the growing need for quantum-resistant cryptography, extensive simulations in the Qiskit framework under both ideal and plausible noisy conditions is conducted, including depolarising, thermal relaxation, Pauli, amplitude damping and phase damping noise models. For each protocol, key lengths are varied from 200 to 3000 bits and, where relevant, simulated intercept-resend attacks to assess resilience against eavesdropping. The key performance metrics, QBER for BB84/EBB84 and the CHSH inequality parameter for E91 are computed over 50 iterations per scenario to ensure statistical robustness. The analysis reveals distinct trade-offs: EBB84 achieves superior early eavesdropper detection at short key lengths, whereas differences between BB84 and EBB84 diminishes as key lengths increases; E91 maintains strong entanglement-based security but is more sensitive to certain noise types. Regression analysis confirms that depolarising and amplitude damping noise most strongly influence QBER and CHSH degradation, whereas key length has a secondary effect. These findings mark the importance of adaptive key management and noise mitigation strategies and offer guidelines for integrating QKD into emerging network architectures such as SDN, 5G, and 6G.

TI Quantum sensing with bright two-mode squeezed light in a distributed
   network of gyroscopes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift- corresponding to the average angular rotation-across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M-mode entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of '9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of '9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.

TI Teleportation of Werner state via graphene-based quantumchannels under
   dephasing environment
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The teleportation of Werner state in the graphene-based quantum channels under the dephasingenvironment is studied through the effective low-energy theory in this paper. The results show that the outputentanglement normally reaches a higher level as the input entanglement increases, while the performance of thecorresponding fidelity is opposite. Given the input state, the greater entanglement in the quantum channel canprovide the higher-quality output state. For graphene-based quantum channels, the low temperature and weakCoulomb repulsive potential can decelerate the attenuation of entanglement resources in the dephasingenvironment. Moreover, when the temperature is lower than 40 K and the coulomb repulsive potential betweenelectrons is less than 6 eV, the average fidelity of the output state reaches more than 80%. These resultsindicate that graphene has potential applications in quantum information.

TI Quantum teleportation, entanglement, LQU and LQFI in e+e → YY
   processes at BESIII through noisy channels
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Quantum teleportation, a protocol that has received extensive and intensive attention in quantum information processing, allows a quantum state to be transferred from one particle to another. In this study, we analytically investigate fidelity (F), logarithmic negativity (LN), local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) as a discord-like measure of quantum correlations in e+e-- YY processes at BESIII through noisy channels, using experimental feasible parameters, where Y and Y refer to the spin-1/2 hyperon and its antihyperon, respectively. We discuss the dependence of LN, LQU and LQFI on the scattering angle theta for different hyperon-antihyperon pairs (Lambda Lambda, Xi 0 Xi 0, Xi-Xi+, Sigma+Sigma-),produced by electron-positron annihilation via charmonium decay. Without a dephasing effect, we show that, LN, LQU, and LQFI vanish at phi = +/-pi and are symmetric around phi = pi/2. Furthermore, LN reaches its maximum when the scattering angle equals phi = pi/2, while LQU and LQFI reach their maxima at different angles. We also explore the LN, LQU, and LQFI for different YY pairs subjected to three distinct types of decoherence channels. Specifically, we show that amplitude damping (AD) and phase damping (PD) lead to a decrease in LN, LQU, and LQFI with an increasing decoherence parameter s. In contrast, the phase flip (PF) channel exhibits symmetric behavior around s = 1/2. Besides, we realize for teleportation, optimal fidelity for different hyperon-antihyperon pairs (Lambda Lambda, Xi 0 Xi 0, Xi- Xi+, Sigma+ Sigma-). We discuss the influence of noisy channels, specifically (AD, PF and PD), on the fidelity of quantum teleportation and on quantum correlations that can exist even beyond entanglement. Furthermore, the results show that the fidelity remains above the classical limit of 2/3 in all three channels, even as the noise increases. This is a significant finding because it shows that not all quantum noise is detrimental. These results can have promising applications in quantum information and particle physics.

TI Quantum Safe Proxy Blind Signature Protocol Based on 3D Entangled
   GHZ-Type States
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
AB As quantum technology advances, classical digital signatures exhibit vulnerabilities in preserving security properties during the transmission of information. Working toward a reliable communication protocol, we introduce a proxy blind signature scheme to teleport a single particle qubit state with a message to the receiver, employing a three qubit GHZ entangled state. The blindness property is utilized to secure the message information from the proxy signer. A trusted party, Trent, is introduced to supervise the communication process. Alice blinds the original message and sends the Bell measurements with her entangled particle to proxy signer Charlie. After receiving measurements from Alice and Charlie, Bob verifies the proxy blind signature and performs appropriate unitary operations on his particle. Thereafter, Trent verifies the security of the quantum teleportation setup by matching the output data with the original data sent by Alice. Security analysis results prove that the proposed scheme fulfils the basic security necessities, including undeniability, unforgeability, blindness, verifiability, and traceability.

TI Optical and hyperfine spectroscopic investigations on europium ions
   doped in yttrium orthosilicate waveguides fabricated by focused ion beam
   milling
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum memory is a crucial element in large-scale quantum networks. Integrated quantum memories based on micro-/-nano structures, such as waveguides, can significantly enhance the scalability and reduce the consumption of optical and electrical power. Eu-151(3+):Y2SiO5 stands out as an exceptional candidate material for quantum memory, because it possesses a spin coherence lifetime of 6 h and an optical storage lifetime of 1 h. Here we employ focused ion beam technology to fabricate a triangular nanobeam on the surface of a Y2SiO5 crystal. The width and length of the nanobeam are 2 mu m and 20 mu m, respectively. The optical lifetime and inhomogeneous broadening of Eu-151(3+) in the triangular nanobeam are measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. The optical lifetime is (1.9 +/- 0.1) ms and the optical inhomogeneous broadening is (1.58 +/- 0.05) GHz at a doping level of 0.07% for Eu-151(3+). The hyperfine transition spectra are measured by using optically detected magnetic resonance and spin inhomogeneous broadening of (19 +/- 3) kHz is obtained. Furthermore, we analyze the coherence properties of optical and hyperfine transitions, respectively, via transient spectral hole burning and spin echo measurement. We obtain an optical homogeneous linewidth down to (22 +/- 3) kHz, which is still limited by the instantaneous spectral diffusion. The spin coherence lifetime under the geomagnetic field is (5.1 +/- 0.6) ms. The results demonstrate that Eu-151(3+) ions embedded within the 2 mu m triangular nanobeam essentially retain the same optical and hyperfine transition properties as those observed in bulk crystals. Consequently, this research lays a foundation for studying the integrated quantum memories based on Eu-151(3+) ensembles and the detection of the single Eu-151(3+) ion based on the focused ion beam technique.

In this paper, based on the quantum variational algorithm, we propose a novel scheme to train an Ansatz circuit and realize high-fidelity compilation of a set of universal quantum gates for singlet-triplet qubits in semiconductor double quantum dots, a fairly heavily constrained system. Furthermore, we propose a scalable architecture for a modular implementation of quantum programs in this constrained systems and validate its performance with two representative demonstrations, the Grover's algorithm for the database searching (static compilation) and a variant of variational quantum eigensolver for the Max-Cut optimization (dynamic compilation). Our methods are potentially applicable to a wide range of physical devices. This work constitutes an important stepping-stone for exploiting the potential for advanced and complicated quantum algorithms on near-term devices.

TI Modular architectures and entanglement schemes for error-corrected
   distributed quantum computation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Connecting multiple smaller qubit modules by generating high-fidelity entanglement is a promising path for scaling quantum computing hardware. The performance of such a modular quantum computer depends on the quality and rate of entanglement generation. However, identifying optimal architectures and entanglement generation protocols remains an open question. How can modular quantum architectures be designed to achieve fault tolerance while requiring only feasible entanglement rates and hardware? Focusing on solid-state quantum hardware, we investigate the threshold and logical failure rate of a fully distributed surface code. We consider both emission-based and scattering-based entanglement schemes between the modules to link the performance to the physical hardware and identify the regime for fault tolerance. We compare architectures with one or two data qubits per module. For some entanglement schemes, thresholds nearing the thresholds of non-distributed implementations (similar to 0.4%) appear feasible with future parameters minimizing the performance gap between modular and monolithic quantum processors.

TI A scalable cavity-based spin-photon interface in a photonic integrated
   circuit
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB A central challenge in quantum networking is transferring quantum states between different physical modalities, such as between flying photonic qubits and stationary quantum memories. One implementation entails using spin-photon interfaces that combine solid-state spin qubits, such as color centers in diamond, with photonic nanostructures. However, while high-fidelity spin-photon interactions have been demonstrated on isolated devices, building practical quantum repeaters requires scaling to large numbers of interfaces yet to be realized. Here, we demonstrate integration of nanophotonic cavities containing tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). Out of a six-channel quantum microchiplet (QMC), we find four coupled SnV-cavity devices with an average Purcell factor of similar to 7. Based on system analyses and numerical simulations, we find with near-term improvements this multiplexed architecture can enable high-fidelity quantum state transfer, paving the way toward building large-scale quantum repeaters.

TI Enhancing quantum entanglement with the local displacement-based quantum
   scissor
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Entangled quantum states serve as a pivotal resource in quantum information processing, where the preparation of highly entangled quantum states is a core issue. In this paper, we propose local displacement-based quantum scissor (LDQS) scheme to enhance the entanglement of the two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. By introducing a local displacement operation in the traditional quantum scissor, the entanglement of the TMSV state is enhanced by approximately 75% for low initial squeezing (r = 0.2) conditions. Compared with the local squeezing-based quantum scissor scheme (Liu et al., 2022), the LDQS scheme eliminates the need for additional pumping and the use of inefficient nonlinear crystals, thereby simplifying the experimental procedure. Moreover, the LDQS scheme provides a greater enhancement in entanglement when both schemes are implemented with the same success probability. Finally, we also demonstrate that the LDQS operation can be used to enhance the entanglement of the TMSV state in lossy channels. These advantages suggest that our scheme shows promise for application in various quantum information tasks, including quantum metrology and quantum communication.

TI Exploring the Potential of QEEGNet for Cross-task and Cross-dataset
   Electroencephalography Encoding with Quantum Machine Learning
SO JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO
   TECHNOLOGY
AB Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in neuroscience and clinical research for analyzing brain activity. While deep learning models such as EEGNet have shown success in decoding EEG signals, they often struggle with data complexity, inter-subject variability, and noise robustness. Recent advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) offer new opportunities to enhance EEG analysis by leveraging quantum computing's unique properties. In this study, we extend the previously proposed Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a hybrid neural network incorporating quantum layers into EEGNet, to investigate its generalization ability across multiple EEG datasets. Our evaluation spans a diverse set of cognitive and motor task datasets, assessing QEEGNet's performance in different learning scenarios. Experimental results reveal that while QEEGNet demonstrates competitive performance and maintains robustness in certain datasets, its improvements over traditional deep learning methods remain inconsistent. These findings suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures require further optimization to fully leverage quantum advantages in EEG processing. Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights into the applicability of QML in EEG research and highlights challenges that must be addressed for future advancements.

TI Universal discriminative quantum neural networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Recent results have demonstrated the successful applications of quantum-classical hybrid methods to train quantum circuits for a variety of machine learning tasks. A natural question to ask is consequentially whether we can also train such quantum circuits to discriminate quantum data, i.e., perform classification on data stored in form of quantum states. Although quantum mechanics fundamentally forbids deterministic discrimination of non-orthogonal states, we show in this work that it is possible to train a quantum circuit to discriminate such data with a trade-off between minimizing error rates and inconclusiveness rates of the classification tasks. Our approach achieves at the same time a performance which is close to the theoretically optimal values and a generalization ability to previously unseen quantum data. This generalization power hence distinguishes our work from previous circuit optimization results and furthermore provides an example of a quantum machine learning task that has inherently no classical analogue.

TI RLD Fisher information bound for multiparameter estimation of quantum
   channels
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB One of the fundamental tasks in quantum metrology is to estimate multiple parameters embedded in a noisy process, i.e. a quantum channel. In this paper, we study fundamental limits to quantum channel estimation via the concept of amortization and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information value. Our key technical result is the proof of a chain-rule inequality for the RLD Fisher information value, which implies that amortization, i.e. access to a catalyst state family, does not increase the RLD Fisher information value of quantum channels. This technical result leads to a fundamental and efficiently computable limitation for multiparameter channel estimation in the sequential setting, in terms of the RLD Fisher information value. As a consequence, we conclude that if the RLD Fisher information value is finite, then Heisenberg scaling is unattainable in the multiparameter setting.

TI Optimal control of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in a

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a widely used protocol to realize high-fidelity and robust quantum control in various quantum systems. However, further application of this protocol in superconducting qubits is limited by population leakage caused by the only weak anharmonicity. Here, we introduce an optimally controlled shortcut-to-adiabatic (STA) technique to speed-up the STIRAP protocol in a superconducting qudit. By modifying the shapes of the STIRAP pulses, we experimentally realize a fast (32 ns) and high-fidelity (0.996 +/- 0.005) quantum state transfer. In addition, we demonstrate that our protocol is robust against control parameter perturbations. Our stimulated Raman shortcut-to-adiabatic passage transition provides an efficient and practical approach for quantum information processing.

TI Qudit-inspired optimization for graph coloring
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We introduce a quantum-inspired algorithm for graph coloring problems (GCPs) that utilizes qudits in a product state, with each qudit representing a node in the graph and parameterized by d-dimensional spherical coordinates. We propose and benchmark two optimization strategies: qudit gradient descent, initiating qudits in random states and employing gradient descent to minimize a cost function; and qudit local quantum annealing, which adapts the local quantum annealing method to optimize an adiabatic transition from a tractable initial function to a problem-specific cost function. Our approaches are benchmarked against established solutions for standard GCPs, showing that our methods not only rival but frequently surpass the performance of recent state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. The adaptability of our algorithm and its high-quality solutions, achieved with minimal computational resources, point to an advancement in the field of quantum-inspired optimization, with potential applications extending to a broad spectrum of optimization problems.

TI Efficient entanglement distillation for quantum channels with
   polarization mode dispersion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement shared by remote network nodes serves as a valuable resource for promising applications in distributed computing, cryptography, and sensing. However, distributing high-quality entanglement via fiber-optic routes could be challenging due to the various decoherence mechanisms in fibers. In particular, one of the primary polarization decoherence mechanisms in optical fibers is polarization mode dispersion (PMD), which is the distortion of optical pulses by randomly varying birefringences. To mitigate the effect of decoherence in entangled particles, quantum entanglement distillation (QED) algorithms have been proposed. One particular class, the recurrence QED algorithms, stands out because it has relatively relaxed requirements both on the size of the quantum circuits involved and on the initial quality of entanglement between particles. However, because the number of required particles grows exponentially with the number of distillation rounds, an efficient recurrence algorithm needs to converge quickly. We present a recurrence QED algorithm designed for photonic qubit pairs affected by PMD-degraded channels. Our proposed algorithm achieves the optimal fidelity as well as the optimal success probability (conditioned on the fact that optimal fidelity is achieved) in every round of distillation. The attainment of the maximal fidelity improves the convergence speed of fidelity with respect to the number of distillation rounds from linear to quadratic and, hence, significantly reduces the number of rounds. Combined with the fact that the optimal success probability is achieved, the proposed algorithm provides an efficient method to distribute entangled states with a high fidelity via optical fibers.

TI Inverse Reticle Optimization With Quantum Annealing and Hybrid Solvers
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Reticle optimization is a computationally demanding task in optical microlithography for advanced semiconductor fabrication. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of D-Wave's quantum annealing (QA) and hybrid steepest descent (SD) solvers in solving pixelated binary reticle optimization problems. We show that the energy derived from the objective function depends on annealing time and inter-sample correlation. Specifically, longer annealing times and reduced inter-sample correlations result in lower energy. Moreover, introducing efficient pausing strategies in forward annealing could reduce the QA runtime by approximately 100-fold while achieving similar results to long annealing times. Finally, reticles with increased variables lead to widespread irregular values in default sorted QA energies due to quantum chain breakages, which could potentially limit the probability of attaining the optimal solution. A hybrid approach that applies the classical SD algorithm to the QA results increases the probability of locating the global minimum solution and reduces runtime to about one-third compared to the classical SD solver. These findings facilitate our comprehension of quantum computing for accelerating computational lithography in semiconductor manufacturing.

TI Quantum algorithms with local particle-number conservation: Noise
   effects and error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum circuits with local particle-number conservation restrict the quantum computation to a subspace of the Hilbert space of the qubit register. In a noiseless or fault-tolerant quantum computation, such quantities are preserved. In the presence of noise, however, the evolution's symmetry could be broken and nonvalid states could be sampled at the end of the computation. On the other hand, the restriction to a subspace in the ideal case suggests the possibility of more resource-efficient error-mitigation techniques for circuits preserving symmetries that are not possible for general circuits. Here, we analyze the probability of staying in such symmetry-preserved subspaces under noise, providing an exact formula for local depolarizing noise. We apply our findings to benchmark, under depolarizing noise, the symmetry robustness of the XY quantum alternating operator Ansatz, which has local particle-number conserving symmetries and is a special case of the quantum alternating operator Ansatz. We also analyze the influence of the choice of encoding the problem on the symmetry robustness of the algorithm and discuss a simple adaption of the bit-flip code to correct for symmetry-breaking errors with reduced resources.

TI Template-based mapping of reversible circuits to IBM quantum computers
SO MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS
AB In order to make the most of the increasing computational power of recently developed quantum computers, it is crucial to perform an efficient mapping of a given quantum circuit that realizes the desired quantum algorithm to the targeted quantum computer (so-called technology mapping). In most cases, the limitations of the targeted quantum hardware have not been taken into account when generating these quantum circuits in the first place. Thus, the technology mapping is likely to induce a considerable overhead for such circuits in order prepare them for the execution on the actual device. In this work, we consider the realization of reversible circuits consisting of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates on IBM quantum computers. Using templates for the realization of the reversible/quantum gates allows to perform a topology-aware decomposition of MCT gates that exhibits the potential of significant reductions of the technology mapping overhead.

TI Analysis of Ansatze Expressibility and Complexity and Their Impact on
   Classification Accuracy Using QNN and QLSTM
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) and Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) models are emerging as powerful tools in quantum machine learning. The effectiveness of these models is largely governed by the structure of their parameterized quantum circuits, also known as Ans & auml;tze. The Expressibility (measure of how well an ans & auml;tz can explore Hilbert space), Entanglement (which governs the correlation between states of multiple qubits), and Depth (a measure of how many layers of quantum gates a circuit has) are fundamental to a model's capacity to learn complex patterns. In this paper, we analyze how varying these attributes for various ans & auml;tze influences classification cost and accuracy. We evaluated QNN and QLSTM models across three cybersecurity datasets using ten ans & auml;tze with varying expressibility and complexity. Results showed that ans & auml;tze with lower expressibility and complexity achieved accuracy and training stability comparable to the more complex ones. Additionally, we found that QNN models consistently offered a better trade-off between accuracy, training time, and computational efficiency compared to QLSTM models.

TI Entangling logical qubits with lattice surgery
SO NATURE
AB The development of quantum computing architectures from early designs and current noisy devices to fully fledged quantum computers hinges on achieving fault tolerance using quantum error correction(1-4). However, these correction capabilities come with an overhead for performing the necessary fault-tolerant logical operations on logical qubits (qubits that are encoded in ensembles of physical qubits and protected by error-correction codes)(5-8). One of the most resource-efficient ways to implement logical operations is lattice surgery(9-11), where groups of physical qubits, arranged on lattices, can be merged and split to realize entangling gates and teleport logical information. Here we report the experimental realization of lattice surgery between two qubits protected via a topological error-correction code in a ten-qubit ion-trap quantum information processor. In this system, we can carry out the necessary quantum non-demolition measurements through a series of local and entangling gates, as well as measurements on auxiliary qubits. In particular, we demonstrate entanglement between two logical qubits and we implement logical state teleportation between them. The demonstration of these operations-fundamental building blocks for quantum computation-through lattice surgery represents a step towards the efficient realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation.
   Two logical qubits are encoded in ensembles of four physical qubits through the surface code, then entangled by lattice surgery, which is a protocol for carrying out fault-tolerant operations.

TI Quantum entanglement is quantum: ZZ production at the LHC
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes pp -> e+e-mu+mu- and h -> e+e-mu+mu-, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the pp -> e+e-mu+mu- process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant ZZ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the h -> e+e-mu+mu- channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.

TI A Computer Science-Oriented Approach to Introduce Quantum Computing to a
   New Audience
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB Contribution: In this study, an alternative educational approach for introducing quantum computing to a wider audience is highlighted. The proposed methodology considers quantum computing as a generalized probability theory rather than a field emanating from physics and utilizes quantum programming as an educational tool to reinforce the learning process. Background: Quantum computing is a topic mainly rooted in physics, and it has been gaining rapid popularity in recent years. A need for extending the educational reach to groups outside of physics has also been becoming a necessity. Intended Outcomes: This study aims to inform academics and organizations interested in introducing quantum computing to a diverse group of participants on an educational approach. It is intended that the proposed methodology would facilitate people from diverse backgrounds to enter the field. Application Design: The introductory quantum physics content is bypassed and the quantum computing concepts are introduced through linear algebra instead. Quantum programming tasks are prepared in line with the content. Pre/post-test design method and Likert scale satisfaction surveys are utilized to measure knowledge acquisition and to evaluate the perception of the learning process by the participants. Findings: Conducted pre/post-test design survey shows that there is a statistically significant increase in the basic knowledge levels of the participants on quantum computing concepts. Furthermore, no significant difference in the gain scores is observed between the participants from different STEM-related educational backgrounds. The majority of the participants were satisfied and provided positive feedback.

AB Finding ground states of quantum many-body systems is known to be hard for both classical and quantum computers. As a result, when Nature cools a quantum system in a low-temperature thermal bath, the ground state cannot always be found efficiently. Instead, Nature finds a local minimum of the energy. In this work, we study the problem of finding local minima in quantum systems under thermal perturbations. While local minima are much easier to find than ground states, we show that finding a local minimum is computationally hard for classical computers, even when the task is to output a single-qubit observable at any local minimum. In contrast, we prove that a quantum computer can always find a local minimum efficiently using a thermal gradient descent algorithm that mimics the cooling process in Nature. To establish the classical hardness of finding local minima, we consider a family of two-dimensional Hamiltonians such that any problem solvable by polynomial-time quantum algorithms can be reduced to finding local minima of these Hamiltonians. Therefore, cooling systems to local minima is universal for quantum computation, and, assuming quantum computation is more powerful than classical computation, finding local minima is classically hard and quantumly easy.

TI High-Fidelity Image Transmission in Quantum Communication with Frequency
   Domain Multi-Qubit Techniques
SO ALGORITHMS
AB This paper proposes a novel quantum image transmission framework to address the limitations of existing single-qubit time domain systems, which struggle with noise resilience and scalability. The framework integrates frequency domain processing with multi-qubit (1 to 8 qubits) encoding to enhance robustness against quantum noise. Initially, images are source-coded using JPEG and HEIF formats with rate adjustment to ensure consistent bandwidth usage. The resulting bitstreams are channel-encoded and mapped to multi-qubit quantum states. These states are transformed into the frequency domain via the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) for transmission. At the receiver, the inverse QFT recovers the time domain states, followed by multi-qubit decoding, channel decoding, and source decoding to reconstruct the image. Performance is evaluated using bit error rate (BER), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and universal quality index (UQI). Results show that increasing the number of qubits enhances image quality and noise robustness, albeit at the cost of increased system complexity. Compared to time domain processing, the frequency domain approach achieves superior performance across all qubit configurations, with the eight-qubit system delivering up to a 4 dB maximum channel SNR gain for both JPEG and HEIF images. Although single-qubit systems benefit less from frequency domain encoding due to limited representational capacity, the overall framework demonstrates strong potential for scalable and noise-robust quantum image transmission in future quantum communication networks.

TI Parallel window decoding enables scalable fault tolerant quantum
   computation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Large-scale quantum computers have the potential to hold computational capabilities beyond conventional computers. However, the physical qubits are prone to noise which must be corrected in order to perform fault-tolerant quantum computations. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides the path for realizing such computations. QEC generates a continuous stream of data that decoders must process at the rate it is received, which can be as fast as 1 mu s per QEC round in superconducting quantum computers. If the decoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered and the computation runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches to quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run slower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog problem. Here, we show how to parallelize decoding to achieve almost arbitrary speed, removing this roadblock to scalability. Our parallelization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed, slowing-down the logical clock speed. However, the slow-down is now only polynomial in the size of the QEC code, averting the exponential slowdown. We numerically demonstrate our parallel decoder for the surface code, showing no noticeable reduction in logical fidelity compared to previous decoders and demonstrating the predicted speedup.
   In order to be useful for future large-scale quantum computing, quantum error correction needs to allow for fast enough classical decoding time, while at the moment the slowdown is exponential in the size of the code. Here, the authors remove this roadblock, showing how to parallelize decoding and make the slowdown polynomial.

TI Near-Field Generation and Control of Ultrafast, Multipartite
   Entanglement for Quantum Nanoplasmonic Networks
SO NANO LETTERS
AB For a quantum Internet, one needs reliable sources of entangled particles that are compatible with measurement techniques enabling time-dependent, quantum error correction. Ideally, they will be operable at room temperature with a manageable decoherence versus generation time. To accomplish this, we theoretically establish a scalable, plasmonically based archetype that uses quantum dots (QD) as quantum emitters, known for relatively low decoherence rates near room temperature, that are excited using subdiffracted light from a near-field transducer (NFT). NFTs are a developing technology that allow rasterization across arrays of qubits and remarkably generate enough power to strongly drive energy transitions on the nanoscale. This eases the fabrication of QD media, while efficiently controlling picosecond-scale dynamic entanglement of a multiqubit system that approaches maximum fidelity, along with fluctuation between tripartite and bipartite entanglement. Our strategy radically increases the scalability and accessibility of quantum information devices while permitting fault-tolerant quantum computing using time-repetition algorithms.

TI Cyclic Remote Implementation of Partially Unknown Quantum Operations
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB We present a novel scheme of Cyclic remote implementation of partially unknown quantum operations (CRIPUQO) via a six-qubit entangled state as the quantum channel. Alice can remotely apply a partially unknown quantum operation U-d (d = 0,1) to Bob's qubit b, and Bob can remotely apply U-d to Charlie's site; meanwhile, Charlie can also remotely apply U-d to Alice's qubit c. It is pointed out that the CRIPUQO in the opposite direction can be perfectly achieved by changing the quantum channel. The scheme above is also generalized to systems having N observers, so that the CRIPUQO can be realized in quantum information networks with N observers in different directions by changing quantum channels.

TI Flip-Chip Integration of the Superconducting Quantum-Classical Circuits:
   Coupling Types
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB As quantum computing evolves from the multi-qubit stage to large multimodularprocessors, addressability and scalability of quantum hardware will require 3D integration and packaging. The advancement of flip-chip technology is critical to enabling progress in this area. However, various types of coupling, such as capacitive, inductive, and galvanic, still require systematic research into the principles, quantification, and loss mechanisms. In this article, different types of 3D architecture are examined using flip-chip technology. The lambda/4$\lambda /4$ and lambda/2$\lambda /2$ superconducting resonators with qubit circuits are designed in a modular configuration consisting of two silicon substrates. This arrangement allows numerical analysis and systematic experimental investigation of capacitive, inductive, and galvanic coupling mechanisms. The transmission of short control pulses for fast qubit manipulation is demonstrated and the feasibility of quantum state transfer is theoretically explored, highlighting the potential of this approach for scalable quantum processors. Particular focus is also on the fabrication technology of superconducting indium bumps between silicon substrates.

TI Practical and scalable decoder for topological quantum error correction
   with an Ising machine
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correction is one of the most important milestones for the realization of large-scale quantum computation. To achieve this, it is essential not only to integrate a large number of qubits with high fidelity but also to build a scalable classical system that can perform error correction. Here, we propose an efficient and scalable decoder for quantum error correction using "Fujitsu Digital Annealer" (DA). Specifically, the error correction problem of stabilizer codes is mapped into an Ising-type optimization problem, so-called quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which is solved by DA. In particular, we implement the proposed DA decoder for the surface code and perform detailed numerical experiments for various code distances to see its performance and scalability. We observe that computational scaling for the DA decoder has a lower order of polynomials than the decoding methods using simulated annealing (SA) and minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm under all tested conditions. It is also shown that the DA decoder has advantages over the Union-Find (UF) decoder from a variety of perspectives including hardware implementation. Furthermore, the threshold behavior of the logical error probability for the DA decoder is analyzed and the resultant threshold lies between 9.4% and 9.8%, which is very close to that obtained by the MWPM decoder. This result clearly shows the high potential of the DA decoder for quantum error correction.

TI Quantum information spreading in random spin chains with topological
   order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum information spreading and scrambling in many-body systems attract interest these days. Tripartite mutual information (TMI) based on operator-based entanglement entropy (EE) is an efficient tool for measuring them. In this paper, we study random spin chains that exhibit phase transitions accompanying nontrivial changes in topological properties. In their phase diagrams, there are two types of many-body localized (MBL) states and one thermalized regime intervening these two MBL states. Quench dynamics of the EE and TMI display interesting behaviors, providing an essential perspective concerning the encoding of quantum information. In particular, one of the models is self-dual, but information spreading measured by the TMI does not respect this self-duality. We investigate this phenomenon from the viewpoint of spatial structure of the stabilizers. In general, we find that knowledge of the phase diagram corresponding to the qubit system is useful for understanding the nature of quantum information spreading in that system. The connection between the present paper and random circuit of projective measurements and also topological Majorana quantum memory is remarked upon.

TI Relating Entropies of Quantum Channels
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we study two different approaches to defining the entropy of a quantum channel. One of these is based on the von Neumann entropy of the corresponding Choi-Jamiolkowski state. The second one is based on the relative entropy of the output of the extended channel relative to the output of the extended completely depolarizing channel. This entropy then needs to be optimized over all possible input states. Our results first show that the former entropy provides an upper bound on the latter. Next, we show that for unital qubit channels, this bound is saturated. Finally, we conjecture and provide numerical intuitions that the bound can also be saturated for random channels as their dimension tends to infinity.

TI Quantum computing for transport network design problems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Transport network design problem (TNDP) is a well-studied problem for planning and operations of transportation systems. They are widely used to determine links for capacity enhancement, link closures to schedule maintenance, identify new road or transit links and more generally network enhancements under resource constraints. As changes in network capacities result in a redistribution of demand on the network, resulting in changes in the congestion patterns, TNDP is generally modelled as a bi-level problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Meta-heuristic methods, such as Tabu Search Method are relied upon to solve these problems, which have been demonstrated to achieve near optimality in reasonable time. The advent of quantum computing has afforded an opportunity to solve these problems faster. We formulate the TNDP problem as a bi-level problem, with the upper level formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem that is solved using quantum annealing on a D-Wave quantum computer. We compare the results with Tabu Search. We find that quantum annealing provides significant computational benefit. The proposed solution has implications for networks across different contexts including communications, traffic, industrial operations, electricity, water, broader supply chains and epidemiology.

TI All-optical quantum computing using cubic phase gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB If suitable quantum optical interactions were available, transforming the field mode operators in a nonlinear fashion, the all-photonics platform could be one of the strongest contenders for realizing a quantum computer. While single -photon qubits may be processed directly, "brighter" logical qubits may be embedded in individual oscillator modes, using so-called bosonic codes, for an in -principle fault -tolerant processing. In this paper, we show how elements of all -optical, universal, and fault -tolerant quantum computation can be implemented using only beam splitters together with single -mode cubic phase gates in reasonable numbers, and possibly off-line squeezed -state or single -photon resources. Our approach is based on a decomposition technique combining exact gate decompositions and approximate Trotterization. This allows for efficient decompositions of certain nonlinear continuous -variable multimode gates into the elementary gates, where the few cubic gates needed may even be weak or all identical, thus facilitating potential experiments. The final gate operations include two -mode controlled phase rotation and three -mode Rabi-type Hamiltonian gates, which are shown to be employable for realizing high-fidelity single -photon two-qubit entangling gates or creating high -quality Gottesman-KitaevPreskill states. We expect our method to be of general use with various applications, including those that rely on quartic Kerr -type interactions.

TI Quantum error correction and holographic information from bilocal
   holography
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Bilocal holography is a constructive approach to the higher spin theory holographically dual to O(N) vector models. In contrast to other approaches to bulk reconstruction, bilocal holography does not take input from the dual gravitational theory. The resulting map is a complete bulk/boundary mapping in that it maps the complete set of O(N) invariant degrees of freedom in the CFT, to the complete set of higher spin degrees of freedom. After restricting to a suitable code subspace we demonstrate that bilocal holography naturally reproduces the quantum error correcting properties of holography and it gives a robust bulk (entanglement wedge) reconstruction. A gauge invariant entangled pair of CFT degrees of freedom are naturally smeared over a semicircle in the bulk spacetime, which is highly suggestive of bit threads. Finally, we argue that finite N relations in the CFT, when interpreted in the dual AdS spacetime, can provide relations between degrees of freedom located near the boundary and degrees of freedom deep in the bulk.

TI Relativistic quantum communication: Energy cost and channel capacities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We consider the communication of classical and quantum information between two arbitrary observers in asymptotically flat spacetimes (possibly containing black holes) and investigate what the energy cost is for such information transmission. By means of localized two-level quantum systems, sender and receiver can use a quantum scalar field as a communication channel. As we have already shown in a previous paper, such a channel has nonvanishing classical capacity as well as entanglement-assisted classical and quantum capacities. Here we will show that the change in the expectation value of the energy of the system during the communication process can be separated in (i) a contribution coming from the particle creation due to the change of the spacetime, (ii) a contribution associated with the energy needed to switch on or off each qubit, and (iii) a term which comes from the communication process itself. For the quantum channel considered here, we show that the extra energy cost needed for communication vanishes. As a result, if one has already created a system of qubits for some specific task (e.g., quantum computation), one can also reliably convey information between its parts with no extra energy cost. We conclude the paper by illustrating the form of the channel capacities and energy contributions in two paradigmatic cases in Minkowski spacetime: (i) sender and receiver in inertial motion and (ii) sender in inertial motion while the receiver is uniformly accelerated.

TI Quantum Topology Optimization via Quantum Annealing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We present a quantum annealing-based solution method for topology optimization (TO). In particular, we consider TO in a more general setting, i.e., applied to structures of continuum domains where designs are represented as distributed functions, referred to as continuum TO problems. According to the problem's properties and structure, we formulate appropriate subproblems that can be solved on an annealing-based quantum computer. The methodology established can effectively tackle continuum TO problems formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programs. To maintain the resulting subproblems small enough to be solved on quantum computers currently accessible with small numbers of qubits and limited connectivity, we further develop a splitting approach that splits the problem into two parts: the first part can be efficiently solved on classical computers, and the second part with a reduced number of variables is solved on a quantum computer. By such, a practical continuum TO problem of varying scales can be handled on the D-Wave quantum annealer. More specifically, we concern the minimum compliance, a canonical TO problem that seeks an optimal distribution of materials to minimize the compliance with desired material usage. The superior performance of the developed methodology is assessed and compared with the state-of-the-art heuristic classical methods, in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. The present work hence provides a promising new avenue of applying quantum computing to practical designs of topology for various applications.

TI Unlocking the potential of photoexcited molecular electron spins for
   room temperature quantum information processing
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Future information processing technologies like quantum memory devices have the potential to store and transfer quantum states to enable quantum computing and networking. A central consideration in practical applications for such devices is the nature of the light-matter interface which determines the storage state density and efficiency. Here, we employ an organic radical, alpha,gamma-bisdiphenylene-beta-phenylallyl doped into an o-terphenyl host to explore the potential for using tuneable and high-performance molecular media in microwave-based quantum applications. We demonstrate that this radical system exhibits millisecond-long spin-lattice relaxation and microsecond-long phase memory times at room temperature, while also having the capability to generate an oscillating spin-polarized state using a co-dissolved photo-activated tetraphenylporphyrin moiety, all enabled by using a viscous liquid host. This latest system builds upon collective wisdom from previous molecules-for-quantum literature by combining careful host matrix selection, with dynamical decoupling, and photoexcited triplet-radical spin polarisation to realise a versatile and robust quantum spin medium.

TI Entanglement detection with quantum support vector machine (QSVM) on
   near-term quantum devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Detecting and quantifying quantum entanglement remain significant challenges in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. This study presents the implementation of quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) on IBM quantum devices to identify and classify entangled states. By employing quantum variational circuits, the proposed framework achieves a runtime complexity of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(\frac{N t}{\epsilon <^>2})$$\end{document}, where N is the number of qubits, t is the number of iterations, and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\epsilon$$\end{document} is the acceptable error margin. We investigate various quantum circuits with multiple blocks and obtain the accuracy of QSVM as measures of expressibility and entangling capability. Our results demonstrate that the QSVM framework achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing entangled states, despite hardware noise such as decoherence and gate errors. Benchmarks across superconducting qubit platforms (e.g., IBM Perth, Lagos, and Nairobi) highlight the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the QSVM framework effectively classifies two-qubit states and extends its predictive capabilities to three-qubit entangled states. This work marks a significant advancement in quantum machine learning for entanglement detection.

TI Can spacetime superposition alleviate gravitationally induced quantum
   decoherence?
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB As a combination of the microscopic structure of spacetime and the principle of quantum superposition, the study of spacetime superposition provides a fundamental bottom-up approach to a comprehensive understanding of relativity and quantum theory. In this paper, we study how quantum gravitational effects generated by the superposition of the black hole's masses affect the many-body entanglement for Dirac fields. The main obstacle to performing quantum information processing tasks near a classical black hole is the inevitable entanglement degradation caused by the Unruh-Hawking thermal bath. Fortunately, here we find that the many-body quantum system near a black hole with superposing masses exhibits more entanglement compared to those in the classical black hole background. The superposition properties of spacetime are found to provide additional quantum resources for mitigating gravitationally induced quantum decoherence and improving the efficiency of quantum information tasks in curved spacetime. In addition, the greatest quantum advantage for the recovery of entanglement in the curved spacetime can be obtained by preparing an optimal initial state.

TI Quantum Computing as a Catalyst for Microgrid Management: Enhancing
   Decentralized Energy Systems Through Innovative Computational Techniques
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper introduces a groundbreaking framework for optimizing microgrid operations using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The increasing integration of decentralized energy systems, characterized by their reliance on renewable energy sources, presents unique challenges, including the stochastic nature of energy supply-and-demand management. Our study leverages quantum computing to enhance the operational efficiency and resilience of microgrids, transcending the limitations of traditional computational methods. The proposed QAOA-based model formulates the microgrid scheduling problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, suitable for quantum computation. This approach not only accommodates complex operational constraints-such as energy conservation, peak load management, and cost efficiency-but also dynamically adapts to the variability inherent in renewable energy sources. By encoding these constraints into a quantum-friendly Hamiltonian, QAOA facilitates a parallel exploration of multiple potential solutions, enhancing the probability of reaching an optimal solution within a feasible time frame. We validate our model through a comprehensive simulation using real-world data from a microgrid equipped with photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and energy storage units. The results demonstrate that QAOA outperforms conventional optimization techniques in terms of cost reduction, energy efficiency, and system reliability. Furthermore, our study explores the scalability of quantum algorithms in energy systems, providing insights into their potential to handle larger, more complex grid architectures as quantum technology advances. This research not only underscores the viability of quantum algorithms in real-world applications but also sets a precedent for future studies on the integration of quantum computing into energy management systems, paving the way for more sustainable, efficient, and resilient energy infrastructures.

TI Generalized Perfect Codes for Symmetric Classical-Quantum Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We define a new family of codes for symmetric classical-quantum channels and establish their optimality. To this end, we extend the classical notion of generalized perfect and quasi-perfect codes to channels defined over some finite dimensional complex Hilbert output space. The resulting optimality conditions depend on the channel considered and on an auxiliary state defined on the output space of the channel. For certain N-qubit classical-quantum channels, we show that codes based on a generalization of Bell states are quasi-perfect and, therefore, they feature the smallest error probability among all codes of the same blocklength and cardinality.

TI On sampling determinantal and Pfaffian point processes on a quantum
   computer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB DPPs were introduced by Macchi as a model in quantum optics the 1970s. Since then, they have been widely used as models and subsampling tools in statistics and computer science. Most applications require sampling from a DPP, and given their quantum origin, it is natural to wonder whether sampling a DPP on a quantum computer is easier than on a classical one. We focus here on DPPs over a finite state space, which are distributions over the subsets of {1, horizontal ellipsis ,N} parametrized by an N x N Hermitian kernel matrix. Vanilla sampling consists in two steps, of respective costs O(N3) and O(Nr2) operations on a classical computer, where r is the rank of the kernel matrix. A large first part of the current paper consists in explaining why the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation of fermionic systems already yields quantum DPP sampling algorithms. We then modify existing quantum circuits, and discuss their insertion in a full DPP sampling pipeline that starts from practical kernel specifications. The bottom line is that, with P (classical) parallel processors, we can divide the preprocessing cost by P and build a quantum circuit with O(Nr) gates that sample a given DPP, with depth varying from O(N) to O(rlogN) depending on qubit-communication constraints on the target machine. We also connect existing work on the simulation of superconductors to Pfaffian point processes (PfPP), which generalize DPPs and would be a natural addition to the machine learner's toolbox. In particular, we describe 'projective' PfPPs, the cardinality of which has constant parity, almost surely. Finally, the circuits are empirically validated on a classical simulator and on 5-qubit IBM machines.

TI Quantum Computation in a Hybrid Array of Molecules and Rydberg Atoms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We show that an array of polar molecules interacting with Rydberg atoms is a promising hybrid system for scalable quantum computation. Quantum information is stored in long-lived hyperfine or rotational states of molecules, which interact indirectly through resonant dipole-dipole interactions with Rydberg atoms. A two-qubit gate based on this interaction has a duration of 1 mu s and an achievable fidelity of 99.9%. The gate has little sensitivity to the motional states of the particles-the molecules can be in thermal states, the atoms do not need to be trapped during Rydberg excitation, the gate does not heat the molecules, and heating of the atoms has a negligible effect. Within a large, static array, the gate can be applied to arbitrary pairs of molecules separated by tens of micrometres, making the scheme highly scalable. The molecule-atom interaction can also be used for rapid qubit initialization and efficient, nondestructive qubit readout, without driving any molecular transitions. Single-qubit gates are driven using microwave pulses alone, exploiting the strong electric dipole transitions between rotational states. Thus, all operations required for large-scale quantum computation can be done without moving the molecules or exciting them out of their ground electronic states.

TI Solving Multidimensional Partial Differential Equations Using Efficient
   Quantum Circuits
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Quantum computing has the potential to solve certain compute-intensive problems faster than classical computing by leveraging the quantum mechanical properties of superposition and entanglement. This capability can be particularly useful for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), which are challenging to solve even for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, especially for multidimensional PDEs. This led researchers to investigate the usage of Quantum-Centric High-Performance Computing (QC-HPC) to solve multidimensional PDEs for various applications. However, the current quantum computing-based PDE-solvers, especially those based on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) suffer from limitations, such as low accuracy, long execution times, and limited scalability. In this work, we propose an innovative algorithm to solve multidimensional PDEs with two variants. The first variant uses Finite Difference Method (FDM), Classical-to-Quantum (C2Q) encoding, and numerical instantiation, whereas the second variant utilizes FDM, C2Q encoding, and Column-by-Column Decomposition (CCD). We evaluated the proposed algorithm using the Poisson equation as a case study and validated it through experiments conducted on noise-free and noisy simulators, as well as hardware emulators and real quantum hardware from IBM. Our results show higher accuracy, improved scalability, and faster execution times in comparison to variational-based PDE-solvers, demonstrating the advantage of our approach for solving multidimensional PDEs.

TI Overcoming the coherence time barrier in quantum machine learning on
   temporal data
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The practical implementation of many quantum algorithms known today is limited by the coherence time of the executing quantum hardware and quantum sampling noise. Here we present a machine learning algorithm, NISQRC, for qubit-based quantum systems that enables inference on temporal data over durations unconstrained by decoherence. NISQRC leverages mid-circuit measurements and deterministic reset operations to reduce circuit executions, while still maintaining an appropriate length persistent temporal memory in the quantum system, confirmed through the proposed Volterra Series analysis. This enables NISQRC to overcome not only limitations imposed by finite coherence, but also information scrambling in monitored circuits and sampling noise, problems that persist even in hypothetical fault-tolerant quantum computers that have yet to be realized. To validate our approach, we consider the channel equalization task to recover test signal symbols that are subject to a distorting channel. Through simulations and experiments on a 7-qubit quantum processor we demonstrate that NISQRC can recover arbitrarily long test signals, not limited by coherence time.
   Inherent limitations on continuously measured quantum systems calls into question whether they could even in principle be used for online learning. Here, the authors experimentally demonstrate a quantum machine learning framework for inference on streaming data of arbitrary length, and provide a theory with criteria for the utility of their algorithm for inference on streaming data.

TI Four-Qubit Cluster States Generation through Multi-Coin Quantum Walk
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum computing requires large numbers of resources of entangled qubits, which cannot be satisfied using traditional methods of entanglement generation, such as optical systems. Therefore, we need more efficient ways of entanglement generation. It has been proved that multi-coin quantum walks can be used to replace direct Bell state measurements during the process of entanglement generation in order to avoid the difficulty of Bell state measurement. In this paper, we take one step further and generate 4-qubit cluster states using multi-coin quantum walks, which simplifies the generation of 4-qubit cluster states by using only Bell states and local measurements. We also propose a method for preparing 4-qubit cluster states with quantum circuits to facilitate their use in quantum computing.

TI A systematic review of anomaly detection in IoT security: towards
   quantum machine learning approach
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrating IoT into daily life generates massive data, enabling smart factories and driving advancements in related technologies like cloud/edge computing, ML, and AI. While ML has been used for data analysis and forecasting, challenges such as data complexity, security, and computing limitations persist, particularly in anomaly detection crucial for network security. Recent research indicates the potential of quantum computing and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to outperform traditional methods in anomaly detection within IoT, an area lacking a comprehensive review. This paper presents a systematic review of Machine Learning-based anomaly detection techniques for IoT security. Despite previous reviews, this study includes the analysis of feature engineering and quantum machine learning techniques in literature. Our findings show that current models have high detection rates on known datasets, but face scalability, real-time processing, and generalization issues. Privacy and security concerns in federated learning (FL) and the effects of data drift also need to be addressed, along with the challenges of 5G and 6G-enabled IoT environments. Future directions include integrating Explainable AI into anomaly detection, exploring adaptive learning techniques, and combining blockchain with machine learning models. The study also highlights the potential of quantum computing to enhance threat detection through quantum machine learning models.

TI Limitations of Variational Quantum Algorithms: A Quantum Optimal
   Transport Approach
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The impressive progress in quantum hardware of the last years has raised the interest of the quantum computing community in harvesting the computational power of such devices. However, in the absence of error correction, these devices can only reliably implement very shallow circuits or comparatively deeper circuits at the expense of a nontrivial density of errors. In this work, we obtain extremely tight limitation bounds for standard noisy intermediate-scale quantum proposals in both the noisy and noise-less regimes, with or without error-mitigation tools. The bounds limit the performance of both circuit model algorithms, such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and also continuous-time algorithms, such as quantum annealing. In the noisy regime with local depolarizing noise p, we prove that at depths L = O(p-1) it is exponentially unlikely that the outcome of a noisy quantum circuit out-performs efficient classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems like max-cut. Although previous results already showed that classical algorithms outperform noisy quantum circuits at constant depth, these results only held for the expectation value of the output. Our results are based on newly developed quantum entropic and concentration inequalities, which constitute a homogeneous toolkit of theoretical methods from the quantum theory of optimal mass transport whose potential usefulness goes beyond the study of variational quantum algorithms.

TI Variational quantum simulation of the quantum critical regime
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The quantum critical regime marks a zone in the phase diagram where quantum fluctuation around the critical point plays a significant role at finite temperatures. While it is of great physical interest, simulation of the quantum critical regime can be difficult on a classical computer due to its intrinsic complexity. Herein, we propose a variational approach, which minimizes the variational free energy, to simulate and locate the quantum critical regime on a quantum computer. The variational quantum algorithm adopts an ansatz by performing an unitary operator on a product of a single-qubit mixed state, in which the entropy can be analytically obtained from the initial state, and thus the free energy can be accessed conveniently. With numeral simulation, using the one-dimensional Kitaev model as a demonstration we show that the quantum critical regime can be identified by accurately evaluating the temperature crossover line. Moreover, the dependencies of both the correlation length and the phase coherence time with temperature are evaluated for the thermal states. Our work suggests a practical way as well as a first step for investigating quantum critical systems at finite temperatures on quantum devices with few qubits.

TI Airborne quantum key distribution with boundary layer effects
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB With the substantial progress of terrestrial fiber-based quantum networks and satellite-based quantum nodes, airborne quantum key distribution (QKD) is now becoming a flexible bond between terrestrial fiber and satellite, which is an efficient solution to establish a mobile, on-demand, and real-time coverage quantum network. However, the random distributed boundary layer is always surrounded to the surface of the aircraft when the flight speed larger than 0.3 Ma, which would introduce random wavefront aberration, jitter and extra intensity attenuation to the transmitted photons. In this article, we propose a performance evaluation scheme of airborne QKD with boundary layer effects. The analyzed results about the photon deflection angle and wavefront aberration effects, show that the aero-optical effects caused by the boundary layer can not be ignored, which would heavily decrease the final secure key rate. In our proposed airborne QKD scenario, the boundary layer would introduce similar to 3.5 dB loss to the transmitted photons and decrease similar to 70.9% of the secure key rate. With tolerated quantum bit error rate set to 8%, the suggested quantum communication azimuth angle between the aircraft and the ground station is within 55(circle). Furthermore, the optimal beacon laser module and adaptive optics module are suggested to be employed, to improve the performance of airborne QKD system. Our detailed airborne QKD performance evaluation study can be performed to the future airborne quantum communication designs.

TI High-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing with many-hypercube
   codes
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Standard approaches to quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computing are based on encoding a single logical qubit into many physical ones, resulting in asymptotically zero encoding rates and therefore huge resource overheads. To overcome this issue, high-rate quantum codes, such as quantum low-density parity-check codes, have been studied over the past decade. In this case, however, it is difficult to perform logical gates in parallel while maintaining low overheads. Here, we propose concatenated high-rate small-size quantum error-detecting codes as a family of high-rate quantum codes. Their simple structure allows for a geometrical interpretation using hypercubes corresponding to logical qubits. We thus call them many-hypercube codes. They can realize both high rates, e.g., 30% (64 logical qubits are encoded into 216 physical ones), and parallelizability of logical gates. Developing dedicated decoder and encoders, we achieve high error thresholds even in a circuit-level noise model. Thus, the many-hypercube codes will pave the way to high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Protecting logical qubits with dynamical decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Demonstrating that logical qubits outperform their physical counterparts represents a milestone in achieving reliable quantum computation. Here, we propose to protect logical qubits with a dynamical decoupling scheme that implements iSWAP gates on nearest-neighbor physical qubits, and we experimentally demonstrate this scheme on superconducting transmon qubits. In our scheme, each logical qubit requires only two physical qubits. A universal set of quantum gates on the logical qubits can be achieved such that each logical gate comprises only one or two physical gates. Our experiments reveal that the coherence time of a logical qubit is extended by up to 357% compared to the better-performing physical qubit. Moreover, we demonstrate-to the best of our knowledge, for the first time-that multiple logical qubits can outperform their physical superconducting counterparts. We illustrate a set of universal gates through a logical Ramsey experiment and the creation of a logical Bell state. Given its scalable nature, our scheme holds promise as a component for future reliable quantum computation.

TI Using Quantum Metrological Bounds in Quantum Error Correction: A Simple
   Proof of the Approximate Eastin-Knill Theorem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a simple proof of the approximate Eastin-Knill theorem, which connects the quality of a quantum error-correcting code (QECC) with its ability to achieve a universal set of transversal logical gates. Our derivation employs powerful bounds on the quantum Fisher information in generic quantum metrological protocols to characterize the QECC performance measured in terms of the worst-case entanglement fidelity. The theorem is applicable to a large class of decoherence models, including erasure and depolarizing noise. Our approach is unorthodox, as instead of following the established path of utilizing QECCs to mitigate noise in quantum metrological protocols, we apply methods of quantum metrology to explore the limitations of QECCs.

TI Improved quantum error correction with randomized compiling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Current hardware for quantum computing suffers from high levels of noise, and so to achieve practical fault-tolerant quantum computing will require powerful and efficient methods to correct for errors in quan-tum circuits. Here, we explore the role and effectiveness of using noise tailoring techniques to improve the performance of error correcting codes. Noise tailoring methods such as randomized compiling (RC) convert complex coherent noise processes to effective stochastic noise. While it is known that this can be leveraged to design efficient diagnostic tools, we explore its impact on the performance of error correcting codes. Of particular interest is the important class of coherent errors, arising from control errors, where RC has the maximum effect-converting these into purely stochastic errors. For these errors, we show here that RC delivers an improvement in performance of the concatenated Steane code by several orders of magnitude. We also show that below a threshold rotation angle, the gains in logical fidelity can be arbitrarily magnified by increasing the size of the codes. These results suggest that using randomized compiling can lead to a significant reduction in the resource overhead required to achieve fault tolerance.

TI Additive Manufacturing for Advanced Quantum Technologies
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The development of quantum technology has opened up exciting opportunities to revolutionize computing and communication, timing and navigation systems, enable noninvasive imaging of the human body, and probe fundamental physics with unprecedented precision. Alongside these advancements has come an increase in experimental complexity and a correspondingly greater dependence on compact, efficient and reliable hardware. The drive to move quantum technologies from laboratory prototypes to portable, real-world instruments has incentivized miniaturization of experimental systems relating to a strong demand for smaller, more robust, and less power-hungry quantum hardware and for increasingly specialized and intricate components. Additive manufacturing, already heralded as game-changing for many manufacturing sectors, is especially well-suited to this task owing to the comparatively large amount of design freedom it enables and its ability to produce intricate 3D forms and specialized components. Herein we review work conducted to date on the application of additive manufacturing to quantum technologies, discuss the current state of the art in additive manufacturing in optics, optomechanics, magnetic components and vacuum equipment, and consider pathways for future advancement. We also give an overview of the research and application areas most likely to be impacted by the deployment of additive manufacturing techniques within the quantum technology sector.

TI Quantum entanglement on photonic chips: a review

AB Entanglement is one of the most vital properties of quantum mechanical systems, and it forms the backbone of quantum information technologies. Taking advantage of nano/microfabrication and particularly complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing technologies, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have emerged as a versatile platform for the generation, manipulation, and measurement of entangled photonic states. We summarize the recent progress of quantum entanglement on PICs, starting from the generation of nonentangled and entangled biphoton states, to the generation of entangled states of multiple photons, multiple dimensions, and multiple degrees of freedom, as well as their applications for quantum information processing.

TI Developing a quantum computing model for sequence annotation of
   interferon protein
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Interferon-related research has important implications for understanding how biological immune systems function. With the development of DNA sequencing in recent years, interferon has been found in an increasing number of species, and many genome sequences remain to be annotated. Since BLAST is a commonly used sequence comparison method and conventional methods have difficulty to optimize the time complexity of the BLAST algorithm, quantum computing sheds light on accelerating BLAST for sequence annotation after DNA sequencing. Moreover, owing to the limitations of quantum devices, related quantum circuit optimization methods are needed to optimize the circuits of quantum algorithms to reduce the qubits required and complexity of the circuits. This work presents a quantum computing model for sequence annotation after DNA sequencing. First, we propose a quantum gene sequence alignment algorithm that optimizes the time complexity of the second step of BLAST from linear to semilinear by combining Grover's quantum search algorithm and the quantum 01 string alignment algorithm. Second, we propose a quantum circuit optimization method based on a truth table that successfully reduces the number of quantum resources needed to implement the quantum algorithm. Third, we propose a visualization and analysis website that provides online circuit generation and simple experiment running. The experimental results show that our proposed methods can be successfully performed both on virtual and real quantum computer, verifying the usability of the algorithm.

TI Quantum Sensing with Erasure Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The dominant noise in an "erasure qubit" is an erasure-a type of error whose occurrence and location can be detected. Erasure qubits have potential to reduce the overhead associated with fault tolerance. To date, research on erasure qubits has primarily focused on quantum computing and quantum networking applications. Here, we consider the applicability of erasure qubits to quantum sensing and metrology. We show theoretically that, for the same level of noise, an erasure qubit acts as a more precise sensor or clock compared to its nonerasure counterpart. We experimentally demonstrate this by artificially injecting either erasure errors (in the form of atom loss) or dephasing errors into a differential optical lattice clock comparison, and observe enhanced precision in the case of erasure errors for the same injected error rate. In the context of a clock with repeated measurement cycles, erasure can improve the stability by a factor of 2. Similar benefits of erasure qubits to sensing can be realized in other quantum platforms like Rydberg atoms and superconducting qubits.

TI Switching and Swapping of Quantum Information: Entropy and Entanglement
   Level
SO ENTROPY
AB Information switching and swapping seem to be fundamental elements of quantum communication protocols. Another crucial issue is the presence of entanglement and its level in inspected quantum systems. In this article, a formal definition of the operation of the swapping local quantum information and its existence proof, together with some elementary properties analysed through the prism of the concept of the entropy, are presented. As an example of the local information swapping usage, we demonstrate a certain realisation of the quantum switch. Entanglement levels, during the work of the switch, are calculated with the Negativity measure and a separability criterion based on the von Neumann entropy, spectral decomposition and Schmidt decomposition. Results of numerical experiments, during which the entanglement levels are estimated for systems under consideration with and without distortions, are presented. The noise is generated by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the intrinsic decoherence is modelled by the Milburn equation. This work contains a switch realisation in a circuit form-built out of elementary quantum gates, and a scheme of the circuit which estimates levels of entanglement during the switch's operating.

TI Submicrometer-scale temperature sensing using quantum coherence of a
   superconducting qubit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Interest is growing in the development of quantum sensing based on the principles of quantum mechanics, such as discrete energy levels, quantum superposition, and quantum entanglement. Superconducting flux qubits are quantum two-level systems whose energy is sensitive to a magnetic field. Therefore, they can be used as high-sensitivity magnetic field sensors that detect the magnetization of a spin ensemble. Since the magnetization depends on temperature and the magnetic field, the temperature can be determined by measuring the magnetization using the flux qubit. In this study, we demonstrated highly sensitive temperature sensing with high spatial resolution as an application of a magnetic field sensor using the quantum coherence of a superconducting flux qubit. By using a superconducting flux qubit to detect the temperature dependence of the polarization ratio of electron spins in nano-diamond particles, we succeeded in measuring the temperature with a sensitivity of 1.3 mu K root Hz(-1) at T = 9.1 mK in the submicrometer range.

TI Entanglement, Quantum Correlators, and Connectivity in Graph States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This work presents a comprehensive exploration of the entanglement and graph connectivity properties of Graph States (GSs). Qubit entanglement in Pseudo Graph States (PGSs) is quantified using the Entanglement Distance (ED), a recently introduced measure of bipartite entanglement. In addition, a new approach is proposed for probing the underlying graph connectivity of genuine GSs, using Pauli matrix quantum correlators. These findings also reveal interesting implications for measurement processes, demonstrating the equivalence of some projective measurements. Finally, the emphasis is placed on the simplicity of data analysis in this framework. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the entanglement and connectivity properties of GSs, offering valuable information for quantum information processing and quantum computing applications. The famous stabiliser formalism, which is the typically preferred framework for the study of this type of states, is not used in this work; on the contrary, this approach is based exclusively on the concepts of expectation values, quantum correlations, and projective measurement, which have the advantage of being very intuitive and fundamental tools of quantum theory.
   This work explores entanglement and graph connectivity in graph states, a known universal resource for quantum computation. Quantifying qubit-wise entanglement with the novel entanglement distance for pseudo graph states, it introduces a method to probe genuine graph states' connectivity using quantum correlators of Pauli matrices. Unveiling equivalence in certain projective measurements, this approach, distinct from the stabilizer formalism, relies on intuitive tools like expectation values and quantum correlations. Offering insights into quantum information processing, it emphasizes simplicity in data analysis.image

TI A quantum encryption design featuring confusion, diffusion, and mode of
   operation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum cryptography-the application of quantum information processing and quantum computing techniques to cryptography has been extensively investigated. Two major directions of quantum cryptography are quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum encryption, with the former focusing on secure key distribution and the latter focusing on encryption using quantum algorithms. In contrast to the success of the QKD, the development of quantum encryption algorithms is limited to designs of mostly one-time pads (OTP) that are unsuitable for most communication needs. In this work we propose a non-OTP quantum encryption design utilizing a quantum state creation process to encrypt messages. As essentially a non-OTP quantum block cipher the method stands out against existing methods with the following features: 1. complex key-ciphertext relation (i.e. confusion) and complex plaintext-ciphertext relation (i.e. diffusion); 2. mode of operation design for practical encryption on multiple blocks. These features provide key reusability and protection against eavesdropping and standard cryptanalytic attacks.

TI Partially Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Architecture with

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers are expected to drastically accelerate certain computing tasks versus classical computers. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, which have tens to hundreds of noisy physical qubits, are gradually becoming available, but it is still challenging to achieve useful quantum advantages in meaningful tasks. On the other hand, full fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) based on quantum error correction code remains far beyond realization due to its extremely large requirement of high-precision physical qubits. In this study, we propose a quantum computing architecture to close the gap between NISQ and FTQC architectures. Our architecture is based on erroneous arbitrary rotation gates and error-corrected Clifford gates implemented by lattice surgery. We omit the typical distillation protocol to achieve direct analog rotations and small qubit requirements, and minimize the remnant errors of the rotations by a carefully designed state injection protocol. Our estimation based on numerical simulations shows that for early-FTQC devices that consist of 104 physical qubits with physical error probability p = 10-4, we can perform roughly 1.72 x 107 Clifford operations and 3.75 x 104 arbitrary rotations on 64 logical qubits. Such computations cannot be realized by the existing NISQ and FTQC architectures on the same device, as well as classical computers. We hope that our proposal and the corresponding development of quantum algorithms based on it will bring new insights into the realization of practical quantum computers in the future.

AB Stabilized cat qubits that possess biased noise channel with bit-flip errors exponentially smaller than phase-flip errors. Together with a set of bias-preserving (BP) gates, cat qubits are a promising candidate for realizing hardware efficient quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing. Compared to dissipatively stabilized cat qubits, the Kerr cat qubits can in principle support faster gate operations with higher gate fidelity, benefiting from the large energy gap that protects the code space. However, the leakage of the Kerr cats can increase the minor type of errors and compromise the noise bias. Both the fast implementation of gates and the interaction with environment can lead to such detrimental leakage if no sophisticated controls are applied. In this work, we introduce new fine-control techniques to overcome the above obstacles for Kerr cat qubits. To suppress the gate leakage, we use the derivative-based transition suppression technique to design derivative-based controls for the Kerr BP gates. We show that the fine-controlled gates can simultaneously have high gate fidelity and high noise bias and when applied to concatenated quantum error correction, can not only improve the logical error rate but also reduce resource overhead. To suppress the environment-induced leakage, we introduce colored single-photon dissipation, which can continuously cool the Kerr cats and suppress the minor errors while not enhancing the major errors.

TI Relaxation to equilibrium in controlled-NOT quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The approach to equilibrium of quantum mechanical systems is a topic as old as quantum mechanics itself, but has recently seen a surge of interest due to applications in quantum technologies, including, but not limited to, quantum computation and sensing. The mechanisms by which a quantum system approaches its long-time, limiting stationary state are fascinating and, sometimes, quite different from their classical counterparts. In this respect, quantum networks represent mesoscopic quantum systems of interest. In such a case, the graph encodes the elementary quantum systems (say qubits) at its vertices, while the links define the interactions between them. We study here the relaxation to equilibrium for a fully connected quantum network with controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates representing the interaction between the constituting qubits. We give a number of results for the equilibration in these systems, including analytic estimates. The results are checked using numerical methods for systems with up to 15-16 qubits. It is emphasized in which way the size of the network controls the convergency.

TI Designing Nanoinclusions for Quantum Sensing Based on Electromagnetic
   Scattering Formalism
SO PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER
AB Quantum interactions between a single particle and nanoinclusions of spherical or cylindrical shape are optimized to produce scattering lineshapes of high selectivity with respect to impinging energies, excitation directions, and cavity sizes. The optimization uses a rigorous solution derived via electromagnetic scattering formalism while the adopted scheme rejects boundary extrema corresponding to resonances that occur outside of the permissible parametric domains. The reported effects may inspire experimental efforts towards designing quantum sensing systems employed in applications spanning from quantum switching and filtering to single-photon detection and quantum memory.

In recent decades, researchers have tried to develop a platform for quantum information and computation that can be integrated into digital and telecom technologies without the need of a cryogenic environment. The current status of research in the field of quantum integrated photonics will be reviewed. A review of the most common integrated photonic platforms will be given, together with the main achievements and results in the last decade.

TI High-rate quantum networks with energy-time entanglement
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Quantum entanglement networks have garnered significant attention due to the inherent security provided by quantum physics. The networks aim to connect a multitude of users with a high secure key rate (SKR). Fully connected networks have been demonstrated using wavelength-division multiplexing architectures. However, the SKR of such networks remains challenging due to the limited brightness of quantum photon-pair sources and the loss introduced by cascaded filtering components. We present high-rate quantum entanglement networks that leverage a broadband quantum light source with high brightness and an industry-grade flexible wavelength-selective switching technique with uniform loss. By implementing the BBM92 protocol, we achieve an SKR of 28.19 kbps in a four-user network, representing a two-order-of-magnitude improvement over previous implementations. After transmission through a 40-km fiber spool, the SKR remains as high as 3.58 kbps and stays positive over distances up to 250 km. Furthermore, the flexibility of our scheme is illustrated by constructing a six-user network, achieving SKRs of 4.21 kbps and 0.45 kbps without and with a 40-km fiber spool, respectively. These results demonstrate a practical approach to enhancing the SKR and scalability in entanglement-based quantum networks, offering a feasible solution for deploying metropolitan and backbone quantum communication systems.

TI Generation of phonon quantum states and quantum correlations among
   single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Hexagonal boron nitride exhibits two types of defects with great potential for quantum information technologies: single-photon emitters (SPEs) and one-dimensional grain boundaries hosting topologically-protected phonons, termed as topologically-protected phonon lines (TPL). Here, by means of a simple effective model and density functional theory calculations, we show that it is possible to use these phonons for the transmission of information. Particularly, a single SPE can be used to induce single-, two- and qubit-phonon states in the one-dimensional channel, and (ii) two distant SPEs can be coupled by the TPL that acts as a waveguide, thus exhibiting strong quantum correlations. We highlight the possibilities offered by this material-built-in nano-architecture as a phononic device for quantum information technologies.

TI Non-Pauli Errors Can Be Efficiently Sampled in Qudit Surface Codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Surface codes are the most promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Single qudit errors are typically modeled as Pauli operators, to which general errors are converted via randomizing methods. In this Letter, we quantify remaining correlations after syndrome measurement for a qudit 2D surface code subject to non-Pauli errors via loops on the lattice, using percolation theory. Below the error correction threshold, remaining correlations are sparse and locally constrained. Syndromes for qudit surface codes are therefore efficiently samplable for non-Pauli errors, independent of the exact forms of the error and decoder.

TI QTFPred: robust high-performance quantum machine learning modeling that
   predicts main and cooperative transcription factor bindings with base
   resolution
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB Deep learning has become an essential tool for identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites, yet conventional approaches often struggle with limited training data for specific TFs. Here, we introduce QTFPred (Quantum-based TF Predictor), a quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates quantum convolutional layers within neural networks to predict TF binding at base resolution. By leveraging the exponential feature space offered by quantum circuits and training from scratch via GPU simulation, QTFPred achieves robust performance even in data-sparse scenarios. In benchmarks on 49 Encyclopedia of DNA elements ChIP-seq datasets, QTFPred delivered state-of-the-art accuracy in 92% of binary prediction and 96% of signal prediction tasks, outperforming conventional models in precision and stability. Moreover, the method reveals underlying TF motif representations, offering insights into cooperative binding mechanisms. These results highlight the potential of quantum machine learning to overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning in genomics modeling.

TI Quantum anonymous collision detection for quantum networks
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum mechanics offers new opportunities for diverse information processing tasks in communication and computational networks. In the last two decades, the notion of quantum anonymity has been introduced in several networking tasks that provide an unconditional secrecy of identity for the communicating parties. In this article, we propose a quantum anonymous collision detection (QACD) protocol which detects not only the collision but also guarantees the anonymity in the case of multiple senders. We show that the QACD protocol serves as an important primitive for a quantum anonymous network that features tracelessness and resource efficiency. Furthermore, the security analysis shows that this protocol is robust against the adversary and malicious participants.

TI Quantum simulation of quantum field theory in the light-front
   formulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes the structure of hadrons such as the proton at a fundamental level. The precision of calculations in QCD limits the precision of the values of many physical parameters extracted from collider data. For example, uncertainty in the parton distribution function is the dominant source of error in the W mass measurement at the Large Hadron Collider. Improving the precision of such measurements is essential in the search for new physics. Quantum simulation offers an efficient way of studying quantum field theories (QFTs) such as QCD nonperturbatively. Previous quantum algorithms for simulating QFTs have qubit requirements that are well beyond the most ambitious experimental proposals for large-scale quantum computers. Can the qubit requirements for such algorithms be brought into range of quantum computation with several thousand logical qubits? We show how this can be achieved by using the light-front formulation of quantum field theory. This work was inspired by the similarity of the light-front formulation to quantum chemistry, first noted by Wilson [Nucl. Phys. B, Proc. Suppl. 17, 82 (1990)].

TI Redundancy and Synergy of an Entangling Cloner in Continuous-Variable
   Quantum Communication
SO ENTROPY
AB We address minimization of information leakage from continuous-variable quantum channels. It is known, that regime of minimum leakage can be accessible for the modulated signal states with variance equivalent to a shot noise, i.e., vacuum fluctuations, in the case of collective attacks. Here we derive the same condition for the individual attacks and analytically study the properties of the mutual information quantities in and out of this regime. We show that in such regime a joint measurement on the modes of a two-mode entangling cloner, being the optimal individual eavesdropping attack in a noisy Gaussian channel, is no more effective that independent measurements on the modes. Varying variance of the signal out of this regime, we observe the nontrivial statistical effects of either redundancy or synergy between the measurements of two modes of the entangling cloner. The result reveals the non-optimality of entangling cloner individual attack for sub-shot-noise modulated signals. Considering the communication between the cloner modes, we show the advantage of knowing the residual noise after its interaction with the cloner and extend the result to a two-cloner scheme.

TI Simulating the quantum switch with quantum circuits is computationally
   hard
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Higher-order transformations acting on input quantum channels in an indefinite causal order-such as the quantum switch-cannot be described by quantum circuits using the same number of calls to the input channels. A natural question is whether they can be simulated, i.e., whether their action can be exactly and deterministically reproduced by a quantum circuit with more calls to the input channels. Here, we prove that the quantum switch acting on two n-qubit channels cannot be simulated by any quantum circuit using k calls to one channel and one to the other, if k < 2(n). This establishes an exponential separation in quantum query complexity between processes with indefinite causal order and quantum circuits. Moreover, even with one extra call to both input channels, such a simulation remains impossible. We further demonstrate the robustness of this separation by extending the result to probabilistic and approximate simulations scenarios.

TI Resource frugal optimizer for quantum machine learning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum-enhanced data science, also known as quantum machine learning (QML), is of growing interest as an application of near-term quantum computers. Variational QML algorithms have the potential to solve practical problems on real hardware, particularly when involving quantum data. However, training these algorithms can be challenging and calls for tailored optimization procedures. Specifically, QML applications can require a large shot-count overhead due to the large datasets involved. In this work, we advocate for simultaneous random sampling over both the dataset as well as the measurement operators that define the loss function. We consider a highly general loss function that encompasses many QML applications, and we show how to construct an unbiased estimator of its gradient. This allows us to propose a shot-frugal gradient descent optimizer called Refoqus (REsource Frugal Optimizer for QUantum Stochastic gradient descent). Our numerics indicate that Refoqus can save several orders of magnitude in shot cost, even relative to optimizers that sample over measurement operators alone.

TI Tests of quantum contextuality in particle physics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum contextuality refers to the impossibility of assigning a predefined, intrinsic value to a physical property of a system independently of the context in which the property is measured. It is, perhaps, the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. The many states with different spin that particle physics provides are the ideal setting for testing contextuality. We verify that the polarization states of single spin-1 massive particles produced at colliders are contextual. We test W+ gauge bosons produced in top-quark decays, J=yi and K*(892)0 mesons in B-meson decays and % mesons in chi 0 cand chi 1 ccharmonium decays by reinterpreting the data and the analyses of the ATLAS, LHCb, Belle II and BESIII experimental collaborations, respectively. The polarization states of these four particles show contextuality with a significance larger than 56. We also discuss the presence of quantum contextuality in spin states of bipartite systems formed by spin-1=2 particles. We test Lambda and Sigma baryons reinterpreting two BESIII data analyses, and pairs of top quarks utilizing a recent analysis of the CMS Collaboration. Quantum contextuality is present with a significance exceeding 56 also in these cases. In addition, we study the feasibility of testing quantum contextuality by means of Z boson production in association with the Higgs boson, Z and W bosons pairs created in Higgs boson decays and with pairs of z leptons. For the latter, we use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic the settings of SuperKEKB and of future lepton colliders. Experiments at high energies, though not designed for the purpose, perform surprisingly well in testing for quantum contextuality.

TI New progress of silicon-based semiconductor quantum computation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Spin qubits in silicon-based semiconductor quantum dots have become one of the prominent candidates for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing due to their long coherence time, good controllability, and compatibility with modern advanced integrated circuit manufacturing processes. In recent years, due to the remarkable advances in silicon-based materials, the structure of quantum dot and its fabrication process, and qubit manipulation technology, the great progress of high-fidelity state preparation and readout, single- and two-qubit gates of spin qubits for silicon based semiconductor quantum computation has been achieved. The control fidelities for single- and two-qubit gates all exceed 99% -fault tolerance threshold required by the surface code known for its exceptionally high tolerance to errors. In this paper, we briefly introduce the basic concepts of silicon-based semiconductor quantum dots, discuss the state-of-art technologies used to improve the fidelities of single- and two-qubit gates, and finally highlight the research directions that should be focused on.
   This paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we introduce three major types of quantum dot (QD) devices fabricated on different silicon-based substrates, including Si/SiGe heterojunction and Si/SiO2. The spin degree of electron or nucleus hosted in QD can be encoded into spin qubits. Electron spin qubits can be thermally initialized to ground state by using an electron reservoirs, and can be read out by spin-charge conversion mechanism: energy-selective readout (Elzerman readout) with reservoirs or Pauli spin blockade (PSB) without reservoirs. Additionally, high fidelity single-shot readout has been demonstrated by using radio-frequency gate reflectometry combined with the PSB, which has unique advantages in large-scale qubit array. To coherently control the spin qubits, electron dipole resonance (ESR) or electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR) for electron and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for nucleus are introduced. With the help of isotope purification greatly improving the dephasing time of qubit and fast single-qubit manipulation based on EDSR, fidelity above 99.9% can be reached. For the two-qubit gates based on exchange interaction between electron spins, the strength of interaction combined with Zeeman energy difference Delta Ez determines the energy levels of system, which lead to the different two-qubit gates, such as controlled-Z (CZ), controlled-Rotation (CROT), and the square root of the SWAP gate (root SWAP) gates. In order to improve the fidelity of two-qubit gates, a series of key technologies is used experimentally, they being isotope purification, symmetry operation, careful Hamiltonian engineering, and gate set tomography. Fidelity of two-qubit gates exceeding 99% has been demonstrated for electron spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum dots and nuclear spin qubits in donors. These advances have pushed the siliconbased spin qubit platform to become a major stepping stone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Finally, we discuss the future study of spin qubits, that is, how to effectively expand the number of qubits, and many other problems to be explored and solved.

TI A quantum algorithm for the direct estimation of the steady state of
   open quantum systems
SO QUANTUM
AB Simulating the dynamics and the non-equilibrium steady state of an open quantum system are hard computational tasks on conventional computers. For the simulation of the time evolution, several efficient quantum algorithms have recently been developed. However, computing the non-equilibrium steady state as the long-time limit of the system dynamics is often not a viable solution, because of exceedingly long transient features or strong quantum correlations in the dynamics. Here, we develop an efficient quantum algorithm for the direct estimation of averaged expectation values of observables on the non-equilibrium steady state, thus bypassing the time integration of the master equation. The algorithm encodes the vectorized representation of the density matrix on a quantum register, and makes use of quantum phase estimation to approximate the eigenvector associated to the zero eigenvalue of the generator of the system dynamics. We show that the output state of the algorithm allows to estimate expectation values of observables on the steady state. Away from critical points, where the Liouvillian gap scales as a power law of the system size, the quantum algorithm performs with exponential advantage compared to exact diagonalization.

TI Space and Time-Efficient Quantum Multiplier in Post Quantum Cryptography
   Era
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper examines the asymptotic performance of multiplication and the cost of quantum implementation for the Naive schoolbook, Karatsuba, and Toom-Cook methods in the classical and quantum cases and provides insights into multiplication roles in the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) era. Further, considering that the lattice-based PQC algorithm is based on polynomial multiplication algorithms, including the Toom-Cook 4-way multiplier as its fundamental building block, we propose a higher-degree multiplier, the Toom-Cook 8-way multiplier, which has the lowest asymptotic performance and implementation cost. Additionally, the designed multiplication will include additional sub-operations to complete the multiplication of large integers in order to prevent side-channel attacks. To design our Toom-Cook 8-way in detail, we employ detailed step computations such as splitting, evaluation, point-wise multiplication, interpolation, and recomposition, as well as several strategies to reduce space and time requirements. Existing asymptotic performance and quantum implementation cost multipliers are compared with our 2-way, 4-way, and 8-way Toom-Cook multiplier designs. Our Toom-Cook 8-way quantum multiplier has the lowest asymptotic log 15 performance analysis or qubit count in terms of space efficiency, with n((15)/(8) ) (log 15)/(2log 15-log 8) log(8) n or asymptotically O(n(1.245)). The design has the lowest logical Toffoli counts bound at 112n(log)8 (15) - 128n and Toffoli depth of n( (15)/(8) )1-( log 15 )/((2 log 15-log 8)) log(8) n, asymptotically close to O(n(1.0569)), which corresponds to a space-and time-efficient multiplication.

TI Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using
   Gaussian-correlated photonic beams
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the deterministic generation and distribution of entanglement in large quantum networks by driving distant qubits with the output fields of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier. In this setting, the amplifier produces a continuous Gaussian two-mode squeezed state, which acts as a quantum-correlated reservoir for the qubits and relaxes them into a highly entangled steady state. Here we are interested in the maximal amount of entanglement and the optimal entanglement generation rates that can be achieved with this scheme under realistic conditions taking, in particular, the finite amplifier bandwidth, waveguide losses, and propagation delays into account. By combining exact numerical simulations of the full network with approximate analytic results, we predict the optimal working point for the amplifier and the corresponding qubit-qubit entanglement under various conditions. Our findings show that this passive conversion of Gaussian into discrete-variable entanglement offers a robust and experimentally very attractive approach for operating large optical, microwave, or hybrid quantum networks, for which efficient parametric amplifiers are currently developed.

TI Resource-efficient quantum algorithm for protein folding
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence of amino acids is known as the protein folding problem. Due to the central role of proteins' structures in chemistry, biology and medicine applications, this subject has been intensively studied for over half a century. Although classical algorithms provide practical solutions for the sampling of the conformation space of small proteins, they cannot tackle the intrinsic NP-hard complexity of the problem, even when reduced to the simplest Hydrophobic-Polar model. On the other hand, while fault-tolerant quantum computers are beyond reach for state-of-the-art quantum technologies, there is evidence that quantum algorithms can be successfully used in noisy state-of-the-art quantum computers to accelerate energy optimization in frustrated systems. In this work, we present a model Hamiltonian with O(N-4) scaling and a corresponding quantum variational algorithm for the folding of a polymer chain with N monomers on a lattice. The model reflects many physico-chemical properties of the protein, reducing the gap between coarse-grained representations and mere lattice models. In addition, we use a robust and versatile optimization scheme, bringing together variational quantum algorithms specifically adapted to classical cost functions and evolutionary strategies to simulate the folding of the 10 amino acid Angiotensin on 22 qubits. The same method is also successfully applied to the study of the folding of a 7 amino acid neuropeptide using 9 qubits on an IBM 20-qubit quantum computer. Bringing together recent advances in building gate-based quantum computers with noise-tolerant hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, this work paves the way towards accessible and relevant scientific experiments on real quantum processors.

TI A support vector machine training scheme based on quantum circuits
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In order to improve the training efficiency of the support vector machine, a quantum circuit training scheme based on the inner product of the quantum state for the support vector machine is proposed in this work. Firstly, on the basis of the full analysis of the computational complexity of the classical support vector machine, the kernel function which is the main factor affecting the computational complexity of the algorithm is primarily analyzed. Based on quantum mechanics and quantum computing theory, the training sample elements in the kernel function are quantized to generate the corresponding quantum states. Secondly, according to the quantum states of the training sample elements, the types and quantities of the required quantum logic gates are derived and calculated, and the quantum circuit that can generate the corresponding quantum states of the training sample elements through the evolution of the quantum initial ground states and the quantum logic gates is designed. Then, in the light of the relationship between the inner product of the quantum state and the quantum logic gate SWAP, the quantum circuit is designed to complete the exchange operation of the corresponding quantum state amplitude. The inner product of the quantum state is realized by exchanging and evolving the amplitude of the quantum state in the quantum circuit. Finally, by measuring the quantum state of the controlling qubit, the inner product solution of the kernel function is obtained, and the acceleration effect of training support vector machine is realized. The verification results show that the scheme enables the support vector machine not only to complete the correct classification, but also to operate the quantum part of the scheme on the real quantum computer . Compared with the classical algorithm, the scheme reduces the time complexity of the algorithm for the polynomial degree, greatly shortens the training time of the model, and improves the efficiency of the algorithm. The scheme has certain feasibility, effectiveness and innovation, and expands the training idea of the support vector machine.

TI Viewing protected superconducting qubits through the lens of the cat
   qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by Z2-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge) and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in Ej/(kBT), while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in cos(29) qubits. We describe cat-qubit-inspired bias-preserving X and CX gates for fluxonium. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.

TI Modeling the performance of early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Progress in fault -tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) has driven the pursuit of practical applications with early fault -tolerant quantum computers (EFTQC). These devices, limited in their qubit counts and fault -tolerance capabilities, require algorithms that can accommodate some degrees of error, which are known as EFTQC algorithms. To predict the onset of early quantum advantage, a comprehensive methodology is needed to develop and analyze EFTQC algorithms, drawing insights from both the methodologies of noisy intermediate -scale quantum and traditional FTQC. To address this need, we propose such a methodology for modeling algorithm performance on EFTQC devices under varying degrees of error. As a case study, we apply our methodology to analyze the performance of randomized Fourier estimation (RFE) [Kshirsagar, Katabarwa, and Johnson, arXiv:2209.11322], an EFTQC algorithm for phase estimation. We investigate the runtime performance and the fault -tolerant overhead of RFE in comparison to the traditional quantum phase estimation algorithm. Our analysis reveals that RFE achieves significant savings in physical qubit counts while having a much higher runtime upper bound. We anticipate even greater physical qubit savings when considering more realistic assumptions about the performance of EFTQC devices. By providing insights into the performance trade-offs and resource requirements of EFTQC algorithms, our work contributes to the development of practical and efficient quantum computing solutions on the path to quantum advantage.

TI Stationary optomagnonic entanglement and magnon-to-optics quantum state
   transfer via opto-magnomechanics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We show how to prepare a steady-state entangled state between magnons and optical photons in an opto-magnomechanical configuration, where a mechanical vibration mode couples to a magnon mode in a ferrimagnet by the dispersive magnetostrictive interaction, and to an optical cavity by the radiation pressure. We find that, by appropriately driving the magnon mode and the cavity to simultaneously activate the magnomechanical Stokes and the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering, a stationary optomagnonic entangled state can be created. We further show that, by activating the magnomechanical state-swap interaction and subsequently sending a weak red-detuned optical pulse to drive the cavity, the magnonic state can be read out in the cavity output field of the pulse via the mechanical transduction. The demonstrated entanglement and state-readout protocols in such a novel opto-magnomechanical configuration allow us to optically control, prepare, and read out quantum states of collective spin excitations in solids, and provide promising opportunities for the study of quantum magnonics, macroscopic quantum states, and magnonic quantum information processing.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) as a solution to protect digital systems in the quantum era. We provide an in-depth analysis of various quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, including lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, isogeny-based, and multivariate approaches. The review highlights the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process, highlighting key algorithms, such as CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+, and discusses the strengths, vulnerabilities, and implementation challenges of the leading algorithms. In addition, we explore transition strategies for organizations, emphasizing hybrid cryptography to ensure backward compatibility during migration. This study offers key insights into the future of cryptographic standards and the critical steps necessary to prepare for the transition from classical to quantum-resistant systems.

TI Precision tomography of a three-qubit donor quantum processor in silicon
SO NATURE
AB Nuclear spins were among the first physical platforms to be considered for quantum information processing(1,2), because of their exceptional quantum coherence(3) and atomic-scale footprint. However, their full potential for quantum computing has not yet been realized, owing to the lack of methods with which to link nuclear qubits within a scalable device combined with multi-qubit operations with sufficient fidelity to sustain fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted P-31 donor nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled-Z gate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin(4), and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7)%. The quantum operations are precisely characterized using gate set tomography (GST)(5), yielding one-qubit average gate fidelities up to 99.95(2)%, two-qubit average gate fidelity of 99.37(11)% and two-qubit preparation/measurement fidelities of 98.95(4)%. These three metrics indicate that nuclear spins in silicon are approaching the performance demanded in fault-tolerant quantum processors(6). We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0)% fidelity. Because electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons(7-9) or physically shuttled across different locations(10,11), these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using donor nuclear and electron spins.

TI Protecting quantum correlations in presence of generalised amplitude
   damping channel: the two-qubit case
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Any kind of quantum resource useful in different information processing tasks is vulnerable to several types of environmental noise. Here we study the behaviour of quantum correlations such as entanglement and steering in two-qubit systems under the application of the generalised amplitude damping channel and propose two protocols towards preserving them under this type of noise. First, we employ the technique of weak measurement and reversal for the purpose of preservation of correlations. We then show how the evolution under the channel action can be seen as an unitary process. We use the technique of weak measurement and most general form of selective positive operator valued measure (POVM) to achieve preservation of correlations for a significantly large range of parameter values.

TI Implementation of Quantum Algorithms via Fast Three-Rydberg-Atom CCZ
   Gates
SO ENTROPY
AB Multiqubit CCZ gates form one of the building blocks of quantum algorithms and have been involved in achieving many theoretical and experimental triumphs. Designing a simple and efficient multiqubit gate for quantum algorithms is still by no means trivial as the number of qubits increases. Here, by virtue of the Rydberg blockade effect, we propose a scheme to rapidly implement a three-Rydberg-atom CCZ gate via a single Rydberg pulse, and successfully apply the gate to realize the three-qubit refined Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and three-qubit Grover search. The logical states of the three-qubit gate are encoded to the same ground states to avoid an adverse effect of the atomic spontaneous emission. Furthermore, there is no requirement for individual addressing of atoms in our protocol.

TI Method for Noise-Induced Regularization in Quantum Neural Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In the current quantum computing paradigm, significant focus is placed on the reduction or mitigation of quantum decoherence. When designing new quantum processing units, the general objective is to reduce the amount of noise qubits are subject to, and in algorithm design, a large effort is underway to provide scalable error correction or mitigation techniques. Yet some previous work has indicated that certain classes of quantum algorithms, such as quantum machine learning, may, in fact, be intrinsically robust to or even benefit from the presence of a small amount of noise. Here, we demonstrate that noise levels in quantum hardware can be effectively tuned to enhance the ability of quantum neural networks to generalize data, acting akin to regularisation in classical neural networks. As an example, we consider two regression tasks, where, by tuning the noise level in the circuit, we demonstrated improvement of the validation mean squared error loss. Moreover, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness by numerically simulating QNN training on a realistic model of a noisy superconducting quantum computer.

TI A Quantum Algorithm for Evaluating the Hamming Distance
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB We present a novel quantum algorithm to evaluate the hamming distance between two unknown oracles via measuring the degree of entanglement between two ancillary qubits. In particular, we use the power of the entanglement degree based quantum computing model that preserves at most the locality of interactions within the quantum model structure. This model uses one of two techniques to retrieve the solution of a quantum computing problem at hand. In the first technique, the solution of the problem is obtained based on whether there is an entanglement between the two ancillary qubits or not. In the second, the solution of the quantum computing problem is obtained as a function in the concurrence value, and the number of states that can be generated from the Boolean variables. The proposed algorithm receives two oracles, each oracle represents an unknown Boolean function, then it measures the hamming distance between these two oracles. The hamming distance is evaluated based on the second technique. It is shown that the proposed algorithm provides exponential speedup compared with the classical counterpart for Boolean functions that have large numbers of Boolean variables. The proposed algorithm is explained via a case study. Finally, employing recently developed experimental techniques, the proposed algorithm has been verified using IBM's quantum computer simulator.

TI Implementation of controlled unitary gates and its application in a
   remote-controlled quantum gate
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Recently, remote-controlled quantum information processing has been proposed for its applications in secure quantum processing protocols and distributed quantum networks. For remote-controlled quantum gates, the experimental realization of controlled unitary (CU) gates between any quantum gates is an essential task. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for implementing CU gates between any pair of unitary gates using the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom of single photons. Then, we experimentally implement remote-controlled single-qubit unitary gates by controlling either the state preparation or measurement of the control qubit with high process fidelities. We believe the proposed remote-controlled quantum gate model can pave the way for secure and efficient quantum information processing.

TI Preparation and Analysis of Two-Dimensional Four-Qubit Entangled States
   with Photon Polarization and Spatial Path
SO ENTROPY
AB Entanglement states serve as the central resource for a number of important applications in quantum information science, including quantum key distribution, quantum precision measurement, and quantum computing. In pursuit of more promising applications, efforts have been made to generate entangled states with more qubits. However, the efficient creation of a high-fidelity multiparticle entanglement remains an outstanding challenge due to the difficulty that increases exponentially with the number of particles. We design an interferometer that is capable of coupling the polarization and spatial paths of photons and prepare 2-D four-qubit GHZ entanglement states. Using quantum state tomography, entanglement witness, and the violation of Ardehali inequality against local realism, the properties of the prepared 2-D four-qubit entangled state are analyzed. The experimental results show that the prepared four-photon system is an entangled state with high fidelity.

TI Nonnegative/Binary matrix factorization for image classification using
   quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Classical computing has borne witness to the development of machine learning. The integration of quantum technology into this mix will lead to unimaginable benefits and be regarded as a giant leap forward in mankind's ability to compute. Demonstrating the benefits of this integration now becomes essential. With the advance of quantum computing, several machine-learning techniques have been proposed that use quantum annealing. In this study, we implement a matrix factorization method using quantum annealing for image classification and compare the performance with traditional machine-learning methods. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF) was originally introduced as a generative model, and we propose a multiclass classification model as an application. We extract the features of handwritten digit images using NBMF and apply them to solve the classification problem. Our findings show that when the amount of data, features, and epochs is small, the accuracy of models trained by NBMF is superior to classical machine-learning methods, such as neural networks. Moreover, we found that training models using a quantum annealing solver significantly reduces computation time. Under certain conditions, there is a benefit to using quantum annealing technology with machine learning.

TI Efficient cavity-assisted storage of photonic qubits in a solid-state

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report on the high-efficiency storage and retrieval of weak coherent optical pulses and photonic qubits in a cavity-enhanced solid-state quantum memory. By using an atomic frequency comb (AFC) memory in a Pr3+:Y2SiO5 3 + :Y 2 SiO 5 crystal embedded in an impedance-matched cavity, we stored weak coherent pulses at the single photon level with up to 62% efficiency for a pre-determined storage time of 2 mu s. We also confirmed that the impedance-matched cavity enhances the efficiency for longer storage times up to 70 mu s. Harnessing the temporal multimodality of the AFC scheme, we stored weak coherent time-bin qubits with a record (51 +/- 2%) efficiency and a fidelity over (94.8 +/- 1.4)%, limited by imperfections in the qubits creation and measurement.

TI Would the fidelity of quantum teleportation be increased by a local
   filtering operation near a dilaton black hole under decoherence?
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Previous studies have shown that the effects of black holes and environmental decoherence generally negatively influence quantum correlations and the fidelity of quantum teleportation in curved spacetime. In our paper, we find that as the dilaton parameter increases, the fidelity of quantum teleportation can either decrease or increase, which suggests that even in the presence of system-environment coupling, the dilaton effect of black hole can positive influence teleportation fidelity; specifically, the dilaton effect can create net fidelity in quantum teleportation under decoherence. This interesting result challenges the long-held belief that the effects of black holes and environmental decoherence can only reduce the fidelity of quantum teleportation. Additionally, we observe an unreported result: if the fidelity of quantum teleportation remains in the classical region, it can be transformed into the quantum region by utilizing a local filtering operation, thereby achieving better fidelity than classical communication. This impressive result may provide new insights for developing an experimental scheme to effectively implement quantum teleportation in the context of dilaton black holes under decoherence.

   distribution protocol
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Semi-quantum key distribution is traditionally based on two-level quantum systems. In this paper, an unconditional security of a semi quantum key distribution protocol based on higher-dimensional systems using various mutually unbiased bases is presented. We first consider the three dimensional case using three and four mutually unbiased bases and derive a lower bound for the key rate as a function of the quantum channel's noise. We then generalize the result to a semi-quantum key distribution protocol that employs different number of mutually unbiased bases for four-dimensional states. It is found that basing the semi-quantum key distribution protocol on higher-dimensional mutually unbiased bases can increase the tolerable threshold of the noise and the maximum achievable value of the secret key rate.

TI Artificial neural network encoding of molecular wavefunctions for
   quantum computing
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) for material modeling have received significant interest. We recently reported an adaptation of ANNs based on Boltzmann machine (BM) architectures to an ansatz of the multiconfigurational many-electron wavefunction, denoted as a neural-network quantum state (NQS), for quantum chemistry calculations [Yang et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2020, 16, 3513-3529]. Here, this study presents its extended formalism to a quantum algorithm that enables the preparation of the NQS through quantum gates. The descriptors of the ANN model, which are chosen as the occupancies of electronic configurations, are quantum-mechanically represented by qubits. Our algorithm may thus bring potential advantages over classical sampling-based computation employed in previous studies. The NQS can be accurately formed using quantum-native procedures. Still, the training of the model in terms of energy minimization is efficiently performed on a classical computer; thus, our approach is a class of variational quantum eigensolvers. The BM models are related to the Gibbs distribution, and our preparation procedures exploit techniques of quantum phase estimation but with no Hamiltonian evolution. The proposed algorithm is assessed by implementing it on a quantum computer simulator. Illustrative molecular calculations at the complete-active-space configuration interaction level of theory are displayed, confirming consistency with the accuracy of our previous classical approaches.
   Molecular wavefunction encoded with artificial neural networks (BM2, BM3, and RBM) is prepared by the quantum algorithm.

TI Encoding Two-Qubit Logical States and Quantum Operations Using the

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel coding scheme, which allows single quantum systems to encode multi-qubit registers. This allows for more efficient use of resources and the economy in designing quantum systems. The scheme is based on the notion of encoding logical quantum states using the charge degree of freedom of the discrete energy spectrum that is formed by introducing impurities in a semiconductor material. We propose a mechanism of performing single qubit operations and controlled two-qubit operations, providing a mechanism for achieving these operations using appropriate pulses generated by Rabi oscillations. The above architecture is simulated using the Armonk single qubit quantum computer of IBM to encode two logical quantum states into the energy states of Armonk's qubit and using custom pulses to perform one and two-qubit quantum operations.

TI Thermal information and teleportation in two-qutrit Heisenberg XX chain
   model
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB We employ the concepts of quantum Fisher information, quantum coherence, and fidelity to study a thermally environmental effect on the teleportation process. It is assumed that a single qutrit is teleported through a thermally environmental containing a two-qutrit Heisenberg XX chain under the external magnetic field (EMF) and Dzyaloshinski Moriya (DM) interaction. The energy spectrum of the physical Hamiltonian and its eigenstates are employed to obtain the thermal density matrix, which is used as a thermal teleportation environment. The Resort to the definition of quantum Fisher information for a single qubit system, we estimate the optimal behaviour concerning the EMF and temperature. The result shows that maximizing the estimation degree depends on increasing the EMF and minimizing it requires lowering temperature. The effect of temperature and DM coupling on the quantum coherence and fidelity of the teleported state is studied. It is shown that temperature destroyed the maximum bounds of the two physical quantity, while the DM coupling delays the effect of EMF at the same periods. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The exploitation of multimodality in different degrees of freedom is one of the most promising ways to increase the rate of heralded entanglement between distant quantum nodes. In this paper, we realize a spatially-multiplexed solid-state quantum memory array with ten individually controllable spin-wave memory cells featuring on-demand read-out and temporal multiplexing. By combining spatial and temporal multiplexing, we store weak coherent pulses at the single-photon level in up to 250 spatio-temporal modes, with an average signal-to-noise ratio of 10(2). We perform a thorough characterization of the whole system, including its multiplexing and demultiplexing stage. We verify that the memory array exhibits low cross-talk even at the single-photon level. The measured performance indicates readiness for storing non-classical states and promises a speed-up in entanglement distribution rates.

TI A novel geometrically invariant quantum watermarking scheme utilizing
   Quantum Error Correction
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB This paper proposes a novel geometrically invariant quantum watermarking scheme using Quantum Error Correction (QEC) and Novel Enhanced Quantum Image Representation (NEQR). The Geometric Transformation -based Image Assembling (GTA) mechanism is proposed to reconstruct the quantum watermark image utilizing QEC principle. The proposed GTA mechanism involves Quantum Image Rotation (QIR) and Quantum Block Rotation (QBR), thus two corresponding quantum watermarking methods, GTA_QIR and GTA_QBR, are proposed and detailed quantum circuits with complexity O(n) are designed. Then the Quantum Majority Finder (QMF) is proposed for embedding the watermark uniformly. In the experiments, we employ dataset USC-SIPI to evaluate the visual quality and robustness of the proposed scheme. Comparisons with the recent quantum watermarking methods is conducted and the results show that our methods have a superior performance. When under attack of 'Salt and Pepper' noise addition, the proposed GTA_QIR and GTA_QBR improve the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 22.57% and 23.49% at a density of 0.05, while at a density of 0.1, the average improvement is 11.13% and 12.05% respectively. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first quantum watermarking scheme which demonstrates resistance to geometric attacks.

TI Semi-Empirical Satellite-to-Ground Quantum Key Distribution Model for
   Realistic Receivers
SO ENTROPY
AB Satellite-based link analysis is valuable for efficient and secure quantum communication, despite seasonal limits and restrictions on transmission times. A semi-empirical quantum key distribution model for satellite-based systems was proposed that simplifies simulations of communication links. Unlike other theoretical models, our approach was based on the experimentally-determined atmospheric extinction coefficient typical for mid-latitude ground stations. The parameter was measured for both clear and foggy conditions, and it was validated using published experimental data from the Micius satellite. Using this model, we simulated secure QKD between the Micius satellite and ground stations with 300 mm and 600 mm aperture telescopes.

TI Rapid single-shot parity spin readout in a silicon double quantum dot
   with fidelity exceeding 99%
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Silicon-based spin qubits offer a potential pathway toward realizing a scalable quantum computer owing to their compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing technologies. Recent experiments in this system have demonstrated crucial technologies, including high-fidelity quantum gates and multiqubit operation. However, the realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer requires a high-fidelity spin measurement faster than decoherence. To address this challenge, we characterize and optimize the initialization and measurement procedures using the parity-mode Pauli spin blockade technique. Here, we demonstrate a rapid (with a duration of a few mu s) and accurate (with >99% fidelity) parity spin measurement in a silicon double quantum dot. These results represent a significant step forward toward implementing measurement-based quantum error correction in silicon.

TI Chiral discrimination through holonomic quantum coherent control with a
   trapped-ion qudit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A novel optical method for distinguishing chiral molecules is proposed and tested within a quantum simulator employing a trapped-ion qudit. This approach correlates the sign disparity of the dipole moment of chiral molecules with distinct cyclic evolution trajectories, yielding the unity population contrast induced by the different non-Abelian holonomies corresponding to the chirality. Harnessing the principles of holonomic quantum computation, our method can achieve highly efficient, non-adiabatic, and robust detection and separation of chiral molecules. Demonstrated in a trapped 171Yb+ ion testbed, this scheme achieves high contrast in the population of a specific state, showcasing its resilience to the noise inherent in the driving field.

TI Quantum deep generative prior with programmable quantum circuits
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Exploiting the utility of near-term quantum devices is a long-standing challenge whereas hybrid quantum machine learning emerges as a promising candidate. Here we propose a quantum-enhanced deep generative algorithm based on programmable quantum circuit-induced quantum latent codes. To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we conduct optical ghost imaging experiments, collecting dataset under varying physical sampling rates. Leveraging a physically enhanced loss function and a pretrained neural network, the quantum algorithm exhibits superior reconstruction performance compared to conventional algorithms. We observe the learnable quantum latent space enhances the out-of-distribution generalization capability of the pretrained model. In the context of computer vision problems, numerical results indicate that quantum latent space can increase the generation diversity of the pretrained model. Furthermore, the algorithm outperforms classical counterparts, particularly in image inpainting and colorization, by a significant margin. Our study demonstrates the utility of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in enhancing generalization capability, highlighting the potential of near-term quantum devices in large-scale generative artificial intelligence.
   Quantum circuits can generate hard distributions. Exploiting this known fact, the authors train a mixture of parametric quantum circuits and classical neural networks and show that the addition of the quantum part can enhance the expressive power of the model for generative AI.

TI Connectivity matrix model of quantum circuits and its application to
   distributed quantum circuit optimization
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB As quantum computation grows, the number of qubits involved in a given quantum computer increases. But due to the physical limitations in the number of qubits of a single quantum device, the computation should be performed in a distributed system. In this paper, a new model of quantum computation based on the matrix representation of quantum circuits is proposed. Then, using this model, we propose a novel approach for reducing the number of teleportations in a distributed quantum circuit. The proposed method consists of two phases: the pre-processing phase and the optimization phase. In the pre-processing phase, it considers the bi-partitioning of quantum circuits by Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) to minimize the number of global gates and to distribute the quantum circuit into two balanced parts with equal number of qubits and minimum number of global gates. In the optimization phase, two heuristics named Heuristic I and Heuristic II are proposed to optimize the number of teleportations according to the partitioning obtained from the pre-processing phase. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on many benchmark quantum circuits. The results of these evaluations show an average of 22.16% improvement in the teleportation cost of the proposed approach compared to the existing works in the literature.

TI Qu-Trefoil: Large-Scale Quantum Circuit Simulator Working on FPGA With
   SATA Storages
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Quantum circuits are fundamental components of quantum computing, and state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation is a widely used technique for tracking qubit behavior throughout circuit evolution. However, simulating a circuit with n qubits requires 2(n+4) bytes of memory, making simulations of more than 40 qubits feasible only on supercomputers. To address this limitation, we propose the Qu-Trefoil, a system designed for large-scale quantum circuit simulations on an FPGA-based platform called Trefoil. Trefoil is a multi-FPGA system connected to eight storage subsystems, each equipped with 32 SATA disks. Qu-Trefoil integrates a suite of HLS-based universal quantum gates, including Clifford gates (Hadamard (H), Pauli-Z (Z), Phase (S), Controlled-NOT (CNOT)), the T gate, and unitary matrix computation, along with HDL-designed modules for system-wide integration. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the system's robustness and flexibility, covering quantum gate performance, chunk size, disk extensibility, and efficiency across different SATA generations. We successfully simulated quantum circuits with over 43 qubits, which required more than 128 TB of memory, in approximately 3.72 to 13.06 hours on a single storage subsystem equipped with one FPGA. This achievement represents a significant milestone in the advancement of quantum computing simulations. Furthermore, thanks to its unique architecture, Qu-Trefoil is more accessible, flexible, and cost-efficient than other existing simulators for large-scale quantum circuit simulations, making it a viable option for researchers with limited access to supercomputers.

TI Single-Shot Secure Quantum Network Coding for General Multiple Unicast
   Network With Free One-Way Public Communication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB It is natural in a quantum network system that multiple users intend to send their quantum message to their respective receivers, which is called a multiple unicast quantum network. We propose a canonical method to derive a secure quantum network code over a multiple unicast quantum network from a secure classical network code. Our code correctly transmits quantum states when there is no attack. It also guarantees the secrecy of the transmitted quantum state even with the existence of an attack when the attack satisfies a certain natural condition. In our security proof, the eavesdropper is allowed to modify wiretapped information dependently on the previously wiretapped messages. Our protocol guarantees the secrecy by utilizing one-way classical information transmission (public communication) in the same direction as the quantum network although the verification of quantum information transmission requires two-way classical communication. In the protocol, some nodes may share secret randomness as resources in advance. Our secure network code can be applied to several networks including the butterfly network.

TI Implementing two-qubit gates at the quantum speed limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The speed of elementary quantum gates, particularly two-qubit gates, ultimately sets the limit on the speed at which quantum circuits can operate. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate commonly used two-qubit gates at nearly the fastest possible speed allowed by the physical interaction strength between two superconduct-ing transmon qubits. We achieve this quantum speed limit by implementing experimental gates designed using a machine-learning-inspired optimal control method. Importantly, our method only requires the single-qubit drive strength to be moderately larger than the interaction strength to achieve an arbitrary two-qubit gate close to its analytical speed limit with high fidelity. Thus the method is applicable to a variety of platforms, including those with comparable single-qubit and two-qubit gate speeds, or those with always-on interactions. We expect our method to offer significant speedups for non-native two-qubit gates that are typically achieved with a long sequence of single-qubit and native two-qubit gates.

TI Long-distance twin-field quantum key distribution with entangled sources
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution (TFQKD), using single-photon-type interference, offers a way to exceed the rate-distance limit without quantum repeaters. However, it still suffers from photon losses and dark counts, which impose an ultimate limit on its transmission distance. In this Letter, we propose a scheme to implement TFQKD with an entangled coherent state source in the middle to increase its range, as well as comparing its performance under coherent attacks with that of TFQKD variants. Simulations show that our protocol has a theoretical distance advantage of 400 km. Moreover, the scheme has great robustness against the misalignment error and finite-size effects. Our work is a promising step toward long-distance secure communication and is greatly compatible with future global quantum networks. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America.

TI Rock the QASBA: Quantum Error Correction Acceleration via the Sparse
   Blossom Algorithm on FPGAs
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
AB Quantum computing is a new paradigm of computation that exploits principles from quantum mechanics to achieve an exponential speedup compared to classical logic. However, noise strongly limits current quantum hardware, reducing achievable performance and limiting the scaling of the applications. For this reason, current errors occurring in the computation and correct them in real time. Nevertheless, the high computational complexity of QEC algorithms is incompatible with the tight time constraints of quantum devices. Thus, hardware acceleration is paramount to achieving real-time QEC. This work presents QASBA, an FPGAbased hardware accelerator for the Sparse Blossom Algorithm (SBA), a state-of-the-art decoding algorithm. After profiling the state-of-the-art software counterpart, we developed a design methodology for hardware development based on the SBA. We also devised an automation process to help users without expertise in hardware design in deploying architectures based on QASBA. We implement QASBA on different FPGA architectures and experimentally evaluate resource usage, execution time, and energy efficiency of our solution. Our solution attains up to 25.05x speedup and 304.16x improvement in energy efficiency compared to the software baseline.

TI Quantum networks boosted by entanglement with a control system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Networks of quantum devices with coherent control over their configuration offer promising advantages in quantum information processing, including quantum communication, computation, and sensing. So far, the investigation of these advantages assumed that the control system was initially uncorrelated with the data processed by the network. Here, we explore the power of quantum correlations between data and control, showing two communication tasks that can be accomplished with information-erasing channels if and only if the sender shares prior entanglement with a third party (the "controller") controlling the network configuration. The first task is to transmit classical messages without leaking information to the controller. The second task is to establish bipartite entanglement with a receiver, or, more generally, to establish multipartite entanglement with a number of spatially separated receivers.

TI Quantum communication with time-bin entanglement over a
   wavelength-multiplexed fiber network
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB In a quantum network involving multiple communicating parties, an important goal is to establish high-quality pairwise entanglement among the users without introducing multiple entangled-photon sources which would necessarily complicate the overall network setup. Moreover, it is preferable that the pairwise entanglement of photons is in the time-bin degree of freedom as the photonic time-bin qubit is ideally suited for fiber-optic distribution. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a field-deployable quantum communication network involving multiple users, all of whom share pairwise entanglement in the time-bin degree of freedom of photons. In particular, by utilizing a single spontaneous-parametric down-conversion source which produces a broadband pair of photons and the wavelength-division demultiplexing/multiplexing technology, all the communicating parties within the network are always simultaneously ready for quantum communication. To further demonstrate the practical feasibility of a quantum network with time-bin entanglement over a wavelength-multiplexed fiber network, we demonstrate entangled-photon quantum key distribution with three users, each separated by 60 km of optical fibers.

TI Measurement-based time evolution for quantum simulation of fermionic
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum simulation using time evolution in phase-estimation-based quantum algorithms can yield unbiased solutions of classically intractable models. However, long runtimes open such algorithms to decoherence. We show how measurement-based quantum simulation uses effective time evolution via measurement to allow runtime advantages over conventional circuit-based algorithms that use real-time evolution with quantum gates. We construct a hybrid algorithm to find energy eigenvalues in fermionic models using only measurements on graph states. We apply the algorithm to the Kitaev and Hubbard chains. Resource estimates show a runtime advantage if measurements can be performed faster than gates, and graph states compactification is fully used. In this letter, we set the stage to allow advances in measurement precision to improve quantum simulation.

TI Encoding Error Correction in an Integrated Photonic Chip
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Integrated photonics provides a versatile platform for encoding and processing quantum information. However, the encoded quantum states are sensitive to noise, which limits their capability to perform complicated quantum computations. Here, we use a five-qubit linear cluster state on a silicon photonic chip to implement a quantum error-correction code and demonstrate its capability of identifying and correcting a single-qubit error. The encoded quantum information is reconstructed from a single-qubit error and an average state fidelity of 0.863 +/- 0.032 is achieved for different input states. We further extend the scheme to demonstrate a fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) on stabilizer formal-ism that allows us to redo the qubit operation against the failure of the teleportation process. Our work provides a proof-of-concept working prototype of error correction and MBQC in an integrated photonic chip.

TI Quantum computing meets neural excitability: modeling ion channels and
   action potentials via membrane biophysics
SO AIMS BIOPHYSICS
AB Understanding neural excitability and action potential generation is a cornerstone of neuroscience, relying on the complex interplay of biophysical mechanisms governed by ion channels in neuronal membranes. Traditional approaches, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model, have provided a robust framework for simulating these processes using classical computational techniques. However, the advent of quantum computing opens new avenues for exploring neuronal dynamics, particularly due to ion movement's inherently quantum mechanical properties at atomic scales. In this study, I investigated the intersection of quantum computing and membrane biophysics, evaluating how quantum algorithms could revolutionize simulations of ion channel behavior and neuronal signaling. I began by analyzing the limitations of classical methods in handling high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Next, I introduced key quantum computing principles, including qubits, superposition, and entanglement, and their potential applications in solving molecular dynamics and differential equations relevant to neuronal activity. Despite promising theoretical advantages, practical challenges such as qubit coherence, error rates, and hardware scalability must be addressed before quantum models can outperform classical simulations. I also discussed hybrid classical-quantum approaches as a transitional strategy, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms. By bridging neuroscience, biophysics, and quantum information science, I aimed to stimulate interdisciplinary research toward more efficient and accurate models of neural excitability.

AB Quantum software engineering is advancing in the domain of quantum computing research and application, yet the documentation is scattered. The slow transition from Von-Neumann based computation systems to quantum systems, and conserving the fundamental computing principles in software development and software engineering helps in enrichment of quantum software development. The evolution of quantum computing over the past years shows a shift in the domain of classical computation to quantum computation in the years to come. Future applications such as, quantum AI and quantum machine learning will benefit from quantum software engineering. This survey collects and explores the various documentations in the domain of quantum systems and quantum software engineering. The survey provides an in-depth exploration of quantum programming languages, which is combined with explanations of quantum computing's fundamentals.

TI How Dynamical Quantum Memories Forget
SO QUANTUM
AB Motivated by recent work showing that a quantum error correcting code can be generated by hybrid dynamics of unitaries and measurements, we study the long time behavior of such systems. We demonstrate that even in the "mixed" phase, a maximally mixed initial density matrix is purified on a time scale equal to the Hilbert space dimension (i.e., exponential in system size), albeit with noisy dynamics at intermediate times which we connect to Dyson Brownian motion. In contrast, we show that free fermion systems - i.e., ones where the unitaries are generated by quadratic Hamiltonians and the measurements are of fermion bilinears - purify in a time quadratic in the system size. In particular, a volume law phase for the entanglement entropy cannot be sustained in a free fermion system.

TI Limitations of nearest-neighbor quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum communication research has in recent years shifted to include multipartite networks for which questions of quantum network routing naturally emerge. To understand the potential for multipartite routing, we focus on the most promising architectures for future quantum networks???those connecting nodes close to each other. Nearest-neighbor networks, such as rings, lines, and grids, have been studied under different communication scenarios to facilitate the sharing of quantum resources especially in the presence of bottlenecks. We analyze the potential of nearest-neighbor entangling gate quantum networks and identify some serious limitations by demonstrating that rings and lines cannot overcome common bottleneck communication problems.

TI Classification witness operator for the classification of different
   subclasses of three-qubit GHZ class
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB It is well known that three-qubit system has two kinds of inequivalent genuine entangled classes under stochastic local operation and classical communication. These classes are called as GHZ class and W class. GHZ class proved to be a very useful class for different quantum information processing tasks such as quantum teleportation, controlled quantum teleportation, etc. In this work, we distribute pure three-qubit states from GHZ class into different subclasses denoted by S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4 and show that the three-qubit states either belong to S-2 or S-3 or S-4 may be more efficient than the three-qubit state belong to S-1. Thus, it is necessary to discriminate the states belong to S-i, i = 2, 3, 4 and the state belong to S-1. To achieve this task, we have constructed different witness operators that can classify the subclasses S-i, i = 2, 3, 4 from S-1. We have shown that the constructed witness operator can be decomposed into Pauli matrices and hence can be realized experimentally.

TI Greedy gradient-free adaptive variational quantum algorithms on a noisy
   intermediate scale quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Hybrid quantum-classical adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) hold the potential to outperform classical computing for simulating many-body quantum systems. However, practical implementations on current quantum processing units (QPUs) are challenging due to the noisy evaluation of a polynomially scaling number of observables, undertaken for operator selection and high-dimensional cost function optimization. We introduce an adaptive algorithm using analytic, gradient-free optimization, called Greedy Gradient-free Adaptive VQE (GGA-VQE). In addition to demonstrating the algorithm's improved resilience to statistical sampling noise in the computation of simple molecular ground states, we execute GGA-VQE on a 25-qubit error-mitigated QPU by computing the ground state of a 25-body Ising model. Although hardware noise on the QPU produces inaccurate energies, our implementation outputs a parameterized quantum circuit yielding a favorable ground-state approximation. We demonstrate this by retrieving the parameterized operators calculated on the QPU and evaluating the resulting ansatz wave-function via noiseless emulation (i.e., hybrid observable measurement).

TI Simulating macroscopic quantum correlations in linear networks
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Many developing quantum technologies make use of quantum networks of different types. Even linear quantum networks are nontrivial, as the output photon distributions can be exponentially complex. Despite this, they can still be computationally simulated. The methods used are transformations into equivalent phase-space representations, which can then be treated probabilistically. This provides an exceptionally useful tool for the prediction and validation of experimental results, including decoherence. As well as experiments in Gaussian boson sampling, which are intended to demonstrate quantum computational advantage, these methods are applicable to other types of entangled linear quantum networks as well. This paper provides a tutorial and review of work in this area, to explain quantum phase-space techniques using the positive-P and Wigner distributions. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Toward coherent quantum computation of scattering amplitudes with a
   measurement-based photonic quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In recent years, applications of quantum simulation have been developed to study the properties of strongly interacting theories. This has been driven by two factors: on the one hand, needs from theorists to have access to physical observables that are prohibitively difficult to study using classical computing; on the other hand, quantum hardware becoming increasingly reliable and scalable to larger systems. In this work, we discuss the feasibility of using quantum optical simulation for studying scattering observables that are presently inaccessible via lattice QCD and are at the core of the experimental program at Jefferson Laboratory, the future Electron-Ion Collider, and other accelerator facilities. We show that recent progress in measurement-based photonic quantum computing can be leveraged to provide deterministic generation of required exotic gates and implementation in a single photonic quantum processor.

TI Real time deterministic quantum teleportation over 10 km of single
   optical fiber channel
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A real time deterministic quantum teleportation over a single fiber channel was implemented experimentally by exploiting the generated EPR entanglement at 1550 nm. A 1342 nm laser beam was used to transfer the classical intimation in real time and also acted as a synchronous beam to realize the synchronization of the quantum and classical information. The dependence of the fidelity on the transmission distance of the fiber channel was studied experimentally with optimizing the transmission efficiency of the lossy channel that was established to manipulate the beam of the EPR entanglement in Alice's site. The maximum transmission distance of the deterministic quantum teleportation was 10 km with the fidelity of 0.51 +/- 0.01, which is higher than the classical teleportation limit of 1/2. The work provides a feasible scheme to establish metropolitan quantum networks over fiber channels based on deterministic quantum teleportation.

TI Quantum Computing and Visualization: A Disruptive Technological Change
   Ahead
SO IEEE COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The focus of this Visualization Viewpoints article is to provide some background on quantum computing (QC), to explore ideas related to how visualization helps in understanding QC, and examine how QC might be useful for visualization with the growth and maturation of both technologies in the future. In a quickly evolving technology landscape, QC is emerging as a promising pathway to overcome the growth limits in classical computing. In some cases, QC platforms offer the potential to vastly outperform the familiar classical computer by solving problems more quickly or that may be intractable on any known classical platform. As further performance gains for classical computing platforms are limited by diminishing Moore's Law scaling, QC platforms might be viewed as a potential successor to the current field of exascale-class platforms. While present-day QC hardware platforms are still limited in scale, the field of quantum computing is robust and rapidly advancing in terms of hardware capabilities, software environments for developing quantum algorithms, and educational programs for training the next generation of scientists and engineers. After a brief introduction to QC concepts, the focus of this article is to explore the interplay between the fields of visualization and QC. First, visualization has played a role in QC by providing the means to show representations of the quantum state of single-qubits in superposition states and multiple-qubits in entangled states. Second, there are a number of ways in which the field of visual data exploration and analysis may potentially benefit from this disruptive new technology though there are challenges going forward.

TI Fast and high-fidelity dispersive readout of a spin qubit with squeezed
   microwave and resonator nonlinearity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Fast and high-fidelity qubit measurement is essential for quantum error correction in universal quantum computing. This study examines dispersive measurement of a spin in a semiconductor double quantum dot using a nonlinear microwave resonator. By employing displaced squeezed vacuum states, we achieve rapid, high-fidelity readout for silicon spin qubits. Our results show that modest squeezing and mild nonlinearity significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the fidelity of qubit-state readout. By optimally adjusting the phases of squeezing and nonlinearity, we reduce readout time to sub-microsecond ranges. With current technology parameters (kappa approximate to 2 chi s, chi s/(2 pi) approximate to 0.15 MHz), utilizing a displaced squeezed vacuum state with 30 photons and a modest squeezing parameter r approximate to 0.6, along with a nonlinear microwave resonator charactered by a strength of lambda approximate to - 1.2 chi s, a readout fidelity of 98% can be attained within a readout time of around 0.6 mu s.

TI Quantum entanglement control in two-spin-1/2 NMR systems through
   magnetic fields and temperature
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate quantum entanglement in two-spin-1/2 NMR systems at thermal equilibrium under external magnetic fields. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the entanglement of the system and show how the entanglement depends on temperature and magnetic field strength, resulting in a threshold temperature beyond which entanglement vanishes. We demonstrate that at zero temperature, the system exhibits a quantum critical point, characterized by non-analytic behavior in the measure of entanglement. We further develop analytical criterion for level crossing, which serves as a condition for identifying quantum critical points in both homonuclear and heteronuclear systems, and apply it to multiple settings to analyze their quantum critical points. We establish a direct link between the quantum entanglement quantifier and experimentally accessible NMR observables, enabling entanglement to be quantified through NMR signal processing. This provides a practical framework for characterizing quantum correlations using standard NMR experiments. These findings provide insights into the thermal control of quantum features, with implications for quantum-enhanced NMR, low-temperature spectroscopy, and emerging quantum technologies.

TI Image classification with rotation-invariant variational quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms are gaining attention as an early application of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the main problems of variational methods lies in the phenomenon of barren plateaus, present in the optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this problem, leading to a new field called geometric quantum machine learning. In this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with C4 rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ devices.

TI Neural-Network Decoders for Quantum Error Correction Using Surface
   Codes: A Space Exploration of the Hardware Cost-Performance Tradeoffs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is required in quantum computers to mitigate the effect of errors on physical qubits. When adopting a QEC scheme based on surface codes, error decoding is the most computationally expensive task in the classical electronic back-end. Decoders employing neural networks (NN) are well-suited for this task but their hardware implementation has not been presented yet. This work presents a space exploration of fully connected feed-forward NN decoders for small distance surface codes. The goal is to optimize the NN for the high-decoding performance, while keeping a minimalistic hardware implementation. This is needed to meet the tight delay constraints of real-time surface code decoding. We demonstrate that hardware-based NN-decoders can achieve the high-decoding performance comparable to other state-of-the-art decoding algorithms whilst being well below the tight delay requirements (approximate to 440 ns) of current solid-state qubit technologies for both application-specific integrated circuit designs (< 30 ns) and field-programmable gate array implementations (< 90 ns). These results indicate that NN-decoders are viable candidates for further exploration of an integrated hardware implementation in future large-scale quantum computers.

TI QPCC: a quantum programming course for inhomogeneous cohorts of

AB The ongoing accelerated development and exploration of Quantum Computing (QC) - systems, software, algorithms and applications - has generated a huge amount of interest and need among a wide range of organisations and user communities to better understand the technology paradigm, its maturity, limitations and opportunities, and positioning alongside classical high-performance computing (HPC) methods and tools. This interest and need to learn about QC has been accentuated by the rapidness and breadth of developments in QC that is being disseminated in both mainstream and specialist scientific/technical media as well as the accessibility to early quantum computing systems and tools. It has become a challenge for the (potential) user community to sift through the material catering to developing bottom-up fundamental scientific/mathematical skills as well as top-down exploitation oriented knowledge.
   As the National and one among the European Competence Centres in HPC, the Irish Centre for High-End Computing (ICHEC) has worked with an international advisory board composed of quantum computing technology developers, the user community and the Irish State Agency's network that is responsible for national enterprise skills development in ICT to create and deliver a blended course which is customisable, modular and stackable, thereby offering different learning pathways to professional learners from the academic, enterprise and public sector communities with inhomogeneous backgrounds. Particular emphasis is laid on the stakes of engaging learners and organisations with different knowledge basis, skills and learning objectives, as well as making the content suitably-positioned and approachable to all (e.g. varied levels of mathematical knowledge required for basic understanding of quantum computing versus developing quantum algorithms).
   In this paper, we discuss the Quantum Programming Certification Course (QPCC) by summarising the 4-year design process with the advisory board, drawing from ICHEC's experience in national and European HPC and QC R&D projects as well as preparation of strategies and joint white papers, and methods to address gaps between mainstream academic programmes in quantum technologies and existing training courses (such as MOOCs, tutorials, workshops). We discuss the approaches in QPCC to target professional learners from inhomogeneous backgrounds, tools and pedagogical approaches in preparing and delivering the training material, opportunities and challenges in positioning QPCC within the academic framework, and summarise open opportunities for developing collaborative solutions.

TI A System-on-a-Chip Implementation of a Post-Quantum Cryptography Scheme
   for Smart Meter Data Communications
SO SENSORS
AB The security of Smart Meter (SM) systems will be a challenge in the era of quantum computing because a quantum computer might exploit characteristics of well-established cryptographic schemes to reach a successful security breach. From a practical perspective, this paper focuses on the feasibility of implementing a quantum-secure lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism in a SM, hardware-constrained equipment. In this regard, the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) scheme, FrodoKEM, an alternate candidate for the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum standardization process, is implemented using a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) device in which the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) component is exploited to accelerate the most time-consuming routines in this scheme. Experimental results show that the execution time to run the FrodoKEM scheme in an SoC device reduces to one-third of that obtained by the benchmark implementation (i.e., the software implementation). Also, the attained execution time and hardware resource usage of this SoC-based implementation of the FrodoKEM scheme show that lattice-based cryptography may fit into SM equipment.

TI Exploiting Anyonic Behavior of Quasicrystals for Topological Quantum
   Computing
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The concrete realization of topological quantum computing using low-dimensional quasiparticles, known as anyons, remains one of the important challenges of quantum computing. A topological quantum computing platform promises to deliver more robust qubits with additional hardware-level protection against errors that could lead to the desired large-scale quantum computation. We propose quasicrystal materials as such a natural platform and show that they exhibit anyonic behavior that can be used for topological quantum computing. Different from anyons, quasicrystals are already implemented in laboratories. In particular, we study the correspondence between the fusion Hilbert spaces of the simplest non-abelian anyon, the Fibonacci anyons, and the tiling spaces of the one-dimensional Fibonacci chain and the two-dimensional Penrose tiling quasicrystals. A concrete encoding on these tiling spaces of topological quantum information processing is also presented by making use of inflation and deflation of such tiling spaces. While we outline the theoretical basis for such a platform, details on the physical implementation remain open.

TI Stationary quantum entanglement and steering between two distant
   macromagnets
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Generating and manipulating magnon quantum states for quantum information processing is a central topic in quantum magnonics. The conventional strategy amplifies the nonlinear interaction among magnons to manifest their quantum correlations at cryogenic temperatures, which is challenging for magnets with vanishingly small nonlinearities. Here we propose an unconventional approach to prepare entangled states of two distant magnon modes by applying a two-tone Floquet field to each magnet inside a microwave cavity. The Floquet driving can effectively generate parametric interaction between magnons and photons, and thus opens an indirect entanglement channel between the two magnon modes mediated by cavity photons. By optimizing the relative ratio of the magnon-photon coupling and the detuning between the magnon modes, the two magnon modes can reach a stationary and robust entanglement, of which the strength is enhanced compared with entanglement generated via magnetic nonlinearities. Furthermore, one-way steering between the two magnets is realized by engineering unequal damping rates of the two magnets while the steering asymmetry can be efficiently modulated by tuning the coupling strength of magnons and cavity photons. The essential physics of our findings universally applies to a wide class of magnets with small nonlinearities and may find promising applications in engineering robust magnon quantum states for quantum information science.

TI Field test of mode-pairing quantum key distribution
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution is a cornerstone of quantum technology, offering information-theoretical secure keys for remote parties. With many quantum communication networks established globally, the mode-pairing protocol stands out for its efficacy over inter-city distances using simple setups, emerging as a promising solution. In this study, we employ the mode-pairing scheme into existing inter-city fiber links, conducting field tests across distances ranging from tens to about a hundred kilometers. Our system achieves a key rate of 1.217 kbit/s in a 195.85 km symmetric link and 3.089 kbit/s in a 127.92 km asymmetric link without global phase locking. The results demonstrate that the modepairing protocol can achieve key rates comparable to those of a single quantum link between two trusted nodes on the Beijing-Shanghai backbone line, effectively reducing the need for half of the trusted nodes. These field tests confirm the mode-pairing scheme's adaptability, efficiency, and practicality, positioning it as a highly suitable protocol for quantum networks.

TI Quantum Gates with Different Robust Merits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A protocol for implementing a universal set of quantum gates, which are safeguarded from noise through geometric, dephasing-free, and dynamical-decoupling approaches is proposed. With properly designed Hamiltonians, the desired interactions are realized directly within the Schr & ouml;dinger picture rather than relying on the interaction picture. This design confers two advantages. One is that the system's evolution remains continuously protected by the noise-mitigation strategies at every stage, eliminating the need to revert to the Schr & ouml;dinger picture. The other one is that the dynamical decoupling technique effectively averages out small residual free terms in the system's Hamiltonian, thus reducing the stringent requirements for precise control of system parameters to avoid errors. Furthermore, numerical results are presented to support our protocol by finding gate fidelities in the absence (presence) of noises or errors, without or with dynamical decoupling technique.

TI Correlating AGP on a quantum computer
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB For variational algorithms on the near term quantum computing hardware, it is highly desirable to use very accurate ansatze with low implementation cost. Recent studies have shown that the antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wavefunction can be an excellent starting point for ansatze describing systems with strong pairing correlations, as those occurring in superconductors. In this work, we show how AGP can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer with circuit depth, number of CNOTs, and number of measurements being linear in system size. Using AGP as the initial reference, we propose and implement a unitary correlator on AGP and benchmark it on the ground state of the pairing Hamiltonian. The results show highly accurate ground state energies in all correlation regimes of this model Hamiltonian.

TI Preserving a qubit during state-destroying operations on an adjacent
   qubit at a few micrometers distance
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Protecting qubits from accidental measurements is essential for controlled quantum operations, especially during state-destroying measurements or resets on adjacent qubits, in protocols like quantum error correction. Current methods to preserve atomic qubits against such disturbances waste coherence time, extra qubits, and introduce additional errors. We demonstrate the feasibility of in-situ state-reset and state-measurement of trapped ions, achieving >99.9% fidelity in preserving an 'asset' ion-qubit while a neighboring 'process' qubit is reset, and >99.6% preservation fidelity while applying a detection beam for 11 mu s on the same neighbor at a distance of 6 mu m. This is achieved through precise wavefront control of addressing optical beams and using a single ion as both a quantum sensor for optical aberrations and an intensity probe with >50 dB dynamic range. Our demonstrations advance quantum processors, enhancing speed and capabilities for tasks like quantum simulations of dissipation and measurement-driven phases, and implementing error correction.

TI Metasurface for programmable quantum algorithms with classical and

SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Metasurfaces have recently opened up applications in the quantum regime, including quantum tomography and the generation of quantum entangled states. With their capability to store a vast amount of information by utilizing the various geometric degrees of freedom of nanostructures, metasurfaces are expected to be useful for processing quantum information. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a programmable metasurface capable of performing quantum algorithms using both classical and quantum light with single photons. Our approach encodes multiple programmable quantum algorithms and operations, such as Grover's search algorithm and the quantum Fourier transform, onto the same metalens array on a metasurface. A spatial light modulator selectively excites different sets of metalenses to carry out the quantum algorithms, while the interference patterns captured by a single-photon camera are used to extract information about the output state at the selected output directions. Our programmable quantum metasurface approach holds promising potential as a cost-effective means of miniaturizing components for quantum computing and information processing.

TI Space-Efficient Logical Qubit Architecture with a Bus for Magic State
   Consumption
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB We propose a logical qubit architecture for quantum computing systems with quantum error correction codes, considering the consumption of magic states. The path to the magic state is represented as a bus, and two types of architecture using a single-line bus, which uses physical qubits encoded with a repetition code, are presented. The architecture with the single-line bus minimizes the number of physical qubits, which refers to the space cost. In addition, the increase in the time cost owing to the single-line bus is mitigated by introducing scheduling and routing algorithms. Using simulations of benchmarks, we compared the costs of the proposed architecture with those of a full-patch architecture, which uses only ancilla patches. The space cost is significantly reduced, offsetting the increase in the time cost and decreasing the space-time cost of some benchmarks. We also estimate the logical error rate of each architecture, and the proposed architecture achieves at least 10 times higher logical error rate than the full-patch architecture at the same distance. However, the proposed architecture can improve the error rate by using higher distances with a slightly increased physical qubit budget. Therefore, it is feasible for near-term quantum computers with approximately 10000-40000 qubits.

TI Quantum control of spin qubits using nanomagnets
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Single-qubit gates are essential components of a universal quantum computer. Without selective addressing of individual qubits, scalable implementation of quantum algorithms is extremely challenging. When the qubits are discrete points or regions on a lattice, selectively addressing magnetic spin qubits at the nanoscale remains a challenge due to the difficulty of localizing and confining a classical divergence-free field to a small volume of space. Herein we propose a technique for addressing spin qubits using voltage-control of nanoscale magnetism, exemplified by the use of voltage control of magnetic anisotropy. We show that by tuning the frequency of the nanomagnet's electric field drive to the Larmor frequency of the spins confined to a nanoscale volume, and by modulating the phase of the drive, single-qubit quantum gates with fidelities approaching those for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be implemented. Such single-qubit gate operations require only tens of femto-Joules per gate operation and have lossless, purely magnetic field control. Their physical realization is also straightforward using foundry manufacturing techniques.

TI Quantum prospects for hybrid thin-film lithium niobate on silicon

SO FRONTIERS OF OPTOELECTRONICS
AB Photonics is poised to play a unique role in quantum technology for computation, communications and sensing. Meanwhile, integrated photonic circuits-with their intrinsic phase stability and high-performance, nanoscale components-offer a route to scaling. However, each integrated platform has a unique set of advantages and pitfalls, which can limit their power. So far, the most advanced demonstrations of quantum photonic circuitry has been in silicon photonics. However, thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is emerging as a powerful platform with unique capabilities; advances in fabrication have yielded loss metrics competitive with any integrated photonics platform, while its large second-order nonlinearity provides efficient nonlinear processing and ultra-fast modulation. In this short review, we explore the prospects of dynamic quantum circuits-such as multiplexed photon sources and entanglement generation-on hybrid TFLN on silicon (TFLN/Si) photonics and argue that hybrid TFLN/Si photonics may have the capability to deliver the photonic quantum technology of tomorrow.

AB In this paper, a mutual authentication quantum key agreement protocol with single-particle measurement is proposed. The participants can authenticate each other's identity through their secret identity information and the entanglement property of Bell states. After the authentication phase, the participants can negotiate a private key with equal contribution. We prove that the proposed scheme is unconditional security. In comparison to the previous mutual authentication quantum key agreement protocols, the proposed method utilizes Bell states as the quantum resource states in both the identity authentication and key agreement stages. It requires single-particle measurement without the need for Bell measurements or the involvement of trusted or semi-trusted other participants. Additionally, our proposed scheme demonstrates significant advantages in terms of qubit efficiency.

TI A simulation methodology for superconducting qubit readout fidelity
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB Qubit readout is a critical part of any quantum computer including the superconducting-qubit-based one. The readout fidelity is affected by the readout pulse width, readout pulse energy, resonator design, qubit design, qubit-resonator coupling, and the noise generated along the readout path. It is thus important to model and predict the fidelity based on various design parameters along the readout path. In this work, a simulation methodology for superconducting qubit readout fidelity is proposed and implemented using Matlab and Ansys HFSS to allow co-optimization in the readout path. As an example, parameters are taken from an actual superconducting-qubit-based quantum computer. Without any calibrations, the model is able to predict the readout error of the system as a function of the readout pulse power. It is found that the system can still maintain high fidelity even if the input power is reduced by 7 dB. This can be used to guide the design and optimization of a superconducting qubit readout system.

TI Balanced k-means clustering on an adiabatic quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Adiabatic quantum computers are a promising platform for efficiently solving challenging optimization problems. Therefore, many are interested in using these computers to train computationally expensive machine learning models. We present a quantum approach to solving the balanced k-means clustering training problem on the D-Wave 2000Q adiabatic quantum computer. In order to do this, we formulate the training problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Unlike existing classical algorithms, our QUBO formulation targets the global solution to the balanced k-means model. We test our approach on a number of small problems and observe that despite the theoretical benefits of the QUBO formulation, the clustering solution obtained by a modern quantum computer is usually inferior to the solution obtained by the best classical clustering algorithms. Nevertheless, the solutions provided by the quantum computer do exhibit some promising characteristics. We also perform a scalability study to estimate the run time of our approach on large problems using future quantum hardware. As a final proof of concept, we used the quantum approach to cluster random subsets of the Iris benchmark data set.

TI Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode on a trapped-ion quantum
   computer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. In this work, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. On the Quantinuum H1 trapped-ion processor, we experimentally observed a supersonic mode on an n = 18 fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, nearest-neighbor interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground-state preparation using a variance minimization scheme, accurately capturing correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length n = 20 using only 3 qubits. On the other hand, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for Theta(log(n))\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Theta (\log (n))$$\end{document} time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer. Our work raises many intriguing questions about the intrinsic properties of non-Hermitian systems that permit efficient quantum simulation.

TI Space-division multiplexed phase compensation for quantum communication:
   concept and field demonstration
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Phase-sensitive quantum communication has received considerable attention to overcome the distance limitation of quantum communication. A fundamental problem in phase-sensitive quantum communication is to compensate phase drift in an optical fiber channel. A combination of time-, wavelength-, and space-division phase compensation can improve the phase stability of the optical fiber. However, the existing phase compensations have used only timeand wavelength-division compensation. Here, we demonstrate space-division multiplexed phase compensation in the Osaka metropolitan networks. Our compensation scheme uses two neighboring fibers, one for quantum communication and the other for sensing and compensating the phase drift. Our field investigations confirm the correlation of the phase drift patterns between the two neighboring fibers. Thanks to the correlation, our spacedivision multiplexed phase compensation significantly reduces the phase drift and improves the quantum bit error rate. Hence, our experimental study has established the space-division multiplexed phase compensation scheme. We also propose a hybrid scheme of space-wavelength-time-division multiplexed phase compensation for twin-field quantum key distribution and a quantum repeater system.

TI Quantum machine learning for Lyapunov-stabilized computation offloading
   in next-generation MEC networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing and machine learning convergence enable powerful new approaches for optimizing mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. This paper uses Lyapunov optimization theory to propose a novel quantum machine learning framework for stabilizing computation offloading in next-generation MEC systems. Our approach leverages hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to learn optimal offloading policies that maximize network performance while ensuring the stability of data queues, even under dynamic and unpredictable network conditions. Rigorous mathematical analysis proves that our quantum machine learning controller achieves close-to-optimal performance while bounding queue backlogs. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional offloading approaches, improving network throughput by up to 30% and reducing power consumption by over 20%. These results highlight the immense potential of quantum machine learning to revolutionize next-generation MEC networks and support emerging applications at the intelligent network edge.

SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Continuous-variable (CV) quantum light sources are the essential resource for quantum computation. Integrated CV quantum light sources offer a scalable pathway by harnessing low-loss nonlinear materials, versatile device architectures, and CMOS-compatible fabrication processes enabled by integrated photonics platforms. In this review, we briefly introduce recent progress on integrated CV quantum light sources, including single-mode squeezed states, two-mode squeezed states, and multimode entangled states. The key performance metrics of CV quantum light sources, such as the squeezing level, bandwidth, purity, and mode multiplexing, are analyzed. We highlight representative implementations of lithium niobate, silicon nitride, and silica platforms for CV quantum light sources and discuss major challenges for realizing integrated large-scale and fault-tolerant CV quantum computation.

TI Polarization of Quantum Channels Using Clifford-Based Channel Combining
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We provide a purely quantum version of polar codes, achieving the symmetric coherent information of any qubit-input quantum channel. Our scheme relies on a recursive channel combining and splitting construction, where a two-qubit gate randomly chosen from the Clifford group is used to combine two single-qubit channels. The inputs to the synthesized bad channels are frozen by preshared EPR pairs between the sender and the receiver, so our scheme is entanglement assisted. We further show that quantum polarization can be achieved by choosing the channel combining Clifford operator randomly, from a much smaller subset of only nine two-qubit Clifford gates. Subsequently, we show that a Pauli channel polarizes if and only if a specific classical channel over a four-symbol input set polarizes. We exploit this equivalence to prove fast polarization for Pauli channels, and to devise an efficient successive cancellation based decoding algorithm for such channels. Finally, we present a code construction based on chaining several quantum polar codes, which is shown to require a rate of preshared entanglement that vanishes asymptotically.

TI Determining the proton content with a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a first attempt to design a quantum circuit for the determination of the parton content of the proton through the estimation of parton distribution functions (PDFs), in the context of high energy physics (HEP). The growing interest in quantum computing and the recent developments of new algorithms and quantum hardware devices motivates the study of methodologies applied to HEP. In this work we identify architectures of variational quantum circuits suitable for PDFs representation (qPDFs). We show experiments about the deployment of qPDFs on real quantum devices, taking into consideration current experimental limitations. Finally, we perform a global qPDF determination from collider data using quantum computer simulation on classical hardware and we compare the obtained partons and related phenomenological predictions involving hadronic processes to modern PDFs.

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox shows that it is possible to create a multipartite state involving three or more particles in which the measurement outcomes of the particles are correlated in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics. We extend it to witness quantum networks. We first extend the GHZ paradox to simultaneously verify the GHZ state and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states on triangle networks. We then extend the GHZ paradox to witness the entanglement of chain networks consisting of multiple GHZ states. All the present results are robust against the noise.

TI Efficient methods for one-shot quantum communication
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We address the question of efficient implementation of quantum protocols, with small communication and entanglement, and short depth circuit for encoding or decoding. We introduce two methods for this; the first constructs a resource-efficient convex-split lemma and the second adapts the technique of classical correlated sampling in computer science literature. These lead to the following consequences in one-shot quantum information theory. First concerns the task of quantum decoupling, achieved in many previous works with the aid of a random or pseudo-random unitary. We show that given any choice of basis such as the computational basis, decoupling can be achieved by a unitary that takes basis vectors to basis vectors. Thus, the circuit acts in a 'classical' manner; furthermore our unitary performs addition and multiplication modulo a prime. As the second consequence, we construct near-optimal communication protocol for quantum channel coding that uses exponentially smaller entanglement than the previous near-optimal protocol.

TI Realizing topological quantum walks on NISQ digital quantum computer
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We study the quantum walk on the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr & eacute;-Harper (AAH) lattice with periodic modulation using a digital quantum computer. We investigate various initial states at the single-particle level, considering different hopping modulation strengths and phase factors. Initiating the quantum walk with a particle at the lattice edge reveals the robustness of the edge state, attributed to the topological nature of the AAH model, and displays the influence of the phase factor on this edge state. On the other hand, when the quantum walk begins with a particle in the lattice bulk, we observe a repulsion of the bulk walker from the edge, especially under strong hopping modulation. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the quantum walk of two particles with nearest-neighbour (NN) interaction. We show the repulsion effect in the quantum walk when two walkers originate from the edge and bulk of the lattice due to the interaction. Additionally, when two particles are positioned at nearest-neighbor sites with strong hopping modulation, they unexpectedly form a local bound state at very small interaction strength, highlighting the unique interplay between hopping modulation and interaction in our quantum walk setup. We analyze these phenomena by examining physical quantities such as density evolution, two-particle correlation, and participation entropy, and discuss their potential applications in quantum technologies.

TI Minimizing Resource Overhead in Fusion-Based Quantum Computation Using
   Hybrid Spin-Photon Devices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present three schemes for constructing a (2,2)-Shor-encoded 6-ring photonic resource state for fusion-based quantum computing, each relying on a different type of photon source. We benchmark these architectures by analyzing their ability to achieve the loss tolerance threshold for fusion-based quantum computation using the target resource state. More precisely, we estimate their minimum hardware requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation in terms of the number of photon sources to achieve on-demand generation of resource states with a desired generation period. Notably, we find that a group of 12 deterministic single-photon sources containing a single matter qubit degree of freedom can produce the target resource state near-deterministically by exploiting entangling gates that are repeated until success. The approach is fully modular, eliminates the need for lossy large-scale multiplexing, and reduces the overhead for resource-state generation by several orders of magnitude compared to architectures using heralded single-photon sources and probabilistic linear-optical entangling gates. Our work shows that the use of deterministic single-photon sources embedding a qubit substantially shortens the path toward fault-tolerant photonic quantum computation.

TI SoK: Benchmarking the Performance of a Quantum Computer
SO ENTROPY
AB The quantum computer has been claimed to show more quantum advantage than the classical computer in solving some specific problems. Many companies and research institutes try to develop quantum computers with different physical implementations. Currently, most people only focus on the number of qubits in a quantum computer and consider it as a standard to evaluate the performance of the quantum computer intuitively. However, it is quite misleading in most times, especially for investors or governments. This is because the quantum computer works in a quite different way than classical computers. Thus, quantum benchmarking is of great importance. Currently, many quantum benchmarks are proposed from different aspects. In this paper, we review the existing performance benchmarking protocols, models, and metrics. We classify the benchmarking techniques into three categories: physical benchmarking, aggregative benchmarking, and application-level benchmarking. We also discuss the future trend for quantum computer's benchmarking and propose setting up the QTOP100.

TI QProv: A provenance system for quantum computing
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum computing promises breakthroughs in various application areas, such as machine learning, chemistry, or simulations. However, today's quantum computers are error-prone and have limited capabilities. This leads to various challenges when developing and executing quantum algorithms, for example, the mitigation of occurring errors or the selection of a suitable quantum computer to execute a certain quantum circuit. To address these challenges, detailed information about the quantum circuit to be executed as well as past executions, and the up-to-date information about the available quantum computers are required. Thus, this data must be continuously collected and stored in the long-term, which is currently not supported. To overcome this problem, a provenance approach is introduced for quantum computing. Therefore, relevant provenance attributes that should be gathered in the area of quantum computing are identified. Furthermore, QProv, a provenance system that automatically collects the identified provenance attributes and provides them in a uniform manner to the user is introduced. Finally, a case study with the collected provenance data and corresponding use cases that can benefit from this provenance data are presented here.

TI Thermodynamic optimization of quantum algorithms: On-the-go erasure of
   qubit registers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider two bottlenecks in quantum computing: limited memory size and noise caused by heat dissipa-tion. Trying to optimize both, we investigate "on-the-go erasure" of quantum registers that are no longer needed for a given algorithm: freeing up auxiliary qubits as they stop being useful would facilitate the parallelization of computations. We study the minimal thermodynamic cost of erasure in these scenarios, applying results on the Landauer erasure of entangled quantum registers. For the class of algorithms solving the Abelian hidden subgroup problem, we find optimal on-the-go erasure protocols. We conclude that there is a trade-off: if we have enough partial information about a problem to build efficient on-the-go erasure, we can use it to instead simplify the algorithm, so that fewer qubits are needed to run the computation in the first place. We provide explicit protocols for these two approaches.

Moreover, we show that polarization also happens for a much smaller subset of two-qudit Cliffords, which is not a unitary 2-design. Finally, we show how to decode the proposed quantum polar codes on Pauli qudit channels.

The vibrational modes can be represented as quantum harmonic oscillators and thus offer a Hilbert space with infinite dimensions. Here we review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the coherent manipulation of the vibrational modes, including bosonic encoding schemes in quantum information, reliable and efficient measurement techniques, and quantum operations that allow various quantum simulations and quantum computation algorithms. We describe experiments using the vibrational modes, including the preparation of non-classical states, molecular vibronic sampling, and applications in quantum thermodynamics. We finally discuss the potential prospects and challenges of trapped-ion vibrational-mode quantum information processing.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Information reconciliation is a critical component of quantum key distribution, ensuring that mismatches between Alice's and Bob's keys are corrected. In this study, we analyse, simulate, optimise and compare the performance of two prevalent algorithms used for information reconciliation: Cascade and LDPC codes in combination with the blind protocol. We focus on their applicability in practical and industrial settings, operating in realistic and application-close conditions. The results are further validated through evaluation on a live industrial QKD system.

AB Quantum Error Correction (QEC) protects qubits against bit- and phase-flip errors in the |0 > /|1 > subspace, but physical qubits can also leak into higher energy levels (e.g., |2 >). Leakage is especially harmful, as it corrupts all subsequent syndrome measurements and can spread to neighboring qubits. Detecting leakage on data qubits is particularly challenging, since they are never measured directly during QEC cycles. Prior work, such as eraser [43], addresses this by inferring leakage from syndrome patterns using a fixed heuristic. However, this approach often misclassifies benign syndromes, triggering excessive leakage-reduction circuits (LRCs). Because LRCs are themselves noisy and slow, these false triggers lengthen QEC cycles and inflate logical error rates.
   We propose gladiator, a general and adaptable leakage speculation framework that works across surface code, color code, and qLDPC codes. Offline, gladiator builds a code-aware errorpropagation graph calibrated to device data. Online, it classifies each syndrome in a few nanoseconds and schedules LRC only when the observed pattern is provably leakage-dominated. This precise speculation eliminates up to 3x (and on average 2x) unnecessary LRCs, shortens QEC cycles, and suppresses false positives at their source. Evaluated on standard fault-tolerant benchmarks, gladiator delivers 1.7x-3.9x speedups and 16% reduction in logical error rate, advancing the efficiency of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Universal Classical Optical Computing Inspired by Quantum Information
   Process
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Quantum computing has attracted much attention in recent decades, since it is believed to solve certain problems substantially faster than traditional computing methods. Theoretically, such an advance can be obtained by networks of the quantum operators in universal gate sets, one famous example of which is formed by quantum Control-not gate and single qubit gates. However, realizing a device that performs practical quantum computing is tricky. This is because it requires a scalable qubit system with long coherence time and good controls, which is harsh for most current platforms. Here, it is demonstrated that the information process based on a relatively stable system-classical optical system, can be considered as an analogy of universal quantum computing. By encoding the information via the polarization state of classical beams, the optical computing elements that correspond to the universal gate set are presented and their combination for a general information process is theoretically illustrated. Taking the analogy of two-qubit processor as an example, it is experimentally verified that the proposal works well. Considering the potential of optical system for reliable and low-energy-consuming computation, the results open a new way toward advanced information processing with high quality and efficiency.

TI Parallelizing Quantum Simulation With Decision Diagrams
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Since people became aware of the power of quantum phenomena in the domain of traditional computation, a great number of complex problems that were once considered intractable in the classical world have been tackled. The downsides of quantum supremacy are its high cost and unpredictability. Numerous researchers are relying on quantum simulators running on classical computers. The critical obstacle facing classical computers in the task of quantum simulation is its limited memory space. Quantum simulation intrinsically models the state evolution of quantum subsystems. Qubits are mathematically constructed in the Hilbert space whose size grows exponentially. Consequently, the scalability of the straightforward statevector approach is limited. It has been proven effective in adopting decision diagrams (DDs) to mitigate the memory cost issue in various fields. In recent years, researchers have adapted DDs into different forms for representing quantum states and performing quantum calculations efficiently. This leads to the study of DD-based quantum simulation. However, their advantage of memory efficiency does not let it replace the mainstream statevector and tensor network-based approaches. We argue the reason is the lack of effective parallelization strategies in performing calculations on DDs. In this article, we explore several strategies for parallelizing DD operations with a focus on leveraging them for quantum simulations. The target is to find the optimal parallelization strategies and improve the performance of DD-based quantum simulation. Based on the experiment results, our proposed strategy achieves a 2-3 times faster simulation of Grover's algorithm and random circuits than the state-of-the-art single-thread DD-based simulator DDSIM.

TI Self-assembled InAs/GaAs single quantum dots with suppressed InGaAs
   wetting layer states and low excitonic fine structure splitting for
   quantum memory
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated as on-demand entangled photon sources through biexciton-exciton (XX-X) cascaded radiative processes. However, perfect entangled photon emitters at the specific wavelengths of 880 nm or 980 nm, that are important for heralded entanglement distribution by absorptive quantum memories, remain a significant challenge. We successfully extend the QD emission wavelength to 880 nm via capping Stranski-Krastanow grown In(Ga)As/GaAs QDs with an ultra-thin Al x Ga1-xAs layer. After carefully investigating the mechanisms governing the vanishing of wetting-layer (WL) states and the anisotropy of QDs, we optimize the growth conditions and achieve a strong suppression of the WL emission as well as a measured minor fine structure splitting of only similar to(3.2 +/- 0.25) mu eV for the exciton line. We further extend this method to fabricate In(Ga)As QDs emitted at 980 nm via introducing InGaAs capping layer, and demonstrate a two-photon resonant excitation of the biexciton without any additional optical or electrical stabilized source. These QDs with high symmetry and stability represent a highly promising platform for the generation of polarization entanglement and experiments on the interaction of photons from dissimilar sources, such as rare-earth-ion-doped crystals for solid quantum memory.

TI Individually addressed entangling gates in a two-dimensional ion crystal
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) ion crystals may represent a promising path to scale up qubit numbers for ion trap quantum information processing. However, to realize universal quantum computing in this system, individually addressed high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates still remain challenging due to the inevitable micromotion of ions in a 2D crystal as well as the technical difficulty in 2D addressing. Here we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates between any ion pairs in a 2D crystal of four ions. We use symmetrically placed crossed acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) to drive Raman transitions and achieve an addressing crosstalk error below 0.1%. We design and demonstrate a gate sequence by alternatingly addressing two target ions, making it compatible with any single-ion addressing techniques without crosstalk from multiple addressing beams. We further examine the gate performance versus the micromotion amplitude of the ions and show that its effect can be compensated by a recalibration of the laser intensity without degrading the gate fidelity. Our work paves the way for ion trap quantum computing with hundreds to thousands of qubits on a 2D ion crystal.
   Quantum gates in 2D ion crystals are more challenging than in 1D. Here, the authors use their 2D ion trap platform and acousto-optical deflectors to demonstrate a 2-qubit gate that can stand the ion micromotion in such configuration.

TI Magic spreading in random quantum circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Magic is the resource that quantifies the amount of beyond-Clifford operations necessary for universal quantum computing. It bounds the cost of classically simulating quantum systems via stabilizer circuits central to quantum error correction and computation. In this paper, we investigate how fast generic many-body dynamics generate magic resources under the constraints of locality and unitarity, focusing on magic spreading in brick-wall random unitary circuits. We explore scalable magic measures intimately connected to the algebraic structure of the Clifford group. These metrics enable the investigation of the spreading of magic for system sizes of up to N = 1024 qudits, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art, which was restricted to about a dozen qudits. We demonstrate that magic resources equilibrate on timescales logarithmic in the system size, akin to anti-concentration and Hilbert space delocalization phenomena, but qualitatively different from the spreading of entanglement entropy. As random circuits are minimal models for chaotic dynamics, we conjecture that our findings describe the phenomenology of magic resources growth in a broad class of chaotic many-body systems.

TI All-microwave nonadiabatic multiqubit geometric phase gate for
   superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Geometric phase gates are promising tools toward robust quantum computing owing to their robustness against certain control errors and decoherence. Here, we propose a multiqubit architecture with a nonadiabatic geometric phase gate scheme that is feasible in widely used superconducting qubit designs such as transmon and fluxonium. Through segmented microwave drive on multiple qubits coupled off-resonantly to a common resonator, the geometric phase gate is obtained from the qubit-state-dependent displacement of the resonator without fine-tuning the qubit frequencies. Fidelity above 99.99% is achieved in simulation under the available experimental parameters. Our scheme uses all-microwave control and only exploits the lowest qubit levels with long coherence time; thus it is desirable for experiments. Together with the single-qubit holonomic gates demonstrated in earlier experiments, our scheme can realize universal all-geometric quantum computing, and it also finds applications in quantum simulation with many-body interactions.

TI Feedback-based quantum algorithm inspired by counterdiabatic driving
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In recent quantum algorithmic developments, a feedback-based approach has shown promise for preparing quantum many-body system ground states and solving combinatorial optimization problems. This method utilizes quantum Lyapunov control to iteratively construct quantum circuits. Here, we propose a substantial enhancement by implementing a protocol that uses ideas from quantum Lyapunov control and the counterdiabatic driving protocol, a key concept from quantum adiabaticity. Our approach introduces an additional control field inspired by counterdiabatic driving. We apply our algorithm to prepare ground states in one-dimensional quantum Ising spin chains. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate a remarkable acceleration in population transfer to low-energy states within a significantly reduced time frame compared to conventional feedback-based quantum algorithms. This acceleration translates to a reduced quantum circuit depth, a critical metric for potential quantum computer implementation. We validate our algorithm on the IBM cloud computer, highlighting its efficacy in expediting quantum computations for many-body systems and combinatorial optimization problems.

TI Investigating and mitigating barren plateaus in variational quantum
   circuits: a survey
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In recent years, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely explored to advance quantum circuits against classic models on various domains, such as quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. Similar to classic machine-learning models, VQCs can be trained through various optimization approaches, such as gradient-based or gradient-free methods. However, when employing gradient-based methods, the gradient variance of VQCs may dramatically vanish as the number of qubits or layers increases. This issue, a.k.a. barren plateaus (BPs), seriously hinders the scaling of VQCs on large datasets. To mitigate the barren plateaus, extensive efforts have been devoted to tackling this issue through diverse strategies. In this survey, we conduct a systematic literature review of recent works from both investigation and mitigation perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize most existing mitigation strategies into five groups and introduce them in detail. Also, we compare the concurrent survey papers about BPs. Finally, we provide insightful discussion on future directions for BPs.

TI The landscape of academic literature in quantum technologies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this study, we investigated the academic literature on quantum technologies (QT) using bibliometric tools. We used a set of 49,823 articles obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) database using a search query constructed through expert opinion. Analysis of this revealed that QT is deeply rooted in physics, and the majority of the articles are published in physics journals. Keyword analysis revealed that the literature could be clustered into three distinct sets, which are (i) quantum communication/cryptography, (ii) quantum computation, and (iii) physical realizations of quantum systems. We performed a burst analysis that showed the emergence and fading away of certain key concepts in the literature. This is followed by co-citation analysis on the "highly cited" articles provided by the WoS, using these we devised a set of core corpus of 34 publications. Comparing the most highly cited articles in this set with respect to the initial set we found that there is a clear difference in most cited subjects. Finally, we performed co-citation analyses on country and organization levels to find the central nodes in the literature. Overall, the analyses of the datasets allowed us to cluster the literature into three distinct sets, construct the core corpus of the academic literature in QT, and to identify the key players on country and organization levels, thus offering insight into the current state of the field. Search queries and access to figures are provided in the appendix.

Numerous studies have examined the application of quantum machine learning (QML) in healthcare and validated its superiority over classical ML algorithms. Objectives: This review investigates and reports the oncological applications of QML. Methods: In March 2023, an electronic investigation of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE, and Cochrane databases was performed. The articles were screened based on titles and abstracts, and their full texts were examined. Results: Initially, a total of 207 articles were retrieved. Thereafter, 9 articles were included in the study, most of which were published from 2020 onwards. The results indicated the implementation of various QML techniques in different aspects of oncology, such as reducing mammography image noise, edge detection of breast cancer, clinical decision support in radiotherapy treatment, and cancer classification. Conclusion: These studies revealed that integrating quantum science with ML can significantly improve patient care and clinical outcomes. Future studies should explore the integration of QC and ML and the development of novel algorithms to enhance cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment planning.

TI Quantum Key Distribution: Modeling and Simulation through BB84 Protocol
   Using Python3
SO SENSORS
AB Autonomous "Things" is becoming the future trend as the role, and responsibility of IoT keep diversifying. Its applicability and deployment need to re-stand technological advancement. The versatile security interaction between IoTs in human-to-machine and machine-to-machine must also endure mathematical and computational cryptographic attack intricacies. Quantum cryptography uses the laws of quantum mechanics to generate a secure key by manipulating light properties for secure end-to-end communication. We present a proof-of-principle via a communication architecture model and implementation to simulate these laws of nature. The model relies on the BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol with two scenarios, without and with the presence of an eavesdropper via the interception-resend attack model from a theoretical, methodological, and practical perspective. The proposed simulation initiates communication over a quantum channel for polarized photon transmission after a pre-agreed configuration over a Classic Channel with parameters. Simulation implementation results confirm that the presence of an eavesdropper is detectable during key generation due to Heisenberg's uncertainty and no-cloning principles. An eavesdropper has a 0.5 probability of guessing transmission qubit and 0.25 for the polarization state. During simulation re-iterations, a base-mismatch process discarded about 50 percent of the total initial key bits with an Error threshold of 0.11 percent.

TI Quantum computing software solutions, technologies, evaluation and

SO COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing has emerged as a promising field with the potential to revolutionize information processing and storage. Understanding its current state and research trajectory is crucial. This study aims to map the current literature on quantum computing, to identify how quantum computing is being used in solving quantum software problems and improving quantum algorithms. Moreover, it examines evaluation parameters and the challenges faced in this field. A systematic mapping study was conducted using the SCOPUS database, including all papers up to December 2024. Relevant articles were selected based on inclusion criteria, and a content analysis was performed to categorize and synthesize the findings. Information was gathered from 33 primary studies. Findings show that quantum computing is mainly applied in machine learning and optimization, though classical methods still outperform it. IBM Quantum is the most used platform. Research focuses on algorithm efficiency, verification over validation, and resource optimization, but lacks standardized evaluation methods. Key limitations include hardware constraints, noise, and scalability, while challenges involve integration, error correction, and problem formulation. Quantum computing continues to face significant technological challenges, but current research lays the groundwork for future advances. More practical studies on real hardware and strategies to improve the implementation and performance of quantum algorithms are needed. Effective evaluation, verification, and validation of quantum solutions must be further investigated.

TI Local Quantum Network Based on Background Electromagnetic Vacuum
   Fluctuations
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, as an unavoidable environment, plays important role in quantum information tasks. Though it plays a passive role in quantum teleportation, as the fluctuations make the initial entanglement decrease with time, it can also generate the past-future correlation between the sending and receiving nodes. In the present work, by utilizing past-future correlation generated by the background vacuum-fluctuated electromagnetic field, the state factor is transferred between two polarizable, controlled and initially separable two-level atoms located at different positions and evolving with the fluctuating field at different times. Results show that to transmit state factor with sufficient precision, there may exist specific local regions within both the ranges of time difference and the spatial separation between the two atoms. The sizes of the time region and spatial region are shown to be in relation with the width of mode ranges as well as the coupled strength, and it can also be controlled by further restricting the directions of the field modes to a certain range.

TI Entanglement-assisted quantum communication beating the quantum
   Singleton bound
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Brun, Devetak, and Hsieh [Science 314, 436 (2006)] demonstrated that preshared entanglement between the sender and receiver enables quantum communication protocols that have better parameters than schemes without the assistance of entanglement. Subsequently, the same authors derived a version of the so-called quantum Singleton bound that relates the parameters of the entanglement-assisted quantum-error-correcting codes proposed by them. We present an entanglement-assisted quantum communication scheme with parameters violating this bound in certain ranges. For a fixed transmission rate, our scheme allows one to correct a larger fraction of errors.

TI Designing quantum networks using preexisting infrastructure
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We consider the problem of deploying a quantum network on an existing fiber infrastructure, where quantum repeaters and end nodes can only be housed at specific locations. We propose a method based on integer linear programming (ILP) to place the minimal number of repeaters on such an existing network topology, such that requirements on end-to-end entanglement-generation rate and fidelity between any pair of end-nodes are satisfied. While ILPs are generally difficult to solve, we show that our method performs well in practice for networks of up to 100 nodes. We illustrate the behavior of our method both on randomly-generated network topologies, as well as on a real-world fiber topology deployed in the Netherlands.

TI A Quantum Machine Learning Approach to Spatiotemporal Emission Modelling
SO ATMOSPHERE
AB Despite the growing impact of emissions on our health and the environment, there remains an unmet need for emission concentration prediction and forecasting. The accumulating monitoring station and satellite data make the problem well-suited for quantum machine learning. This work takes a quantum machine learning approach to the spatiotemporal prediction of emission concentration. A quantum quanvolutional neural network model was developed and compared to a classical spatiotemporal ConvLSTM model using an evaluation framework of baseline models and metrics of per-pixel loss and intersection over union accuracy. The quantum quanvolutional neural network developed successfully generates one-hour-ahead emission concentration forecasts with increasingly lower loss (6.5% and 30.5% less) and higher accuracy (18.4% and 18.6% higher) compared to the input-independent and random baselines at the end of training. The quantum model was also comparable to the classical ConvLSTM model, with slightly lower loss (4%) but also slightly lower accuracy (3.7%). The study's results suggest that the quantum machine learning approach has the potential to improve emission concentration modeling and could become a powerful tool for accurately predicting air pollution.

   Applications
SO ALGORITHMS
AB In this paper, we explore using the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm to address scientific and engineering problems through quantum computing, utilizing the NWQSim simulation package on a high-performance computing platform. Focusing on domains such as power-grid management and climate projection, we demonstrate the correlations of the accuracy of quantum phase estimation, along with various properties of coefficient matrices, on the final solution and quantum resource cost in iterative and non-iterative numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method and finite difference method, as well as their impacts on quantum error correction costs using the Microsoft Azure Quantum resource estimator. We summarize the exponential resource cost from quantum phase estimation before and after quantum error correction and illustrate a potential way to reduce the demands on physical qubits. This work lays down a preliminary step for future investigations, urging a closer examination of quantum algorithms' scalability and efficiency in domain applications.

TI Unlocking the Potential of Quantum Machine Learning to Advance Drug
   Discovery
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The drug discovery process is a rigorous and time-consuming endeavor, typically requiring several years of extensive research and development. Although classical machine learning (ML) has proven successful in this field, its computational demands in terms of speed and resources are significant. In recent years, researchers have sought to explore the potential benefits of quantum computing (QC) in the context of machine learning (ML), leading to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML) as a distinct research field. The objective of the current study is twofold: first, to present a review of the proposed QML algorithms for application in the drug discovery pipeline, and second, to compare QML algorithms with their classical and hybrid counterparts in terms of their efficiency. A query-based search of various databases took place, and five different categories of algorithms were identified in which QML was implemented. The majority of QML applications in drug discovery are primarily focused on the initial stages of the drug discovery pipeline, particularly with regard to the identification of novel drug-like molecules. Comparison results revealed that QML algorithms are strong rivals to the classical ones, and a hybrid solution is the recommended approach at present.

TI Fully device-independent model on quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Bell inequality can provide a useful witness for device-independent applications with quantum (or postquantum) eavesdroppers. This feature holds only for single entangled systems. Our goal is to explore a device-independent model for quantum networks. We first propose a Bell inequality to verify the genuinely multipartite nonlocality of connected quantum networks including cyclic networks and universal quantum computational resources for a measurement-based computation model. This is further used to construct a monogamy relation in a fully device-independent model with multisource quantum resources. It is finally applied for multiparty quantum key distribution, blind quantum computation, and quantum secret sharing. The present model can inspire various large-scale applications on quantum networks in a device-independent manner.

We demonstrate the method in 167 Er-167(3+):Y2SiO5 by preparing spectrally isolated 18-dB-absorbing features on a <1 dB background. Using these features we create an atomic frequency comb and show a quantum storage of 200-ns pulses with 22% efficiency, limited by the background absorption which arises from laser instability. We describe the experimental improvements needed to reach the material limits: O(1)-s spin-state storage, O(100) MHz bandwidth, and >90% efficiency.

TI Automating NISQ Application Design with Meta Quantum Circuits with
   Constraints (MQCC)
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Near-term intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers are likely to have very restricted hardware resources, where precisely controllable qubits are expensive, error-prone, and scarce. Programmers of such computers must therefore balance trade-offs among a large number of (potentially heterogeneous) factors specific to the targeted application and quantum hardware. To assist them, we propose Meta Quantum Circuits with Constraints (MQCC), a meta-programming framework for quantum programs. Programmers express their application as a succinct collection of normal quantum circuits stitched together by a set of (manually or automatically) added meta-level choice variables, whose values are constrained according to a programmable set of quantitative optimization criteria. MQCC's compiler generates the appropriate constraints and solves them via an SMT solver, producing an optimized, runnable program. We showcase a few MQCC's applications for its generality including an automatic generation of efficient error syndrome extraction schemes for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with heterogeneous qubits and an approach to writing approximate quantum Fourier transformation and quantum phase estimation that smoothly trades off accuracy and resource use. We also illustrate that MQCC can easily encode prior one-off NISQ application designs--multi-programming (MP), crosstalk mitigation (CM)-as well as a combination of their optimization goals (i.e., a combined MP-CM).

TI Research progress of material, physics, and device of topological
   superconductors for quantum computing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Since the physical limit of Moore's law is being approached, many alternative computing methods have been proposed, among which quantum computing is the most concerned and widely studied. Owing to the non closeability of quantum system, the uncontrollable external factors will lead to quantum dissipation and decoherence. In order to avoid the decoherence of quantum superposition state, the fabrication of robust quantum bits has become one of the key factors. Majorana zero mode (MZM) is a quasi-particle emerging in the topological and superconducting hybrid system. It has non-Abelian statistical properties. Therefore, the topological qubit constructed by MZM has natural robustness to quantum decoherence. Despite the arduous exploration by various experimental groups, the experimental verification of MZM is still lacking. This paper reviews the history and main technical routes of quantum computing, focusing on the theory of topological superconductors, observable experimental phenomena, and the latest experimental progress. Furthermore we discuss and analyze the present status of the topological superconductor research. Finally, we prospect the future experiments and applications of topological superconductors in quantum computing.

TI Quantum-resilient software security: A fuzzy AHP-based assessment
   framework in the era of quantum computing
SO PLOS ONE
AB The introduction of quantum computing has transformed the setting of information technology, bringing both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. As quantum technologies continue to evolve, addressing their implications for software security has become an essential area of research. This paradigm change provides an unprecedented chance to strengthen software security from the start, presenting a plethora of novel alternatives. We use a multi-criteria decision-making methodology in this work to evaluate the efficacy of quantum computing approaches in improving software security. As the number of electronic applications grows, software developers strive to produce more sophisticated and user-friendly alternatives. However, in the pursuit of complexity, vulnerabilities may be introduced inadvertently, posing a substantial danger to software security. Our study addresses five major components of the quantum method to overcome these challenges: lattice-based cryptography, fully homomorphic algorithms, quantum key distribution, quantum hash functions, and blind quantum algorithms. The rapid development of quantum bits (qubits) regarded as basic quantum entities adds complexity and risk to the software security landscape. As a result, in the age of quantum computing, evaluating software security becomes not only necessary but also critical. To accomplish this objective, we propose the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), a soft computing method, as a reliable tool for accomplishing this goal. Our research aims to prioritise security variables using quantum security criteria, providing an innovative viewpoint on software security evaluation in the quantum computing era.

TI A novel quantum key distribution resistant against large-pulse attacks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic security by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. This means the security is independent of all future advances in algorithm or computational power. However, due to the non-availability of single-photon sources, most traditional QKD protocols are vulnerable to various attacks, such as photon number-splitting (PNS) attacks. Also, the imperfections in the measuring devices open a loophole for side channels that an eavesdropper may exploit to launch attacks such as large-pulse attacks. As a result, this compromises the security of transmitted information. To address these challenges, the authors present a QKD protocol that is secure against both large-pulse attacks and PNS attacks at zero-error, in which the eavesdropper does not introduce any error, but still, the legitimate users of the system cannot distil a secure key. A notable feature of the proposed protocol is that it promotes greater robustness against both attacks than the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol or the Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) protocol.
   A novel quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol is presented that addresses the security vulnerabilities posed by large-pulse attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the protocol, the authors conducted extensive simulations and analysis. The results demonstrate the robustness of our protocol against large-pulse attacks, with significantly improved performance compared to existing solutions. image

Angle-etched nanodevices are emerging as a solution to photonic integration in bulk substrates where color centers are best defined. We model triangular cross-section waveguides and photonic crystal cavities using Finite-Difference Time-Domain and Finite-Difference Eigensolver approaches. We analyze optimal color center positioning within the modes of these devices and provide estimates on achievable Purcell enhancement in nanocavities with applications in quantum communications. Using open quantum system modeling, we explore emitter-cavity interactions of multiple non-identical color centers coupled to both a single cavity and a photonic crystal molecule in SiC. We observe polariton and subradiant state formation in the cavity-protected regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics applicable in quantum simulation.

TI Ultrabright Entanglement Based Quantum Key Distribution over a 404 km
   Optical Fiber
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entangled photons are crucial resources for quantum information processing. Here, we present an ultrabright polarization-entangled photon source based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide designed for practical quantum communication networks. Using a 780 nm pump laser, the source achieves a pair generation rate of 2.4 x 1010 pairs/s/mW. Remarkably, the entangled photons are bright enough to be detected by a power meter, reaching a power of 17.9 nW under a pump power of 3.2 mW. We demonstrate the practicality of the source by conducting quantum key distribution experiments over longdistance fiber links. Wavelength-division multiplexing was employed to enhance the key generation, and nonlocal dispersion compensation was implemented to ensure precise timing coincidence measurements across a broad spectral range. By utilizing nine pairs of wavelength channels, the system achieved the applicable secure key rates of up to 440.80 bits/s over 200 km with a 62 dB loss and extended the maximum secure key generation distance to 404 km. These results demonstrate the potential of wavelength-multiplexed polarization-entangled photon sources for high-speed, long-distance quantum communication, positioning them as key components for future large-scale quantum networks.

TI Photonic-chip-based dense entanglement distribution
SO PHOTONIX
AB The dense quantum entanglement distribution is the basis for practical quantum communication, quantum networks and distributed quantum computation. To make entanglement distribution processes stable enough for practical and large-scale applications, it is necessary to perform them with the integrated pattern. Here, we first integrate a dense wavelength-division demultiplexing system and unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers on one large-scale photonic chip and demonstrate the multi-channel wavelength multiplexing entanglement distribution among distributed photonic chips. Specifically, we use one chip as a sender to produce high-performance and wideband quantum photon pairs, which are then sent to two receiver chips through 1-km standard optical fibers. The receiver chip includes a dense wavelength-division demultiplexing system and unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers and realizes multi-wavelength-channel energy-time entanglement generation and analysis. High quantum interference visibilities prove the effectiveness of the multi-chip system. Our work paves the way for practical entanglement-based quantum key distribution and quantum networks.

TI A Quantum Framework for Combinatorial Optimization Problem over Graphs
SO DATA SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Combinatorial optimization problems over graphs, such as the traveling salesman problem, longest path problem, and maximum independent set problem, are well-known for being computationally costly, some even NP-hard problems. In this paper, we propose a general quantum algorithm framework searching for approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems with linear objective functions. Our framework provides APIs (application programming interfaces) that enable developers to encode weighted graph structures onto quantum circuits and utilize variational algorithms to generate approximate solutions. One key advantage of our framework is that it allows developers to design new graph algorithms for the graph problem represented as linear combinations of edge weights without requiring expertise in quantum programming. Besides, it only uses a logarithmic level of quantum bit scale, making our framework work on quantum computers with limited physical resources. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework can provide good approximations for the traveling salesman problem compared to current quantum algorithm.

TI Time-extensive classical and quantum correlations in thermal machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study intraenvironmental classical and quantum correlations in a thermal machine, which is modeled as a driven quantum system coupled with thermal reservoirs. We compute the mutual information, the quantum discord, and the entanglement between two parts of the environment formed by oscillators centered around two different frequencies. We show that there are only two processes that generate time-extensive correlations in the long-time limit. First, there is a resonant process which is responsible for the transport of excitations between different environmental modes due to the absorption (or emission) of energy from (or into) the driving field. Second, there is a nonresonant process that transforms the energy from the external driving into pairs of excitations in two environmental modes. We show that there is a regime when the mutual information and the quantum discord between the parts of the environment correlated by these two processes grow quadratically in time, while entanglement production is time extensive.

TI Suppressing quantum errors by scaling a surface code logical qubit
SO NATURE
AB Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction(1,2) offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 +/- 0.016)% compared to (3.028 +/- 0.023)%). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7x10(-6) logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6x10(-7) excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.

TI Reinforcement learning-based architecture search for quantum machine
   learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) models use encoding circuits to map data into a quantum Hilbert space. While it is well known that the architecture of these circuits significantly influences core properties of the resulting model, they are often chosen heuristically. In this work, we present a approach using reinforcement learning techniques to generate problem-specific encoding circuits to improve the performance of QML models. By specifically using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, we reduce the number of necessary circuit evaluations during the search, providing a sample-efficient framework. In contrast to previous search algorithms, our method uses a layered circuit structure that significantly reduces the search space. Additionally, our approach can account for multiple objectives such as solution quality and circuit depth. We benchmark our tailored circuits against various reference models, including models with problem-agnostic circuits and classical models. Our results highlight the effectiveness of problem-specific encoding circuits in enhancing QML model performance.

TI A universal qudit quantum processor with trapped ions
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Most quantum computers use binary encoding to store information in qubits-the quantum analogue of classical bits. Yet, the underlying physical hardware consists of information carriers that are not necessarily binary, but typically exhibit a rich multilevel structure. Operating them as qubits artificially restricts their degrees of freedom to two energy levels(1). Meanwhile, a wide range of applications-from quantum chemistry(2) to quantum simulation(3)-would benefit from access to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which qubit-based quantum computers can only emulate(4). Here we demonstrate a universal quantum processor using trapped ions that act as qudits with a local Hilbert-space dimension of up to seven. With a performance similar to qubit quantum processors(5), this approach enables the native simulation of high-dimensional quantum systems(3), as well as more efficient implementation of qubit-based algorithms(6,7).

TI Dequantizing quantum machine learning models using tensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ascertaining whether a classical model can efficiently replace a given quantum model-dequantization-is crucial in assessing the true potential of quantum algorithms. In this work, we introduced the dequantizability of the function class of variational quantum-machine-learning (VQML) models by employing the tensor network formalism, effectively identifying every VQML model as a subclass of matrix product state (MPS) model characterized by constrained coefficient MPS and tensor product-based feature maps. From this formalism, we identify the conditions for which a VQML model's function class is dequantizable or not. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient quantum kernel-induced classical kernel which is as expressive as given any quantum kernel, hinting at a possible way to dequantize quantum kernel methods. This presents a thorough analysis of VQML models and demonstrates the versatility of our tensor-network formalism to properly distinguish VQML models according to their genuine quantum characteristics, thereby unifying classical and quantum machine-learning models within a single framework.

TI Analysis of Surface Code Algorithms on Quantum Hardware Using the Qrisp
   Framework
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The pursuit of scalable quantum computing is intrinsically limited by qubit decoherence, making robust quantum error correction (QEC) techniques crucial. As a leading solution, the topological surface code offers inherent protection against local noise. This study presents the first comprehensive implementation and quantitative characterization of a full surface code pipeline, which includes encompassing lattice construction, multi-round syndrome extraction, and MWPM decoding, using the high-level Qrisp programming framework. The entire pipeline was executed on IQM superconducting quantum processors to provide an empirical assessment under current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) conditions. Our experimental data definitively show that the system operates significantly below the fault-tolerance threshold. Crucially, a quantitative resource analysis isolates and establishes the lack of native qubit reset on the hardware as the dominant architectural bottleneck. This constraint forces the physical qubit count to scale as d2+(d2-1)T, effectively preventing scaling to larger code distances (d) and execution times (T) on current devices. The work confirms Qrisp's capability to support advanced QEC protocols, demonstrating that high-level abstraction can reduce implementation complexity by simplifying scheduling and mapping, thereby facilitating deeper experimental analysis of hardware limitations.

TI Scalable Parameter Design for Superconducting Quantum Circuits with
   Graph Neural Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called "three-stair scaling" mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single-and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 s. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.

TI Transitions in entanglement complexity in random quantum circuits by
   measurements
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Random Clifford circuits doped with non Clifford gates exhibit transitions to universal entanglement spectrum statistics [1] and quantum chaotic behavior. In [2] we proved that the injection of Omega(n) non Clifford gates into a n-qubit Clifford circuit drives the transition towards the universal value of the purity fluctuations. In this paper, we show that doping a Clifford circuit with Omega(n) single qubit non Clifford measurements is both necessary and sufficient to drive the transition to universal fluctuations of the purity.

TI Quantum correlations in PT-symmetric systems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study the dynamics of correlations in a paradigmatic setup to observe PT-symmetric physics: a pair of coupled oscillators, one subject to a gain one to a loss. Starting from a coherent state, quantum correlations (QCs) are created, despite the system being driven only incoherently, and can survive indefinitely. Both total and QCs exhibit different scalings of their long-time behavior in the PT-broken/unbroken phase and at the exceptional point (EP). In particular, PT symmetry breaking is accompanied by non-zero stationary QCs. This is analytically shown and quantitatively explained in terms of entropy balance. The EP in particular stands out as the most classical configuration, as classical correlations diverge while QCs vanish.

TI A meta-trained generator for quantum architecture search
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have made great success in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era due to their relative resilience to noise and high flexibility relative to quantum resources. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) aims to enhance the performance of VQAs by refining the structure of the adopted Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). QAS is garnering increased attention owing to its automation, reduced reliance on expert experience, and its ability to achieve better performance while requiring fewer quantum gates than manually designed circuits. However, existing QAS algorithms optimize the structure from scratch for each VQA without using any prior experience, rendering the process inefficient and time-consuming. Moreover, determining the number of quantum gates, a crucial hyper-parameter in these algorithms is a challenging and time-consuming task. To mitigate these challenges, we accelerate the QAS algorithm via a meta-trained generator. The proposed algorithm directly generates high-performance circuits for a new VQA by utilizing a meta-trained Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). The number of quantum gates required in the designed circuit is automatically determined based on meta-knowledge learned from a variety of training tasks. Furthermore, we have developed a meta-predictor to filter out circuits with suboptimal performance, thereby accelerating the algorithm. Simulation results on variational quantum compiling and Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) demonstrate the superior performance of our method over a state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS).

TI Integrated programmable controlled phase gate design for quantum
   information processing
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB An integrated programmable controlled-phase (CPHASE) gate has been proposed for quantum information processing applications. This gate can introduce arbitrary phase difference to the target qubit in the case of the control qubit being in the state of |1. As the desired phase difference can be utilized after fabrication, unlike the conventional controlled-phase gates that provide hard-coded phase shift, such an integrated gate is expected to pave the way for more versatile operations of current integrated optical circuits as well as possible new applications.

TI Nonlinear signal distortion corrections through quantum sensing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Having accurate gate generation is essential for precise control of a quantum system. The generated gate usually suffers from linear and nonlinear distortion. Previous works have demonstrated how to use a qubit to correct linear frequency distortions but have not commented on how to handle nonlinear distortions. This is an important issue as we show that nonlinear amplitude distortions from the RF electronics can affect Rabi pulses by as much as 10%. We present work that demonstrates how a transmon qubit can be used as a highly sensitive cryogenic detector to characterize these nonlinear amplitude distortions. We show that a correction can drive these errors down to <1% over a 700MHz range. This correction technique provides a method to minimize the effects of signal distortions and can be easily applied to broadband control pulses to produce higher fidelity arbitrary quantum gates.

TI Quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Spin network states are a powerful tool for constructing the SU(2) gauge theories on a graph. In loop quantum gravity (LQG), they have yielded many promising predictions, although progress has been limited by the computational challenge of dealing with high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. To explore more general configurations, quantum computing methods can be applied by representing spin network states as quantum circuits. In this article, we introduce an improved method for constructing quantum circuits for 4-valent Ising spin networks, which utilizes a smaller number of qubits than previous approaches. This has practical implications for the implementation of quantum circuits. We also demonstrate the procedure with various examples, including the construction of a 10-node Ising spin network state. The key ingredient of the method is the variational transfer of partial states, which we illustrate through numerous examples. Our improved construction provides a promising avenue for further exploring the potential of quantum computing methods in quantum gravity research.

TI Unimon qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconducting qubits seem promising for useful quantum computers, but the currently wide-spread qubit designs and techniques do not yet provide high enough performance. Here, we introduce a superconducting-qubit type, the unimon, which combines the desired properties of increased anharmonicity, full insensitivity to dc charge noise, reduced sensitivity to flux noise, and a simple structure consisting only of a single Josephson junction in a resonator. In agreement with our quantum models, we measure the qubit frequency, omega(01)/(2 pi), and increased anharmonicity alpha/(2 pi) at the optimal operation point, yielding, for example, 99.9% and 99.8% fidelity for 13 ns single-qubit gates on two qubits with (omega(01), alpha) = (4.49 GHz, 434 MHz) x 2 pi and (3.55 GHz, 744 MHz) x 2 pi, respectively. The energy relaxation seems to be dominated by dielectric losses. Thus, improvements of the design, materials, and gate time may promote the unimon to break the 99.99% fidelity target for efficient quantum error correction and possible useful quantum advantage with noisy systems.
   While transmon is the most widely used superconducting qubit, the search for alternative qubit designs with improved characteristic is ongoing. Hyyppa et al. demonstrate a novel superconducting qubit, the unimon, that combines high anharmonicity and protection against low-frequency charge noise and flux noise.

TI Superconducting quantum computers: who is leading the future?
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Superconducting quantum computing has emerged as a leading platform in the pursuit of practical quantum computers, driven by rapid advances from industry, academia, and government initiatives. This review examines the state of superconducting quantum technology, with emphasis on qubit design, processor architecture, scalability, and supporting quantum software. We compare the hardware strategies and performance milestones of key players-including IBM Quantum, Google Quantum AI, Rigetti Computing, Intel Quantum, QuTech, and Oxford Quantum Circuits-highlighting innovations in qubit coherence, control, and system integration. Landmark demonstrations such as quantum supremacy experiments are discussed alongside progress toward real-world applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Beyond hardware, attention is given to the broader software and service ecosystem, including quantum programming frameworks, operating environments, and cloud-accessible platforms such as Amazon Braket, Azure Quantum, and OriginQ Cloud, which enable remote access and algorithm development. Persistent challenges in superconducting quantum computing-such as error correction, system stability, and large-scale integration-are assessed in light of emerging approaches aimed at fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the field moves from the NISQ era toward fault-tolerant quantum computing, we capture the defining hardware achievements and characteristics of current superconducting processors, while examining the ongoing efforts and challenges in overcoming NISQ-era limitations. These developments offer critical insights into the path toward scalable quantum systems and their transformative impact on future technologies, while also underscoring the strategic and societal considerations that require balancing innovation with responsible oversight and thoughtful governance.

TI Resource-compact time-optimal quantum computation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computation enables reliable quantum computation but incurs a significant overhead from both time and resource perspectives. To reduce computation time, Austin G. Fowler proposed time-optimal quantum computation by constructing a quantum circuit for a fault-tolerant T gate without probabilistic S gate correction. In this work, we introduce a resource-compact quantum circuit that significantly reduces resource requirements by more than 60% for a fault-tolerant T gate without probabilistic S gate correction. Consequently, we present a quantum circuit that minimizes resource utilization for time-optimal quantum computation, demonstrating efficient time-optimal quantum computation. Additionally, we describe an efficient form involving initialization, CNOTs, and measurements, laying the foundation for the development of an efficient compiler for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Scalable and Modular Generation of W-State Entanglements via
   Memory-Enhanced Fusion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here, we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We also demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way toward realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.

TI Quantum Algorithms for Some Strings Problems Based on Quantum String

AB We study algorithms for solving three problems on strings. These are sorting of n strings of length k, "the Most Frequent String Search Problem ", and "searching intersection of two sequences of strings ". We construct quantum algorithms that are faster than classical (randomized or deterministic) counterparts for each of these problems. The quantum algorithms are based on the quantum procedure for comparing two strings of length k in O(k) queries. The first problem is sorting n strings of length k. We show that classical complexity of the problem is & UTheta;(nk) for constant size alphabet, but our quantum algorithm has O & SIM;(nk) complexity. The second one is searching the most frequent string among n strings of length k. We show that the classical complexity of the problem is & UTheta;(nk), but our quantum algorithm has O & SIM;(nk) complexity. The third problem is searching for an intersection of two sequences of strings. All strings have the same length k. The size of the first set is n, and the size of the second set is m. We show that the classical complexity of the problem is & UTheta;((n+m)k), but our quantum algorithm has O & SIM;((n+m)k) complexity.

TI Creating and destroying coherence with quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The emerging quantum technologies rely on our ability to establish and control quantum systems in nonclassical states, exhibiting entanglement and quantum coherence. It is thus crucial to understand how entanglement and coherence can be created in the most efficient way. In this Letter we study optimal ways to create a large amount of quantum coherence via quantum channels. For this, we compare different scenarios, where the channel is acting on an incoherent state, on states which have coherence, and also on subsystems of multipartite quantum states. We show that correlations in multipartite systems do not enhance the ability of a quantum channel to create coherence. We also study the ability of quantum channels to destroy coherence, proving that a channel can destroy more coherence when acting on a subsystem of a bipartite state. Crucially, we also show that the destroyed coherence on a multipartite system can exceed the upper bound of those on the single system when the total state is entangled. Our results significantly simplify the evaluation of the coherence generating capacity of quantum channels, which we also discuss.

Classical computers may encounter difficulties with these owing to immense computational demands. This study introduces quantum computer-generated holography (QGH) as a viable solution. QGH employs a point-cloud algorithm in which point-cloud data are represented by the superposition states of qubits, and lightwave interactions on the hologram are calculated using principles of quantum mechanics. QGH can accelerate hologram computation by a factor of 10(6) in a 1 tera-pixel hologram from 1 tera-object points, compared to classical computer-generated holography. The study discusses advantages, limitations, and future directions.

TI Performance Analysis of Continuous Variable Quantum Teleportation with

SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Continuous variable quantum teleportation (CVQT) is one of the technologies currently explored to implement global quantum networks. Entanglement source is an indispensable resource to realize CVQT, and its distribution process has natural symmetry. Though there are many results for CVQT over optical fiber or atmospheric channel, little attention is paid to seawater channel. In this paper, a model based on seawater chlorophyll concentration is used to study the attenuation effect of seawater on light. In our scheme, a noiseless linear amplifier is utilized for enhancing the performance of CVQT under seawater channel. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has an improvement in terms of fidelity and maximum transmission distance compared with the original scheme.

TI Local clustering decoder as a fast and adaptive hardware decoder for the
   surface code
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB To avoid prohibitive overheads in performing fault-tolerant quantum computation, the decoding problem needs to be solved accurately and at speeds sufficient for fast feedback. Existing decoding systems fail to satisfy both of these requirements, meaning they either slow down the quantum computer or reduce the number of operations that can be performed before the quantum information is corrupted. We introduce the Local Clustering Decoder as a solution that simultaneously achieves the accuracy and speed requirements of a real-time decoding system. Our decoder is implemented on FPGAs and exploits hardware parallelism to keep pace with the fastest qubit types. Further, it comprises an adaptivity engine that allows the decoder to update itself in real-time in response to control signals, such as heralded leakage events. Under a realistic circuit-level noise model where leakage is a dominant error source, our decoder enables one million error-free quantum operations with 4x fewer physical qubits when compared to standard non-adaptive decoding. This is achieved whilst decoding in under 1 mu s per round with modest FPGA resources, demonstrating that high-accuracy real-time decoding is possible, and reducing the qubit counts required for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Quantum coherence and counterdiabatic quantum computing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Counterdiabatic driving (CD) emerges as a valuable technique for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, enhancing quantum technology applications. In this context, counterdiabatic quantum computing (CQC) represents a new paradigm with the potential to achieve quantum advantage for industrial problems. This work investigates the production of quantum coherence in adiabatic evolution accelerated by CD within the framework of CQC. Specifically, we analyze different orders in the nested commutator expansion for approximated CDs for three cases: a weighted max-cut problem, a four-local Hamiltonian, and a non-stoquastic Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that the hierarchy introduced by coherence production correlates with the success probability in the impulse regime. This suggests that protocols increasing coherence during evolution enhance performance in adiabatic evolution driven by counterdiabatic techniques. We show that large quantum coherence also means large energy fluctuation during evolution, which is associated with the speed of evolution, paving the way for designing superior algorithms in CQC.

TI Demonstration of Shor Encoding on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for unlocking the true power of quantum computers. QEC codes use multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit, which is protected against errors at the physical qubit level. Here, we use a trapped-ion system to experimentally prepare m-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and sample the measurement results to construct m x m logical states of the [[m(2), 1, m]] Shor code, up to m = 7. The synthetic logical fidelity shows how deeper encoding can compensate for additional gate errors in state preparation for larger logical states. However, the optimal code size depends on the physical error rate and we find that m = 5 has the best performance in our system. We further realize the direct logical encoding of the [[9, 1, 3]] Shor code on nine qubits in a 13-ion chain for comparison, with 98.8(1)% and 98.5(1)% fidelity for state vertical bar +/->(L), respectively.

AB Because of the largest number of qubits available, and the massive parallel execution of entangling two-qubit gates, atom arrays is a promising platform for quantum computing. The qubits are selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps, some of which can be moved during the computation itself. By adjusting the locations of the traps and shining a specific global laser, different pairs of qubits, even those initially far away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program execution. In comparison, previous QC architectures only generate entanglement on a fixed set of quantum register pairs. Thus, reconfigurable atom arrays (RAA) present a new challenge for QC compilation, especially the qubit mapping/layout synthesis stage which decides the qubit placement and gate scheduling. In this paper, we consider an RAA QC architecture that contains multiple arrays, supports 2D array movements, represents cutting-edge experimental platforms, and is much more general than previous works. We start by systematically examining the fundamental constraints on RAA imposed by physics. Built upon this understanding, we discretize the state space of the architecture, and we formulate layout synthesis for such an architecture to a satisfactory modulo theories problem. Finally, we demonstrate our work by compiling the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the promising near-term quantum computing applications. Our layout synthesizer reduces the number of required native two-qubit gates in 22-qubit QAOA by 5.72x (geomean) compared to leading experiments on a superconducting architecture. Combined with a better coherence time, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in circuit fidelity.

TI Noise-Robust Quantum Teleportation With Counterfactual Communication
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Direct counterfactual communication (DCC) based on the dynamic quantum Cheshire cat effect is an interesting protocol for particle-less information transfer. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust, completely counterfactual, teleportation scheme based on the modified DCC. We show that our scheme does not require any a priori shared phase reference; an essential requirement for conventional teleportation schemes. For our modified DCC, we investigate the noise acting on the remotely controlled properties of a photon, i.e., path and polarization. We show that our proposed modification and resulting teleportation scheme are robust against channel delay and dephasing noise. While for photonic loss, depolarizing, and bit-flip noise, it is possible to obtain the correct state given only the channel state information.

TI Single-State Multi-Party Quantum Key Agreement with Single-Particle
   Measurement
SO ENTROPY
AB In this study, we propose a single-state multi-party quantum key agreement (MQKA) protocol with single-particle measurement. Firstly, a single-state three-party quantum key agreement protocol with single-particle measurement is introduced, followed by a security analysis that validated its capability to resist potential internal and external attacks. Furthermore, we utilize multi-particle entangled states to present a multi-party version of the single-state multi-party quantum key agreement with single-particle measurement. In comparison to previous MQKA protocols, our approach presents the following advantages: it employs one kind of multi-particle entangled state as the quantum resource; eliminates the need for entanglement swapping techniques, unitary operations, or pre-shared keys between participants; uses only the X measurement basis and Z measurement basis; transmits fewer qubits; consumes fewer qubits; and has higher qubit efficiency.

TI Navigating the 16-dimensional Hilbert space of a high-spin donor qudit
   with electric and magnetic fields
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Efficient scaling and flexible control are key aspects of useful quantum computing hardware. Spins in semiconductors combine quantum information processing with electrons, holes or nuclei, control with electric or magnetic fields, and scalable coupling via exchange or dipole interaction. However, accessing large Hilbert space dimensions has remained challenging, due to the short-distance nature of the interactions. Here, we present an atom-based semiconductor platform where a 16-dimensional Hilbert space is built by the combined electron-nuclear states of a single antimony donor in silicon. We demonstrate the ability to navigate this large Hilbert space using both electric and magnetic fields, with gate fidelity exceeding 99.8% on the nuclear spin, and unveil fine details of the system Hamiltonian and its susceptibility to control and noise fields. These results establish high-spin donors as a rich platform for practical quantum information and to explore quantum foundations.
   Qudits, higher-dimensional analogues of qubits, expand quantum state space for information processing using fewer physical units. Here the authors demonstrate control over a 16-dimensional Hilbert space, equivalent to four qubits, using combined electron-nuclear states of a single Sb donor atom in Si.

TI Polarization entanglement generation in silicon nitride
   waveguide-coupled dual microring resonators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Polarization-entangled photon pair sources exhibiting nonlocal quantum correlations are crucial to developments of quantum computing, quantum communications, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing technologies. On-chip polarization entanglement generation thus constitutes one enabling component for integrated quantum photonic circuits. Here, we present to our knowledge the first polarization-entangled photon pair sources in a silicon nitride platform for integrated quantum photonic circuits. We demonstrate the generation of a polarization-entangled state by adopting a configuration comprising dual microring resonators, with nearly degenerate transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarized cavity resonances for the two resonators coupled in series to a common bus waveguide. We measure two-photon interference and quantum state tomography to characterize the polarization entanglement of the generated state and to reconstruct the density matrix. Our experiments reveal a visibility of 96.4 o +/- 3.1 o and of 86.7 o +/- 3.2 o with the |H > and |V > bases, respectively (and a visibility of 89.4 o +/- 6.6 o and 81.3 o +/- 7.3 o with the |D > and |A > bases), and a fidelity of similar to 75.7 o from the tomographic reconstructed density matrix.

AB Entanglement, that is, quantum correlations that do not have a classical counterpart, is a precondition to establishing communication protocols beyond the existing classical protocols, such as quantum key distribution, that achieves a higher level of security without computational assumptions. In this work, we present a proof of demonstration of detecting various entangled states, prepared by time-bin encoding with photons that are natural resources for long-distance quantum communication. We generate a maximally entangled state in time-bin qubits and verify the state in two ways. We first consider measurements that realize entanglement witnesses for the verification of entanglement. We then perform a quantum state tomography for the full characterization. Experimental resources are also discussed.

TI Quantum information science and technology professional learning for
   secondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics teachers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB [This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Investigating and Improving Quantum Education through Research.] There is a growing need in the United States for a workforce trained in quantum information science and technology (QIST), a disciplinary topic that is rarely addressed in precollege science, mathematics, and computer science curricula. University quantum physics and physics education researchers designed and initiated a 4-week, 12-h QIST professional development workshop for N 1/4 51 preservice and in-service secondary school science, mathematics, and computer science educators. A STEM integration framework guided the workshop structure, which incorporated a situated cognition model for learning quantum concepts and computing, identifying recent advances in quantum technologies, planning curricula, and differentiating among QIST subfields including quantum communication, quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology and sensing. The pre-/post-research design employed a newly developed teacher attitude survey, Teacher Self-Efficacy in Quantum Information Science and Technology Scale (TSE-QIST). Exploratory factor analysis identified three latent constructs in teachers' self-efficacy, including (i) knowledge about QIST academic pathways and careers; (ii) QIST pedagogical fluency and STEM integration; and (iii) facilitating QIST learning. Parametric comparisons of means indicated that teacher participants showed significant gains overall and in all latent constructs with medium to large effect sizes (p < 0.001). This professional learning model shows promise in strengthening teachers' self-confidence in pedagogical content knowledge of quantum ideas so they may facilitate student engagement in quantum information science, a field that involves conceptual change and is often considered abstract, counterintuitive, inaccessible, and suitable only for the academically elite. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

TI A Probability-Based Optimization Approach for Entanglement Distribution
   and Source Position in Quantum Networks
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum Internet (QI) is a system of interconnected quantum computers able to exchange information encoded in the so called quantum bits (qubits). Differently from the classical counterpart, qubits benefit from a manifold properties guaranteed by quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement. Despite the fact that quantum networks bring significant advantages, several phenomena can negatively impact the overall system, potentially hindering communication. In order to evaluate the network performance, a comprehensive probability expression is derived in this work to ultimately determine how many qubits are expected to be successfully received by nodes. On this basis, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to fairly maximize the qubits exchanged between node pairs and jointly optimize 1) the position of the quantum source, and 2) the entanglement distribution plan. To cope with the non-convexity of the problem, an iterative optimization algorithm, leveraging Block Coordinate Descendent (BCD) and Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) techniques, is proposed. A thorough simulation campaign is conducted to corroborate the theoretical findings. Numerical results demonstrates, under different parameter setups, that the proposed algorithm provides superior performance with respect to a baseline approach.

Performance tests reveal insights into key pair generation, file signing, and signature verification processes. Comparative tests with the well-known and popular RSA algorithm highlight the trade-offs between security and time efficiency.

TI Probing quantum discord and coherence dynamics in the discrete-time
   quantum walk under generalized amplitude damping noise channel
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We investigate the behaviour of one-dimensional dissipative Hadamard discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) in the generalized amplitude damping channel. By manipulating the noise intensity, we uncover intriguing dynamics in the coherence of the coin state such as rebounding and freezing phenomena. The entanglement between the quantum walker' states diminishes at lower dissipation rates despite the pronounced coherence. The non-classical characters of the dissipative DTQW becomes evident through the manifestation of quantum discord. Our study shows that even under maximum dissipation stemming from both zero and finite-temperature environment, the quantum walker retains rudimentary non-classical behaviours. It is shown that fine-tuning the parameter governing the coin rotation angle optimizes the quantum discord of the walker. These results are useful for optimizing quantum walks in the presence of noisy channels.

TI The Security Performance Analysis of Blockchain System Based on
   Post-Quantum Cryptography - A Case of Cryptocurrency Exchanges
SO VIETNAM JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The current blockchain system for cryptocurrency exchanges primarily employs elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for generating key pairs in wallets, and elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) for generating signatures in transactions. Consequently, with the maturation of quantum computing technology, the current blockchain system faces the risk of quantum computing attacks. Quantum computers may potentially counterfeit signatures produced by ECDSA. Therefore, this study analyzes the vulnerabilities of the current blockchain system to quantum computing attacks and proposes a post-quantum cryptography (PQC)-based blockchain system to enhance security by addressing and improving each identified weakness. Furthermore, this study proposes PQC-based wallets and PQC-based transactions, utilizing PQC digital signature algorithms to generate PQC-based signatures for the inputs in PQC-based transactions, thereby preventing signatures from being counterfeited by quantum computing. Experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency of the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), a PQC digital signature algorithm, in producing wallets, generating signatures, and verifying signatures surpasses that of ECDSA in the current blockchain system. Furthermore, the ML-DSA also exhibits a higher security level.

TI Quantum algorithms for generator coordinate methods
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB This paper discusses quantum algorithms for the generator coordinate method (GCM) that can be used to benchmark molecular systems. The GCM formalism defined by exponential operators with exponents defined through generators of the fermionic U(N) Lie algebra (Thouless theorem) offers a possibility of probing large subspaces using low-depth quantum circuits. In the present study, we illustrate the performance of the quantum algorithm for constructing a discretized form of the Hill-Wheeler equation for ground-and excited-state energies. We also generalize the standard GCM formulation to multiproduct extension that when collective paths are properly probed can systematically introduce higher rank effects and provide elementary mechanisms for symmetry purification when generator states break the spatial or spin symmetries. The GCM quantum algorithms also can be viewed as an alternative to existing variational quantum eigensolvers, where multistep classical optimization algorithms are replaced by a single-step procedure for solving the Hill-Wheeler eigenvalue problem.

TI Entropic uncertainty relation of two-qubit detectors coupled to scalar
   fields in an expanding spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The principles of quantum information provide new avenues to investigate the cosmos. The uncertainty principle is an important trait of the nonclassical world, and it characterizes a significant lower bound (LB) that can be used to estimate measurement results for two noncommuting observables. Subsequently, the uncertainty principle is generalized to a new version by using the entropy and the quantum memory, that is, the quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations (Q-M-A-E-U-Rs). Here, considering two qubit detectors coupled to scalar fields, we explore the effects of different cosmic parameters on Q-M-A-E-U-Rs and reveal the influence of the Holevo quantity on the LB of a Q-M-A-E-U-R. It is revealed that an increase in the expansion rapidity of spacetime can enhance the entropic uncertainty and decrease the ability to accurately predict the measurement outcome. The volume expansion leads to the invariance of the entropic uncertainty. An increase in the particle mass of the scalar field causes degradation in entropic uncertainty. In addition, the influence of the Holevo quantity on the Q-M-A-E-U-R's LB can be ignored if one considers (sigma(x), sigma(y)) as two complementary observables. Therefore, one can use the Adabi bound and Berta bound to equivalently predict the left-hand side (LHS) of the Q-M-A-E-U-R in this situation. However, when (sigma(x), sigma(z)) are chosen as two noncommuting observables, the effect of the Holevo quantity on the LB of the uncertainty relation cannot be ignored, and the Adabi bound can always precisely achieve the LHS and predict entropic uncertainty.

TI Efficient modeling of superconducting quantum circuits with tensor
   networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We use a tensor network method to compute the low-energy excitations of a large-scale fluxonium qubit up to a desired accuracy. We employ this numerical technique to estimate the pure-dephasing coherence time of the fluxonium qubit due to charge noise and coherent quantum phase slips from first principles, finding an agreement with previously obtained experimental results. By developing an accurate single-mode theory that captures the details of the fluxonium device, we benchmark the results obtained with the tensor network for circuits spanning a Hilbert space as large as 15(180). Our algorithm is directly applicable to the wide variety of circuit-QED systems and may be a useful tool for scaling up superconducting quantum technologies.

TI Enhancing mechanical entanglement in molecular optomechanics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB We propose a scheme for enhancing bipartite quantum entanglement in a double-cavity molecular optomechanical system (McOM) incorporating an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Utilizing a set of linearized quantum Langevin equations and numerical simulations, we investigate the impact of the OPA on both optical-vibration and vibration-vibration entanglement. Our key findings reveal a counterintuitive trade-off: while the OPA significantly enhances vibration-vibration entanglement, a critical resource for quantum memories and transducers, it simultaneously suppresses optical-vibration entanglement, essential for quantum state transfer and readout. We demonstrate that maximal vibration-vibration entanglement is achieved when the molecular collective vibrational modes are symmetrically populated, providing a clear experimental guideline for optimizing entanglement sources. In particular, the vibration-vibration entanglement generated in our OPA-enhanced McOM system exhibits remarkable robustness to thermal noise, persisting at temperatures approaching e3 K, significantly exceeding conventional optomechanical systems in terms of thermal robustness, and highlighting the potential for room temperature quantum information processing. These results establish a promising theoretical foundation for OPA-enhanced McOM systems as a robust and scalable platform for quantum technologies, paving the way for future experimental implementations and advanced quantum information processing applications.

TI Generating three-dimensional genome structures with a variational
   quantum algorithm
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB Chromosome conformation capture experiments have revealed the underlying spatial interactions that govern three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and topology. Detecting 3D contacts between genomic loci considerably enhances our understanding of fundamental regulatory processes. Modeling 3D structures from experimental contact matrices can further contextualize the relationship between 3D genome organization and regulation. While classical algorithms have been successful in reconstructing genomic conformations, we investigate the prospect of quantum computation to aid in modeling the conformational space. In this context, we propose a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to model the distribution of 3D genomic structures from experimental contact data. Through rigorous evaluations, we demonstrate the capability of our algorithm to sample ensembles of viable 3D conformations that agree well with experimental and simulated contact data. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to model the conformational space of a single cell or a population of cells. In the advent of sufficient quantum utility, the insights gained from this study can serve as a foundation for investigating high-resolution, large-scale ensembles of genomic conformations through generative VQAs.

TI Decoherence-free-subspace-based deterministic conversions for entangled
   states with heralded robust-fidelity quantum gates
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The decoherence-free subspace (DFS) serves as a protective shield against certain types of environmental noise, allowing the system to remain coherent for extended periods of time. In this paper, we propose two protocols, i.e., one converts two-logic-qubit Knill-LaflammeMilburn (KLM) state to two-logic-qubit Bell states, and the other converts three-logic-qubit KLM state to three-logic-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, through cavity -assisted interaction in DFS. Especially, our innovative protocols achieve their objectives in a heralded way, thus enhancing experimental accessibility. Moreover, single photon detectors are incorporated into the setup, which can predict potential failures and ensure seamless interaction between the nitrogenvacancy center and photons. Rigorous analyses and evaluations of two schemes demonstrate their abilities to achieve near -unit fidelities in principle and exceptional efficiencies. Further, our protocols offer progressive solutions to the challenges posed by decoherence, providing a pathway towards practical quantum technologies.

TI Storage and analysis of light-matter entanglement in a fiber-integrated
   system
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The deployment of a full-fledged quantum internet poses the challenge of finding adequate building blocks for entanglement distribution between remote quantum nodes. A practical system would combine propagation in optical fibers with quantum memories for light, leveraging on the existing communication network while featuring the scalability required to extend to network sizes. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum memory entangled with a photon at telecommunication wavelength. The storage device is based on a fiber- pigtailed laser-written waveguide in a rare earth-doped solid and allows an all-fiber stable addressing of the memory. The analysis of the entanglement is performed using fiber-based interferometers. Our results feature orders-of-magnitude advances in terms of storage time and efficiency for integrated storage of light-matter entanglement and constitute a substantial step forward toward quantum networks using integrated devices.

   optimization problems
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers are now readily available, motivating many researchers to experiment with Variational Quantum Algorithms. Among them, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is one of the most popular one studied by the combinatorial optimization community. In this tutorial, we provide a mathematical description of the class of Variational Quantum Algorithms, assuming no previous knowledge of quantum physics from the readers. We introduce precisely the key aspects of these hybrid algorithms on the quantum side (parametrized quantum circuit) and the classical side (guiding function, optimizer). We devote a particular attention to QAOA, detailing the quantum circuits involved in that algorithm, as well as the properties satisfied by its possible guiding functions. Finally, we discuss the recent literature on QAOA, highlighting several research trends.

TI Scalable determination of multipartite entanglement in quantum networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum networks comprised of entangled end nodes serve stronger than the classical correlation for unparalleled quantum internet applications. However, practical quantum networking is affected by noise, which at its worst, causes end nodes to be described by pre-existing classical data. In such untrusted networks, determining quantum network fidelity and genuine multi-node entanglement becomes crucial. Here, we show that determining quantum network fidelity and genuine N-node entanglement in an untrusted star network requires only N + 1 measurement settings. This method establishes a semi-trusted framework, allowing some nodes to relax their assumptions. Our network determination method is enabled by detecting genuine N-node Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability. Experimentally, using spontaneous parametric down-conversion entanglement sources, we demonstrate the determinations of genuine 3-photon and 4-photon quantum networks and the false positives of the widely used entanglement witness, the fidelity criterion of 1/2. Our results provide a scalable method for the determination of multipartite entanglement in realistic quantum networks.

TI Semantic embedding for quantum algorithms
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The study of classical algorithms is supported by an immense understructure, founded in logic, type, and category theory, that allows an algorithmist to reason about the sequential manipulation of data irrespective of a computation's realizing dynamics. As quantum computing matures, a similar need has developed for an assurance of the correctness of high-level quantum algorithmic reasoning. Parallel to this need, many quantum algorithms have been unified and improved using quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which characterize the ability, by alternating circuit ansatze, to transform the singular values of sub-blocks of unitary matrices by polynomial functions. However, while the algebraic manipulation of polynomials is simple (e.g., compositions and products), the QSP/QSVT circuits realizing analogous manipulations of their embedded polynomials are non-obvious. This work constructs and characterizes the runtime and expressivity of QSP/QSVT protocols where circuit manipulation maps naturally to the algebraic manipulation of functional transforms (termed semantic embedding). In this way, QSP/QSVT can be treated and combined modularly, purely in terms of the functional transforms they embed, with key guarantees on the computability and modularity of the realizing circuits. We also identify existing quantum algorithms whose use of semantic embedding is implicit, spanning from distributed search to proofs of soundness in quantum cryptography. The methods used, based in category theory, establish a theory of semantically embeddable quantum algorithms, and provide a new role for QSP/QSVT in reducing sophisticated algorithmic problems to simpler algebraic ones.

TI Arbitrary entangled state transfer via a topological qubit chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum state transfer is one of the basic tasks in quantum information processing. We here propose a theoretical approach to realize arbitrary entangled state transfer through a qubit chain, which is a class of extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models and accommodates multiple topological edge states separated from the bulk states. We show that an arbitrary entangled state, from two qubits to N qubits, can be encoded in the corresponding edge states, and then adiabatically transferred from one end to the other of the chain. The dynamical phase differences resulting from the time evolutions of different edge states can be eliminated by properly choosing evolution time. Our approach is robust against both the qubit-qubit coupling disorder and the evolution time disorder. For concreteness of discussions, we assume that such a chain is constructed by an experimentally feasible superconducting qubit system, but our proposal can also be applied to other systems.

TI Surface Code with Imperfect Erasure Checks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recently, significant effort has been devoted towards designing erasure qubits in which dominant physical noise excites detectable leakage states that can be returned to the qubit subspace. Interest in these erasure qubits has been driven by studies showing that the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum error correction are significantly relaxed when noise in every gate operation is dominated by erasures. However, these studies assume perfectly accurate erasure checks after every gate operation which generally come with undesirable time and hardware overhead costs. In this work, we investigate the consequences of using an imperfect but overhead-efficient erasure check for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with the surface code. We show that, under physically reasonable assumptions on the imperfect erasure checks, the threshold error rate is still at least over twice that for Pauli noise. We also study the impact of imperfect erasure checks on the effective error distance and find that it degrades the effective distance under a general error model in which a qubit suffers from depolarizing noise when interacting with a leaked qubit. We then identify a more restrictive but realistic noise model for a qubit that interacts with a leaked qubit, under which the effective error distance is twice that for Pauli noise. We apply our analysis to recently proposed superconducting dual-rail erasure qubits and show that achieving good-performance surface code quantum memories with relaxed system requirements is possible.

TI Qubit analog with polariton superfluid in an annular trap
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB We report on the experimental realization and characterization of a qubit analog with semiconductor exciton-polaritons. In our system, a polaritonic condensate is confined by a spatially patterned pump laser in an annular trap that supports energy-degenerate vortex states of the polariton superfluid. Using temporal interference measurements, we observe coherent oscillations between a pair of counter-circulating vortex states coupled by elastic scattering of polaritons off the laser-imprinted potential. The qubit basis states correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the two vortex states. By engineering the potential, we tune the coupling and coherent oscillations between the two circulating current states, control the energies of the qubit basis states, and initialize the qubit in the desired state. The dynamics of the system is accurately reproduced by our theoretical two-state model, and we discuss potential avenues to implement quantum gates and algorithms with polaritonic qubits analogous to quantum computation with standard qubits.

By employing cyclic operators and a qudit T gate, we generalise the dihedral benchmarking scheme for single- and multi-qudit circuits. Our results establish a path for experimentally benchmarking qudit systems and are of theoretical and experimental interest because our scheme is optimal insofar as it does not require preparation of the full qudit Clifford gate set to characterise a non-Clifford gate. Moreover, combined with Clifford randomised benchmarking, our scheme is useful to characterise the generators of a universal gate set.

TI Near-Term n to k Distillation Protocols Using Graph Codes
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB Noisy hardware forms one of the main hurdles to the realization of a near-term quantum internet. Distillation protocols allows one to overcome this noise at the cost of an increased overhead. We consider here an experimentally relevant class of distillation protocols, which distill n to k end-to-end entangled pairs using bilocal Clifford operations, a single round of communication and a possible final local operation depending on the observed measurement outcomes. In the case of permutationally invariant depolarizing noise on the input states, we find a correspondence between these distillation protocols and graph codes. We leverage this correspondence to find provably optimal distillation protocols in this class for several tasks important for the quantum internet. This correspondence allows us to investigate use cases for so-called non-trivial measurement syndromes. Furthermore, we detail a recipe to construct the circuit used for the distillation protocol given a graph code. We use this to find circuits of short depth and small number of two-qubit gates. Additionally, we develop a black-box circuit optimization algorithm, and find that both approaches yield comparable circuits. Finally, we investigate the teleportation of encoded states and find protocols which jointly improve the rate and fidelities with respect to prior art.

This protocol is compatible with most optimal control meth-ods used in previous rotating-wave approximation (RWA) protocols; thus, it is as robust as (or even more robust than) the RWA protocols. Using counter-rotating effects allows us to apply strong drives. There-fore, we can improve the gate speed by 5-10 times compared to the RWA counterpart for implementing high-fidelity (> 99.99%) gates. Such an ultrafast evolution (nanoseconds, even picoseconds) significantly reduces the influence of decoherence (e.g., the qubit dissipation and dephasing). Moreover, because the counter-rotating effects no longer induce a gate infidelity (in both the weak and strong driving regimes), we can achieve a higher fidelity compared to the RWA protocols. Therefore, in the presence of decoherence, one can implement ultrafast geometric quantum gates with > 99% fidelities.

TI DQRA: Deep Quantum Routing Agent for Entanglement Routing in Quantum
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum routing plays a key role in the development of the next-generation network system. In particular, an entangled routing path can be constructed with the help of quantum entanglement and swapping among particles (e.g., photons) associated with nodes in the network. From another side of computing, machine learning has achieved numerous breakthrough successes in various application domains, including networking. Despite its advantages and capabilities, machine learning is not as much utilized in quantum networking as in other areas. To bridge this gap, in this article, we propose a novel quantum routing model for quantum networks that employs machine learning architectures to construct the routing path for the maximum number of demands (source-destination pairs) within a time window. Specifically, we present a deep reinforcement routing scheme that is called Deep Quantum Routing Agent (DQRA). In short, DQRA utilizes an empirically designed deep neural network that observes the current network states to accommodate the network's demands, which are then connected by a qubit-preserved shortest path algorithm. The training process of DQRA is guided by a reward function that aims toward maximizing the number of accommodated requests in each routing window. Our experiment study shows that, on average, DQRA is able to maintain a rate of successfully routed requests at above 80% in a qubit-limited grid network and approximately 60% in extreme conditions, i.e., each node can be repeater exactly once in a window. Furthermore, we show that the model complexity and the computational time of DQRA are polynomial in terms of the sizes of the quantum networks.

TI State-independent quantum contextuality with projectors of nonunit rank
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Virtually all of the analysis of quantum contextuality is restricted to the case where events are represented by rank-one projectors. This restriction is arbitrary and not motivated by physical considerations. We show here that loosening the rank constraint opens a new realm of quantum contextuality and we demonstrate that state-independent contextuality (SIC) can even require projectors of nonunit rank. This enables the possibility of SIC with less than 13 projectors, which is the established minimum for the case of rank one. We prove that for any rank, at least 9 projectors are required. Furthermore, in an exhaustive numerical search we find that 13 projectors are also minimal for the cases where all projectors are uniformly of rank two or uniformly of rank three.

TI Importance of kernel bandwidth in quantum machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum kernel methods are considered a promising avenue for applying quantum computers to machine learning problems. Identifying hyperparameters controlling the inductive bias of quantum machine learning models is expected to be crucial given the central role hyperparameters play in determining the performance of classical machine learning methods. In this work we introduce the hyperparameter controlling the bandwidth of a quantum kernel and show that it controls the expressivity of the resulting model. We use extensive numerical experiments with multiple quantum kernels and classical data sets to show consistent change in the model behavior from underfitting (bandwidth too large) to overfitting (bandwidth too small), with optimal generalization in between. We draw a connection between the bandwidth of classical and quantum kernels and show analogous behavior in both cases. Furthermore, we show that optimizing the bandwidth can help mitigate the exponential decay of kernel values with qubit count, which is the cause behind recent observations that the performance of quantum kernel methods decreases with qubit count. We reproduce these negative results and show that if the kernel bandwidth is optimized, the performance instead improves with growing qubit count and becomes competitive with the best classical methods.

TI Adiabatic quantum algorithm for multijet clustering in high energy
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB The currently predicted increase in computational demand for the upcoming High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) event reconstruction, and in particular jet clustering, is bound to challenge present day computing resources, becoming an even more complex combinatorial problem. In this paper, we show that quantum annealing can tackle dijet event clustering by introducing a novel quantum annealing binary clustering algorithm. The benchmarked efficiency is of the order of 96%, thus yielding substantial improvements over the current quantum state-of-the-art. Additionally, we also show how to generalize the proposed objective function into a more versatile form, capable of solving the clustering problem in multijet events. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI Quantum communication with itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Surface acoustic waves are commonly used in classical electronics applications, and their use in quantum systems is beginning to be explored, as evidenced by recent experiments using acoustic Fabry-Perot resonators. Here we explore their use for quantum communication, where we demonstrate a single-phonon surface acoustic wave transmission line, which links two physically separated qubit nodes. Each node comprises a microwave phonon transducer, an externally controlled superconducting variable coupler, and a superconducting qubit. Using this system, precisely shaped individual itinerant phonons are used to coherently transfer quantum information between the two physically distinct quantum nodes, enabling the high-fidelity node-to-node transfer of quantum states as well as the generation of a two-node Bell state. We further explore the dispersive interactions between an itinerant phonon emitted from one node and interacting with the superconducting qubit in the remote node. The observed interactions between the phonon and the remote qubit promise future quantum-optics-style experiments with itinerant phonons.

TI Quantum neural network-assisted topology optimization: Concept and
   implementation with parameterized quantum circuits
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB This study proposes a quantum machine learning-assisted approach to accelerating density-based topology optimization using quantum neural network (QNN), a class of trainable models based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). The proposed framework extracts key features from classical data, starting by encoding the corresponding finite element analysis results, i.e., strain energy, sensitivity, and design variables from early design iterations obtained using the standard optimizer. Then, the PQCs are fine-tuned using minimization of the binary cross-entropy loss function, enabling the model to learn the mapping between input features and optimal design. Specifically, the framework consists of two main stages. First, an offline training stage where the QNN is calibrated using precomputed iterative results from a relatively coarse mesh obtained through the standard optimizer, establishing pattern recognition between input features and the final design variables. The second is an online stage where the trained QNN model is integrated with the standard optimizer to accelerate the final design. Numerical results show that QNN requires only a small number of qubits, and once trained on coarse meshes with several different boundary conditions, can effectively integrate with standard optimizers to predict target designs across various configurations, including different resolutions, volume constraints, and loading conditions. Furthermore, the proposed QNN-assisted framework significantly reduces computational time compared to standard iterative approaches, laying the groundwork for solving large-scale problems with near-term quantum computers.

TI Topological obstructions to quantum computation with unitary oracles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Algorithms with unitary oracles can be nested, which makes them extremely versatile. An example is the phase estimation algorithm used in many candidate algorithms for quantum speedup. The search for new quantum algorithms benefits from understanding their limitations: Some tasks are impossible in quantum circuits, although their classical versions are easy, for example, cloning. An example with a unitary oracle U is the if clause, the task to implement controlled U (up to the phase on U). In classical computation the conditional statement is easy and essential. In quantum circuits the if clause was shown impossible from one query to U. Is it possible from polynomially many queries? Here we unify algorithms with a unitary oracle and develop a topological method to prove their limitations: No number of queries to U and U dagger lets quantum circuits implement the if clause, even if admitting approximations, postselection, and relaxed causality. We also show limitations of process tomography, oracle neutralization, and dim U root U, UT , and U dagger algorithms. Our results strengthen an advantage of linear optics, challenge the experiments on relaxed causality, and motivate new algorithms with many-outcome measurements.

TI Detecting virtual photons in ultrastrongly coupled superconducting
   quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Light-matter interaction and understanding the fundamental physics behind is essential for emerging quantum technologies. Solid-state devices may explore new regimes where coupling strengths are "ultrastrong", i.e., comparable to the energies of the subsystems. New exotic phenomena occur the common root of many of them being the fact that the entangled vacuum contains virtual photons. They herald the lack of conservation of the number of excitations which is the witness of ultrastrong coupling breaking the U(1) symmetry. Despite more than a decade of research, the detection of ground-state virtual photons still awaits demonstration. In this work, we recognize the "conspiring" set of experimental challenges and show how to overcome them, thus providing a solution to this long-standing problem. We find that combining a superinductor-based unconventional "light fluxonium" qudit and coherent control yields a highly efficient, faithful, and selective conversion of virtual photons into real ones. This enables their detection with resources available to present-day quantum technologies.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We discuss the implementation of lattice gauge theories on digital quantum computers, focusing primarily on the number of quantum gates required to simulate their time evolution. We find that to compile quantum circuits, using available state-of-the-art methods with our own augmentations, the cost of a single time step of an elementary plaquette is beyond what is reasonably practical in the current era of quantum hardware. However, we observe that such costs are highly sensitive to the truncation scheme used to derive different Hamiltonian formulations of non-Abelian gauge theories, emphasizing the need for low -dimensional truncations of such models in the same universality class as the desired theories.

TI QEMOS: a scalable quantum error mitigation method to overcome qubit
   sensitivity
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Compared with traditional computers, quantum computers can provide exponential acceleration for certain critical fields. However, the coupling of quantum systems with the environment, along with the intrinsic characteristics of quantum systems, has collectively introduced quantum noise, which has emerged as a significant impediment to the development of quantum computing. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has been proposed as an alternative solution in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. In recent years, with the rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning-based QEM technology has received attention from the industry. However, the latest machine learning-based QEM techniques have limitations, especially their inability to mitigate errors in the quantum circuits whose number of qubits exceeds the number of qubits in the training set, and their tendency to amplify noise when constructing feature sets. This paper proposes QEMOS, a novel random forest-based machine learning model that utilizes a new feature dataset incorporating quantum computer backend properties, with feature dimensionality reduction enabling decoupling from the number of qubits. The model is trained and tested using six different simulators from Qiskit and a real quantum computer tianyan-176. It is worth noting that this model overcomes the limitation of sensitivity to the number of qubits, which was the main problem of previous methods. When trained on 5-9 qubit circuits, the model achieves a probability of correct mitigation of 86.38% on 2-13 qubit circuits, though this efficacy is observed primarily for circuits exhibiting high-probability outputs and decreases as all output probabilities approach zero. Compared to the baseline, the model demonstrates a 31.74% error reduction on test sets with more qubits than the training set. On real quantum computer, testing shows an average error reduction of 67.5%.

TI Equivariant quantum circuits for learning on weighted graphs
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidate for advantage on near-term quantum hardware. When training a parametrized quantum circuit in this setting to solve a specific problem, the choice of ansatz is one of the most important factors that determines the trainability and performance of the algorithm. In quantum machine learning (QML), however, the literature on ansatzes that are motivated by the training data structure is scarce. In this work, we introduce an ansatz for learning tasks on weighted graphs that respects an important graph symmetry, namely equivariance under node permutations. We evaluate the performance of this ansatz on a complex learning task, namely neural combinatorial optimization, where a machine learning model is used to learn a heuristic for a combinatorial optimization problem. We analytically and numerically study the performance of our model, and our results strengthen the notion that symmetry-preserving ansatzes are a key to success in QML.

TI Boosting Photonic Quantum Computation with Moderate Nonlinearity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Photonic measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a promising route towards fault-tolerant universal quantum computing. A central challenge in this effort is the huge overhead in the resources required for the construction of large photonic clusters using probabilistic linear-optics gates. Although strong single-photon nonlinearity ideally enables deterministic construction of such clusters, it is challenging to realise in a scalable way. Here we explore the prospects of using moderate nonlinearity (with conditional phase shifts smaller than pi) to boost photonic quantum computing and significantly reduce its resources' overhead. The key element in our scheme is a nonlinear router that preferentially directs photonic wavepackets to different output ports depending on their intensity. As a relevant example, we analyze the nonlinearity provided by Rydberg blockade in atomic ensembles, in which the trade-off between the nonlinearity and the accompanying loss is well understood. We present protocols for efficient Bell measurement and GHZ-state preparation-both key elements in the construction of cluster states, as well as for the CNOT gate and quantum factorization. Given the large number of entangling operations involved in fault-tolerant MBQC, the increase in success probability provided by our protocols already at moderate nonlinearities can result in a significant reduction in the required resources.

TI The 2T-qutrit, a two-mode bosonic qutrit
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers often manipulate physical qubits encoded on two -level quantum systems. Bosonic qubit codes depart from this idea by en-coding information in a well-chosen subspace of an infinite-dimensional Fock space. This larger physical space provides a natural protection against exper-imental imperfections and allows bosonic codes to circumvent no-go results that apply to states constrained by a 2-dimensional Hilbert space. A bosonic qubit is usually defined in a single bosonic mode but it makes sense to look for multimode versions that could exhibit better performance.In this work, building on the observation that the cat code lives in the span of coherent states indexed by a finite subgroup of the complex numbers, we consider a two-mode generalisation living in the span of 24 coherent states indexed by the binary tetrahedral group 2T of the quaternions. The result-ing 2T-qutrit naturally inherits the algebraic properties of the group 2T and appears to be quite robust in the low-loss regime. We initiate its study and identify stabilisers as well as some logical operators for this bosonic code.

TI Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in variational
   quantum circuits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which classically optimize a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a computational task, promise to advance our understanding of quantum many-body systems and improve machine learning algorithms using near-term quantum computers. Prominent challenges associated with this family of quantumclassical hybrid algorithms are the control of quantum entanglement and quantum gradients linked to their classical optimization. Known as the barren plateau phenomenon, these quantum gradients may rapidly vanish in the presence of volume-law entanglement growth, which poses a serious obstacle to the practical utility of VQAs. Inspired by recent studies of measurement-induced entanglement transition in random circuits, we investigate the entanglement transition in variational quantum circuits endowed with intermediate projective measurements. Considering the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) for the XXZ model and the Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), we observe a measurement-induced entanglement transition from volume-law to area-law with increasing measurement rate. Moreover, we provide evidence that the transition belongs to the same universality class of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the transition coincides with a "landscape transition" from severe to mild/no barren plateaus in the classical optimization. Our work may provide an avenue for improving the trainability of quantum circuits by incorporating intermediate measurement protocols in currently available quantum hardware.

TI Designing complex concentrated alloys with quantum machine learning and
   language modeling
SO MATTER
AB Designing novel complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) is an essential topic in materials science. However, due to the complicated high- dimensional component-property relationship, tuning material properties by researchers' experience is challenging, even when guided by physical or empirical rules. Here, we adopt quantum computing (QC) technology and machine learning models to provide a proof-of-concept application of QC in physical metallurgy. We propose a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) model to predict single-phase CCAs. We show that fine-tuned quantum kernels with entanglement deliver promising performance, with a maximum accuracy of 89.4%. The QSVM model is then used to identify 1,741 lightweight CCAs jointly with a new text-mining-based method. Meanwhile, we devise a controllable approach to study the effect of noise on model performance and find that the noise level needs to be minimized for high-performance QSVM models. This study provides a practical and general approach to designing CCAs based on quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Computation of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and
   Entanglement Tomography in a Lattice Gauge Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Strongly coupled gauge theories far from equilibrium may exhibit unique features that could illuminate the physics of the early universe and of hadron and ion colliders. Studying real-time phenomena has proven challenging with classical-simulation methods, but is a natural application of quantum simulation. To demonstrate this prospect, we quantum compute nonequal-time correlation functions and perform entanglement tomography of nonequilibrium states of a simple lattice gauge theory, the Schwinger model, using a trapped-ion quantum computer by IonQ Inc. As an ideal target for near-term devices, a recently predicted [Zache et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 050403 (2019)] dynamical quantum phase transition in this model is studied by preparing, quenching, and tracking the subsequent nonequilibrium dynamics in three ways: (i) overlap echos signaling dynamical transitions, (ii) nonequal-time correlation functions with an underlying topological nature, and (iii) the entanglement structure of nonequilibrium states, including entanglement Hamiltonians. These results constitute the first observation of a dynamical quantum phase transition in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer, and are a first step toward investigating topological phenomena in nuclear and high-energy physics using quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Computing Approaches for Vector Quantization-Current
   Perspectives and Developments
SO ENTROPY
AB In the field of machine learning, vector quantization is a category of low-complexity approaches that are nonetheless powerful for data representation and clustering or classification tasks. Vector quantization is based on the idea of representing a data or a class distribution using a small set of prototypes, and hence, it belongs to interpretable models in machine learning. Further, the low complexity of vector quantizers makes them interesting for the application of quantum concepts for their implementation. This is especially true for current and upcoming generations of quantum devices, which only allow the execution of simple and restricted algorithms. Motivated by different adaptation and optimization paradigms for vector quantizers, we provide an overview of respective existing quantum algorithms and routines to realize vector quantization concepts, maybe only partially, on quantum devices. Thus, the reader can infer the current state-of-the-art when considering quantum computing approaches for vector quantization.

TI Quantum cryptography with highly entangled photons from semiconductor
   quantum dots
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Semiconductor quantum dots are capable of emitting polarization entangled photon pairs with ultralow multi-pair emission probability even at maximum brightness. Using a quantum dot source with a fidelity as high as 0.987(8), we implement here quantum key distribution with an average quantum bit error rate as low as 1.9% over a time span of 13 hours. For a proof of principle, the key generation is performed with the BBM92 protocol between two buildings, connected by a 350-m-long fiber, resulting in an average raw (secure) key rate of 135 bits/s (86 bits/s) for a pumping rate of 80 MHz, without resorting to time- or frequency-filtering techniques. Our work demonstrates the viability of quantum dots as light sources for entanglement-based quantum key distribution and quantum networks. By increasing the excitation rate and embedding the dots in state-of-the-art photonic structures, key generation rates in the gigabits per second range are in principle at reach.

TI Security analysis of qutrit quantum secret sharing with linear optical
   correlation measurement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we investigate a possibility of three-dimensional extension of correlation measurement based quantum secret sharing (QSS) with a three-dimensional cyclic-entangled state, called qutrit cyclic-entangled state. The qutrit cyclic-entangled state can be post-selected by a correlation measurement setup with linear optical elements. Thus, this protocol can provide a measurement-device-independent security against a potential eavesdropper, since the measurement results reveals only a correlation among qutrits sent from the three parties, not the exact quantum states. We show that our protocol can be implemented with current state-of-the-art technologies. The security of QSS with a qutrit cyclic-entangled state is analyzed for the cases, when all players are trusted as well as there are malicious players. Possibility of higher-dimensional, qudit extension and conditions for an advantage with qudit are investigated as well.

TI Loss Control-Based Key Distribution under Quantum Protection
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum cryptography revolutionizes secure information transfer, providing defense against both quantum and classical computational attacks. The primary challenge in extending the reach of quantum communication comes from the exponential decay of signals over long distances. We meet this challenge by experimentally realizing the Quantum-Protected Control-Based Key Distribution (QCKD) protocol, utilizing physical control over signal losses. By ensuring significant non-orthogonality of the leaked quantum states, this control severely constrains eavesdroppers' capacities. We demonstrate the performance and scale of our protocol by experiments over a 1707 km long fiber line. The scalability of the QCKD opens the route for globally secure quantum-resistant communication.

TI Client-server Identification Protocols with Quantum PUF
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Recently, major progress has been made towards the realisation of quantum internet to enable a broad range of classically intractable applications. These applications such as delegated quantum computation require running a secure identification protocol between a low-resource and a high-resource party to provide secure communication. In this work, we propose two identification protocols based on the emerging hardware-secure solutions, the quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (qPUFs). The first protocol allows a low-resource party to prove its identity to a high-resource party and in the second protocol, it is vice versa. Unlike existing identification protocols based on Quantum Read-out PUFs that rely on the security against a specific family of attacks, our protocols provide provable exponential security against any Quantum Polynomial-Time adversary with resource-efficient parties. We provide a comprehensive comparison between the two proposed protocols in terms of resources such as quantum memory and computing ability required in both parties as well as the communication overhead between them.

TI Qubit Adoption Method of a Quantum Computing-Based Metaheuristics
   Algorithm for Truss Structures Analysis
SO BIOMIMETICS
AB Since the mention of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2016, quantum computers and quantum computing (QC) have emerged as key technologies. Many researchers are trying to realize quantum computers and quantum computing. In particular, most of the development and application of metaheuristics algorithms using quantum computing is focused on computer engineering fields. Cases in which the developed algorithm is applied to the optimal design of a building or the optimal design results presented by expanding the algorithm in various directions are very insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed four methods of adopting qubits to perform pitch adjusting in the optimization process of the QbHS (quantum-based harmony search) algorithm and applied it to TTO (truss topology optimization) using four methods to compare the results. The four methods of adopting qubits have the same or decreased number of qubits adopted as the number of iterations changes. As a result of applying TTO using four methods, convergence performance differed depending on the adoption method, and convergence performance was superior to conventional HS (harmony search) algorithms in all methods. The optimal design of structural engineering using such QC is expected to contribute to the revitalization of future technologies in the architectural field and the field of computer information systems.

TI Effects of quantum resources and noise on the statistical complexity of

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigate how the addition of quantum resources changes the statistical complexity of quantum circuits by utilizing the framework of quantum resource theories. Measures of statistical complexity that we consider include the Rademacher complexity and the Gaussian complexity, which are well-known measures in computational learning theory that quantify the richness of classes of real-valued functions. We derive bounds for the statistical complexities of quantum circuits that have limited access to certain resources and apply our results to two special cases: (a) stabilizer circuits that are supplemented with a limited number of T gates and (b) instantaneous quantum polynomial-time Clifford circuits that are supplemented with a limited number of CCZ gates. We show that the increase in the statistical complexity of a quantum circuit when an additional quantum channel is added to it is upper bounded by the free robustness of the added channel. Moreover, as noise in quantum systems is a major obstacle to implementing many quantum algorithms on large quantum circuits, we also study the effects of noise on the Rademacher complexity of quantum circuits. Finally, we derive bounds for the generalization error associated with learning from training data arising from quantum circuits.

TI Surrogate optimization of variational quantum circuits
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Variational quantum eigensolvers are touted as a near-term algorithm capable of impacting many applications. However, the potential has not yet been realized, with few claims of quantum advantage and high resource estimates, especially due to the need for optimization in the presence of noise. Finding algorithms and methods to improve convergence is important to accelerate the capabilities of near-term hardware for variational quantum eigensolver or more broad applications of hybrid methods in which optimization is required. To this goal, we look to use modern approaches developed in circuit simulations and stochastic classical optimization, which can be combined to form a surrogate optimization approach to quantum circuits. Using an approximate (classical central processing unit/graphical processing unit) state vector simulator as a surrogate model, we efficiently calculate an approximate Hessian, which is passed as input for a quantum processing unit or exact circuit simulator. This method will lend itself well to parallelization across quantum processing units. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an approach with and without sampling noise and a proof-of-principle demonstration on a quantum processing unit utilizing 40 qubits.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Modeling nonlinear activation functions on quantum computers is vital for quantum neurons employed in fully quantum neural networks, however, remains a challenging task. We introduce an amplitude-based implementation for approximating nonlinearity in the form of the unit step function on a quantum computer. Our approach expands upon repeat-until-success protocols, suggesting a modification that requires a single measurement only. We describe two distinct circuit types which receive their input either directly from a classical computer or as a quantum state when embedded in a more advanced quantum algorithm. All quantum circuits are theoretically evaluated using numerical simulation and executed on NOISY INTERMEDIATE-SCALE QUANTUM hardware. We demonstrate that reliable data with high precision can be obtained from our quantum circuits involving up to eight qubits and up to 25 CX-gate applications, enabled by state-of-the-art hardware-optimization techniques and measurement error mitigation.

AB Generating indistinguishable photons from independent nodes is an important challenge for the development of quantum networks. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of highly indistinguishable single photons from two dissimilar atomic quantum nodes. One node is based on a fully blockaded cold Rydberg ensemble and generates on-demand single photons. The other node is a quantum repeater node based on a Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum memory and emits heralded single photons after a controllable memory time that is used to synchronize the two sources. We demonstrate an indistinguishability of 94.6 +/- 5.2% for a temporal window including 90% of the photons. This advancement opens new possibilities for interconnecting quantum repeater and processing nodes with high-fidelity Bell state measurement without sacrificing its efficiency.

TI Demonstration of microwave single-shot quantum key distribution
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Security of modern classical data encryption often relies on computationally hard problems, which can be trivialized with the advent of quantum computers. A potential remedy for this is quantum communication which takes advantage of the laws of quantum physics to provide secure exchange of information. Here, quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a powerful tool, allowing for unconditionally secure quantum communication between remote parties. At the same time, microwave quantum communication is set to play an important role in future quantum networks because of its natural frequency compatibility with superconducting quantum processors and modern near-distance communication standards. To this end, we present an experimental realization of a continuous-variable QKD protocol based on propagating displaced squeezed microwave states. We use superconducting parametric devices for generation and single-shot quadrature detection of these states. We demonstrate unconditional security in our experimental microwave QKD setting. The security performance is shown to be improved by adding finite trusted noise on the preparation side. Our results indicate feasibility of secure microwave quantum communication with the currently available technology in both open-air (up to similar to 80m) and cryogenic (over 1000 m) conditions.

TI Emulation of Quantum Algorithms Using CMOS Analog Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computers are regarded as the future of computing, as they are believed to be capable of solving extremely complex problems that are intractable on conventional digital computers. However, near-term quantum computers are prone to a plethora of noise sources that are difficult to mitigate, possibly limiting their scalability and precluding us from running any useful algorithms. Quantum emulation is an alternative approach that uses classical analog hardware to emulate the properties of superposition and entanglement, thereby mimicking quantum parallelism to attain similar speeds. By contrast, the use of classical digital hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), is less inefficient at emulating a quantum computer, as it does not take advantage of the fundamentally analog nature of quantum states. Consequently, this approach adds an inherent hardware overhead that also prevents scaling. In this work, an energy-efficient quantum emulator based on analog circuits realized in UMC 180-nm CMOS technology is proposed along with the design methodologies for a scalable computing architecture. A sixfold improvement in power consumption was observed over the FPGA-based approach for a ten-qubit emulation of Grover's search algorithm (GSA). The proposed emulator is also about 400 times faster than a Ryzen 5600x six-core processor performing a simulation of six-qubit Grover's search algorithm.

TI Discrete-modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution with a
   high key rate
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Discrete-modulation continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution has the potential for large-scale deployment in secure quantum communication networks owing to its low implementation complexity and compatibility with the current coherent optical telecommunication. However, current discrete-modulation protocols require relatively large constellation sizes to achieve a key rate comparable to that of the Gaussian modulation. Here, we show that a high key rate comparable to the Gaussian modulation can be achieved using only ten or so coherent states by implementing suitable key map and numerical convex optimization techniques. Specifically, the key rate of the two-ring constellation with 12 coherent states (four states in the inner ring and eight states in the outer ring) can reach 2.4 times of that of original quadrature phase shift keying and 70% of the Gaussian modulation protocol at 50 km. Such an approach can easily be applied to existing systems, making the discrete-modulation protocol an attractive alternative for high-rate and low-cost applications in secure quantum communication networks.

This in turn provides helpful theological metaphors for articulating divine presence at the level of life in theistic evolution, partially addressing the issue of evolutionary theodicy by supporting the concept of deep Incarnation. The point of understanding the Incarnation as deeply entangled enfleshment is that it brings the suffering of creation into the life of the Redeemer as well as the Creator, facilitating redemption and hope through the divine life.

TI Simulating dirty bosons on a quantum computer
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers hold the potential to unlock new discoveries in complex quantum systems by enabling the simulation of physical systems that have heretofore been impossible to implement on classical computers due to intractability. A system of particular interest is that of dirty bosons, whose physics highlights the intriguing interplay of disorder and interactions in quantum systems, playing a central role in describing, for instance, ultracold gases in a random potential, doped quantum magnets, and amorphous superconductors. Here, we demonstrate how quantum computers can be used to elucidate the physics of dirty bosons in one and two dimensions. Specifically, we explore the disorder-induced delocalized-to-localized transition using adiabatic state preparation. In one dimension, the quantum circuits can be compressed to small enough depths for execution on currently available quantum computers. In two dimensions, the compression scheme is no longer applicable, thereby requiring the use of large-scale classical state vector simulations to emulate quantum computer performance. In addition, simulating interacting bosons via emulation of a noisy quantum computer allowed us to study the effect of quantum hardware noise on the physical properties of the simulated system. Our results suggest that scaling laws control how noise modifies observables versus its strength, the circuit depth, and the number of qubits. Moreover, we observe that noise impacts the delocalized and localized phases differently. A better understanding of how noise alters the observed properties of the simulated system is essential for leveraging near-term quantum devices for simulation of dirty bosons, and indeed for condensed matter systems in general.

TI Asymptotics of quantum channels
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We discuss several aspects concerning the asymptotic dynamics of discrete-time semigroups associated with a quantum channel. By using an explicit expression of the asymptotic map, which describes the action of the quantum channel on its attractor manifold, we investigate the role of permutations in the asymptotic dynamics. We show that, in general, they make the asymptotic evolution non-unitary, and they are related to the divisibility of the quantum channel. Also, we derive several results about the asymptotics of faithful and non-faithful channels, and we establish a constructive unfolding theorem for the asymptotic dynamics.

TI Exploring ab initio machine synthesis of quantum circuits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Gate-level quantum circuits are often derived manually from higher level algorithms. While this suffices for small implementations and demonstrations, ultimately automatic circuit design will be required to realise complex algorithms using hardware-specific operations and connectivity. Therefore, ab initio creation of circuits within a machine, either a classical computer or a hybrid quantum-classical device, is of key importance. We explore a range of established and novel techniques for the synthesis of new circuit structures, the optimisation of parameterised circuits, and the efficient removal of low-value gates via the quantum geometric tensor. Using these techniques we tackle the tasks of automatic encoding of unitary processes and translation (recompilation) of a circuit from one form to another. Using emulated quantum computers with various noise-free gate sets we provide simple examples involving up to 10 qubits, corresponding to 20 qubits in the augmented space we use. Further applications of specific relevance to chemistry modelling are considered in a sister paper, 'Exploiting subspace constraints and ab initio variational methods for quantum chemistry'. The emulation environments used were QuEST, QuESTlink and pyQuEST. All resources will be made openly accessible and are currently available upon request.

TI Probabilistic simulation of quantum circuits using a deep-learning
   architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The fundamental question of how to best simulate quantum systems using conventional computational resources lies at the forefront of condensed matter and quantum computation. It impacts both our understanding of quantum materials and our ability to emulate quantum circuits. Here we present an exact formulation of quantum dynamics via factorized generalized measurements which maps quantum states to probability distributions with the advantage that local unitary dynamics and quantum channels map to local quasistochastic matrices. This representation provides a general framework for using state-of-the-art probabilistic models in machine learning for the simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. Using this framework, we have developed a practical algorithm to simulate quantum circuits using an attention network based on a powerful neural network ansatz responsible for the most recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. We demonstrate our approach by simulating circuits that build Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and linear graph states of up to 60 qubits, as well as a variational quantum eigensolver circuit for preparing the ground state of the transverse field Ising model on several system sizes. Our methodology constitutes a modern machine learning approach to the simulation of quantum physics with applicability both to quantum circuits as well as other quantum many-body systems.

TI Resource analysis of quantum algorithms for coarse-grained protein
   folding models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Protein folding processes are a vital aspect of molecular biology that is hard to simulate with conventional computers. Quantum algorithms have been proven superior for certain problems and may help tackle this complex life science challenge. We analyze the resource requirements for simulating simplified yet computationally challenging protein folding models on a quantum computer, assessing the feasibility of these existing approaches in the current and near-future technological landscape. We calculate the minimum number of qubits, interactions, and two-qubit gates necessary to build a heuristic quantum algorithm with the specific information of a folding problem. Particularly, we focus on the resources needed to build quantum operations based on the Hamiltonian linked to the protein folding models for a given amino acid count. Such operations are a fundamental component of these quantum algorithms, guiding the evolution of the quantum state for efficient computations. Specifically, we study coarse-grained folding models on the lattice and the fixed backbone side-chain conformation model and assess their compatibility with the constraints of existing quantum hardware given different bit encodings. We conclude that the number of qubits required falls within current technological capabilities. However, the limiting factor is the high number of interactions in the Hamiltonian, resulting in a quantum gate count unavailable today.

AB Scalability of today's superconducting quantum computers is limited due to the huge costs of generating/routing microwave control pulses per qubit from room temperature. One active research area in both industry and academia is to push the classical controllers to the dilution refrigerator in order to increase the scalability of quantum computers. Superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) is a classical logic technology with low power consumption and ultra-high speed, and thus is a promising candidate for in-fridge classical controllers with maximized scalability. Prior work has demonstrated high-fidelity SFQ-based single-qubit gates. However, little research has been done on SFQ-based multi-qubit gates, which are necessary to realize SFQ-based universal quantum computing.
   In this paper, we present the first thorough analysis of SFQ-based two-qubit gates. Our observations show that SFQ-based two-qubit gates tend to have high leakage to qubit noncomputational subspace, which presents severe design challenges. We show that despite these challenges, we can realize gates with high fidelity by carefully designing optimal control methods and qubit architectures. We develop optimal control methods that suppress leakage, and also investigate various qubit architectures that reduce the leakage. After carefully engineering our SFQfriendly quantum system, we show that it can achieve similar gate fidelity and gate time to microwave-based quantum systems. The promising results of this paper show that (1) SFQ-based universal quantum computation is both feasible and effective; and (2) SFQ is a promising approach in designing classical controller for quantum machines because it can increase the scalability while preserving gate fidelity and performance.

TI Experimental generation of multimode quantum correlations between a
   conical probe and a conical conjugate based on a four-wave mixing
   process
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Multimode quantum correlations and entanglements has drawn much attention recently due to its importance for both fundamental science and the future development of quantum information processing and quantum communication. Here, by using a four-wave mixing process with a conical pump beam and a conical probe beam, we experimentally generate the multimode quantum correlations between a conical probe beam and a conical conjugate beam, and we also observe about -2.6-dB intensity-difference squeezing between these two conical beams. In addition, we find the optimal value of each parameter in this scheme for further applications. Besides, the multi-spatial-mode nature of the generated quantum correlated beams is shown by comparing the variation tendencies of the intensity-difference noise of the probe and conjugate beams under global attenuation and local cutting attenuation. Our scheme may find potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication.

TI Hybrid optomechanical superconducting qubit system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an integrated nonlinear superconducting device based on a nanoelectromechanical shuttle. The system can be described as a qubit coupled to a bosonic mode. The topology of the circuit gives rise to an adjustable qubit-mechanical coupling, allowing the experimenter to tune between linear and quadratic coupling in the mechanical degrees of freedom. Owing to its flexibility and potential scalability, the proposed setup represents an important step towards the implementation of bosonic error correction with mechanical elements in large-scale superconducting circuits. We give preliminary evidence of this possibility by discussing a simple state-swapping protocol that uses this device as a quantum memory element.

TI Local invariants of braiding quantum gates-associated link polynomials
   and entangling power
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB For a generic n-qubit system, local invariants under the action of SL(2,C)circle times n<i characterize non-local properties of entanglement. In general, such properties are not immediately apparent and hard to construct. Here we consider two-qubit Yang-Baxter operators and show that their eigenvalues completely determine the non-local properties of the system. Moreover, we apply the Turaev procedure to these operators and obtain their associated link/knot polynomials. We also compute their entangling power and compare it with that of a generic two-qubit operator.

TI Distributed quantum architecture search
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms, inspired by neural networks, have become a novel approach in quantum computing. However, designing efficient parameterized quantum circuits remains a challenge. Quantum architecture search tackles this by adjusting circuit structures along with gate parameters to automatically discover high-performance circuit structures. In this study, we propose an end-to-end distributed quantum architecture search framework, where we aim to automatically design distributed quantum circuit structures for interconnected quantum processing units with specific qubit connectivity. We devise a circuit generation algorithm which incorporates TeleGate and TeleData methods to enable nonlocal gate implementation across quantum processing units. While taking into account qubit connectivity, we also incorporate qubit assignment from logical to physical qubits within our quantum architecture search framework. A two-stage progressive training-free strategy is employed to evaluate extensive circuit structures without circuit training costs. Through numerical experiments on three VQE tasks, the efficacy and efficiency of our scheme is demonstrated. Our research into discovering efficient structures for distributed quantum circuits is crucial for near-term quantum computing where a single quantum processing unit has a limited number of qubits. Distributed quantum circuits allow for breaking down complex computations into manageable parts that can be processed across multiple quantum processing units.

TI Asymptotically improved circuit for a d-ary Grover's algorithm with
   advanced decomposition of the n-qudit Toffoli gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The progress in building quantum computers to execute quantum algorithms has recently been remarkable. Grover???s search algorithm in a binary quantum system provides a considerable speed-up over the classical paradigm. It can be extended to a d-ary (qudit) quantum system also for utilizing the advantage of larger state space, which helps to reduce the runtime of the algorithm as compared to the traditional binary quantum systems. In a qudit quantum system, an n-qudit Toffoli gate plays a significant role in the accurate implementation of Grover???s algorithm. In this article, a generalized n-qudit Toffoli gate is realized using higher-dimensional qudits to attain a logarithmic depth decomposition without ancilla qudit. The circuit for Grover???s algorithm has then been designed for any d-ary quantum system, where d 2, with the proposed n-qudit Toffoli gate to obtain optimized depth compared to earlier approaches. The technique for decomposing an n-qudit Toffoli gate requires access to two immediately higher-energy levels, making the design susceptible to errors. Nevertheless, we show that the percentage decrease in the probability of error is significant with both gate count and circuit depth reduced as compared to that in state-of-the-art works.

TI When Quantum Computation Meets Data Science: Making Data Science Quantum
SO HARVARD DATA SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Quantum computation and quantum information have attracted considerable attention on multiple frontiers of scientific fields ranging from physics to chemistry and engineering, as well as from computer science to mathematics and statistics. Data science combines statistical methods, computational algorithms, and domain science information to extract knowledge and insights from big data, and to solve complex real-world problems. While it is well-known that quantum computation has the potential to revolutionize data science, much less has been said about the potential of data science to advance quantum computation. Yet because the stochasticity of quantum physics renders quantum computation random, data science can play an important role in the development of quantum computation and quantum information. This article gives an overview of quantum computation and promotes interplay between quantum science and data science. Overall, it advocates for the development of quantum data science for advancing quantum computation and quantum information.

TI Quantum computation via Floquet tailored Rydberg interactions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Rydberg atoms have stood out as a highly promising platform for realizing quantum computation. Floquet frequency modulation (FFM), in Rydberg atom systems, provides a unique tool for achieving precise quantum control and uncovering exotic physical phenomena. This work introduces a method to realize controlled arbitrary phase gates in Rydberg atoms by manipulating system dynamics using FFM. Notably, the need for laser addressing of individual atoms is eliminated, enhancing convenience for practical applications. Furthermore, this approach is integrated with soft quantum control strategies to enhance the fidelity and robustness of the resultant controlled-phase gates. Finally, as an example, this methodology is applied in Grover-Long algorithm to search target items with zero failure rate, demonstrating its substantial significance for future quantum information processing applications. This work leveraging Rydberg atoms and FFM may herald a new era of scalable and reliable quantum computing.

TI Routed quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB We argue that the quantum-theoretical structures studied in several recent lines of research cannot be adequately described within the standard framework of quantum circuits. This is in particular the case whenever the combination of subsystems is described by a nontrivial blend of direct sums and tensor products of Hilbert spaces. We therefore propose an extension to the framework of quantum circuits, given by routed linear maps and routed quantum circuits. We prove that this new framework allows for a consistent and intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of circuit diagrams, applicable to both pure and mixed quantum theory, and exemplify its use in several situations, including the superposition of quantum channels and the causal decompositions of unitaries. We show that our framework encompasses the 'extended circuit diagrams' of Lorenz and Barrett [arXiv:2001.07774 (2020)], which we derive as a special case, endowing them with a sound semantics.

TI Wasserstein complexity of quantum circuits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Given a unitary transformation, what is the size of the smallest quantum circuit that implements it? This quantity, known as the quantum circuit complexity, is a fundamental property of quantum evolutions that has widespread applications in many fields, including quantum computation, quantum field theory, and black hole physics. In this paper, we obtain a new lower bound for the quantum circuit complexity in terms of a novel complexity measure that we propose for quantum circuits, which we call the quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proposed measure is based on the quantum Wasserstein distance of order one (also called the quantum earth mover's distance), a metric on the space of quantum states. We also prove several fundamental and important properties of our new complexity measure, which stand to be of independent interest. Finally, we show that our new measure also provides a lower bound for the experimental cost of implementing quantum circuits, which implies a quantum limit on converting quantum resources to computational resources. Our results provide novel applications of the quantum Wasserstein distance and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the resources needed to implement a quantum computation.

TI Purcell Enhancement of Erbium Ions in TiO2 on Silicon
   Nanocavities
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Isolated solid-state atomic defects with telecom optical transitions are ideal quantum photon emitters and spin qubits for applications in long-distance quantum communication networks. Prototypical telecom defects, such as erbium, suffer from poor photon emission rates, requiring photonic enhancement using resonant optical cavities. Moreover, many of the traditional hosts for erbium ions are not amenable to direct incorporation with existing integrated photonics platforms, limiting scalable fabrication of qubit-based devices. Here, we present a scalable approach toward CMOS-compatible telecom qubits by using erbium-doped titanium dioxide thin films grown atop silicon-on insulator substrates. From this heterostructure, we have fabricated one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities demonstrating quality factors in excess of 5 x 10(4) and corresponding Purcell-enhanced optical emission rates of the erbium ensembles in excess of 200. This easily fabricated materials platform represents an important step toward realizing telecom quantum memories in a scalable qubit architecture compatible with mature silicon technologies.

AB Quantum metrology enables some of the most precise measurements. In the life sciences, diamond-based quantum sensing has led to a new class of biophysical sensors and diagnostic devices that are being investigated as a platform for cancer screening and ultrasensitive immunoassays. However, a broader application in the life sciences based on nanoscale NMR spectroscopy has been hampered by the need to interface highly sensitive quantum bit (qubit) sensors with their biological targets. Here, we demonstrate an approach that combines quantum engineering with single molecule biophysics to immobilize individual proteins and DNA molecules on the surface of a bulk diamond crystal that hosts coherent nitrogen vacancy qubit sensors. Our thin (sub-5 nm) functionalization architecture provides precise control over the biomolecule adsorption density and results in near-surface qubit coherence approaching 100 its. The developed architecture remains chemically stable under physiological conditions for over 5 d, making our technique compatible with most biophysical and biomedical applications.

TI Resilient quantum gates on periodically driven Rydberg atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Fault-tolerant implementation of quantum gates is one of preconditions for realizing quantum computation. The platform of Rydberg atoms is one of the most promising candidates for achieving quantum computation. We propose to implement a controlled-Z gate on Rydberg atoms where an amplitude-modulated field is employed to induce Rydberg antiblockade. Gate robustness against the fluctuations in the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction can be largely enhanced by adjusting amplitude-modulated field. Furthermore, we introduce a Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg transition on the target atom so as to improve the gate resilience to the deviation in the gate time and the drift in the pulse amplitude. With feasible experimental parameters, one can achieve the gate with low fidelity errors caused by atomic decay, interatomic dipole-dipole force, and Doppler effects. Finally, we generalize the gate scheme into multiqubit cases, where resilient multiqubit phase gates can be obtained in one step with an unchanged gate time as the number of qubits increases.

TI Optimal execution of logical Hadamard with low-space overhead in rotated
   surface code
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computation requires error-correcting codes that enable reliable universal quantum operations. This study introduces a novel approach that executes the logical Hadamard with low-space requirements while preserving the original definition of logical operators within the framework of the rotated surface codes. Our method leverages a boundary deformation method to rotate the logical qubit transformed by transversal Hadamard. Following this, the original encoding of the logical qubit is reinstated through logical flip-and-shift operations. The estimated space-time cost for a logical Hadamard operation with a code distance d is 5d2 + 3d2. The efficiency enhancement of the proposed method is approximately four times greater than those of previous approaches, regardless of the code distance. Unlike the traditional method, implementing a logical Hadamard requires only two patches instead of seven. Furthermore, the proposed method ensures the parallelism of quantum circuits by preventing interferences between adjacent logical data qubits.

TI Quantum Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent years, with rapid progress in the development of quantum technologies, quantum machine learning has attracted a lot of interest. In particular, a family of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, consisting of classical and quantum elements, has been massively explored for the purpose of improving the performance of classical neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called quantum dilated convolutional neural networks (QDCNNs). Our method extends the concept of dilated convolution, which has been widely applied in modern deep learning algorithms, to the context of hybrid neural networks. The proposed QDCNNs are able to capture larger context during the quantum convolution process while reducing the computational cost. We perform empirical experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets for the task of image recognition and demonstrate that QDCNN models generally enjoy better performances in terms of both accuracy and computation efficiency compared to existing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs).

TI Deep Ensemble learning and quantum machine learning approach for
   Alzheimer's disease detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Alzheimer disease (AD) is among the most chronic neurodegenerative diseases that threaten global public health. The prevalence of Alzheimer disease and consequently the increased risk of spread all over the world pose a vital threat to human safekeeping. Early diagnosis of AD is a suitable action for timely intervention and medication, which may increase the prognosis and quality of life for affected individuals. Quantum computing provides a more efficient model for different disease classification tasks than classical machine learning approaches. The full potential of quantum computing is not applied to Alzheimer's disease classification tasks as expected. In this study, we proposed an ensemble deep learning model based on quantum machine learning classifiers to classify Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative I and Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative II datasets are merged for the AD disease classification. We combined important features extracted based on the customized version of VGG16 and ResNet50 models from the merged images then feed these features to the Quantum Machine Learning classifier to classify them as non-demented, mild demented, moderate demented, and very mild demented. We evaluate the performance of our model by using six metrics; accuracy, the area under the curve, F1-score, precision, and recall. The result validates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for detecting Alzheimer's disease by registering an accuracy of 99.89 and 98.37 F1-score.

TI Proposal for Optomagnonic Teleportation and Entanglement Swapping
SO PHOTONICS
AB A protocol for realizing discrete-variable quantum teleportation in an optomagnonic system is provided. Using optical pulses, an arbitrary photonic qubit state encoded in orthogonal polarizations is transferred onto the joint state of a pair of magnonic oscillators in two macroscopic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) spheres that are placed in an optical interferometer. We further show that optomagnonic entanglement swapping can be realized in an extended dual-interferometer configuration with a joint Bell-state detection. Consequently, magnon Bell states are prepared. We analyze the effect of the residual thermal occupation of the magnon modes on the fidelity in both the teleportation and entanglement swapping protocols. The work may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks based on magnonics.

TI Practical Advantage of Classical Communication in Entanglement Detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum communication, yet conventional detection relies solely on local measurements. In this Letter, we present an experimental demonstration, based on an improved theoretical framework showing that one-way local operations and classical communication (1-LOCC) can significantly outperform purely local measurements in detecting quantum entanglement. By casting the entanglement detection problem as a semidefinite program, we derive protocols that minimize false negatives at fixed false-positive rates. A variational generative machine-learning algorithm efficiently searches over high-dimensional parameter spaces, identifying states and measurement strategies that exhibit a clear 1-LOCC advantage. Experimentally, we realize a genuine event-ready protocol on a threedimensional photonic entanglement source, employing fiber delays as short-lived quantum memories. We implement rapid, field-programmable gate array-based sampling of the optimized probabilistic instructions, allowing Bob's measurement settings to adapt to Alice's outcomes in real time. Our results validate the predicted 1-LOCC advantage in a realistic noisy setting and reduce the experimental trials needed to certify entanglement. These findings mark a step toward scalable, adaptive entanglement detection methods crucial for quantum networks and computing, paving the way for more efficient generation and verification of high-dimensional entangled states.

AB Quantum error correction (QEC) codes can tolerate hardware errors by encoding fault-tolerant logical qubits using redundant physical qubits and detecting errors using parity checks. Leakage errors occur in quantum systems when a qubit leaves its computational basis and enters higher energy states. These errors severely limit the performance of QEC due to two reasons. First, they lead to erroneous parity checks that obfuscate the accurate detection of errors. Second, the leakage spreads to other qubits and creates a pathway for more errors over time. Prior works tolerate leakage errors by using leakage reduction circuits (LRCs) that modify the parity check circuitry of QEC codes. Unfortunately, naively using LRCs always throughout a program is sub-optimal because LRCs incur additional two-qubit operations that (1) facilitate leakage transport, and (2) serve as new sources of errors.
   Ideally, LRCs should only be used if leakage occurs, so that errors from both leakage as well as additional LRC operations are simultaneously minimized. However, identifying leakage errors in real-time is challenging. To enable the robust and efficient usage of LRCs, we propose ERASER that speculates the subset of qubits that may have leaked and only uses LRCs for those qubits. Our studies show that the majority of leakage errors typically impact the parity checks. We leverage this insight to identify the leaked qubits by analyzing the patterns in the failed parity checks. We propose ERASER+M that enhances ERASER by detecting leakage more accurately using qubit measurement protocols that can classify qubits into |0., |1. and |... states. ERASER and ERASER+M improve the logical error rate by up to 4.3x and 23x respectively compared to always using LRC.

TI Combating errors in quantum communication: an integrated approach
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Near-term quantum communication protocols suffer inevitably from channel noises, whose alleviation has been mostly attempted with resources such as multiparty entanglement or sophisticated experimental techniques. Generation of multiparty higher dimensional entanglement is not easy. This calls for exploring realistic solutions which are implementable with current devices. Motivated particularly by the difficulty in generation of multiparty entangled states, in this paper, we have investigated error-free information transfer with minimal requirements. For this, we have proposed a new information encoding scheme for communication purposes. The encoding scheme is based on the fact that most noisy channels leave some quantities invariant. Armed with this fact, we encode information in these invariants. These invariants are functions of expectation values of operators. This information passes through the noisy channel unchanged. Pertinently, this approach is not in conflict with other existing error correction schemes. In fact, we have shown how standard quantum error-correcting codes emerge if suitable restrictions are imposed on the choices of logical basis states. As applications, for illustration, we propose a quantum key distribution protocol and an error-immune information transfer protocol.

TI Near-Optimal Performance of Quantum Error Correction Codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Knill-Laflamme conditions distinguish exact quantum error correction codes, and they have played a critical role in the discovery of state-of-the-art codes. However, the family of exact codes is a very restrictive one and does not necessarily contain the best -performing codes. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a generalized and quantitative performance metric. In this Letter, we derive the near -optimal channel fidelity, a concise and optimization -free metric for arbitrary codes and noise. The metric provides a narrow two-sided bound to the optimal code performance, and it can be evaluated with exactly the same input required by the Knill-Laflamme conditions. We demonstrate the numerical advantage of the near -optimal channel fidelity through multiple qubit code and oscillator code examples. Compared to conventional optimization -based approaches, the reduced computational cost enables us to simulate systems with previously inaccessible sizes, such as oscillators encoding hundreds of average excitations. Moreover, we analytically derive the near -optimal performance for the thermodynamic code and the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code. In particular, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code 's performance under excitation loss improves monotonically with its energy and converges to an asymptotic limit at infinite energy, which is distinct from other oscillator codes.

TI On the Social Shaping of Quantum Technologies: An Analysis of Emerging
   Expectations Through Grant Proposals from 2002-2020
SO MINERVA
AB The term 'quantum technology' was first popularised by an Australian physicist in the mid-1990s. These technologies make use of the properties of quantum physics and are being developed and invested across the world, yet this emerging technology is understudied in science and technology studies. This article investigates the emergence of the notion of 'quantum technologies' and examines the expectations shaping this field through an analysis of research grants funded by a national research funder, the Australian Research Council between 2002 and 2020. I examine how 'quantum technology' and 'quantum computing' have come to dominate claims and expectations surrounding research in quantum science. These expectations do more than inform the scientific goals of the field. They also provide an overarching, uniting rhetoric for individual projects and people and shape the uses imagined for quantum technologies. This analysis shows how claims for this emerging technology draw on 'breakthrough' metaphors to engage researchers and marshal investment and concludes by highlighting the need for increased clarity regarding expectations for quantum technologies.

TI Decoherence time control by interconnection for finite-level quantum
   memory systems
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL
AB This paper is concerned with open quantum systems whose dynamic variables have an algebraic structure, similar to that of the Pauli matrices for finite-level systems. The Hamiltonian and the operators of coupling of the system to the external bosonic fields depend linearly on the system variables. The fields are represented by quantum Wiener processes which drive the system dynamics according to a quasilinear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equation whose drift vector and dispersion matrix are affine and linear functions of the system variables. This setting includes the zero-Hamiltonian isolated system dynamics as a particular case, where the system variables are constant in time, which makes them potentially applicable as a quantum memory. In a more realistic case of nonvanishing system-field coupling, we define a memory decoherence time when a mean-square deviation of the system variables from their initial values becomes relatively significant as specified by a weighting matrix and a fidelity parameter. We consider the decoherence time maximization over the energy parameters of the system and obtain a condition under which the zero Hamiltonian provides a suboptimal solution. This optimization problem is also discussed for a direct energy coupling interconnection of such systems.

TI Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The rate and security of quantum communications between users placed at arbitrary points of a quantum communication network depend on the structure of the network, on its extension and on the nature of the communication channels. In this work we propose a strategy for the optimization of trusted-relays based networks that intertwines classical network approaches and quantum information theory. Specifically, by suitably defining a quantum communication efficiency functional, we identify the optimal quantum communication connections through the network by balancing security and the quantum communication rate. The optimized network is then constructed as the network of the maximal quantum communication efficiency connections and its performance is evaluated by studying the scaling of average properties as functions of the number of nodes and of the network spatial extension.

TI Measurement-Free Code-Switching Protocol for Low-Overhead Quantum
   Computation Using Permutation-Invariant Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Transversal gates on quantum error correction codes have been a promising approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing, but are limited by the Eastin-Knill no-go theorem. Existing solutions such as gate teleportation and magic state distillation are resource-intensive. We present a measurement-free codeswitching protocol for universal quantum computation, switching between a stabilizer code for transversal Clifford gates and a permutation-invariant (PI) code for transversal non-Clifford gates that are logical Z rotations for any rational multiple of pi. The novel non-Clifford gates enabled by this code-switching protocol provide for a lower gate count implementation of a universal gate set relative to the Clifford + T gate set. To achieve this, we present a protocol for performing controlled-NOT gates between the codes using near-term quantum control operations that employ a catalytic bosonic mode. We also present a new class of PI codes with tunable code distance, supporting transversal non-Clifford gates, and demonstrate their reduced gate count overhead relative to a comparable stabilizer code to stabilizer code-switching scheme.

TI Relaxation of stationary states on a quantum computer yields a unique
   spectroscopic fingerprint of the computer's noise
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantifying, controlling, and correcting noise related errors is one of the current challenges in quantum computing. Here, the authors study the time dependence of the relaxation of a stationary state simulated on a quantum computer, and show that such spectroscopic signature is unique and can be used to characterize the noise on individual quantum computers.
   Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computing, but its significant sensitivity to noise requires sophisticated error correction and mitigation. Traditionally, noise on the quantum device is characterized directly through qubit and gate measurements, but this approach has drawbacks in that it does not adequately capture the effect of noise on realistic multi-qubit applications. In this paper, we simulate the relaxation of stationary quantum states on a quantum computer to obtain a unique spectroscopic fingerprint of the computer's noise. In contrast to traditional approaches, we obtain the frequency profile of the noise as it is experienced by the simulated stationary quantum states. Data from multiple superconducting-qubit IBM processors show that noise generates a bath within the simulation that exhibits both colored noise and non-Markovian behavior. Our results provide a direction for noise mitigation but also suggest how to use noise for quantum simulations of open systems.

TI Ultrahigh-fidelity composite rotational quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Composite pulse sequences, which produce arbitrary predefined rotations of a qubit on the Bloch sphere, are presented. The composite sequences contain up to 17 pulses and can compensate up to 8 orders of experimental errors in the pulse amplitude and the pulse duration. Composite sequences for three basic quantum gates, X (NOT), Hadamard and arbitrary rotation, are derived. Three classes of composite sequences are presented: one symmetric and two asymmetric. They contain as their lowest members two well-known composite sequences: the three-pulse symmetric SCROFULOUS pulse and the four-pulse asymmetric BB1 pulse, which compensate first- and second-order errors, respectively. The shorter sequences are derived analytically, and the longer ones numerically (instead by nesting and concatenation, as usually done hitherto). Consequently, the composite sequences derived here match or outperform the existing ones in terms of either speed or accuracy, or both. For example, we derive a second-order composite sequence, which is faster (by about 13%) than the famous BB1 sequence. For higher-order sequences, the speedup becomes much more pronounced. This is important for quantum information processing as the sequences derived here provide more options for finding the sweet spot between ultrahigh fidelity and high speed.

AB We present a direct comparison between QAOA (Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz), and QA (Quantum Annealing) on 127 qubit problem instances. QAOA with p = 1, 2 rounds is executed on the 127 qubit heavy-hex graph gate-model quantum computer ibm_washington, using on-device grid-searches for angle finding, and QA is executed on two Pegasus-chip D-Wave quantum annealers. The problems are random Ising models whose connectivity matches heavy-hex graphs and the Pegasus graph connectivity, and optionally include hardware-compatible cubic terms (ZZZ terms). The QAOA circuits are heavily optimized and of extremely short depth, with a CNOT depth of 6 per round, which allows whole chip usage of the heavy-hex lattice. QAOA and QA are both compared against simulated annealing and the optimal solutions are computed exactly using CPLEX. The noiseless mean QAOA expectation values for p = 1, 2 are computed using classical light-cone based simulations. We find QA outperforms QAOA on the evaluated devices.

TI A Systematic Methodology to Compute the Quantum Vulnerability Factors
   for Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing is one of the most promising technology advances of the latest years. Qubits are highly sensitive to noise, which can make the output useless. Lately, it has been shown that superconducting qubits are extremely susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. When adopted in large scale, radiation-induced errors are expected to become a serious challenge for qubits reliability. We propose an evaluation of the impact of transient faults in the execution of quantum circuits on superconducting chips. Inspired by the Architectural and Program Vulnerability Factors, widely used for classical computation, we propose the Quantum Vulnerability Factor (QVF) to measure the impact of qubit corruption on the circuit output. We model faults, and design a fault injector, based on the latest studies on real machines and radiation experiments. We report the finding of more than 388,000,000 fault injections, considering single and double faults, on three algorithms, identifying the faults and qubits that are more likely to impact the output. We give guidelines on how to map the qubits in real devices to reduce the output error and to reduce the probability of having a radiation-induced corruption modifying the output. Finally, we compare simulations with experiments on physical quantum computers.

AB The many-body problem is central to many fields, such as condensed-matter physics and chemistry, but also to combinatorial optimization, which is nothing but a classical many-body problem. This manuscript, written as part of an Habilitation & agrave; Diriger des Recherches, presents the various algorithmic approaches, both classical and quantum, to solving this problem. We begin by reviewing the main existing classical and quantum methods, focusing on their successes as well as their current limitations. In particular, we present the state-of-the-art in quantum methods, distinguishing between perfect and noisy processors. We then present recent work on combining classical and quantum algorithms to overcome the limitations inherent to both paradigms. In particular, we begin by showing how tensor networks, often used as reference tools to gauge the interest of quantum methods, can also be used to initialize a quantum computation, in addition to simulating it realistically. We then turn to the special case of fermionic problems. After describing a method based on natural orbitals for shortening, and thus making more reliable, quantum circuits to prepare fermionic states, we present a method based on slave spins for using a platform of Rydberg atoms to simulate lattice models of fermions. Finally, we show how these same Rydberg platforms can be used to solve combinatorial problems, and how decoherence influences the quality of the results obtained. This leads to the definition of a new utility metric for quantum processors, the Q-score.

TI Nonlinear quantum gates for a Bose-Einstein condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum interferometry and quantum information processing have been proposed for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), but BECs are described in complicated ways such as using quantum field theory or using a nonlinear differential equation. Nonlinear quantum mechanics does not mesh well with the superposition principle at the heart of interferometry and quantum information processing but could be compatible. Thus, we develop a rigorous foundation for quantum gates, obtained by solving the equation for evolution, and then we employ this foundation, combined with quantum-control techniques and appropriate state-sampling techniques, to devise feasible nonlinear Hadamard gates and thereby feasible, i.e., high-contrast, nonlinear Ramsey interferometry. Our approach to BEC interferometry and quantum logic shifts the paradigm by enlarging to the case of nonlinear quantum mechanics, which we apply to the cases of BEC interferometry and quantum information processing.

TI Million-Atom Wave Function Simulations of a Single Donor Qubit Made in
   Silicon Utilizing Ion Implantation Technology
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A large-scale quantum computer promises quantum algorithms with an exponential speed increase over classical counterparts. Ion implanted donor atom qubits in isotopically enriched have demonstrated leading coherence times and gate fidelities. Large-scale donor architectures must be tolerant to positional uncertainties owing to ion straggling consistent with the implant energy required to place near surface donor atoms allowing manipulation by surface control electrodes. These issues are addressed with a 40 million silicon atom quantum model based on the atomistic tight-binding technique in the context of the flip-flop qubit architecture. The donor electron wavefunction operates in a state of equal superposition between the buried host donor atom and below the surface gate oxide. Key issues include: donor positional uncertainty from ion straggling coupled with non-uniform control gate potentials, the coupling of donor wave functions to gate-defined quantum wells, and the effect of bystander donors including the mitigation of non-functional adventitious channeled ions by re-implantation employing deterministic ion implantation. An upper constraint of 9 keV ions minimizes straggling allowing quantum superposition and is compatible with existing fabrication techniques. With heavy donors, such as , the constraints are relaxed because, for a given implant depth, the heavy donors straggle less than light donors.

TI Character Varieties and Algebraic Surfaces for the Topology of Quantum
   Computing
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB It is shown that the representation theory of some finitely presented groups thanks to their SL2(C) character variety is related to algebraic surfaces. We make use of the Enriques-Kodaira classification of algebraic surfaces and related topological tools to make such surfaces explicit. We study the connection of SL2(C) character varieties to topological quantum computing (TQC) as an alternative to the concept of anyons. The Hopf link H, whose character variety is a Del Pezzo surface f(H) (the trace of the commutator), is the kernel of our view of TQC. Qutrit and two-qubit magic state computing, derived from the trefoil knot in our previous work, may be seen as TQC from the Hopf link. The character variety of some two-generator Bianchi groups, as well as that of the fundamental group for the singular fibers (E) over tilde (6) and (D) over tilde (4) contain f(H). A surface birationally equivalent to a K3 surface is another compound of their character varieties.

TI Four-Party Semi-Quantum Key Agreement Protocol Based on Four-Particle
   Cluster States
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum cryptography is a new research field emerging from the combination of cryptography and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, the basic principles of quantum mechanics guarantee its security, such as Heisenberg's inaccuracy principle and the unclonability principle which are different from classical ciphers. Therefore, quantum cryptography is theoretically capable of achieving unconditional security. Recently, with the continuous development of quantum cryptography, its related research has received wide attention. Meanwhile, the quantum key agreement is an important branch of quantum cryptography and a quantum channel-based security protocol that calls for a secure shared key able to be negotiated between participants and does not allow any part of the participants to control the generation of this key. Unlike classical key agreement protocols relying on mathematical hard problems to guarantee security, the security of quantum key agreement protocols is guaranteed by the basic principles of quantum mechanics and can achieve unconditional security, thus better meeting practical needs. However, general quantum key agreement protocols can only satisfy the cases where all participants have full quantum capabilities. Thus, semi-quantum key agreements have been proposed by scholars, which means that one participant in the protocol has full quantum capability while the other participants have only semi-quantum capability. In this case, some of the large institutions or companies are treated as entities with full quantum capabilities, while some ordinary users are treated as entities with semi- quantum capabilities who only need to employ the Z-base {|0 >,|1 >} for quantum state preparation or measurement. However, there are still few studies on multi-party semi-quantum key agreement protocols, with cases of reliance on trusted third parties or low efficiency of quantum bits. Therefore, the multi-party semi-quantum key agreement protocol is significant to be studied.
   Methods We design a new four-party semi-quantum key protocol based on a four-particle cluster state. Furthermore, the secure shared key in this protocol is established by one full-quantum party of Dave, and three semi-quantum parties including Alice, Bob, and Charlie through measurement-resend operations and the entanglement properties of the four-particle cluster state, without the assistance of a trusted third party. The four-particle cluster state is a particular sort of four-particle entangled state whose entanglement properties are adopted in the key agreement and eavesdropping detection parts of the protocol. In this protocol, the measurement- resend operation is performed several times. Finally, since CTRL particles that are normally discarded in a previous protocol can be employed again, the quantum resource waste is reduced. In terms of security, the protocol is proven to be effective against internal attacks and all external attacks. Additionally, two optical devices, the wavelength quantum filter (WQF), and the photon number separator (PNS) are introduced in the protocol, which allows both Trojan horse attacks to be effectively defended against. In terms of qubit efficiency, the protocol performance is measured by Cabello qubit efficiency.
   Results and Discussions Firstly, general quantum key agreement protocols can achieve the purpose of shared keys securely established between participants. However, in the existing quantum key agreement protocols, participants are required to have excessive capabilities and equipment. Therefore, we put forward a new four-party semi- quantum key negotiation protocol based on a four- particle cluster state. The three semi-quantum participants of Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and one participant Dave with full quantum capability in this protocol can perform key negotiation without any third party. As a consequence, the requirements for participant capacity and equipment in this protocol are reduced. The four- particle cluster state is utilized in the protocol for key agreement and eavesdropping detection. Secondly, the measurement- resend operation is leveraged in the protocol, which means that the particle is randomly executed with a CTRL or SIFT operation. In this case, the CTRL operation means that the particle is subjected to a reflection operation, the SIFT operation means that the particle is subjected to a Z-base measurement with the preparation of a new particle, and finally the newly prepared particle is resent. Furthermore, the measurement-resend operation is performed twice in the protocol to make the CTRL particles normally discarded in the previous protocol can be reused, Therefore, the quantum resource waste is reduced. Thirdly, the protocol is verified to be effective against both external and internal attacks through security analysis. Meanwhile, the protocol shows superior performance through performance analysis.
   Conclusions Our paper proposes a four-party semi- quantum key agreement protocol based on a four-particle cluster state. In this protocol, no assistance from trusted third parties is required to ensure that a secure shared key is established by negotiation between a full quantum party and three semi-quantum parties and that the contributions of each party to the shared key are equal. Analysis indicates that internal attacks and all external attacks can be effectively defended by the new semi-quantum key agreement protocol. The final comparison results show that the proposed semi-quantum key agreement protocol can improve performance and save quantum resources simultaneously.

TI Pulse-level noisy quantum circuits with QuTiP
SO QUANTUM
AB The study of the impact of noise on quantum circuits is especially relevant to guide the progress of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing. In this paper, we address the pulse-level simulation of noisy quantum circuits with the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP). We introduce new tools in qutip-qip, QuTiP's quantum information processing package. These tools simulate quantum circuits at the pulse level, leveraging QuTiP's quantum dynamics solvers and control optimization features. We show how quantum circuits can be compiled on simulated processors, with control pulses acting on a target Hamiltonian that describes the unitary evolution of the physical qubits. Various types of noise can be introduced based on the physical model, e.g., by simulating the Lindblad densitymatrix dynamics or Monte Carlo quantum trajectories. In particular, the user can define environment-induced decoherence at the processor level and include noise simulation at the level of control pulses. We illustrate how the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is compiled and executed on a superconducting-qubit-based processor, on a spin-chain-based processor and using control optimization algorithms. We also show how to easily reproduce experimental results on cross-talk noise in an ion-based processor, and how a Ramsey experiment can be modeled with Lindblad dynamics. Finally, we illustrate how to integrate these features with other software frameworks.

TI Generation of Frequency-Tunable Shaped Single Microwave Photons Using a
   Fixed-Frequency Superconducting Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Scaling up a superconducting quantum computer will likely require quantum communication between remote chips, which can be implemented using an itinerant microwave photon in a transmission line. To realize high-fidelity communication, it is essential to control the frequency and temporal shape of the microwave photon. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of frequency-tunable shaped microwave photons without resorting to any frequency-tunable circuit element. We develop a framework that treats a microwave resonator as a band-pass filter mediating the interaction between a superconducting qubit and the modes in the transmission line. This interpretation allows us to stimulate the photon emission by an off-resonant drive signal. We characterize how the frequency and temporal shape of the generated photon depends on the frequency and amplitude of the drive signal. By modulating the drive amplitude and frequency, we achieve a frequency tunability of 40 MHz while maintaining the photon mode shape time symmetric. Through measurements of the quadrature amplitudes of the emitted photons, we demonstrate a consistently high state and process fidelities around 95% across the tunable frequency range. Our hardware-efficient approach eliminates the need for additional biasing lines typically required for frequency tuning, offering a simplified architecture for scalable quantum communication.

The newly derived criteria are based on the maximum eigenvalue of the NPT entangled state, which is easier to determine experimentally than to completely reconstruct the state via tomography.

TI Rare Earth-Diamond Hybrid Structures for Optical Quantum Technologies
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Diamond containing nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) is one of the most investigated materials for quantum technologies, because of this system's exceptional spin properties. Although the NV- optical transition is very bright, it suffers from spectral diffusion and weak zero-phonon line, and is in the visible range. This limits integration into quantum photonic structures and interfacing with optical fiber networks. In contrast, rare earth (RE) ions exhibit extremely narrow and stable optical transitions, including erbium's 1.5 mu m telecom wavelength. Combining RE with NV- properties through short-range interactions is however challenging as RE do not readily enter the diamond lattice. In this work, a thin-film-based architecture in which RE and NV- centers can interact while preserving their unique properties is introduced. Thin films of Er3+:Y2O3 are grown by chemical vapor deposition on diamond substrates with well-crystallized and highly textured structures. An extensive spectroscopic study of Er3+ transitions at room and low temperatures further reveals that photoluminescence spectra and decays are close to bulk materials. It is also shown that Y2O3 thin film deposition has no detrimental effects on NV- optical and spin properties. RE thin films deposited on diamond can thus be suitable for building hybrid materials for new functionalities in quantum sensing, communication, and processing.

AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ computers) are now readily available, motivating many researchers to experiment with Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Among them, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most popular one studied by the combinatorial optimization community. In this tutorial, we provide a mathematical description of the class of Variational Quantum Algorithms, assuming no previous knowledge of quantum physics from the readers. We introduce precisely the key aspects of these hybrid algorithms on the quantum side (parametrized quantum circuit) and the classical side (guiding function, optimizer). We devote a particular attention to QAOA, detailing the quantum circuits involved in that algorithm, as well as the properties satisfied by its possible guiding functions. Finally, we discuss the recent literature on QAOA, highlighting several research trends.

TI Topology and density control of satellite-defined photonic quantum
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Creating photonic quantum networks by distributing entangled photon pairs through low Earth orbit satellites is a promising technological advance. A recent work has studied a model of such networks and reported the presence of a heavy-tailed degree distribution. This heterogeneous structure is highly undesirable when it comes to the quantum memory utilization efficiency and network robustness under malicious attack. In this work, however, we show that such a topology is not necessarily inherent to satellite-based quantum networks. We theoretically analyze factors that determine the connection probability between two nodes and propose a principled design methodology to control both the topology and density of the resulting network. We present numerical evidence that our method can continuously transform the heterogeneous heavy-tailed network into a more homogeneous Erdos-Renyi-like random network with the prescribed level of density as characterized by the average or maximal degree. Such results are in good agreement with our theoretical analysis, which not only predicts the qualitative structural transition but also provides a quantitative way to estimate important network features during the process. Under our control strategies, the resulting network can achieve various desirable properties, such as a short path length and diameter, high quantum memory utilization efficiency, and enhanced robustness against attack. We believe the design principle proposed in this work represents an important step towards building and controlling functionally efficient satellite-photonic quantum networks in the future.

TI Feasibility of Quantum Key Distribution Between Supersonic Aircraft
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to enable the secure transfer of information and is the only known method of key exchange capable of providing verifiable security. While commercial optical fibre based QKD links are available, there are presently no free space based commercial solutions. Furthermore, QKD on airborne platforms has only been experimentally verified at low altitudes and at low speeds. We first survey the academic literature to identify gaps in research and establish a foundation for our own study. Subsequently, this study utilises computational modelling to find that continuous variable (CV) QKD is feasible for high-speed airborne platforms and can provide sufficient data rates (> 100 Mb/s without multiplexing) at suitable ranges (approximate to 15 km with full wavefront correction) for typical supersonic aircraft use cases. The implementation of such a system is economically viable as it can utilise relatively low-cost standard devices developed by the telecommunications industry, as opposed to the specialised equipment typically required for discrete variable (DV) QKD protocols. Our results highlight how the current capabilities of such devices impose limits on the performance (data rates and ranges) of airborne QKD systems.

TI Quantum simulation of thermodynamics in an integrated quantum photonic
   processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The emergence of relaxation in unitarily evolving systems can be seen as a paradox, but not once the distinction between local and global dynamics is considered. Here, the authors use photons in an integrated optical interferometer to show that, for a system evolving unitarily on a global level, single-mode measurements converge to those of a thermal state.
   One of the core questions of quantum physics is how to reconcile the unitary evolution of quantum states, which is information-preserving and time-reversible, with evolution following the second law of thermodynamics, which, in general, is neither. The resolution to this paradox is to recognize that global unitary evolution of a multi-partite quantum state causes the state of local subsystems to evolve towards maximum-entropy states. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this effect in linear quantum optics by simultaneously showing the convergence of local quantum states to a generalized Gibbs ensemble constituting a maximum-entropy state under precisely controlled conditions, while introducing an efficient certification method to demonstrate that the state retains global purity. Our quantum states are manipulated by a programmable integrated quantum photonic processor, which simulates arbitrary non-interacting Hamiltonians, demonstrating the universality of this phenomenon. Our results show the potential of photonic devices for quantum simulations involving non-Gaussian states.

TI Quantum algorithms to compute the neighbour list of N-body
   simulations
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB One of the strategies to reduce the complexity of N-body simulations is the computation of the neighbour list. However, this list needs to be updated from time to time, with a high computational cost. This paper focuses on the use of quantum computing to accelerate such a computation. Our proposal is based on a well-known oracular quantum algorithm (Grover). We introduce an efficient quantum circuit to build the oracle that marks pairs of closed bodies, and we provide three novel algorithms to calculate the neighbour list under several hypotheses which take into account a-priori information of the system. We also describe a decision methodology for the actual use of the proposed quantum algorithms. The performance of the algorithms is tested with a statistical simulation of the oracle, where a fixed number of pairs of bodies are set as neighbours. A statistical analysis of the number of oracle queries is carried out. The results obtained with our simulations indicate that when the density of bodies is low, our algorithms clearly outperform the best classical algorithm in terms of oracle queries.

TI Quantum simulation of the ground-state Stark effect in small molecules:
   a case study using IBM Q
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB As quantum computing approaches its first commercial implementations, quantum simulation emerges as a potentially ground-breaking technology for several domains, including biology and chemistry. However, taking advantage of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry raises a number of theoretical and practical challenges at different levels, from the conception to its actual execution. We go through such challenges in a case study of a quantum simulation for the hydrogen (H-2) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecules, at an actual commercially available quantum computer, the IBM Q. The former molecule has always been a playground for testing approximate calculation methods in quantum chemistry, while the latter is just a little bit more complex, lacking the mirror symmetry of the former. Using the variational quantum eigensolver method, we study the molecule's ground state energy versus interatomic distance, under the action of stationary electric fields (Stark effect). Additionally, we review the necessary calculations of the matrix elements of the second quantization Hamiltonian encompassing the extra terms concerning the action of electric fields, using STO-LG-type atomic orbitals to build the minimal basis sets.

TI Scalable Entanglement Certification via Quantum Communication
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Harnessing the advantages of shared entanglement for sending quantum messages often requires the implementation of complex two-particle entangled measurements. We investigate entanglement advantages in protocols that use only the simplest two-particle measurements, namely, product measurements. For experiments in which only the dimension of the message is known, we show that robust entanglement advantages are possible but that they are fundamentally limited by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Subsequently, we propose a natural extension of the standard scenario for these experiments and show that it circumvents this limitation. This leads us to prove entanglement advantages from every entangled twoqubit Werner state, evidence its generalization to high-dimensional systems, and establish a connection to quantum teleportation. Our results reveal the power of product measurements for generating quantum correlations in entanglement-assisted communication and they pave the way for practical semi-deviceindependent entanglement certification well beyond the constraints of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering.

TI Quantum communications for image transmission over error-prone channels
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB The introduction of quantum communications, enabled by advancements in quantum computing, is expected to play a significant role in the field of communications. Inherent properties of quantum objects, such as superposition and entanglement, have the potential to provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges encountered by classical communication systems in bandwidth-intensive applications such as media transmission. This research explores the performance of a quantum communication system in image transmission using quantum superposition and investigates its performance using a simple quantum channel model. With an increase in channel noise, there are significant gains in the rate distortion performance of images transmitted over the quantum channel compared to an ideal classical channel. This novel attempt at constructing a quantum communication-based image transmission system indicates the potential of the approach to be applied to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of high-quality media transmission applications.

TI Fermionic quantum computation with Cooper pair splitters
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device consists of quantum dots tunnelcoupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions implements the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev [1]. Due to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this second device design, we show that there is a sweet spot for which the local fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.

TI An Intrusion Resistant SCADA Framework Based on Quantum and Post-Quantum
   Scheme
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The rapid emergence of quantum computing threatens current Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) security standards, mainly, American Gas Association (AGA)-12. Therefore, researchers are developing various security schemes based on either quantum or post-quantum algorithms. However, the efficiency of quantum algorithms impacts the security of the post-quantum digital signature scheme. We propose an intrusion resistant algorithm exploiting and applying quantum principles in the post-quantum signature algorithm. We use the Bennett 1992 (B92) protocol, a quantum key distribution scheme, to obtain the cipher, and the practical Stateless Hash-based Signatures (SPHINCS)-256 protocol to obtain a post-quantum signature. However, instead of Chacha-12, a well-known cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, we apply a quantum random number generator to obtain a truly random Hash to Obtain Random Subset (HORS) signature with Tree (HORST) secret key used in SPHINCS-256. We have implemented the design in Python with the Quantum Information Toolkit. We have validated the proposed algorithm using the Probabilistic Model Checking for Performance and Reliability Analysis (PRISM) and Scyther tools. Moreover, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical tests show that the proposed algorithm key pairs have randomness of 98% and RSA and ECDSA are below 96%.

TI Deep quantum neural networks on a superconducting processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Deep learning and quantum computing have achieved dramatic progresses in recent years. The interplay between these two fast-growing fields gives rise to a new research frontier of quantum machine learning. In this work, we report an experimental demonstration of training deep quantum neural networks via the backpropagation algorithm with a six-qubit programmable superconducting processor. We experimentally perform the forward process of the backpropagation algorithm and classically simulate the backward process. In particular, we show that three-layer deep quantum neural networks can be trained efficiently to learn two-qubit quantum channels with a mean fidelity up to 96.0% and the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen with an accuracy up to 93.3% compared to the theoretical value. In addition, six-layer deep quantum neural networks can be trained in a similar fashion to achieve a mean fidelity up to 94.8% for learning single-qubit quantum channels. Our experimental results indicate that the number of coherent qubits required to maintain does not scale with the depth of the deep quantum neural network, thus providing a valuable guide for quantum machine learning applications with both near-term and future quantum devices.
   Experimental studies about the trainability and generalization capacities of quantum neural networks are highly in need. Here, the authors implement a previously proposed parametrization and training scheme using a 6-qubit superconducting quantum processor.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum data locking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum data locking is a quantum communication primitive that allows the use of a short secret key to encrypt a much longer message. It guarantees information-theoretical security against an adversary with limited quantum memory. Here we present a quantum data locking protocol that employs pseudorandom circuits consisting of Clifford gates only, which are much easier to implement fault tolerantly than universal gates. We show that information can be encrypted into n-qubit code words using order n - H-min(X) secret bits, where H-min(X) is the min-entropy of the plain text, and a min-entropy smaller than n accounts for information leakage to the adversary. As an application, we discuss an efficient method for encrypting the output of a quantum computer.

TI Fast and efficient long-distance quantum state transfer in long-range
   spin-12 models
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum state transfer (QST) is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling scheme in long spin- 12 linear chains. Exploiting the properties of the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that with minimal engineering, i.e. an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average transfer fidelity above 99% can be achieved. To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality QST is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer-range coupling schemes.

TI Microwave quantum memcapacitor effect
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Developing the field of neuromorphic quantum computing necessitates designing scalable quantum memory devices. Here, we propose a superconducting quantum memory device in the microwave regime, termed a microwave quantum memcapacitor. It comprises two linked resonators, the primary one is coupled to a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device, which allows for the modulation of the resonator properties through external magnetic flux. The auxiliary resonator, operated through weak measurements, provides feedback to the primary resonator, ensuring stable memory behavior. This device operates with a classical input in one cavity while reading the response in the other, serving as a fundamental building block toward arrays of microwave quantum memcapacitors. We observe that a bipartite setup can retain its memory behavior and gains entanglement and quantum correlations. Our findings pave the way for the experimental implementation of memcapacitive superconducting quantum devices and memory device arrays for neuromorphic quantum computing.
   Nonlinear memory devices such as memristors, memcapacitors, and meminductors, are the building blocks of energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. Here, the authors propose a superconducting circuit design acting as a microwave quantum memcapacitor, which could be implemented in neuromorphic quantum computing architectures.

AB Multi-qubit graph states generated by the action of controlled phase shift operators on a separable quantum state of a system, in which all the qubits are in arbitrary identical states, are examined. The geometric measure of entanglement of a qubit with other qubits is found for the graph states represented by arbitrary graphs. The entanglement depends on the degree of the vertex representing the qubit, the absolute values of the parameter of the phase shift gate and the parameter of state the gate is acting on. Also the geometric measure of entanglement of the graph states is quantified on the quantum computer ibmq_athens.

TI Lean Classical-Quantum Hybrid Neural Network Model for Image
   Classification
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The integration of algorithms from quantum information with neural networks has enabled unprecedented advancements in various domains. Nonetheless, the application of quantum machine learning algorithms for image classification predominantly relies on traditional architectures such as variational quantum circuits. The performance of these models is closely tied to the scale of their parameters, with the substantial demand for parameters potentially leading to limitations in computational resources and a significant increase in computation time. In this study, a Lean Classical-Quantum Hybrid Neural Network (LCQHNN) is introduced, which achieves efficient classification performance with only four layers of variational circuits, thereby substantially reducing computational costs. These experiments demonstrate that LCQHNN achieves 100%, 99.02%, and 85.55% classification accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Under the same parameter conditions, the convergence speed of this method is also faster than that of traditional models. Furthermore, through visualization studies, it is found that the model effectively captures key data features during training and establishes a clear association between these features and their corresponding categories. This study confirms that the employment of quantum algorithms enhances the model's ability to handle complex classification problems.

TI Frequency Conversion Interface towards Quantum Network: From Atomic
   Transition Line to Fiber Optical Communication Band
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum repeater is a key component of quantum network, and atomic memory is one of the important candidates for constructing quantum repeater. However, the atomic transition wavelength is not suitable for long-distance transmission in optical fiber. To bridge atomic memory and fiber communication, we demonstrate a frequency conversion interface from rubidium D1 line (795 nm) to the optical communication L-band (1621 nm) based on difference frequency generation. To reduce broadband noise of spontaneous Raman scattering caused by strong pumping light, we use a combination of two cascaded etalons and a Fabry-Perot cavity with low finesse to narrow the noise bandwidth to 11.7 MHz. The filtering system is built by common optical elements and is easy to use; it can be widely applied in frequency conversion process. We show that the signal-noise ratio of the converted field is good enough to reduce the input photon number below 1 under the condition of low external device conversion efficiency (0.51%) and large duration of input pulse (250 ns). The demonstrated frequency conversion interface has important potential application in quantum networks.

TI Title: experimental realisation of multi-qubit gates using electron
   paramagnetic resonance
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum information processing promises to revolutionise computing; quantum algorithms have been discovered that address common tasks significantly more efficiently than their classical counterparts. For a physical system to be a viable quantum computer it must be possible to initialise its quantum state, to realise a set of universal quantum logic gates, including at least one multi-qubit gate, and to make measurements of qubit states. Molecular Electron Spin Qubits (MESQs) have been proposed to fulfil these criteria, as their bottom-up synthesis should facilitate tuning properties as desired and the reproducible production of multi-MESQ structures. Here we explore how to perform a two-qubit entangling gate on a multi-MESQ system, and how to readout the state via quantum state tomography. We propose methods of accomplishing both procedures using multifrequency pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and apply them to a model MESQ structure consisting of two nitroxide spin centres. Our results confirm the methodological principles and shed light on the experimental hurdles which must be overcome to realise a demonstration of controlled entanglement on this system.

TI Finite-temperature detection of quantum critical points via internal
   quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that the teleportation protocol can be efficiently used to detect quantum critical points using finitetemperature data even if all resources needed for its implementation lie within the system under investigation. Contrary to a previous proposal, there is no need to use an external qubit as the input state to be teleported to one of the qubits within the system. Here we use a pair of nearest-neighbor spins from an infinite spin- 12 chain in equilibrium with a heat bath as the entangled resource of the quantum-teleportation protocol and a third adjacent qubit within the chain itself as the input state to be teleported. For several spin-chain models subjected to an external magnetic field, we show that the efficiency of the teleportation protocol is severely affected as we cross the quantum critical points associated with those spin chains. This abrupt change in efficiency gives us a clear indication of a quantum phase transition.

AB We prove, modulo a conjecture on quantum steering ellipsoids being true, the existence of the phenomenon of locally inaccessible hidden quantum correlations, that is, the existence of two-particle states whose hidden quantum correlations cannot be revealed by local filters implemented exclusively on one side of the experiment but that can still be revealed when both parties cooperate in applying judiciously chosen local filters. The quantum correlations considered here are the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for Bell nonlocality and the violation of the F 3 inequality for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Specifically, we provide a necessary criterion for guaranteeing the presence of such phenomena for arbitrary two-qubit states. This criterion in turn relies on the conjecture that the maximal violations of CHSH inequality and F 3 inequality are both upper bounded by functions that depend on the magnitude of the quantum steering ellipsoid center. This latter conjecture, although currently lacking an analytical proof, is supported by numerical results. We use this necessary criterion to explicitly show examples of two-qubit states with locally inaccessible hidden quantum correlations and furthermore two-qubit states with locally inaccessible maximal hidden quantum correlations.

TI On the Duality of Teleportation and Dense Coding
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Quantum teleportation is a quantum communication primitive that allows a long-distance quantum channel to be built using pre-shared entanglement and one-way classical communication. However, the quality of the established channel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entanglement. In this work, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement for the task of teleportation. We first show how this problem can be rephrased as a state discrimination problem. In this picture, a quantitative duality between teleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to-Bob teleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense coding protocol, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the success probability in the same state discrimination problem. One of our main results provides a complete characterization of the states that offer no advantage in one-way teleportation protocols over classical states, thereby offering a new and intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem of identifying such states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact that bound entangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation threshold. Moreover, our established duality between teleportation and dense coding can be used to show that the exact same states are unable to provide a non-classical advantage for dense coding as well. We also discuss the duality from a communication capacity point of view, deriving upper and lower bounds on the accessible information of a dense coding protocol in terms of the fidelity of its associated teleportation protocol. A corollary of this discussion is a simple proof of the previously established fact that bound entangled states do not provide any advantage in dense coding.

TI Time-optimal holonomic quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A three-level system can be used in a A-type configuration in order to construct a universal set of quantum gates through the use of non-Abelian nonadiabatic geometrical phases. Such construction allows for high-speed operation times which diminish the effects of decoherence. This might be, however, accompanied by a breakdown of the validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) due to the comparable timescale between counter-rotating terms and the pulse length, which greatly affects the dynamics. Here, we investigate the trade-off between dissipative effects and the RWA validity, obtaining the optimal regime for the operation of the holonomic quantum gates.

TI Event horizons are tunable factories of quantum entanglement
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
AB That event horizons generate quantum correlations via the Hawking effect is well known. We argue, however, that the creation of entanglement can be modulated, as desired, by appropriately illuminating the horizon. We adapt techniques from quantum information theory to quantify the entanglement produced during the Hawking process and show that, while ambient thermal noise (e.g. cosmic microwave background radiation) degrades it, the use of squeezed inputs can boost the nonseparability between the interior and exterior regions in a controlled manner. We further apply our ideas to analog event horizons concocted in the laboratory and insist that the ability to tune the generation of entanglement offers a promising route towards detecting quantum signatures of the elusive Hawking effect.

TI Matrix product state on a quantum computer
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Solving quantum many-body systems is one of the most significant regimes where quantum computing applies. Currently, as a hardware-friendly computational paradigms, variational algorithms are often used for finding the ground energy of quantum many-body systems. However, running large-scale variational algorithms is challenging, because of the noise as well as the obstacle of barren plateaus. In this work, we propose the quantum version of matrix product state, and develop variational quantum algorithms to prepare it in canonical forms, allowing to run the variational matrix product state method, which is equivalent to the density matrix renormalization group method, on near term quantum devices. Compared with widely used methods such as variational quantum eigensolver, this method can greatly reduce the number of qubits required, and thus can mitigate the effects of Barren Plateaus while obtain comparable or even better accuracy. Our method holds promise for distributed quantum computing, offering possibilities for fusion of different computing systems.

TI Simulation of a Three-Nucleons System Transition on Quantum Circuits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum computers have proven to be effective in simulating many quantum systems. Simulating nuclear processes and state preparation poses significant challenges, even for traditional supercomputers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a complete simulation of a nuclear transition, including the preparation of both ground and first excited states. To tackle the complexity of strong interactions between two and three nucleons, the states are modeled on the tritium nucleus. Both the initial and final states are represented using quantum circuits with variational quantum algorithms and inductive biases. Describing the spin-isospin states requires four qubits, and a parameterized quantum circuit that exploits a total of 16 parameters is initialized. The estimated energy has a relative error of approximate to$\approx$2% for the ground state and approximate to$\approx$10% for the first excited state of the system. The simulation estimates the transition probability between the two states as a function of the dipole polarization angle. This work marks a first step toward leveraging digital quantum computers to simulate nuclear physics.

TI Scalable parameterized quantum circuits classifier
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As a generalized quantum machine learning model, parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have been found to perform poorly in terms of classification accuracy and model scalability for multi-category classification tasks. To address this issue, we propose a scalable parameterized quantum circuits classifier (SPQCC), which performs per-channel PQC and combines the measurements as the output of the trainable parameters of the classifier. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss through optimizing the trainable parameters of PQC, SPQCC leads to a fast convergence of the classifier. The parallel execution of identical PQCs on different quantum machines with the same structure and scale reduces the complexity of classifier design. Classification simulations performed on the MNIST Dataset show that the accuracy of our proposed classifier far exceeds that of other quantum classification algorithms, achieving the state-of-the-art simulation result and surpassing/reaching classical classifiers with a considerable number of trainable parameters. Our classifier demonstrates excellent scalability and classification performance.

In this paper, we propose a universal error correction scheme to reduce errors and obtain effective solutions. Then, we apply this error correction scheme to designing a distributed phase estimation algorithm that presents a basic tool for studying distributed Shor's algorithm and distributed discrete logarithm algorithm as well as other distributed quantum algorithms. Our method may provide a universal strategy of error correction for a kind of distributed quantum computing.

TI Lithium Niobate on Insulator: An Emerging Platform for Integrated
   Quantum Photonics
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Due to its properties, lithium niobate is one of the most suitable material platforms for the implementation of integrated optical quantum circuits. With the commercialization of lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) substrates in the recent years, the lithium niobate nanostructuring technology has progressed immensely. Now nanostructured LNOI components can be fabricated with a quality on par with any other material platform, and could act as effective building blocks for integrated quantum circuits. The advanced nanostructuring technology combined with its favorable material properties make the LNOI platform a real contender for the realization of large-scale optical quantum circuits. The aim of this perspective article is to examine the utility of the LNOI platform toward this goal. To do this, first the availability of the individual components that can act as the building blocks for such circuits is investigated. Afterward, a fully on-chip implementation of a multiplexed source of single photons on the LNOI platform is envisioned, which is a highly challenging task in all material platforms. Based on the performance of the state-of-the-art components on the LNOI platform, the performance of such a device is quantified and the areas in which more progress is needed are pointed out.

TI State preparation boosters for early fault- tolerant quantum computation
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing is believed to be particularly useful for the simula-tion of chemistry and materials, among the various applications. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the development of near -term quantum algorithms for quantum simulation, including VQE and many of its variants. However, for such algorithms to be useful, they need to over-come several critical barriers including the inability to prepare high-quality approximations of the ground state. Current challenges to state preparation, including barren plateaus and the high-dimensionality of the optimization landscape, make state preparation through ansatz optimization unreliable. In this work, we introduce the method of ground state boosting, which uses a limited-depth quantum circuit to reliably increase the overlap with the ground state. This circuit, which we call a booster, can be used to aug-ment an ansatz from VQE or be used as a stand-alone state preparation method. The booster converts circuit depth into ground state overlap in a controllable manner. We numerically demonstrate the capabilities of boost-ers by simulating the performance of a particular type of booster, namely the Gaussian booster, for preparing the ground state of N2 molecular sys-tem. Beyond ground state preparation as a direct objective, many quantum algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation, rely on high-quality state preparation as a subroutine. Therefore, we foresee ground state boosting and similar methods as becoming essential algorithmic components as the field transitions into using early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Adaptive circuit learning of born machine: towards realization of
   amplitude embedding and quantum data loading
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum data loading plays a central role in quantum algorithms and quantum information processing. Many quantum algorithms hinge on the ability to prepare arbitrary superposition states as a subroutine, with claims of exponential speedups often predicated on access to an efficient data-loading oracle. In practice, constructing a circuit to prepare a generic n-qubit quantum state typically demands computational efforts scaling as O(2n), posing a significant challenge for quantum algorithms to outperform their classical counterparts. To address this critical issue, various hybrid quantum-classical approaches have been proposed. However, many of these solutions favor simplistic circuit architectures, which are susceptible to substantial optimization challenges. In this study, we harness quantum circuits as Born machines to generate probability distributions. Drawing inspiration from methods used to investigate electronic structures in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, we propose a framework called Adaptive Circuit Learning of Born Machine, which dynamically expands the ansatz circuit. Our algorithm is designed to selectively integrate two-qubit entangled gates that best capture the intricate entanglement present within the target state. Empirical experiments underscore the efficacy of our approach in encoding real-world data through amplitude embedding, demonstrating not only compliance with but also enhancement over the performance benchmarks set by prior research.

TI Cost-Effective ML-Powered Polarization-Encoded Quantum Key Distribution
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Secure communications have become a requirement for virtually all kind of applications. Currently, two distant parties can generate shared random secret keys by using public key cryptography. However, quantum computing represents one of the greatest threats for the finite complexity of the mathematics behind public key cryptography. In contrast, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on properties of quantum mechanics, which enables eavesdropping detection and guarantees the security of the key. Among QKD systems, polarization encoded QKD has been successfully tested in laboratory experiments and recently demonstrated in closed environments. The main drawback of QKD is its high cost, which comes, among others, from: i) the requirements for the quantum transmitters and receivers; and ii) the need of carefully selecting the fibers supporting the quantum channel to minimize the environmental effects that could dramatically change the polarization state of photons. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) -based polarization tracking and compensation that is able to keep shared secret key exchange to high rates even under large fiber stressing events. Exhaustive results using both synthetic and experimental data show remarkable performance, which can simplify the design of both quantum transmitter and receiver, as well as enable the use of aerial optical cables, thus reducing total QKD system cost.

TI Quantum Coordination Rates in Multi-User Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Quantum coordination is considered in networks with classical and quantum links. We begin with networks with classical links, and characterize the generation of separable and classical-quantum correlations in three primary models: 1) a two-node network with limited common randomness (CR), 2) a no-communication network, and 3) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers. We establish the optimal tradeoff between the classical communication and CR rates in each setting, thus characterizing the minimal resources for simulating classical-quantum correlations. Next, we consider coordination in networks with quantum links. We study the following models: 1) a cascade network with limited entanglement, 2) a broadcast network, and 3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the optimal tradeoff between quantum communication and entanglement rates in each setting, characterizing the minimal resources for entanglement coordination. The examples demonstrate that coordination of entanglement and coordination of separable correlations behave differently. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.

TI Functional near-infrared spectroscopy for the detection of fear using
   parameterized quantum circuits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Excessive fear in response to certain stimuli may be a key indicator of anxiety disorders. Its detection makes it valuable for the diagnosis and treatment of such pathologies. Quantum computing has shown promising results in processing different types of brain signals. However, its potential for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals remains largely unexplored. The present study investigates the application of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for the detection of fear in fNIRS data. To this end, two different quantum architectures and quantum kernels are presented and tested on a publicly available fNIRS dataset. The proposed models are evaluated for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification by cross-validation to measure their performance under different conditions. The cross-validation results showed good performance of the proposed architectures even when trained on a very small dataset. Both analyzed quantum kernels showed high performance as feature extractors. Surprisingly, the subject-dependent approach achieved superior results despite using a training set more than 20 times smaller than that of the subject-independent approach. These results emphasize the power of quantum models in the classification of fNIRS signals and open new avenues for the analysis of this type of brain signals beyond the limitations of classical approaches.

TI Few-qubit quantum refrigerator for cooling a multi-qubit system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose to use a few-qubit system as a compact quantum refrigerator for cooling an interacting multi-qubit system. We specifically consider a central qubit coupled to N ancilla qubits in a so-called spin-star model to be used as refrigerant by means of short interactions with a many-qubit system to be cooled. We first show that if the interaction between the qubits is of the longitudinal and ferromagnetic Ising model form, the central qubit is colder than the environment. We summarize how preparing the refrigerant qubits using the spin-star model paves the way for the cooling of a many-qubit system by means of a collisional route to thermalization. We discuss a simple refrigeration cycle, considering the operation cost and cooling efficiency, which can be controlled by N and the qubit-qubit interaction strength. Besides, bounds on the achievable temperature are established. Such few-qubit compact quantum refrigerators can be significant to reduce dimensions of quantum technology applications, can be easy to integrate into all-qubit systems, and can increase the speed and power of quantum computing and thermal devices.

TI Toward cost-effective quantum circuit simulation with performance tuning
   techniques
SO CONNECTION SCIENCE
AB Quantum circuit simulation is a popular approach to evaluating novel quantum algorithms before a physical quantum computer is available. Unfortunately, the simulation is often done with the full-state quantum circuit simulation scheme, and a huge memory space required by a full-state simulator is a limiting factor for the simulation of a larger qubit system. In this work, in order to support the simulation of a broadened qubit system, storage devices are introduced into the full-state quantum circuit simulation. A vertical qubit simulation design is proposed for the storage-based, full-state quantum circuit simulation, including qubit representation, threading model, and parallel state manipulations over storage devices. An empirical method of simulator parameter tuning is developed to achieve higher simulation performance. Our experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art memory-only simulator (QuEST), the storage-based simulation can achieve a 61x higher cost-delay ratio and can simulate a 39-qubit system on a commodity computer. The encouraging results indicate that our proposed simulator can help scale the full-state simulation for larger quantum circuits and achieve higher performance via the performance tuning method.

TI Quantum photonics sensing in biosystems
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Quantum sensors emerged among quantum technologies as the ones with promising potential applications in the near future. This perspective reviews two leading quantum sensing platforms and their advancements toward biological applications: quantum light sources and color centers in diamonds. Quantum light, including squeezed states and N00N states, allows enhanced phase measurements by surpassing the classical shot noise limits. This advantage can be exploited in several contexts, enabling improved resolution and sensitivity, which are particularly valuable in biological contexts where traditional high-intensity illumination could damage or alter delicate samples. In parallel, color centers in diamonds, specifically nitrogen-vacancy and silicon-vacancy centers, also emerged as promising for sensing applications due to their high sensitivity and biocompatibility. These sensors enable detailed intracellular measurements, such as temperature detection, and show potential for measuring magnetic fields of biological origin. Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in translating these technologies from a controlled laboratory environment to practical, widely applicable devices for diverse biological applications. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of quantum sensors in the biological field. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Experimental demonstration of a quantum controlled-SWAP gate with
   multiple degrees of freedom of a single photon
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Optimizing the physical realization of quantum gates is important to build a quantum computer. The controlled-SWAP gate, also named Fredkin gate, can be widely applicable in various quantum information processing schemes. In the present research, we propose and experimentally implement quantum Fredkin gate in a single-photon hybrid-degrees-of-freedom system. Polarization is used as the control qubit, and SWAP operation is achieved in a four-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by photonic orbital angular momentum. The effective conversion rate P of the quantum Fredkin gate in our experiment is (95.4 +/- 2.6)%. Besides, we find that a kind of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states can be prepared by using our quantum Fredkin gate, and these nonseparale states can show its quantum contextual characteristic by the violation of Mermin inequality. Our experimental design and coding method are useful for quantum computing and quantum fundamental study in high-dimensional and hybrid coding quantum systems.

TI On the Impact of Affine Loop Transformations in Qubit Allocation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Most quantum compiler transformations and qubit allocation techniques to date are either peep-hole focused or rely on sliding windows that depend on a number of external parameters including the topology of the quantum processor. Thus, global optimization criteria are still lacking.
   In this article, we explore the synergies and impact of affine loop transformations in the context of qubit allocation and mapping. With this goal in mind, we designed and implemented AXL, a domain specific language and source-to-source compiler for quantum circuits that can be directly described with affine relations. We conduct an extensive evaluation spanning circuits from the recently introduced QUEKO benchmark suite, eight quantum circuits taken from the literature, three distinct coupling graphs, four affine transformations (including the Pluto dependence distance minimization and Feautrier's minimum latency algorithms), four qubit allocators, and two back-end quantum compilers. Our results demonstrate that affine transformations using global optimization criteria can cooperate effectively in several scenarios with quantum qubit mapping algorithms to reduce the circuit depth, size and allocation time.

TI Generation of quantum entanglement based on electromagnetically induced
   transparency media
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement is an essential ingredient for the absolute security of quantum communication. Generation of continuous-variable entanglement or two-mode squeezing between light fields based on the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been systematically investigated in this work. Here, we propose a new scheme to enhance the degree of entanglement between probe and coupling fields of coherent-state light by introducing a two-photon detuning in the EIT system. This proposed scheme is more efficient than the conventional one, utilizing the ground-state relaxation (population decay or dephasing) rate to produce entanglement or two-mode squeezing which adds far more excess fluctuation or noise to the system. In addition, maximum degree of entanglement at a given optical depth can be achieved with a wide range of the coupling Rabi frequency and the two-photon detuning, showing our scheme is robust and flexible. It is also interesting to note that while EIT is the effect in the perturbation limit, i.e. the probe field being much weaker than the coupling field and treated as a perturbation, there exists an optimum ratio of the probe to coupling intensities to achieve the maximum entanglement. Our proposed scheme can advance the continuous-variable-based quantum technology and may lead to applications in quantum communication utilizing squeezed light.

TI Spin-orbit interaction enabled high-fidelity two-qubit gates
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the implications of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) for two-qubit gates (TQGs) in semiconductor spin qubit platforms. SOI renders the exchange interaction governing qubit pairs anisotropic, posing a serious challenge for conventional TQGs derived for the isotropic Heisenberg exchange. Starting from microscopic level, we develop a concise computational Hamiltonian that captures the essence of SOI, and use it to derive properties of the rotating-frame time evolutions. Two key findings are made. First, for the controlled-phase/controlled-Z gate, we show and analytically prove the existence of 'SOI nodes' where the fidelity can be optimally enhanced, with only slight modifications in terms of gate time and local phase corrections. Second, we discover and discuss novel two-qubit dynamics that are inaccessible without SOI-the reflection gate and the direct controlled-not gate (CNOT). The relevant conditions and achievable fidelities are explicitly derived for the direct CNOT.

TI Relation between quantum coherence and quantum entanglement in quantum
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum measurement is a class of quantum channels that sends quantum states to classical states. We set up resource theories of quantum coherence and quantum entanglement for quantum measurements and find relations between them. For this, we conceive a relative entropy-type quantity to account for the quantum resources of quantum measurements. The quantum coherence of a quantum measurement can be converted into the entan-glement in a bipartite quantum measurement through coherence nongenerating transformations. Conversely, a quantum entanglement monotone of quantum measurements induces a quantum coherence monotone of quantum measurements. Our results confirm that the understanding on the link between quantum coherence and quantum entanglement is valid even for quantum measurements which do not generate any quantum resource.

We discuss the factors that must be considered to implement a desired effective Hamiltonian on a device. We describe the translation between a device's physical layout, the circuit graph, and the effective Hamiltonian. We go over the process of electromagnetic simulation of a device layout to predict its behavior. We also discuss concerns such as connectivity, crosstalk suppression, and radiation shielding, and how they affect both on-chip design and enclosure structures. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in superconducting quantum circuit design and acts as a starter document for researchers working on any of these challenges.

TI Quantum Machine Learning for b-jet charge identification
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Machine Learning algorithms have played an important role in hadronic jet classification problems. The large variety of models applied to Large Hadron Collider data has demonstrated that there is still room for improvement. In this context Quantum Machine Learning is a new and almost unexplored methodology, where the intrinsic properties of quantum computation could be used to exploit particles correlations for improving the jet classification performance. In this paper, we present a brand new approach to identify if a jet contains a hadron formed by a b or (b) over bar quark at the moment of production, based on a Variational Quantum Classifier applied to simulated data of the LHCb experiment. Quantum models are trained and evaluated using LHCb simulation. The jet identification performance is compared with a Deep Neural Network model to assess which method gives the better performance.

TI Two-Party Mutual Authentication Semi-Quantum Key Agreement Protocol
   Based on Bell State
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum cryptography uses quantum states as the carriers of information transmission and transmits information between authorized users through quantum channels. Different from that of traditional cryptography, the security of quantum cryptography is guaranteed by the basic principles of quantum mechanics. Therefore, it is theoretically unconditionally secure. In recent years, quantum cryptography has received extensive attention from many researchers engaged in cryptography, and has gradually developed into a popular research direction in the field of cryptography. Specifically, the quantum key agreement is an important research topic in quantum cryptography. It enables all participants to jointly negotiate a session key through a secure quantum channel, and each participant's contribution to the negotiated key is the same. On the one hand, due to the high cost and scarce resources, it is difficult for the vast majority of participants to have well-performing quantum devices. Therefore, in order to facilitate the implementation of the protocol, it is necessary to simplify the quantum operations of the participants. In response to this problem, some scholars have proposed a semi-quantum key agreement protocol. The semi-quantum key agreement protocol requires that one of the participants in the protocol has complete quantum capabilities, and the remaining participants only have semi-quantum capabilities. Moreover, the semi-quantum participants can only perform the following two operations: i) reflection operation. No operation is performed on the received particles, and the received particles are returned directly. ii) Measurement operation. Z-based measurement is performed on the received particles, and new particles are prepared according to the measurement results. On the other hand, since participants may be attacked by man-in-the-middle in the process of key agreement, it is necessary to authenticate participants before the key agreement. In recent years, researchers have also proposed some quantum key agreement protocols with mutual authentication. In practical application scenarios, in order to facilitate the implementation of the protocol, it is necessary to design a semi-quantum key agreement protocol with lower requirements for participants ability and equipment. In order to prevent external attackers from counterfeiting authorized users to steal shared keys, the protocol needs to have a mutual authentication function. Therefore, it is necessary to design a semi-quantum key agreement protocol with mutual authentication.
   Methods Based on the Bell state, we propose a two-party semi-quantum key agreement protocol with a mutual authentication function, where Alice is a full quantum participant and Bob is a semi-quantum participant. The two sides achieve mutual authentication of identity by preparing and measuring identity information particles. By using the entanglement characteristics of the Bell state, the shared key negotiation was realized. Compared with other entangled states, the Bell state used in this protocol is easier to prepare, and the protocol only uses two quantum measurement operations, namely Z-based measurement and Bell measurement, which are easier to implement in existing technology. In addition, we proved that the proposed scheme can effectively resist participant attacks and external attacks, and that the protocol is equipped with a wavelength quantum filter and a photon number separator on both sides of Alice and Bob to avoid Trojan horse attacks. In the performance analysis of this protocol, the Cabello qubit efficiency was used to measure the performance of the quantum key agreement protocol.
   Results and Discussions First of all, in the previous research on quantum key agreement protocols, some scholars focus on how to simplify the quantum operation of participants, so as to better apply to the actual scene of resource scarcity, while others pay attention to how to prevent the man-in-the-middle attacks that may be encountered during the key agreement process and further improve the security of the protocol. The two-party mutual authentication semi-quantum key agreement protocol based on the Bell state proposed in this paper can not only reduce the requirements for participants capabilities and devices, but also realize mutual authentication between participants before key agreement to prevent the protocol from being attacked by man-in-the-middle. Finally, a security analysis shows that the protocol can effectively resist participant and external attacks. In addition, the performance analysis shows that the protocol can improve the quantum bit efficiency compared with some quantum key agreement protocols that meet a single function under the condition of satisfying two functional characteristics at the same time.
   Conclusions In this study, a two-party mutual authentication semi-quantum key agreement protocol based on the Bell state is proposed. The protocol not only ensures that the shared key can be fairly negotiated between the full quantum party, Alice, and the semi-quantum party, Bob, but more importantly, the two parties need to authenticate each other's identity before the key agreement, so as to resist external attackers posing as legitimate users to steal the shared key. Security analysis shows that this semi-quantum key agreement protocol can resist both participant and external attacks. Finally, through a performance analysis and comparison with existing quantum key agreement protocols, it is found that the protocol has certain advantages in terms of its function and performance.

TI Selective filtering of photonic quantum entanglement via
   anti-parity-time symmetry
SO SCIENCE
AB Entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing, sensing, and communication, but it is susceptible to decoherence. To address this, research in quantum optics has explored filtering techniques such as photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. We introduce an approach to entanglement retrieval that exploits the features of non-Hermitian systems. By designing an anti-parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network and achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels, remaining robust against decoherence during propagation. Our results offer an approach to using non-Hermitian symmetries to address central challenges in quantum technologies.

TI Universal Quantum Computer from Relativistic Motion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present an explicit construction of a relativistic quantum computing architecture using a variational quantum circuit approach that is shown to allow for universal quantum computing. The variational quantum circuit consists of tunable single-qubit rotations and entangling gates that are implemented successively. The single-qubit rotations are parameterized by the proper time intervals of the qubits' trajectories and can be tuned by varying their relativistic motion in spacetime. The entangling layer is mediated by a relativistic quantum field instead of through direct coupling between the qubits. Within this setting, we give a prescription for how to use quantum field-mediated entanglement and manipulation of the relativistic motion of qubits to obtain a universal gate set, for which compact nonperturbative expressions that are valid for general spacetimes are also obtained. We also derive a lower bound on the channel fidelity that shows the existence of parameter regimes in which all entangling operations are effectively unitary, despite the noise generated from the presence of a mediating quantum field. Finally, we consider an explicit implementation of the quantum Fourier transform with relativistic qubits.

TI Exploring the use of quantum computers for resilience analysis in
   critical infrastructure networks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Resilience analysis of networks representing critical infrastructure is a computationally hard problem, and the question arises of whether quantum computers may be beneficial for this purpose. On the way towards an answer to this problem, we map a small critical infrastructure network on a quantum network composed of dipole-dipole-coupled nodes. The latter are each equipped with up to three discrete (quantum) states, two of which support the connectivity of the network, while the third state, reachable through nondeterministic spontaneous processes, represents a 'broken' node. A finite 'repair' time is needed to restore the node. To study the dynamics of such networks on a quantum computer, we derive unitary dilations of Kraus operators governing the evolution of our open quantum network, and generate corresponding quantum circuits using the qiskit interface. We then study the population dynamics of several cases of increasing complexity on the quantum hardware. We discuss how scaling of errors is related to the depth of the quantum circuits. Ultimately, we show that open quantum systems can be used for modelling critical infrastructure, but quantum computers with much lower error rates than currently available are required for a quantitative resilience analysis.

TI Mentor initialed multiparty hierarchical joint remote preparation of an
   arbitrary n-qudit state via generalized Bell states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose a protocol to Mentor initiated hierarchical joint remote prepare the arbitrary n-qudit state with generalized Bell states.The agents share generalized Bell states with the Mentor. The Mentor performs five-qudit projective measurements on his entangled particles to initiate the quantum channel shared by the agents. All the senders share the information of the prepared state and make quantum measurements on their particles based on the state to be prepared. The agent in the upper grade needs only the assistance of one of the agents in the lower grade to reconstruct the original state, while the agents in the lower grade need the assistance of all the other agents to recover the original state. It is more convenient in application than others since the agents in the protocol only requires two-particle entanglement for Mentor initiated hierarchical joint remote preparation of an arbitrary n-qudit state.

TI A large-scale reconfigurable multiplexed quantum photonic network
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB The distribution of entanglement in quantum networks will enable the next generation of technologies in quantum-secured communications, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Future quantum networks will require dense connectivity, allowing multiple users to share entanglement in a reconfigurable and multiplexed manner, while long-distance connections are established through the teleportation of entanglement, or entanglement swapping. Although several recent works have demonstrated fully connected, local multi-user networks based on multiplexing, extending such networks to a global network architecture of interconnected local networks remains an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate the next step in the evolution of multiplexed quantum networks-a prototype global reconfigurable network in which entanglement is routed and teleported in a flexible and multiplexed manner between two local four-user networks. At the heart of our network is a programmable 8 x 8-dimensional multi-port circuit that harnesses the natural mode-mixing process inside of a multi-mode fibre to implement on-demand high-dimensional operations on two independent photons carrying eight transverse-spatial modes. Our circuit design allows us to break away from the limited planar geometry and bypass the control and fabrication challenges of conventional integrated photonic platforms. Our demonstration highlights the potential of this architecture for enabling large-scale, global quantum networks that offer versatile connectivity while being fully compatible with an existing communications infrastructure.

AB By leveraging shared entanglement between a pair of qubits, one can teleport a quantum state from one particle to another. Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsically many-body generalization of quantum teleportation, with an elegant and surprising connection to gravity. In particular, the teleportation of quantum information relies on many-body dynamics, which originate from strongly interacting systems that are holographically dual to gravity; from the gravitational perspective, such quantum teleportation can be understood as the transmission of information through a traversable wormhole. Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for many-body quantum teleportation???dubbed peaked-size teleportation. Intriguingly, peaked-size teleportation utilizes precisely the same type of quantum circuit as traversable wormhole teleportation yet has a completely distinct microscopic origin: It relies upon the spreading of local operators under generic thermalizing dynamics and not gravitational physics. We demonstrate the ubiquity of peaked-size teleportation, both analytically and numerically, across a diverse landscape of physical systems, including random unitary circuits, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (at high temperatures), one-dimensional spin chains, and a bulk theory of gravity with stringy corrections. Our results pave the way toward using many-body quantum teleportation as a powerful experimental tool for (i) characterizing the size distributions of operators in strongly correlated systems and (ii) distinguishing between generic and intrinsically gravitational scrambling dynamics. To this end, we provide a detailed experimental blueprint for realizing many-body quantum teleportation in both trapped ions and Rydberg atom arrays; effects of decoherence and experimental imperfections are analyzed.

TI Real-Time Threat Mitigation in Financial IT Infrastructures Using
   Quantum Computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB institutions continue to face evolving cyber security threats that require immediate detection and mitigation to prevent significant damage. Classical-based cyber security mechanisms struggle to keep up with these emerging threats due to their limitations in processing power and scalability, especially when dealing with distributed attacks. Quantum computing promises an unmatched level of scalable parallel processing with increased accuracy, speed, and timely response to realtime threats. This research evaluates the application of quantum computing algorithms, specifically Continuous-Variable Quantum Neural Networks (CV-QNN), Crystals-Kyber cryptographic methods, and Quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo simulations, within financial IT infrastructures. Our findings indicate that quantum algorithms substantially enhance threat detection accuracy, reduce response latency, and ensure secure communication against quantum-powered threats. However, practical implementation of quantum computing solutions faces challenges such as high error rates, environmental sensitivity, and integration complexities. Addressing these issues requires further technological advancement and strategic planning. This research contributes actionable insights for financial institutions, guiding the strategic adoption of quantum technologies to strengthen cyber security resilience.

TI Hardware-Efficient, Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Rydberg
   Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Neutral-atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing. One important remaining roadblock for the large-scale application of these systems is the ability to perform error-corrected quantum operations. To entangle the qubits in these systems, atoms are typically excited to Rydberg states, which could decay or give rise to various correlated errors that cannot be addressed directly through traditional methods of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this work, we provide the first complete characterization of these sources of error in a neutral-atom quantum computer and propose hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant quantum computation schemes that mitigate them. Notably, we develop a novel and distinctly efficient method to address the most important errors associated with the decay of atomic qubits to states outside of the computational subspace. These advances allow us to significantly reduce the resource cost for fault-tolerant quantum computation compared to existing, general-purpose schemes. Our protocols can be implemented in the near term using state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms with qubits encoded in both alkali and alkaline-earth atoms.

TI Robust Photonic Quantum Gates With A Large Number of Waveguide Segments
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Realizing quantum information processors is challenged by errors and noise across all platforms. While composite segmentation schemes are proposed in many systems, their application to photonic quantum gates in dual-rail configurations has only recently been demonstrated. However, prior research is limited to a small number of segments, full noise correlation, and has overlooked the inherent power loss in such designs. Here, the fidelity and power loss of composite designs for photonic quantum gates with a high number of segments of varying geometrical widths are studied. Using numerical simulations, the relationship between gate performance and the number of waveguide segments, accounting for statistical error correlations and variances is analyzed. Beyond effectively reducing the errors, an asymptotic scaling pattern of quantum gate fidelity and power loss is observed as the number of segments increases. This analysis is examined in Silicon and Lithium Niobate platforms, addressing practical implementation challenges. The findings demonstrate that optimized multi-segment waveguide geometrical designs significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of photonic quantum gates, paving the way for more reliable quantum information processors.

TI Quantum surrogate modelling to solve phase field simulation problems in
   metal solidification
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are hybrid algorithms that combine quantum computing capabilities with classical machine learning (ML) tasks, utilizing classical optimizers to train parametrized quantum circuits. This work demonstrates their practical utility by addressing regression tasks in an industrially relevant context: modelling dendritic solidification in metals, a process crucial for determining mechanical properties in additive manufacturing. By comparing a classical surrogate model based on extreme gradient boosting with a hybrid classical-quantum VQA model, this work shows that VQAs can serve as a viable alternative for computationally expensive surrogate modelling. These findings highlight the potential of VQAs to tackle complex physical phenomena in high-cost computational scenarios, advancing their application in real-world industrial ML challenges.

TI Quantum Codes for Asymmetric Channels: ZZZY Surface Codes
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB We introduce surface ZZZY codes, a novel family of quantum error-correcting codes designed for asymmetric channels. Derived from standard surface codes through tailored modification of generators, ZZZY codes can be decoded by the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm with a suitable pre-processing phase. The resulting decoder exploits the information provided by the modified generators without introducing additional complexity. ZZZY codes demonstrate a significant performance advantage over surface codes when increasing the channel asymmetry, while maintaining the same correction capability over depolarizing channel.

TI Quantum State Transfer and Periodicity in Discrete-Time Quantum Walks
   Under Non-Markovian Dephasing Noise
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph, present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum non-Markovian dephasing noises, particularly quantum non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for a finite number of steps in a quantum walk. Our investigation brings out the feasibility of state transfer in a noisy environment.

TI Subtleties in the trainability of quantum machine learning models
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB A new paradigm for data science has emerged, with quantum data, quantum models, and quantum computational devices. This field, called quantum machine learning (QML), aims to achieve a speedup over traditional machine learning for data analysis. However, its success usually hinges on efficiently training the parameters in quantum neural networks, and the field of QML is still lacking theoretical scaling results for their trainability. Some trainability results have been proven for a closely related field called variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). While both fields involve training a parametrized quantum circuit, there are crucial differences that make the results for one setting not readily applicable to the other. In this work, we bridge the two frameworks and show that gradient scaling results for VQAs can also be applied to study the gradient scaling of QML models. Our results indicate that features deemed detrimental for VQA trainability can also lead to issues such as barren plateaus in QML. Consequently, our work has implications for several QML proposals in the literature. In addition, we provide theoretical and numerical evidence that QML models exhibit further trainability issues not present in VQAs, arising from the use of a training dataset. We refer to these as dataset-induced barren plateaus. These results are most relevant when dealing with classical data, as here the choice of embedding scheme (i.e., the map between classical data and quantum states) can greatly affect the gradient scaling.

AB This paper introduces a deep learning system based on a quantum neural network for the binary classification of points of a specific geometric pattern (Two-Moons Classification problem) on a plane.
   We believe that the use of hybrid deep learning systems (classical + quantum) can reasonably bring benefits, not only in terms of computational acceleration but in understanding the underlying phenomena and mechanisms; that will lead to the creation of new forms of machine learning, as well as to a strong development in the world of quantum computation.
   The chosen dataset is based on a 2D binary classification generator, which helps test the effectiveness of specific algorithms; it is a set of 2D points forming two interspersed semicircles. It displays two disjointed data sets in a two-dimensional representation space: the features are, therefore, the individual points' two coordinates, x1 and x2.
   The intention was to produce a quantum deep neural network with the minimum number of trainable parameters capable of correctly recognising and classifying points.

TI Quantum computation with electrons trapped on liquid Helium by using the
   centimeter-wave manipulating techniques
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Surface-state electrons floating on liquid Helium have been served as one of the great potential experimental platforms to implement quantum computation, wherein the qubits are usually encoded by either the lowest two levels of the vertical vibrations (i.e., Hydrogen-like atoms) or the electronic spins. Given the relevant operations require additional techniques, such as the corresponding millimeter-wave or magnetic field manipulations, here we investigate how to implement the scalable quantum computation with a trapped electron array by alternatively using the usual centimeter-wave manipulating techniques. This is because the eigenfrequency of the present qubit, encoded by the two lowest levels of the lateral vibration of the trapped electron, is limited in the centimeter-wave band. We show that, by biasing the electrodes properly and driving the coplanar waveguide transmission line resonator, the electrons can be individually trapped in a series of anharmonic potentials on liquid Helium. Therefore, the well-developed circuit quantum electrodynamics technique for the implementation of superconducting quantum computation can be conveniently utilized here in the present quantum computing platform (proposed firstly in Phys Rev Lett 105:040503, 2010, to implement the fundamental logic gates, typically such as the single-qubit rotations of the individually addressable trapped electrons, the switchable two-qubit manipulations between the electrons trapped in the distant traps, and also the high-fidelity readouts of the target qubits. The feasibility of the proposal is also discussed by numerical simulations.

TI Quantum algorithm for protein-ligand docking sites identification in the
   interaction space
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN
AB Over the past two decades, the development of novel drugs evolved into a high-demanding computational field. There is a constant and increasing need for advanced methods for determining protein-ligand binding in the drug design process. Even after the introduction and use of High-Performance Computers in drug design, fundamental problems and constraints have not been dealt with in a satisfactory manner. This is partially due to the fact that ligand docking in proteins is a quantum mechanical process. With the quantum computers available today, the question "Can quantum computers be used in drug design and how?" arises naturally. A novel quantum algorithm for protein-ligand docking site identification is presented here. In detail, the protein lattice model has been expanded to include protein-ligand interactions. Quantum state labelling for the interaction sites is introduced, and an extended and modified Grover quantum search algorithm is implemented to search for docking sites. This algorithm has been tested and executed on both a quantum simulator and a real quantum computer. The results show that the quantum algorithm can identify effectively docking sites. The quantum algorithm is highly scalable and well-suited for identifying docking sites within large proteins, poised to harness the potential of increased quantum bits in the future.

AB The Unitary Synthesis Problem (Aaronson-Kuperberg 2007) asks whether any n-qubit unitary U can be implemented by an efficient quantum algorithm A augmented with an oracle that computes an arbitrary Boolean function f. In other words, can the task of implementing any unitary be efficiently reduced to the task of implementing any Boolean function?
   In this work, we prove a one-query lower bound for unitary synthesis. We show that there exist unitaries U such that no quantum polynomial-time oracle algorithm A(f) can implement U, even approximately, if it only makes one (quantum) query to f. Our approach also has implications for quantum cryptography: we prove (relative to a random oracle) the existence of quantum cryptographic primitives that remain secure against all one-query adversaries A(f). Since such one-query algorithms can decide any language, solve any classical search problem, and even prepare any quantum state, our result suggests that implementing random unitaries and breaking quantum cryptography may be harder than all of these tasks.
   To prove this result, we formulate unitary synthesis as an efficient challenger-adversary game, which enables proving lower bounds by analyzing the maximum success probability of an adversary A(f). Our main technical insight is to identify a natural spectral relaxation of the one-query optimization problem, which we bound using tools from random matrix theory.
   We view our framework as a potential avenue to rule out polynomial-query unitary synthesis, and we state conjectures in this direction.

TI Shemesh Theorem and Its Relation With the Zero-Error Quantum Information

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, our objective is to establish results that connect Shemesh theorem with quantum zero-error information theory. To achieve this, we will first introduce definitions and properties related to the zero-error capacity of a quantum channel, with particular emphasis on demonstrating that the eigenstates common to the Kraus operators representing the quantum channel are fixed points. This result has previously been employed to develop a test for determining whether a quantum channel possesses positive zero-error capacity. In this work, we demonstrate that the eigenstates common to the Kraus operators representing the channel reside within the Shemesh subspace. Consequently, the fixed points of the quantum channel act as a bridge between Shemesh theorem and quantum zero-error information theory, thereby enabling the derivation of new results on the zero-error capacity of quantum channels.

TI Quantum Conformal Prediction for Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in
   Quantum Machine Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum machine learning is a promising programming paradigm for the optimization of quantum algorithms in the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. A fundamental challenge in quantum machine learning is generalization, as the designer targets performance under testing conditions while having access only to limited training data. Existing generalization analyses, while identifying important general trends and scaling laws, cannot be used to assign reliable and informative "error bars" to the decisions made by quantum models. In this article, we propose a general methodology that can reliably quantify the uncertainty of quantum models, irrespective of the amount of training data, the number of shots, the ansatz, the training algorithm, and the presence of quantum hardware noise. The approach, which builds on probabilistic conformal prediction (CP), turns an arbitrary, possibly small, number of shots from a pretrained quantum model into a set prediction, e.g., an interval, that provably contains the true target with any desired coverage level. Experimental results confirm the theoretical calibration guarantees of the proposed framework, referred to as quantum CP.

TI Partial blind quantum computation: a framework for selective circuit
   protection
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computing is rapidly advancing toward cloud-based services, raising significant concerns about the privacy and security of computations outsourced to untrusted quantum servers. Universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocols enable clients with limited quantum resources to delegate computations while concealing both inputs and circuit details. However, applying UBQC uniformly to an entire quantum circuit incurs additional quantum resources and computational overhead, which can be a significant burden in practical implementations. In many cases, such as Grover's algorithm, only specific subroutines-like oracles-contain sensitive information, while the rest of the circuit does not require the same level of protection. Therefore, selectively applying UBQC to critical components can enhance computational efficiency while maintaining security. In this work, we propose a selective application of UBQC that targets only the critical components of quantum circuits. By integrating techniques from quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) and UBQC, our approach secures the sensitive subcircuits while allowing the remaining, non-sensitive portions to be executed more efficiently. In our framework, UBQC-protected sections output quantum states that are encrypted via bit-flip and phase-flip operations, and we devise a mechanism based on selective X and Z gate corrections to seamlessly interface these with unprotected sections. We provide a security analysis demonstrating that our selective UBQC approach preserves universality, correctness, and blindness, and we illustrate its practical advantages through an application to Grover's algorithm. This work paves the way for more efficient and practical secure quantum computing on near-term devices.

TI Efficient Implementation of Discrete-Time Quantum Walks on Quantum
   Computers
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum walks have proven to be a universal model for quantum computation and to provide speed-up in certain quantum algorithms. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, among others, is one of the most suitable candidates for circuit implementation due to its discrete nature. Current implementations, however, are usually characterized by quantum circuits of large size and depth, which leads to a higher computational cost and severely limits the number of time steps that can be reliably implemented on current quantum computers. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable quantum circuit implementing the DTQW on the 2n-cycle based on the diagonalization of the conditional shift operator. For t time steps of the DTQW, the proposed circuit requires only O(n2+nt) two-qubit gates compared to the O(n2t) of the current most efficient implementation based on quantum Fourier transforms. We test the proposed circuit on an IBM quantum device for a Hadamard DTQW on the 4-cycle and 8-cycle characterized by periodic dynamics and by recurrent generation of maximally entangled single-particle states. Experimental results are meaningful well beyond the regime of few time steps, paving the way for reliable implementation and use on quantum computers.

TI Mutual Information and Quantum Discord in Quantum State Discrimination
   with a Fixed Rate of Inconclusive Outcomes
SO ENTROPY
AB We studied the mutual information and quantum discord that Alice and Bob share when Bob implements a discrimination with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes (FRIO) onto two pure non-orthogonal quantum states, generated with arbitrary a priori probabilities. FRIO discrimination interpolates between minimum error (ME) and unambiguous state discrimination (UD). ME and UD are well known discrimination protocols with several applications in quantum information theory. FRIO discrimination provides a more general framework where the discrimination process together with its applications can be studied. In this setting, we compared the performance of optimum probability of discrimination, mutual information, and quantum discord. We found that the accessible information is obtained when Bob implements the ME strategy. The most (least) efficient discrimination scheme is ME (UD), from the point of view of correlations that are lost in the initial state and remain in the final state, after Bob's measurement.

TI Artificial Intelligence in Quantum Communications: A Comprehensive
   Survey
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the field of quantum communication has emerged in recent years as a promising avenue for enhancing secure data transmission, error correction, and scalability in quantum networks. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of AI applications in quantum communication, with a focus on machine learning (ML) models such as neural networks and reinforcement learning, which are adapted to manage complex quantum challenges. Despite the growing body of research, current studies often concentrate on specific AI techniques or quantum applications, lacking a unified framework that evaluates their practical effectiveness, scalability, and cost-efficiency. Addressing this gap, our survey systematically reviews and categorizes AI-driven methodologies across core aspects like system security, transmission speed, and reliability. Through a critical comparison and ranking of existing techniques, this study identifies best practices and key advancements while highlighting areas requiring further exploration. By providing an in-depth analysis of AI's potential to transform quantum communication, this paper aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop resilient, adaptive, and economically viable quantum communication systems.

AB Quantum computing opens up new possibilities for the simulation of many-body nuclear systems. As the number of particles in a many-body system increases, the size of the space if the associated Hamiltonian increases exponentially. This presents a challenge when performing calculations on large systems when using classical computing methods. By using a quantum computer, one may be able to overcome this difficulty thanks to the exponential way the Hilbert space of a quantum computer grows with the number of quantum bits (qubits). Our aim is to develop quantum computing algorithms which can reproduce and predict nuclear structure such as level schemes and level densities. As a sample Hamiltonian, we use the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. We use an efficient encoding of the Hamiltonian onto many-qubit systems, and have developed an algorithm allowing the full excitation spectrum of a nucleus to be determined with a variational algorithm capable of implementation on today's quantum computers with a limited number of qubits. Our algorithm uses the variance of the Hamiltonian, < H-2 >- < H >(2), as a cost function for the widely-used variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). In this work we present a variance based method of finding the excited state spectrum of a small nuclear system using a quantum computer, using a reduced-qubit encoding method.

TI Simulated annealing method in variational quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE STUDY OF CLUSTERS NANOSTRUCTURES
   AND NANOMATERIALS
AB Variational quantum algorithms are the only quantum algorithms that are currently used in hybrid quantum-classical devices to solve rather practical than modelling problems in condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and machine learning. In this paper, a new variational quantum algorithm is analysed in detail, implemented in codes and tested. Its distinctive feature is the use of the simulated annealing algorithm to minimize the objective function (energy) as well as a new type of unitary ansatz with multi-qubit interaction. The quantum part of the algorithm is emulated on a classical computer, and the efficiency of the algorithm is estimated by the number of iterations. To test the algorithm, we choose the problem of finding the ground state of the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule at the equilibrium distance between protons. The Hamiltonian in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is modeled by the Hamiltonian of a 4-qubit system in the Pauli basis. The universal ansatz for the problem is constructed taking into account the symmetry of the Hamiltonian as a composition of the exponentials of Pauli operators. It depends on 4 parameters, and the corresponding energy has twelve local minima. The algorithm, implemented as a modular program in Python using both the direct annealing method and the dual_annealing function of the Sci-py library, showed high efficiency in comparison with the algorithm based on the standard ansatz and the gradient descent method.

TI Assessing a binary quantum channel exploiting a silicon photomultiplier

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In quantum communication protocols, the use of photon-number-resolving detectors could open new perspectives by broadening the way to encode and decode information and merging the properties of discrete and continuous variables. In this work, we consider a quantum channel exploiting a silicon-photomultiplier-based receiver and evaluate its performance for quantum communication protocols under three possible configurations, defined by different post- processing of the detection outcomes. We investigate two scenarios: information transmission over the channel, quantified by the mutual information, and continuous-variable quantum key distribution, quantified by the key generation rate. The preliminary results encourage further use of this detection scheme in extended networks. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.

TI Generalization of Quantum Machine Learning Models Using Quantum Fisher
   Information Metric
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Generalization is the ability of machine learning models to make accurate predictions on new data by learning from training data. However, understanding generalization of quantum machine learning models has been a major challenge. Here, we introduce the data quantum Fisher information metric (DQFIM). It describes the capacity of variational quantum algorithms depending on variational ansatz, training data, and their symmetries. We apply the DQFIM to quantify circuit parameters and training data needed to successfully train and generalize. Using the dynamical Lie algebra, we explain how to generalize using a low number of training states. Counterintuitively, breaking symmetries of the training data can help to improve generalization. Finally, we find that out-of-distribution generalization, where training and testing data are drawn from different data distributions, can be better than using the same distribution. Our work provides a useful framework to explore the power of quantum machine learning models.

AB Hybrid authenticated key exchange combines cryptography key material from different sources (classical, quantum and post-quantum cryptography) to build protocols that are resilient to catastrophic failures, technology advances and future cryptanalytic attacks. In this work, we propose and implement a triple-hybrid version of the transport layer security network protocol TLS 1.3, combining classical and post-quantum cryptography, and quantum key distribution. We evaluate the performance of this triple-hybrid TLS in an experimental network scenario and our analysis shows that the quantum-resistant feature comes at an increased communication cost of approximately 68% over the total time of the composite handshakes. In exchange, our solution is an enhancement to the TLS 1.3 protocol by adding quantum-resistant cryptography schemes.

TI Creation of Two-Mode Squeezed States in Atomic Mechanical Oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Two-mode squeezed states, which are entangled states with bipartite quantum correlations in continuous variable systems, are crucial in quantum information processing and metrology. Recently, continuous variable quantum computing with the vibrational modes of trapped atoms has emerged with significant progress, featuring a high degree of control in hybridizing with spin qubits. Creating two-mode squeezed states in such a platform could enable applications that are only viable with photons. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two-mode squeezed states by employing atoms in a two-dimensional optical lattice as quantum registers. The states are generated by a controlled projection conditioned on the relative phase of two independent squeezed states. The individual squeezing is created by sudden jumps of the oscillators' frequencies, allowing generating of the two-mode squeezed states at a rate within a fraction of the oscillation frequency. We validate the states by entanglement steering criteria and Fock state analysis. Our results can be applied in other mechanical oscillators for quantum sensing and continuous-variable quantum information.

In addition, we delve into the core principles of QML and illustrate its transformative potential in accelerating material discovery through a range of quantum simulations and innovative adaptations. The review also highlights advanced active learning strategies that integrate quantum artificial intelligence, offering a more efficient pathway to explore the vast, complex material design space. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future opportunities for QML in material design, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize the field and facilitate groundbreaking innovations.

TI Performance of Planar Floquet Codes with Majorana-Based Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction is crucial for any quantum computing platform to achieve truly scalable quan-tum computation. The surface code and its variants have been considered the most promising quantum error correction scheme due to their high threshold, low overhead, and relatively simple structure that can naturally be implemented in many existing qubit architectures, such as superconducting qubits. The recent development of Floquet codes by Hastings and Haah offers another promising approach. By going beyond the usual paradigm of stabilizer codes, Floquet codes achieve similar performance while being constructed entirely from two-qubit measurements. This makes them particularly suitable for platforms where two-qubit measurements can be implemented directly, such as the measurement-only topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) proposed by Karzig et al. Here, we explain how two vari-ants of Floquet codes can be implemented on MZM-based architectures without any auxiliary qubits for syndrome measurement and with shallow syndrome-extraction sequences. We then numerically demon-strate their favorable performance. In particular, we show that they improve the threshold for scalable quantum computation in MZM-based systems by an order of magnitude and significantly reduce space and time overheads below threshold.

SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB By using the non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion method, the non-Markovian dynamics of entanglement, quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation in the spin chain system with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-wohlman-Aharony interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya in-teractions are studied. In particular, the joint ef-fects of Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-wohlman-Aharony interactions and different external magnetic fields are dis-cussed under zero and finite temperatures, respectively. The results show that the concurrence, channel capacity of quantum dense coding and average fidelity of quantum teleportation can be effectively increased via the increasing of Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-wohlman-Aharony interactions along the z-direction which can be attributed to the constructive role of Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-wohlman-Aharony interactions on the O(3) invariance in the spin chain. Non-uniform magnetic fields with the combination of Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-wohlman-Aharony interactions are found to be more effective in the increasing of the parameters under discussion.

AB Supply chain planning is a complex optimization problem that involves the coordination of multiple resources in order to reduce costs and maximize benefit. In this study, we propose a QUBO formulation for the scheduling of the transportation of materials to a factory with uncertain arrival times. The standard methods like network flow or MILP solvers escalate exponentially with the problem parameters, making computation times grow rapidly. Quantum annealing is a candidate for an optimization poccess that can solve this computationally intense problems, and thus it is important to be able to find compatible formulations. The model proposed makes use of the QUBO formulation to give optimal solutions to the scheduling with unceratinty. We will establish the problem from a stochastic optimization point of view, and then build a hamiltonian that encodes it, following the QUBO formulation. With the quick increase in qubit numbers of quantum computers, this model seems like a promising tool that will provide solutions to very relevant and computionally hard problems in the near future.

TI QGOpt: Riemannian optimization for quantum technologies
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Many theoretical problems in quantum technology can be formulated and addressed as constrained optimization problems. The most common quantum mechanical constraints such as, e.g., orthogonality of isometric and unitary matrices, CPTP property of quantum channels, and conditions on density matrices, can be seen as quotient or embedded Riemannian manifolds. This allows to use Riemannian optimization techniques for solving quantum-mechanical constrained optimization problems. In the present work, we introduce QGOpt, the library for constrained optimization in quantum technology. QGOpt relies on the underlying Riemannian structure of quantum-mechanical constraints and permits application of standard gradient based optimization methods while preserving quantum mechanical constraints. Moreover, QGOpt is written on top of TensorFlow, which enables automatic differentiation to calculate necessary gradients for optimization. We show two application examples: quantum gate decomposition and quantum tomography.

TI Enhanced Lightweight Quantum Key Distribution Protocol for Improved
   Efficiency and Security
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides secure communication by leveraging quantum mechanics, with the BB84 protocol being one of its most widely adopted implementations. However, the classical post-processing steps in BB84, such as sifting, error correction, and key verification, often result in significant communication overhead, limiting its efficiency and scalability. In this work, we propose three key optimizations for BB84: (1) PRNG-based predetermined key bit positioning, which eliminates redundant bit exchanges during sifting, (2) hash-based subsequence comparison, enabling lightweight and efficient key verification, and (3) adaptive basis reconciliation, which minimizes the communication costs associated with basis matching. The proposed optimizations achieve a 50% reduction in communication overhead for large key sizes compared to traditional QKD protocols, as demonstrated through rigorous performance analysis. While the focus of this work is on the BB84 protocol, these optimizations are also directly applicable to a broader class of Discrete-Variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols, such as six-state, B92, and E91, which share a fundamentally similar post-processing structure. This generality highlights the modularity and adaptability of the proposed methods across diverse QKD implementations. The proposed optimizations enhance post-processing efficiency and scalability, enabling practical deployment in bandwidth-limited environments like IoT networks, secure financial systems, and defense communications, thereby supporting broader adoption of quantum communication systems.

TI Increasing Quantum Correlations Based on Measurement-Induced Disturbance
   via a Swapping Procedure with Two-Qubit Mixed States
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, quantum correlation (QC) swapping for certain separable two-qubit mixed states is treated. A QC quantifier, measurement-induced disturbance (MID) (Luo in Phys Rev A 77:022301, 2008), is employed to characterize and quantify QCs in the relevant states. Properties of all QCs in the swapping process are revealed. Particularly, it is found that MID can be increased through QC swapping for certain separable two-qubit mixed states.

TI Vibronic spectra of molecules - an experiment with a quantum computer
   simulator
SO ANNALES MATHEMATICAE ET INFORMATICAE
AB In addition to the exciting fundamental questions of quantum computing and implementation possibilities of quantum computers, it is important to look for application areas of quantum computing, to point out practical cases which justify the need for this technology. Besides the wellknown qubit-based quantum computers, there are also devices based on other foundations that can surpass the capabilities of classical computers. Among these, devices operating on the basis of boson sampling have a naturally occurring application: the approximate calculation of the vibrational spectrum of molecules. Two separate research groups, Huh et al. [14] and Wang et al. [22] created quantum simulators based on boson sampling, which were successfully used to calculate the transition probabilities between specific states of small molecules. Following the methodology found in these two articles, this paper presents how the calculations of transition probabilities can be performed on a classical computer using a quantum computer simulator which is based on Gaussian boson sampling.

TI A general quantum algorithm for numerical integration
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum algorithms have shown their superiority in many application fields. However, a general quantum algorithm for numerical integration, an indispensable tool for processing sophisticated science and engineering issues, is still missing. Here, we first proposed a quantum integration algorithm suitable for any continuous functions that can be approximated by polynomials. More impressively, the algorithm achieves quantum encoding of any integrable functions through polynomial approximation, then constructs a quantum oracle to mark the number of points in the integration area and finally converts the statistical results into the phase angle in the amplitude of the superposition state. The quantum algorithm introduced in this work exhibits quadratic acceleration over the classical integration algorithms by reducing computational complexity from O(N) to O(root N). Our work addresses the crucial impediments for improving the generality of quantum integration algorithm, which provides a meaningful guidance for expanding the superiority of quantum computing.

TI Teleportation and Entanglement Swapping of Continuous Quantum Variables
   of Microwave Radiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum communication is needed to build powerful quantum computers and establish reliable quantum networks. At its basis lies the ability to generate and distribute entanglement to separate quantum systems, which can be used to run remote quantum operations on them or teleport quantum states from one system to another with the help of classical channels. To this end, it is useful to harness the resource of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement, since it can be efficiently and unconditionally produced by squeezing light in a nonlinear medium and can be easily manipulated, distributed, and measured using standard components. While various aspects of CV-based quantum communication have been successfully demonstrated in the optical domain, some key capabilities, such as entanglement swapping, have been lacking in the microwave domain. Here, we demonstrate three key elements of CV-based microwave quantum communication: (i) a Josephson mixer operating as a nondegenerate two-mode entangler with maximum measured logarithmic negativity EN = 1.5, (ii) a quantum teleportation apparatus, capable of teleporting vacuum and coherent states with a maximum fidelity of 73%, which exceeds the 50% classical limit and is mainly limited by intermediate losses in the setup, and (iii) an entanglement-swapping system which generates entanglement between two remote noninteracting modes via entanglement-swapping operations applied to input vacuum and coherent states with maximum measured logarithmic negativity EN = 0.53. Such hardware-efficient CV entanglement building blocks that are based on nondegenerate Josephson mixers could enable wide-ranging applications in modular quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.

TI Lipkin model on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Atomic nuclei are important laboratories for exploring and testing new insights into the universe, such as experiments to directly detect dark matter or explore properties of neutrinos. The targets of interest are often heavy, complex nuclei that challenge our ability to reliably model them (as well as quantify the uncertainty of those models) with classical computers. Hence there is great interest in applying quantum computation to nuclear structure for these applications. As an early step in this direction, especially with regards to the uncertainties in the relevant quantum calculations, we develop circuits to implement variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms for the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which is often used in the nuclear physics community as a testbed for many-body methods. We present quantum circuits for VQE for two and three particles and discuss the construction of circuits for more particles. Implementing the VQE for a two-particle system on the IBM Quantum Experience, we identify initialization and two-qubit gates as the largest sources of error. We find that error mitigation procedures reduce the errors in the results significantly, but additional quantum hardware improvements are needed for quantum calculations to be sufficiently accurate to be competitive with the best current classical methods.

AB In recent years, near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computing devices have become available. One of the most promising application areas to leverage such NISQ quantum computer prototypes is quantum machine learning. While quantum neural networks are widely studied for supervised learning, quantum reinforcement learning is still just an emerging field of this area. To solve a classical continuous control problem, we used continuous-variable quantum machine learning. We introduce proximal policy optimization for photonic variational quantum agents and also study the effect of the data re-uploading. We present performance assessment via empirical study using Strawberry Fields, a photonic simulator Fock backend and a hybrid training framework connected to an OpenAI Gym environment and TensorFlow. For the restricted CartPole problem, the two variations of the photonic policy learning achieve comparable performance levels and a faster convergence than the baseline classical neural network of same number of trainable parameters.

TI Timing Constraints Imposed by Classical Digital Control Systems on
   Photonic Implementations of Measurement-Based Quantum Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Most of the architectural research on photonic implementations of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) has focused on the quantum resources involved in the problem with the implicit assumption that these will provide the main constraints on system scaling. However, the "flying-qubit" architecture of photonic MBQC requires specific timing constraints that need to be met by the classical control system. This classical control includes, for example, the amplification of the signals from single-photon detectors to voltage levels compatible with digital systems; the implementation of a control system which converts measurement outcomes into basis settings for measuring subsequent cluster qubits, in accordance with the quantum algorithm being implemented; and the digital-to-analog converter and amplifier systems required to set these measurement bases using a fast phase modulator. In this article, we analyze the digital system needed to implement arbitrary one-qubit rotations and controlled-not gates in discrete-variable photonic MBQC, in the presence of an ideal cluster state generator, with the main aim of understanding the timing constraints imposed by the digital logic on the analog system and quantum hardware. We have verified the design using functional simulations and have used static timing analysis of a Xilinx field-programmable gate array (7 series) to provide a practical upper bound on the speed at which the adaptive measurement processing can be performed, in turn constraining the photonic clock rate of the system. The design and testing system is freely available for use as the basis of analysis of more complex designs, incorporating more recent proposals for photonic quantum computing. Our work points to the importance of codesigning the classical control system in tandem with the quantum system in order to meet the challenging specifications of a photonic quantum computer.

TI C3-VQA: Cryogenic Counter-Based Coprocessor for Variational Quantum
   Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Cryogenic quantum computers play a leading role in demonstrating quantum advantage. Given the severe constraints on the cooling capacity in cryogenic environments, thermal design is crucial for the scalability of these computers. The sources of heat dissipation include passive inflow via intertemperature wires and the power consumption of components located in the cryostat, such as wire amplifiers and quantum-classical interfaces. Thus, a critical challenge is to reduce the number of wires by reducing the required intertemperature bandwidth while maintaining minimal additional power consumption in the cryostat. One solution to address this challenge is near-data processing using ultralow-power computational logic within the cryostat. Based on the workload analysis and domain-specific system design focused on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), we propose the cryogenic counter-based coprocessor for VQAs (C3-VQA) to enhance the design scalability of cryogenic quantum computers under the thermal constraint. The C3-VQA utilizes single-flux-quantum logic, which is an ultralow-power superconducting digital circuit that operates at the 4 K environment. The C3-VQA precomputes a part of the expectation value calculations for VQAs and buffers intermediate values using simple bit operation units and counters in the cryostat, thereby reducing the required intertemperature bandwidth with small additional power consumption. Consequently, the C3-VQA reduces the number of wires, leading to a reduction in the total heat dissipation in the cryostat. Our evaluation shows that the C3-VQA reduces the total heat dissipation at the 4 K stage by 30% and 81% under sequential-shot and parallel-shot execution scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, a case study in quantum chemistry shows that the C3-VQA reduces total heat dissipation by 87% with a 10 000-qubit system.

TI Efficient quantum simulation of electron-phonon systems by variational
   basis state encoder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Digital quantum simulation of electron-phonon systems requires truncating infinite phonon levels into N basis states and then encoding them with qubit computational basis. Unary encoding and binary encoding are the two most representative encoding schemes, which demand O(N ) and O(log N) qubits as well as O(N ) and O(N log N) quantum gates, respectively. In this paper, we propose a variational basis state encoding algorithm that reduces the scaling of the number of qubits and quantum gates to both O(1) for systems obeying the area law of entanglement entropy. The cost for the scaling reduction is a constant amount of additional measurement. The accuracy and efficiency of the approach are verified by both numerical simulation and realistic quantum hardware experiments. In particular, we find using one or two qubits for each phonon mode is sufficient to produce quantitatively correct results across weak and strong coupling regimes. Our approach paves the way for practical quantum simulation of electron-phonon systems on both near-term hardware and error-corrected quantum computers.

TI Quantum simulation of Maxwell's equations via Schrödingerisation
SO ESAIM-MATHEMATICAL MODELLING AND NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
AB We present quantum algorithms for electromagnetic fields governed by Maxwell's equations. The algorithms are based on the Schr & ouml;dingerisation approach, which transforms any linear PDEs and ODEs with non-unitary dynamics into a system evolving under unitary dynamics, via a warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. In this paper, our quantum algorithms are based on either a direct approximation of Maxwell's equations combined with Yee's algorithm, or a matrix representation in terms of Riemann-Silberstein vectors combined with a spectral approach and an upwind scheme. We implement these algorithms with physical boundary conditions, including perfect conductor and impedance boundaries. We also solve Maxwell's equations for a linear inhomogeneous medium, specifically the interface problem. Several numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the validity of this approach. In addition, instead of qubits, the quantum algorithms can also be formulated in the continuous variable quantum framework, which allows the quantum simulation of Maxwell's equations in analog quantum simulation.

TI A SECURE METHOD OF COMMUNICATION THROUGH BB84 PROTOCOL IN QUANTUM KEY
   DISTRIBUTION
SO SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
AB Security awareness is one of the most pressing topics in today's globe. The idea of cryptography is introduced when the subject is information security. Conventional cryptography-based security techniques rely on the presumption that keys are shared before secure connections. The most crucial factor to consider when integrating cryptographic operations into account when integrating cryptographic operations in with any system is the safe key management strategy required for sending and transferring a secret key between two entities The systems will be vulnerable to bugs and possibly fatal external assaults if the fundamental management methods are poor A method for securely encrypting data sent between parties is quantum cryptography. and spotting eavesdroppers trying to overhear the conversation. Quantum cryptography may be the solution to these issues a quantum cryptography application, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), refers to the production of a cryptographic key with unconditional security assured by physical rules. Quantum cryptography is a kind of encryption. We examine the quantum key exchange protocol (BB84 protocol) in this study and the way that it significantly improves data transfer security when compared to standard encryption techniques. The main objective of quantum cryptography is to offer a trustworthy way to provide a secure method of communication between the intended peers only and to detect the Eavesdropper presence.

TI Generalized isometric tensor based quantum key distribution protocols of
   squeezed multiphoton entangled states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Isometric tensor offers a novel and powerful tool that can compress an entangled state into its tensor network state (TNS). The resulting quantum compression provides a new opportunity for enhancing quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. The main idea explored in this work is to use the quantum compression to improve the efficiency of QKD. In a nut-shell, a collection of any multi-photon entangled states that carry encoded classical bits is compressed into a single-photon state before the corresponding photon is sent to the receiver that measures the qubit and decompresses it. In this paper, we first show how to obtain the generalized isometric tensors for compressing any entangled states and their inverse isometric tensors for decompression. In our proposed QKD protocol, the input state consists of any multi-photon entangled states, which are first compressed into a single-photon state vertical bar 0 > or vertical bar 1 > or Bell states by the sender Alice. A sequence of single-photon states and and one photon from the Bell state mixed with decoy qubits is sent to the receiver Bob via a quantum channel. Bob obtains the final sifted compressed states vertical bar 0 > and vertical bar 1 > and conjugate transpose of the isometric tensors. Using our protocols, Bob can decompress the received states vertical bar 0 > and vertical bar 1 > into original entangled states. Since quantum processors that are used to send quantum information between nodes are relatively primitive and low in power and the preparation of many-photon entanglement is relatively difficult at present, finding suitable protocols for the compression of transmitted quantum data brings important practical benefits. More generally, the quantum information theory primarily investigates quantum data manipulation under locality constraints, so our protocols connect naturally to these investigations. Our protocols increase the encoding capacity of QKD protocols. Not only our proposed processes of compression and decompression are very simple, but also entanglement compression using isometric tensors can be implemented by using quantum circuits and current technology. Because many ideas for designing of quantum information processing equipment envision that a network composed of relatively small quantum processors sending quantum information between nodes, it is greatly significant to find appropriate protocols for compressing the transmitted quantum data.

TI Quantum Simulation of Variable-Speed Multidimensional Wave Equations via
   Clifford-Assisted Pauli Decomposition
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The simulation of multidimensional wave propagation with variable material parameters is a computationally intensive task, with applications from seismology to electromagnetics. While quantum computers offer a promising path forward, their algorithms are often analyzed in the abstract oracle model, which can mask the high gate-level complexity of implementing those oracles. We present a framework for constructing a quantum algorithm for the multidimensional wave equation with a variable speed profile. The core of our method is a decomposition of the system Hamiltonian into sets of mutually commuting Pauli strings, paired with a dedicated diagonalization procedure that uses Clifford gates to minimize simulation cost. Within this framework, we derive explicit bounds on the number of quantum gates required for Trotter-Suzuki-based simulation. Our analysis reveals significant computational savings for structured block-model speed profiles compared to general cases. Numerical experiments in three dimensions confirm the practical viability and performance of our approach. Beyond providing a concrete, gate-level algorithm for an important class of wave problems, the techniques introduced here for Hamiltonian decomposition and diagonalization enrich the general toolbox of quantum simulation.

TI Leakage Benchmarking for Universal Gate Sets
SO ENTROPY
AB Errors are common issues in quantum computing platforms, among which leakage is one of the most-challenging to address. This is because leakage, i.e., the loss of information stored in the computational subspace to undesired subspaces in a larger Hilbert space, is more difficult to detect and correct than errors that preserve the computational subspace. As a result, leakage presents a significant obstacle to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate benchmarking framework called leakage randomized benchmarking (LRB), for measuring leakage rates on multi-qubit quantum systems. Our approach is more insensitive to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) noise than existing leakage benchmarking protocols, requires fewer assumptions about the gate set itself, and can be used to benchmark multi-qubit leakages, which has not been achieved previously. We also extended the LRB protocol to an interleaved variant called interleaved LRB (iLRB), which can benchmark the average leakage rate of generic n-site quantum gates with reasonable noise assumptions. We demonstrate the iLRB protocol on benchmarking generic two-qubit gates realized using flux tuning and analyzed the behavior of iLRB under corresponding leakage models. Our numerical experiments showed good agreement with the theoretical estimations, indicating the feasibility of both the LRB and iLRB protocols.

TI Quantum Uncertainties and Holism Seem to Render Irrelevant
   Qudit-Semantics
SO ENTROPY
AB We consider a semantics based on the peculiar holistic features of the quantum formalism. Any formula of the language gives rise to a quantum circuit that transforms the density operator associated to the formula into the density operator associated to the atomic subformulas in a reversible way. The procedure goes from the whole to the parts against the compositionality-principle and gives rise to a semantic characterization for a new form of quantum logic that has been called "Lukasiewicz quantum computational logic". It is interesting to compare the logic based on qubit-semantics with that on qudit-semantics. Having in mind the relationships between classical logic and Lukasiewicz-many valued logics, one could expect that the former is stronger than the fragment of the latter. However, this is not the case. From an intuitive point of view, this can be explained by recalling that the former is a very weak form of logic. Many important logical arguments, which are valid either in Birkhoff and von Neumann's quantum logic or in classical logic, are generally violated.

TI Optomechanics for quantum technologies
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Interaction with light can be used to precisely control motional states. This Review surveys recent progress in the preparation of non-classical mechanical states and in the application of optomechanical platforms to specific tasks in quantum technology.
   The ability to control the motion of mechanical systems through interaction with light has opened the door to a plethora of applications in fundamental and applied physics. With experiments routinely reaching the quantum regime, the focus has now turned towards creating and exploiting interesting non-classical states of motion and entanglement in optomechanical systems. Quantumness has also shifted from being the very reason why experiments are constructed to becoming a resource for the investigation of fundamental physics and the creation of quantum technologies. Here, by focusing on opto- and electromechanical platforms we review recent progress in quantum state preparation and entanglement of mechanical systems, together with applications to signal processing and transduction, quantum sensing and topological physics, as well as small-scale thermodynamics.

TI Generation of quantum entanglement in superposed diamond spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A comprehensive study integrating the microscopic structure of spacetime and the principle of quantum superposition is capable of offering a fundamental bottom-up approach for understanding the quantum aspect of gravity. In this paper, we present a framework for the superposition of spacetime structures in the causal diamond spacetime and analyze the behavior of quantum entanglement generated by spacetime superposition from the perspective of relativistic quantum information. For the first time, we combine the concept of spacetime superposition with causal diamonds and derive the analytical expression of the Unruh-diamond vacuum state for Dirac fields in the causal diamond spacetime. Based on this, we analyze both initially correlated and uncorrelated modes in superposed and classical causal diamond spacetimes, and quantifying how quantum thermal effects arising from spacetime structure alter entanglement. Our findings reveal that quantum entanglement degrades in classical diamond spacetime, while the superposed structure generates additional entanglement resources between modes in superposed diamond spacetimes. From a quantum information perspective, our results suggest that the characteristics of spacetime structural manifestations can serve as valuable resources for performing quantum information processing tasks.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider entanglement distillation with noisy operations in which quantum measurements that constitute a general quantum operation are particularly noisy. We present a protocol for purifying noisy measurements and show that imperfect local operations can distill entanglement. The protocol works for arbitrary noisy measurements in general and is cost-effective and resource-efficient with single additional qubit per party to resolve the distillation of entanglement. The purification protocol is feasible with currently available quantum technologies and readily applied to entanglement applications.

TI Optimizing the optimizer: decomposition techniques for quantum annealing
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Although quantum computing hardware has evolved significantly in recent years, spurred by increasing industrial and government interest, the size limitation of current generation quantum computers remains an obstacle when applying these devices to relevant, real-world problems. In order to effectively exploit the potential benefits of quantum computing, heterogeneous approaches that combine both classical and quantum computing techniques are needed. In this work, we explore multiple heterogeneous algorithms for solving a variety of industry-relevant benchmark problems in order to understand how best to leverage quantum computers given current constraints. Our results indicate the following: (1) that solver performance is highly dependent on the structure (size and edge density) of the problem graph; (2) that reusing a single fixed problem embedding, as opposed to dynamically searching for problem embeddings, is key to avoiding computational bottlenecks; (3) that solutions of better quality are produced by algorithms that iteratively propagate the influence that solving an individual sub-problem has to the remainder of the larger problem; and (4) that the Qbsolv algorithm (which implements the aforementioned techniques) is, at this time, the state-of-the-art in producing quality solutions, in a timely fashion, to a variety of theoretical and real-world problems too large to directly embed onto a quantum annealing device.

TI 3D topological quantum computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we will present some ideas to use 3D topology for quantum computing extending ideas from a previous paper. Topological quantum computing used "knotted" quantum states of topological phases of matter, called anyons. But anyons are connected with surface topology. But surfaces have (usually) abelian fundamental groups and therefore one needs non-Abelian anyons to use it for quantum computing. But usual materials are 3D objects which can admit more complicated topologies. Here, complements of knots do play a prominent role and are in principle the main parts to understand 3-manifold topology. For that purpose, we will construct a quantum system on the complements of a knot in the 3-sphere (see T. Asselmeyer-Maluga, Quantum Rep. 3 (2021) 153, arXiv:2102.04452 for previous work). The whole system is designed as knotted superconductor, where every crossing is a Josephson junction and the qubit is realized as flux qubit. We discuss the properties of this systems in particular the fluxion quantization by using the A-polynomial of the knot. Furthermore, we showed that 2-qubit operations can be realized by linked (knotted) superconductors again coupled via a Josephson junction.

TI Robust Dequantization of the Quantum Singular Value Transformation and
   Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms
SO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
AB Several quantum algorithms for linear algebra problems, and in particular quantum machine learning problems, have been "dequantized" in the past few years. These dequantization results typically hold when classical algorithms can access the data via length-squared sampling. This assumption, which is standard in the field of randomized linear algebra, means that for a unit-norm vector u is an element of C-n, we can sample from the distribution p(u):{1,& mldr;,n}->[0,1] defined as p(u)(i)=|u(i)|(2) for each i is an element of{1,& mldr;,n}. Since this distribution corresponds to the distribution obtained by measuring the quantum state |u> in the computational basis, length-squared sampling access gives a reasonable classical analogue to the kind of quantum access considered in many quantum algorithms for linear algebra problems. In this work we investigate how robust these dequantization results are. We introduce the notion of approximate length-squared sampling, where classical algorithms are only able to sample from a distribution close to the ideal distribution in total variation distance. While quantum algorithms are natively robust against small perturbations, current techniques in dequantization are not. Our main technical contribution is showing how many techniques from randomized linear algebra can be adapted to work under this weaker assumption as well. We then use these techniques to show that the recent low-rank dequantization framework by Chia, Gilyen, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (JACM 2022) and the dequantization framework for sparse matrices by Gharibian and Le Gall (STOC 2022), which are both based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation, can be generalized to the case of approximate length-squared sampling access to the input. We also apply these results to obtain a robust dequantization of many quantum machine learning algorithms, including quantum algorithms for recommendation systems, supervised clustering and low-rank matrix inversion.

TI Research progress of integrated quantum light sources with orbital
   angular momentum
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum light sources are one of key devices for quantum information processing, and they are also the important foundation for applications such as in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum simulation. Improving the capacity of quantum information coding by using the quantum light source is a major challenge in the development of quantum information technology. Photons with a helical phase front can carry a discrete, unlimited but quantized amount of orbital angular momentum (OAM). The infinite number of states with different OAMs can greatly increase the capacity of optical communication and information processing in quantum regimes. To date photons carrying OAM have mainly been generated by using bulk crystals, which limits the efficiency and the scalability of the source. With the advancement of quantum photonic technology, many significant quantum photonic devices can now be realized on integrated chips. However, creating high- dimensional OAM quantum states at a micro-nano scale is still a challenge. And the research of harnessing high-dimensional OAM mode by using integrated quantum photonic technologies is still in its infancy. Here, the authors review the recent progress and discuss the integrated quantum light sources with OAM. The authors introduce the research progress of using OAM for both single photons and entangled photons and emphasize the exciting work on pushing boundaries in high-dimensional quantum states. This may pave the way for the research and practical applications of high-dimensional quantum light sources.

Recent advances revolve around the use of quantum machine learning, which promises to revolutionize program computation and boost software systems' problem-solving capabilities. However, using quantum computing technologies is not trivial and requires interdisciplinary skills and expertise. For such a reason, we propose QUANTUMOONLIGHT, a community-based low-code platform that allows researchers and practitioners to configure and experiment with quantum machine learning pipelines, compare them with classic machine learning algorithms, and share lessons learned and experience reports.

TI Recovering quantum entanglement after its certification
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Entanglement is a crucial quantum resource with broad applications in quantum information science. For harnessing entanglement in practice, it is a prerequisite to certify the entanglement of a given quantum state. However, the certification process itself destroys the entanglement, thereby precluding further exploitation of the entanglement. Resolving this conflict, here, we present a protocol that certifies the entanglement of a quantum state without complete destruction and then probabilistically recovers the original entanglement to provide useful entanglement for further quantum applications. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol in a photonic quantum system and highlight its usefulness for selecting high-quality entanglement from a realistic entanglement source. Moreover, our study reveals various trade-off relations among the physical quantities involved in the protocol. Our results show how entanglement certification can be made compatible with subsequent quantum applications and be beneficial to sort entanglement for better performance in quantum technologies.

TI Quantum sensing from gravity as a universal dephasing channel for qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the interaction of a transmon qubit with a classical gravitational field. Exploiting the generic phenomena of the gravitational redshift and Aharonov-Bohm phase, we show that entangled quantum states dephase with a universal rate. The gravitational phase shift is expressed in terms of a quantum computing noise channel. We give a measurement protocol based on a modified phase estimation algorithm which is linear in the phase drift, which is optimal for measuring the small phase that is acquired from the gravitation channel. Additionally, we propose qubit-based platforms as quantum sensors for precision gravitometers and mechanical strain gauges as an example of this phenomenon's utility. We estimate a sensitivity for measuring the local gravitational acceleration to be delta g/g similar to 10-7. This paper demonstrates that classical gravitation has a nontrivial influence on quantum computing hardware and provides an illustration of how quantum computing hardware may be utilized for purposes other than computation. While we focus on superconducting qubits, we point to the universal nature of gravitational phase effects for all quantum platforms.

TI Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in
   two-dimensional layouts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for engineering scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on postoperation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum-dot architectures.

TI On the integration of quantum machine learning into hybrid frameworks
   for high energy particle physics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB In this study, the potential of quantum machine learning (QML) techniques based on trainable quantum circuits was explored for vector boson identification at the large hadron collider (LHC). Specifically, the compact muon solenoid (CMS) experiment dataset was employed to reconstruct the Z boson through the muon-antimuon (mu+mu-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mu <^>{+}\mu <^>{-}$$\end{document}) decay channel using variational quantum circuits (VQC). To examine the effect of data structure on QML performance, various preprocessing strategies were applied, including different train/test splits, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and class balancing techniques. The dataset was evaluated under two train/test configurations, namely a balanced split (70:30) and an imbalanced split (80:20), in order to examine the effect of class distribution on QML outcomes. Feature selection based on Random Forest (RF) was used to extract the most informative variables, while principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to reduce input dimensionality and optimize qubit usage. To mitigate class imbalance, resampling techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), SMOTE combined with edited nearest neighbors (SMOTEENN), and SMOTE with Tomek Links (SMOTETomek) were implemented. A comparative evaluation using stratified cross-validation was conducted to assess model performance and generalization ability across different configurations. The findings indicated that integrating PCA with resampling methods substantially improves the generalization capacity of the VQC model, especially in imbalanced settings. Among all configurations, SMOTE and SMOTEENN delivered the highest classification performance, boosting sensitivity to the minority class and enhancing model stability. These results highlight the significance of data structure, feature reduction, and resampling in classical quantum (CQ) data processing for high energy physics applications.

TI Quantum Switchboard with Coupled-Cavity Array
SO ENTROPY
AB The ability to control the flow of quantum information is deterministically useful for scaling up quantum computation. In this paper, we demonstrate a controllable quantum switchboard which directs the teleportation protocol to one of two targets, fully dependent on the sender's choice. Importantly, the quantum switchboard also acts as a optimal quantum cloning machine, which allows the receivers to recover the unknown quantum state with a maximal fidelity of 5/6. This protects the system from the complete loss of quantum information in the event that the teleportation protocol fails. We also provide an experimentally feasible physical implementation of the proposal using a coupled-cavity array. The proposed switchboard can be utilized for the efficient routing of quantum information in a large quantum network.

TI Variational Quantum Algorithm Applied to Collision Avoidance of Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicles
SO ENTROPY
AB Mission planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a complex problem that is expected to be solved by quantum computing. With the increasing application of UAVs, the demand for efficient conflict management strategies to ensure airspace safety continues to increase. In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits with the help of classical optimizers are currently one of the most promising strategies to gain quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the UAV collision avoidance problem that maps the collision avoidance problem to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The problem is formulated as an Ising Hamiltonian, then the ground state is solved using two kinds of VQAs: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We select conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to further promote the performance of our model. Four examples are given to validate that with our method the probability of obtaining a feasible solution can exceed 90% based on appropriate parameters, and our method can enhance the efficiency of a UAVs' collision avoidance model.

TI Non-Perturbative Approaches to Linear and Nonlinear Responses of Atoms,
   Molecules, and Molecular Aggregates: A Theoretical Approach to Molecular
   Quantum Information and Quantum Biology
SO CHEMISTRY-SWITZERLAND
AB Non-perturbative approaches to linear and nonlinear responses (NLR) of atoms, molecules, and molecular aggregates are reviewed in relation to low and high harmonic generations (HG) by laser fields. These response properties are effective for the generation of entangled light pairs for quantum information processing by spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and stimulated four-wave mixing (SFWM). Quasi-energy derivative (QED) methods, such as QED M & oslash;ller-Plesset (MP) perturbation, are reviewed as time-dependent variational methods (TDVP), providing analytical expressions of time-dependent linear and nonlinear responses of open-shell atoms, molecules, and molecular aggregates. Numerical Liouville methods for the low HG (LHG) and high HG (HHG) regimes are reviewed to elucidate the NLR of molecules in both LHG and HHG regimes. Three-step models for the generation of HHG in the latter regime are reviewed in relation to developments of attosecond science and spectroscopy. Orbital tomography is also reviewed in relation to the theoretical and experimental studies of the amplitudes and phases of wave functions of open-shell atoms and molecules, such as molecular oxygen, providing the Dyson orbital explanation. Interactions between quantum lights and molecules are theoretically examined in relation to derivations of several distribution functions for quantum information processing, quantum dynamics of molecular aggregates, and future developments of quantum molecular devices such as measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). Quantum dynamics for energy transfer in dendrimer and related light-harvesting antenna systems are reviewed to examine the classical and quantum dynamics behaviors of photosynthesis. It is shown that quantum coherence plays an important role in the well-organized arrays of chromophores. Finally, applications of quantum optics to molecular quantum information and quantum biology are examined in relation to emerging interdisciplinary frontiers.

TI Hardware Efficient Quantum Simulation of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories with
   Qudits on Rydberg Platforms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces in nature, and developing tailored quantum hardware and algorithms to simulate them is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. Here we take an approach where gauge fields, discretized in spacetime, are represented by qudits and are time evolved in Trotter steps with multiqudit quantum gates. This maps naturally and hardware efficiently to an architecture based on Rydberg tweezer arrays, where long-lived internal atomic states represent qudits, and the required quantum gates are performed as holonomic operations supported by a Rydberg blockade mechanism. We illustrate our proposal for a minimal digitization of SU(2) gauge fields, demonstrating a significant reduction in circuit depth and gate errors in comparison to a traditional qubit-based approach, which puts simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories within reach of NISQ devices.

TI Towards quantum technologies with gamma photons
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In the context of the second quantum revolution, the ability to manipulate quantum systems is already used for various techniques and a growing number of technology demonstrators, mostly with low energy photons. In this frame, our intention is to extend quantum technologies to gamma photons. Our aim is to take advantage of resources brought by entanglement with higher energy particles, particularly electron-positron annihilation quanta. Tools for low frequency quantum experiments are not suitable for penetrant radiation, consequently we need to use effects typical to the keV-MeV energy range instead. High energy photon protocols would include fundamental properties testing, industrial imaging, quantum random number generators, quantum simulators, military applications and improvement of already existing medical procedures. In this paper we review some important steps in the study of annihilation photon correlations, we point out the experimental differences and necessities with respect to the energy increase in quantum photonic experiments and we describe the design of a quantum gamma device we propose for experiments meant to prove feasibility of gamma ray based protocols. The perspective behind our project is to evidence the possibility to communicate via entangled quanta through media which are not transparent for low energy photons.

TI Generalized Ansatz for High-Accuracy Quantum Sentiment Classification
   Using Variational Quantum Algorithm Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper investigates sentiment classification using QNLP within the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) framework, which offers a practical approach for current hardware limitations by optimizing parameterized quantum circuits through classical computation. While the quantum computer is not ready yet for commercialization, the development and testing of quantum algorithms in classical simulations are useful for finding the quantum advantages. Moreover, designing an effective VQA ansatz is a key challenge because it directly influences the model's expressiveness and trainability. To address this, a new ansatz called the GeneralQC ansatz is proposed by combining the preliminary SimpleSA ansatz with the circuit-centric quantum classifier, aiming to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of both methods. Three instantiations of the GeneralQC ansatz-H-CRx, Rx-CNOT, and Rx-CRz-are explored under the SimpleSA strategy of defining noun word boxes as fixed identity gates and are compared with both the baseline SimpleSA ansatz and versions with noun parameterization. The findings reveal that the Rx-CNOT and Rx-CRz models with non-parameterized nouns significantly outperform the SimpleSA ansatz, achieving an accuracy of 96.92%.

TI Quantum annealing for linear spectral unmixing: a proof-of-concept
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB Spectral unmixing is a popular technique in remote sensing, in which the measured spectrum of light is decomposed to determine which materials have produced the reflected signal. The technique gives insight into which materials are present on the target surface, making it useful in a wide variety of geoscience applications. However, the spectral unmixing problem tends to be computationally taxing to solve, limiting the extent to which the technique can be applied. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the potential application of a particular type of quantum computing, quantum annealing, on the spectral unmixing problem. To do this, we devised the first Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) formulation for linear spectral unmixing. This formulation of the problem can be solved using simulated or quantum annealing. Using artificial spectral mixtures, the QUBO formulation and both annealing methods were tested on accuracy and required computation time. The results were compared to the popular Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) algorithm. The MESMA algorithm and simulated annealing achieve comparable accuracy at equal computation time, indicating some potential of annealing in spectral unmixing applications. Solving the QUBO formulation by means of quantum annealing was possible only on simplified versions of the unmixing problem due to current hardware restrictions. However, quantum annealing requires a fraction of the computation time of the MESMA algorithm or simulated annealing, indicating the potential of quantum annealing for these types of problems. If quantum computing devices continue to improve in the following years, practical applications of spectral unmixing may become more efficiently solvable using quantum annealing.

TI Quantum simulation of the N-flavor Gross-Neveu model

The case of two flavors is particularly interesting as it can be mapped to the Hubbard model. We derive the appropriate qubit Hamiltonians and associated quantum circuits. We compare classical simulation and density matrix renormalization group/time-evolving blocked decimation calculations with the results of quantum simulation on various platforms for N = 2 and 4-flavors. We demonstrate that the four steps needed for calculations of real-time scattering can be implemented using current NISQ devices.

TI Modulation leakage vulnerability in continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Flaws in the process of modulation, or encoding of key bits in the quadratures of the electromagnetic light field, can make continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems susceptible to leakage of secret information. Here, we report such a modulation leakage vulnerability in a system that uses an optical in-phase and quadrature modulator to implement a single sideband encoding scheme. The leakage arises from the limited suppression of a quantum-information-carrying sideband during modulation. Based on the results from a proof-of-concept experiment, we theoretically analyze the impact of this vulnerability and show that the leakage reduces the range over which secret key can be obtained, and can even lead to a security breach, if disregarded. We also study the efficacy of additional trusted noise to counter this vulnerability.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The efficient error correction subsystem is essential for quantum computing and communication systems due to challenges like no-cloning and destructive measurements. Error-correction codes and fault-tolerant technologies are vital for mitigating errors. Our focus is on implementing fault-tolerant encoding circuits based on Steane code within optical integrated circuits using two C-NOT structures that utilize nonlinear optics. A Mach-Zehnder structure made from Si3N4 and nonlinear material with a nonlinear coefficient of n(2) = - 3.5 x 10(-15) m(2)/W (the nanocrystal of PbS), is exposed to 1.55 mu m wavelength waves, where propagated modes serve as qubits. The main input state delivers 25 mu W per 100 nm(2), and secondary inputs provide 15 mu W per 100 nm(2), allowing entanglement and error detection among qubits. The design has achieved a fidelity of F > 0.89, crucial for effective error correction in photon-based quantum computations.

TI A hierarchical approach for building distributed quantum systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, a multi-layer hierarchical architecture is proposed for distributing quantum computation. In a distributed quantum computing (DQC), different units or subsystems communicate by teleportation in order to transfer quantum information. Quantum teleportation requires classical and quantum resources and hence, it is essential to minimize the number of communications among these subsystems. To this end, a two-level hierarchical optimization method is proposed to distribute the qubits among different parts. In Level I, an integer linear programming model is presented to distribute a monolithic quantum system into K balanced partitions which results in the minimum number of non-local gates. When a qubit is teleported to a destination part, it can be used optimally by other gates without being teleported back to the destination part. In Level II, a data structure is proposed for quantum circuit and a recursive function is applied to minimize the number of teleportations. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous ones.

TI Skyrmionic qubits stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as
   platforms for qubits and quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role, stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.

TI Entanglement generation in a quantum network at distance-independent
   rate
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We develop a protocol for entanglement generation in the quantum internet that allows a repeater node to use n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) projective measurements that can fuse n successfully entangled links, i.e., two-qubit entangled Bell pairs shared across n network edges, incident at that node. Implementing n-fusion, for n >= 3, is in principle not much harder than 2-fusions (Bell-basis measurements) in solid-state qubit memories. If we allow even 3-fusions at the nodes, we find-by developing a connection to a modified version of the site-bond percolation problem-that despite lossy (hence probabilistic) link-level entanglement generation, and probabilistic success of the fusion measurements at nodes, one can generate entanglement between end parties Alice and Bob at a rate that stays constant as the distance between them increases. We prove that this powerful network property is not possible to attain with any quantum networking protocol built with Bell measurements and multiplexing alone. We also design a two-party quantum key distribution protocol that converts the entangled states shared between two nodes into a shared secret, at a key generation rate that is independent of the distance between the two parties.

TI Quantum sensing using multiqubit quantum systems and the Pauli polytope
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum sensing has highly practical potential applications in fields ranging from fundamental physics and quantum communication to biophysics and bioengineering. However, achieving high fidelity and control of entangled qubits that enables sensing beyond the quantum limit is still a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to quantum sensing, which we call open-system quantum sensing, where we exploit a generalization of the Pauli exclusion principle to sense the openness of a multiqubit quantum system from only measurement of the qubit occupations. Qubit occupations of a pure state obey generalized Pauli exclusion constraints that define a convex set known as the Pauli polytope, and hence violation of one of these constraints-a facet of the polytope-reveals a mixed state from the interaction of a quantum system with its environment without performing full-state tomography. We examine experimental ultrafast spectroscopic data from the photosynthetic light-harvesting complex in green sulfur bacteria and show that we can sense and decode the relaxation of the complex due to environmental noise. More generally, we can apply open-system quantum sensing with any general multiqubit quantum system, where it provides a unique, visual approach that promises enhanced sensitivity and fidelity.

AB Striving for higher gate fidelity is crucial not only for enhancing existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, but also for unleashing the potential of fault-tolerant quantum computation through quantum error correction.

TI Hamiltonian phase error in resonantly driven CNOT gate above the
   fault-tolerant threshold
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Because of their long coherence time and compatibility with industrial foundry processes, electron spin qubits are a promising platform for scalable quantum processors. A full-fledged quantum computer will need quantum error correction, which requires high-fidelity quantum gates. Analyzing and mitigating gate errors are useful to improve gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet reliable calibration procedure for a high-fidelity controlled-rotation gate in an exchange-always-on Silicon quantum processor, allowing operation above the fault-tolerance threshold of quantum error correction. We find that the fidelity of our uncalibrated controlled-rotation gate is limited by coherent errors in the form of controlled phases and present a method to measure and correct these phase errors. We then verify the improvement in our gate fidelities by randomized benchmark and gate-set tomography protocols. Finally, we use our phase correction protocol to implement a virtual, high-fidelity, controlled-phase gate.

TI Rate limits in quantum networks with lossy repeaters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The derivation of ultimate limits to communication over certain quantum repeater networks have provided extremely valuable benchmarks for assessing near-term quantum communication protocols. However, these bounds are usually derived in the limit of ideal devices and leave questions about the performance of practical implementations unanswered. To address this challenge, we quantify how the presence of loss in repeater stations affect the maximum attainable rates for quantum communication over linear repeater chains and more complex quantum networks. Extending the framework of node splitting, we model the loss introduced at the repeater stations and then prove the corresponding limits. In the linear chain scenario we show that, by increasing the number of repeater stations, the maximum rate cannot overcome a quantity, which solely depends on the loss of a single station. We introduce a way of adapting the standard machinery for obtaining bounds to this realistic scenario. The difference is that whilst ultimate limits for any strategy can be derived given a fixed channel, when the repeaters introduce additional decoherence, then the effective overall channel is itself a function of the chosen repeater strategy (e.g., one-way versus two-way classical communication). Classes of repeater strategies can be analysed using additional modeling and the subsequent bounds can be interpreted as the optimal rate within that class.

TI Idler-free channel position finding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is a powerful tool for quantum sensing, and entangled states can greatly boost the discriminative power of protocols for quantum illumination, quantum metrology, or quantum reading. However, entangled state protocols generally require the retention of an idler state, to which the probes are entangled. Storing a quantum state is difficult and so technological limitations can make protocols requiring quantum memories impracticable. One alternative is idler-free protocols that utilize nonclassical sources but do not require any idler states to be stored. Here we apply such a protocol to the task of channel position finding. This involves finding a target channel in a sequence of background channels, and has many applications, including quantum sensing, quantum spectroscopy, and quantum reading.

TI Molecular One- and Two-Qubit Systems with Very Long Coherence Times
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB General-purpose quantum computation and quantum simulation require multi-qubit architectures with precisely defined, robust interqubit interactions, coupled with local addressability. This is an unsolved challenge, primarily due to scalability issues. These issues often derive from poor control over interqubit interactions. Molecular systems are promising materials for the realization of large-scale quantum architectures, due to their high degree of positionability and the possibility to precisely tailor interqubit interactions. The simplest quantum architecture is the two-qubit system, with which quantum gate operations can be implemented. To be viable, a two-qubit system must possess long coherence times, the interqubit interaction must be well defined and the two qubits must also be addressable individually within the same quantum manipulation sequence. Here results are presented on the investigation of the spin dynamics of chlorinated triphenylmethyl organic radicals, in particular the perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical, a mono-functionalized PTM, and a biradical PTM dimer. Extraordinarily long ensemble coherence times up to 148 mu s are found at all temperatures below 100 K. Two-qubit and, importantly, individual qubit addressability in the biradical system are demonstrated. These results underline the potential of molecular materials for the development of quantum architectures.

TI Topological Contextuality and Anyonic Statistics of Photonic-Encoded
   Parafermions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quasiparticle poisoning, expected to arise during the measurement of the Majorana zero-mode state, poses a fundamental problem for the realization of Majorana-based quantum computation. Parafermions, a natural generalization of Majorana fermions, can encode topological qudits immune to quasiparticle poisoning. While parafermions are expected to emerge in superconducting fractional quantum Hall systems, they are not yet attainable with current technology. To bypass this problem, we employ a photonic quantum simulator to experimentally demonstrate the key components of parafermion-based universal quantum computation. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, by manipulating the photonic states, we realize Clifford-operator Berry phases that correspond to braiding statistics of parafermions. Second, we investigate the quantum contextuality in a topological system for the first time by demonstrating the contextuality of parafermion-encoded qudit states. Importantly, we find that the topologically encoded contextuality opens the way to magic state distillation, while both the contextuality and the braiding-induced Clifford gates are resilient against local noise. By introducing contextuality, our photonic quantum simulation provides the first step toward a physically robust methodology for realizing topological quantum computation.

TI Quantum state preparation and its prospects in quantum machine learning
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The development of traditional classic computers relies on the transistor structure of microchips, which develops in accordance with Moore's Law. In the future, as the distance between transistors approaches to the physical limit of manufacturing process, the development of computation capability of classical computers will encounter a bottleneck. On the other hand, with the development of machine learning, the demand for computation capability of computer is growing rapidly, and the contradiction between computation capability and demand for computers is becoming increasingly prominent. As a new computing model, quantum computing is significantly faster than classical computing for some specific problems, so, sufficient computation capability for machine learning is expected. When using quantum computing to deal with machine learning tasks, the first basic problem is how to represent the classical data effectively in the quantum system. This problem is called the state preparation problem. In this paper, the relevant researches of state preparation are reviewed, various state preparation schemes proposed at present are introduced, the processes of realizing these schemes are described, and the complexities of these schemes are summarized and analyzed. Finally, some prospects of the research work in the direction of state preparation are also presented.

However, high-dimensional quantum protocols are rarely investigated both theoretically and experimentally, despite the remarkable advantages that high-dimensional quantum systems exhibit over two-level systems for certain quantum information and computing tasks. Here, we propose asymmetric protocols that utilize different dimensional systems to prepare the stator and achieve remote state operations with the assistance of shared N -partite graph states. Our protocols demonstrate convincing control power and security, with all implementations achievable through local operations and classical communications. The experimental realization of high-dimensional quantum systems and operations is presented using current technology. Our work contributes towards achieving arbitrary high-dimensional quantum protocols and paves the way for implementing high-dimensional quantum communication and computation.

TI Scalable, High-Fidelity All-Electronic Control of Trapped-Ion Qubits

AB The central challenge of quantum computing is implementing high-fidelity quantum gates at scale. However, many existing approaches to qubit control suffer from a scale-performance trade-off, impeding progress towards the creation of useful devices. Here, we present a vision for an electronically controlled trapped-ion quantum computer that alleviates this bottleneck. Our architecture utilizes shared current-carrying traces and local tuning electrodes in a microfabricated chip to perform quantum gates with low noise and crosstalk regardless of device size. To verify our approach, we experimentally demonstrate low-noise site-selective singleand two-qubit gates in a seven-zone ion trap. We implement electronic singlequbit gates with fidelities >= 99.99912(8)% and demonstrate consistent performance with low crosstalk across the device. We also electronically generate two-qubit maximally entangled states with 99.97(1)% fidelity and long-term stable performance over continuous system operation. These state-of-the-art results highlight the potential of our all-electronic approach for coherent control of trapped-ion qubits in largescale quantum computers.

TI Spiderweb Array: A Sparse Spin-Qubit Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB One of the main bottlenecks in the pursuit of a large-scale-chip-based quantum computer is the large number of control signals needed to operate qubit systems. As system sizes scale up, the number of terminals required to connect to off-chip control electronics quickly becomes unmanageable. Here, we discuss a quantum-dot spin-qubit architecture that integrates on-chip control electronics, allowing for a significant reduction in the number of signal connections at the chip boundary. By arranging the qubits in a two-dimensional array with about 12 mu m pitch, we create space to implement locally integrated sampleand-hold circuits. This allows us to offset the inhomogeneities in the potential landscape across the array and to globally share the majority of the control signals for qubit operations. We make use of advanced circuit modeling software to go beyond conceptual drawings of the component layout, to assess the feasibility of the scheme through a concrete floor plan, including estimates of footprints for quantum and classical electronics, as well as routing of signal lines across the chip using different interconnect layers. We make use of local demultiplexing circuits to achieve an efficient signal-connection scaling, leading to a Rent's exponent as low asp = 0.43. Furthermore, we use available data from state-of-the-art spin qubit and microelectronics technology development, as well as circuit models and simulations, to estimate the operation frequencies and power consumption of a million-qubit array. This work presents a complementary approach to previously proposed architectures, focusing on a feasible scheme to integrating quantum and classical hardware, and identifying remaining challenges for achieving full fault-tolerant quantum computation. It thereby significantly closes the gap towards a fully CMOS-compatible quantum computer implementation.

TI Optimization Tools for Distance-Preserving Flag Fault-Tolerant Error
   Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Lookup-table decoding is fast and distance preserving, making it attractive for near-term quantum computer architectures with small-distance quantum error-correcting codes. In this work, we develop several optimization tools that can potentially reduce the space and time overhead required for flag fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) with lookup-table decoding on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. Our techniques include the compact lookup-table construction, the meet-in-the-middle technique, the adaptive time decoding for flag FTQEC, the classical processing technique for flag information, and the separate X- and Z-counting technique. We evaluate the performance of our tools using numerical simulation of hexagonal color codes of distances 3, 5, 7, and 9 under circuit-level noise. Combining all tools can result in an increase of more than an order of magnitude in the pseudothreshold for the hexagonal color code of distance 9, from (1.34 +/- 0.01) x 10-4 to (1.43 +/- 0.07) x 10-3.

TI Measuring error rates of mid-circuit measurements
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-fidelity mid-circuit measurements, which read out the state of specific qubits in a multiqubit processor without destroying them or disrupting their neighbors, are a critical component for useful quantum computing. They enable fault-tolerant quantum error correction, dynamic circuits, and other paths to solving classically intractable problems. But there are few methods to assess their performance comprehensively. In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first randomized benchmarking protocol that measures the rate at which mid-circuit measurements induce errors in many-qubit circuits. Using this protocol, we detect and eliminate previously undetected measurement-induced crosstalk in a 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. Then, we use the same protocol to measure the rate of measurement-induced crosstalk error on a 27-qubit IBM Q processor, and quantify how much of that error is eliminated by dynamical decoupling.

TI Coherence dynamics in Simon's quantum algorithm
SO EPL
AB - Quantum coherence plays a pivotal role in quantum algorithms. We study the coherence dynamics of the evolved states in Simon's quantum algorithm based on Tsallis relative alpha entropy and l(1,p) norm. We prove that the coherence of the first register and the second register both rely on the dimension N of the state spaces of the n qubit systems, and increase with the increase of N. We show that the oracle operator O does not change the coherence. Moreover, we study the coherence dynamics in Simon's quantum algorithm and prove that overall the coherence is in production when N > 4 and in depletion when N < 4.Copyright (c) 2023 EPLA

TI System-environment quantum information flow
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The return of the information from the environment to the system is a phenomenon that can be related to the existence of non-Markovian mechanisms in the environment, and such a transformation of resources can be useful for quantum information applications. Thus, understanding the details of the system-environment information dynamics, i.e., the transference of quantum resources, is of key importance to design noise-resilient quantum technologies. In this Letter, we show how a quantum resource propagates from the main system to an environment, using as a model a single qubit coupled to two linear chains of qubits, and also the information dynamics among the environment qubits. In this way, we characterize the propagation of information leaving the main qubit and going through the environment. Finally, we connect the conditions for the emergence of this dynamics to the existence of quantum Darwinism.

TI Multistate transition dynamics by strong time-dependent perturbation in
   NISQ era
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We develop a quantum computing scheme utilizing McLachlan variational principle in a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to accurately calculate the transition dynamics of a closed quantum system with many excited states subject to a strong time-dependent perturbation. A systematic approach for optimal construction of a general N-state ansatz with unaryN-qubit encoding is refined. We also use qubit efficient encoding in McLachlan variational quantum algorithm to reduce the number of qubits to log(2) N, simultaneously diminishing depths of the quantum circuits. The significant reduction of the number of time steps is achieved by use of the second order marching method. Instrumental in obtaining high accuracy are adaptations of the circuits to include time-dependent global phase correction. We illustrated, tested and optimized our quantum computing algorithm on a set of 16 bound hydrogenic eigenstates exposed to a strong laser attosecond pulse. Results for transition probabilities are obtained with accuracy better than 1%, as established by comparison to the benchmark data. Use of interaction representation of the Hamiltonian reduces the noise accumulation while the quantum system evolves intime.

TI Statistical mechanics of quantum error correcting codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study stabilizer quantum error correcting codes (QECC) generated under hybrid dynamics of local Clifford unitaries and local Pauli measurements in one dimension. Building upon (1) a general formula relating the error susceptibility of a subregion to its entanglement properties, and (2) a previously established mapping between entanglement entropies and domain wall free energies of an underlying spin model, we propose a statistical mechanical description of the QECC in terms of "entanglement domain walls." Free energies of such domain walls generically feature a leading volume law term coming from its "surface energy," and a subvolume law correction coming from thermodynamic entropies of its transverse fluctuations. These are most easily accounted for by capillary-wave theory of liquid-gas interfaces, which we use as an illustrative tool. We show that the information-theoretic decoupling criterion corresponds to a geometric decoupling of domain walls, which further leads to the identification of the "contiguous code distance" of the QECC as the crossover length scale at which the energy and entropy of the domain wall are comparable. The contiguous code distance thus diverges with the system size as the subleading entropic term of the free energy, protecting a finite code rate against local undetectable errors. We support these correspondences with numerical evidence, where we find capillary-wave theory describes many qualitative features of the QECC; we also discuss when and why it fails to do so.

AB Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) defines cryptographic algorithms designed to resist the advent of the quantum computer. Most public-key cryptosystems today are vulnerable to quantum attackers, so a global-scale transition to PQC is expected. As a result, several entities foment efforts in PQC standardization, research, development, creation of Work Groups (WGs), and issuing adoption recommendations. However, there is a long road to broad PQC adoption in practice. This position paper describes why migrating to PQC is necessary and gathers evidence that the "hybrid mode" can help the migration process. Finally, it stresses that there are risks yet to be considered by the literature. Quantum-safe protocols are being evaluated, but more attention (and awareness) is needed for the software and protocols at the application layer. Lastly, this position paper gives further recommendations for a smother PQC migration.

The proposed quantum algorithm presents time complexity that is logarithmic in the product of the training set cardinality and the dimension of the vectors. It is based just on a suitable state preparation like the retrieval from a QRAM, a SWAP test circuit, and a measurement process on a single qubit. An implementation on an IBM quantum processor is presented.

TI The transfer of entanglement negativity at the onset of interactions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum information, in the form of entanglement with an ancilla, can be transmitted to a third system through interaction. Here, we investigate this process of entanglement transmission perturbatively in time. Using the entanglement monotone negativity, we determine how the proclivity of an interaction to either generate, transfer or lose entanglement depends on the choice of Hamiltonians and initial states. These three proclivities are captured by Hamiltonian- and state-dependent quantities that we call negativity susceptibility, negativity transmissibility and negativity vulnerability respectively. These notions could serve, for example, as cost functions in quantum technologies such as machine-learned quantum error correction.

Using our framework, we apply several common techniques from these classical domains and numerically examine their suitability for and performance on this problem. Our methods are evaluated on single-qubit systems as well as on larger systems. While the first part of our proposed method outputs a single unitary matrix representing the composite effects of a quantum circuit or algorithm, we use existing tools-and assess the performance of these-to factor such a matrix into a product of elementary quantum gates. This enables our pipeline to be truly end-to-end: starting from desired input/output examples, our code ultimately results in a quantum circuit diagram.

TI Securing Practical Quantum Communication Systems with Optical Power
   Limiters
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Controlling the energy of unauthorized light signals in a quantum cryptosystem is an essential criterion for implementation security. Here, we propose a passive optical power limiter device based on thermooptical defocusing effects, providing a reliable power limiting threshold that can be readily adjusted to suit various quantum applications. In addition, the device is robust against a wide variety of signal variations (e.g., wavelength, pulse width), which is important for implementation security. We experimentally show that the proposed device does not compromise quantum communication signals. It only has a minimal impact (if not, negligible impact) on the intensity, phase, or polarization degrees of freedom of the photons, thus making it suitable for general communication purposes. To show its practical utility for quantum cryptography, we demonstrate and discuss three potential applications: (1) measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with enhanced security against a general class of Trojan-horse attacks, (2) using the power limiter as a countermeasure against bright illumination attacks, and (3) the application of power limiters to potentially enhance the implementation security of plug-and-play quantum key distribution.

TI Computer-Aided Quantum Algorithms for Real-Time Energy Market Trading
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study presents an innovative approach for optimizing real-time energy market trading strategies by integrating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Quantum Annealing (QA). The primary objective is to enhance trading performance by leveraging the adaptive capabilities of PPO alongside the optimization power of QA. The methodology involves using PPO to develop a dynamic trading strategy that adapts to real-time market conditions. PPO's reinforcement learning framework is employed to manage state representations, action spaces, and reward functions, thereby continuously refining the trading policy. The optimization of trading parameters is achieved through Quantum Annealing, which solves Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems derived from the trading strategy formulation. Key findings from the study demonstrate significant improvements in trading outcomes. The integration of QA with PPO led to a 25% increase in total return, a 15% enhancement in Sharpe ratio, a 10% reduction in maximum drawdown, and a 20% decrease in transaction costs. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining quantum optimization techniques with reinforcement learning for superior trading strategy development. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to advancing real-time trading strategy optimization through the synergistic use of machine learning and quantum computing. This approach offers potential applications across various financial sectors and domains requiring sophisticated real-time decision-making and optimization. Future research is suggested to further explore the scalability and practical implementation of this integrated methodology in more complex and larger-scale optimization problems.

TI Quantum information transfer using weak measurements and any non-product
   resource state
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Information about an unknown quantum state can be encoded in weak values of projectors belonging to a complete eigenbasis. A protocol that enables one party-Bob-to remotely determine the weak values corresponding to weak measurements performed by another spatially separated party-Alice is presented. The particular set of weak values contains complete information of the quantum state encoded on Alice's register, which enacts the role of preselected system state in the aforementioned weak measurement. Consequently, Bob can determine the quantum state from these weak values, which can also be termed as remote state determination or remote state tomography. A combination of non-product bipartite resource state shared between the two parties and classical communication between them is necessary to bring this statistical scheme to fruition. Significantly, the information transfer of a pure quantum state of any known dimensions can be effected even with resource states of low dimensionality and purity with a single measurement setting at Bob's end.

TI Niobium-buffered tantalum for a superconducting fluxonium qubit
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB We use a magnetron sputtering system to grow a tantalum film on a sapphire substrate with a niobium buffer layer at room temperature. The tantalum film is in alpha-phase, which is preferred for superconducting quantum devices. We fabricate a superconducting heavy fluxonium qubit with this niobium-buffered tantalum film, which demonstrates good performance. Forbidden transitions and sideband transition phenomena between specific energy levels are observed. Due to the specific design parameters, the fluxonium described herein exhibits high anharmonicity while maintaining a long decoherence time in the higher energy states, making it well-suited for use as a qudit and enabling high-dimensional quantum computation. With further optimization of the film deposition process, superconducting qubits other than fluxoniums with higher performance are expected to be obtained using these multilayer films grown at room temperature.

TI Adoption of Quantum Computing in Economic Analysis: Potential and
   Challenges in Distributed Information Systems
SO EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB INTRODUCTION: Quantum computing technology has become a center of attention in various scientific disciplines, including economic analysis. The adoption of quantum computing in economic analysis offers tremendous potential to improve the processing of complex economic data and provide deep insights. However, the use of quantum technology in the context of distributed information systems also raises several challenges, including data security and the limitations of quantum technology. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the implications of adopting quantum computing in economic analysis, with a focus on distributed information systems. METHODS: This research was carried out using a descriptive qualitative approach, with data derived from the results of relevant research and previous studies. The collected data will be processed and analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the adoption of quantum computing in economic analysis in distributed information systems. RESULTS: This research then finds that the adoption of quantum computing in economic analysis has the potential to increase efficiency, accuracy, and depth of economic insight. However, limitations of current quantum technologies, including quantum errors, limited scale of operations, and data security issues, limit their applications. In the long term, research and development will be key to overcoming these obstacles and maximizing the potential of this technology in economic analysis. CONCLUSION: The long-term implications include increased economic competitiveness and significant changes in the way economic decision-making is carried out, assuming that ethical and regulatory issues are also carefully considered.

Along this line, the quantumness power and dequantumness power are introduced. In particular, once a quantum dynamics described by time-varying quantum channels reduces the quantumness for any input ensembles all the time, we call it a completely dequantumness channel, whose relationship with Markovianity is analyzed through several examples.

AB The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem is a famous cryptographic problem consisting in recovering a secret from noised samples. This problem is usually solved via reduction techniques, that is, one reduces the original instance to a smaller one before substituting back the recovered unknowns and starting the process again. There has been an extensive amount of work where time-memory trade-offs, optimal chains of reductions or different solving techniques were considered but hardly any of them involved quantum algorithms. In this work, we are interested in studying the improvements brought by quantum computers when attacking the LPN search problem in the sparse noise regime. Our primary contribution is a novel efficient quantum algorithm based on Grover's algorithm which searches for permutations achieving specific error patterns. This algorithm non-asymptotically outperforms the known techniques in a low-noise regime while using a low amount of memory.

TI Hyperentanglement quantum communication over a 50 km noisy fiber channel
SO OPTICA
AB High-dimensional entanglement not only offers a high security level for quantum communication but also promises improved information capacity and noise resistance of the system. However, due to various constraints on different high-dimensional degrees of freedom, whether these advantages can bring improvement to the actual implementation is still not well proven. Here we present a scheme to fully utilize these advantages over long-distance noisy fiber channels. We exploit polarization and time-bin hyperentanglement to achieve high-dimensional coding, and observe significant enhancements in secure key rates and noise tolerance that surpass the capabilities of qubit systems. Moreover, the demonstration achieves a distribution up to 50 km, which is the longest distance for high-dimensional entanglement-based quantum key distribution up to date, to our knowledge. Our demonstration validates the potential of high-dimensional entanglement for quantum communications over long-distance noisy channels, paving the way for a resilient and resource-efficient quantum network.

TI Probing the Page transition via approximate quantum error correction
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In recent years, there is a huge progress in understanding the black hole information problem, and the key is that the black hole entropy of radiation should be calculated by the island formula, which describes the Page curve to ensure the unitarity of black hole evaporation. In the paper, we find that the black hole evaporation interpreted by the island formula can be understood in the language of approximate quantum error correction. Furthermore, the Page transition, as a special property of the Page curve, should be understood as the property of approximate quantum error correction itself, i.e. a general class of quantum systems under certain conditions from approximate quantum error correction can also exhibit phenomenon similar to the Page transition.

TI Collectively Encoded Rydberg Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate a collectively encoded qubit based on a single Rydberg excitation stored in an ensemble of N entangled atoms. Qubit rotations are performed by applying microwave fields that drive excitations between Rydberg states. Coherent readout is performed by mapping the excitation into a single photon. Ramsey interferometry is used to probe the coherence of the qubit, as well as to test the robustness to external perturbations. We show that qubit coherence is preserved even as we lose atoms from the polariton mode, preserving Ramsey fringe visibility. We show that dephasing due to electric field noise scales as the fourth power of field amplitude. These results show that robust quantum information processing can be achieved via collective encoding using Rydberg polaritons, and hence this system could provide an attractive alternative coding strategy for quantum computation and networking.

TI Measuring the impact of post quantum cryptography in Industrial IoT
   scenarios
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB The continuously evolving nature of cryptography is driven by the emergence of new threats and attack vectors. Quantum computers pose a paradigmatic security risk to cryptography, challenging its very core principles. This quantum threat can be appropriately addressed through quantum-safe cryptographic primitives, such as quantum key distribution and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). In the case of PQC, the paradigm shift involves using algorithms with significantly higher computational costs. This paper analyzes the possibilities and challenges of transitioning from current cryptographic systems to PQC alternatives, with a focus on the critical case of constrained-resource devices. We demonstrate the feasibility of such a transition in IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios with limited nodes, and we evaluate how new proposals can mitigate the impact of signature computations on securing IoT/IIoT devices. In this work, we design and implement a novel framework to conduct an extensive set of experiments measuring the performance of different families of PQC algorithms in terms of execution time and power consumption. Both the framework and the dataset have been published in the EU Open Research Repository Zenodo to facilitate the future selection of algorithms that best adapt to the specific characteristics of each system.

TI Quantum Fisher information of multi-qubit WV entangled state under
   Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As an important quantity in the field of parameter estimation theory and quantum precision measurement, quantum Fisher information (QFI) can not only be used to set the theoretical limit of measurement precision in quantum system, but also be exploited to witness metrological useful quantum entanglement. Recently, it has also been broadly used in many aspects of quantum information science, including quantum metrology, multipartite entanglement structure detection, quantum phase transition, quantum chaos, quantum computation and etc. In this work, from the perspective of quantum measurement, we study the quantum Fisher information of an N-qubit WV state ( a |WN) +,./1 - a2 |00 center dot center dot center dot 0) ) under local operation and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. Furthermore, with the general Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) we analyze its performance in high-precision phase measurement. The results show that, under the local operation, the QFI of an N-qubit WV state becomes larger with the increase of parameter alpha. This not only means the enhanced quantum entanglement, but also implies the powerful ability in high-precision quantum measurement. In the LMG model, as the increase of interactional strength 7 the QFI of N = 3 qubits WV state gradually tends to be stable and almost not be affected by parameter alpha, which relaxes the requirement in the preparation of target state and indicates a great potential in achieving the relatively stable measurement precision. When the number of qubits from WV state is larger than 3, the QFI of WV state increases with the increase of parameter alpha. In the case of fixed parameter alpha, we investigate the QFI of an N-qubit WV state with respect to interaction strength 7. It is found that the QFI of WV state will increase with the increasing interaction strength, which implies that the greater the interaction strength, the stronger the quantum measurement ability of the WV state. Our work will promote the development of high-precision quantum metrology and especially the interaction-enhanced quantum measurement, and further provide new insights in quantum information processing.

TI Low-loss liquid metal interconnects for superconducting quantum circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Building a modular architecture with superconducting quantum computing chips is one of the means to achieve qubit scalability, allowing the screening, selection, replacement, and integration of individual qubit modules into large quantum systems. However, the nondestructive replacement of modules within a compact architecture remains a challenge. Liquid metals, specifically gallium alloys, can be alternatives to solid-state galvanic interconnects. This is motivated by their self-healing, self-aligning, and other desirable fluidic properties, potentially enabling the nondestructive replacement of modules at room temperatures, even after operating the entire system at millikelvin regimes. In this study, we present coplanar waveguide resonators (CPWRs) interconnected by gallium alloy droplets, achieving high internal quality factors up to nearly one million and demonstrating performance on par with the continuous solid-state CPWRs. Leveraging the desirable fluidic properties of gallium alloys at room temperature and their compact design, we envision a modular quantum system enabled by liquid metals.

TI Quantum Machine Learning Revolution in Healthcare: A Systematic Review
   of Emerging Perspectives and Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing (QC) stands apart from traditional computing systems by employing revolutionary techniques for processing information. It leverages the power of quantum bits (qubits) and harnesses the unique properties exhibited by subatomic particles, such as superposition, entanglement, and interference. These quantum phenomena enable quantum computers to operate on an entirely different level, exponentially surpassing the computational capabilities of classical computers. By manipulating qubits and capitalising on their quantum states, QC holds the promise of solving complex problems that are currently intractable in the case of traditional computers. The potential impact of QC extends beyond its computational power and reaches into various critical sectors, including healthcare. Scientists and engineers are working diligently to overcome various challenges and limitations associated with QC technology. These include issues related to qubit stability, error correction, scalability, and noise reduction. In such a scenario, our proposed work provides a concise summary of the most recent state of the art based on articles published between 2018 and 2023 in the healthcare domain. Additionally, the approach follows the necessary guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review. This includes utilising research questions and evaluating the quality of the articles using specific metrics. Initially, a total of 2,038 records were acquired from multiple databases, with 468 duplicate records and 1,053 records unrelated to healthcare subsequently excluded. A further 258, 68, and 39 records were eliminated based on title, abstract, and full-text criteria, respectively. Ultimately, the remaining 49 articles were subject to evaluation, thus providing a brief overview of the recent literature and contributing to existing knowledge and comprehension of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms and their applications in the healthcare sector. This analysis establishes a foundational framework for forthcoming research and development at the intersection of QC and machine learning, ultimately paving the way for innovative approaches to addressing complex challenges within the healthcare domain.

TI Quantum Information in Neural Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Identifying the physiological processes in the central nervous system that underlie our conscious experiences has been at the forefront of cognitive neuroscience. While the principles of classical physics were long found to be unaccommodating for a causally effective consciousness, the inherent indeterminism of quantum physics, together with its characteristic dichotomy between quantum states and quantum observables, provides a fertile ground for the physical modeling of consciousness. Here, we utilize the Schrodinger equation, together with the Planck-Einstein relation between energy and frequency, in order to determine the appropriate quantum dynamical timescale of conscious processes. Furthermore, with the help of a simple two-qubit toy model we illustrate the importance of non-zero interaction Hamiltonian for the generation of quantum entanglement and manifestation of observable correlations between different measurement outcomes. Employing a quantitative measure of entanglement based on Schmidt decomposition, we show that quantum evolution governed only by internal Hamiltonians for the individual quantum subsystems preserves quantum coherence of separable initial quantum states, but eliminates the possibility of any interaction and quantum entanglement. The presence of non-zero interaction Hamiltonian, however, allows for decoherence of the individual quantum subsystems along with their mutual interaction and quantum entanglement. The presented results show that quantum coherence of individual subsystems cannot be used for cognitive binding because it is a physical mechanism that leads to separability and non-interaction. In contrast, quantum interactions with their associated decoherence of individual subsystems are instrumental for dynamical changes in the quantum entanglement of the composite quantum state vector and manifested correlations of different observable outcomes. Thus, fast decoherence timescales could assist cognitive binding through quantum entanglement across extensive neural networks in the brain cortex.

TI Phase transition in magic with random quantum circuits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Magic is a property of quantum states that enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computing using simple sets of gate operations. Understanding the mechanisms by which magic is created or destroyed is, therefore, a crucial step towards efficient and practical fault-tolerant computation. Many proposals for error correction in quantum computing make use of so-called stabilizer codes, which use multiqubit measurements to detect deviations from logical qubit states. Here we observe that a random stabilizer code subject to coherent errors exhibits a phase transition in magic, which we characterize through analytical, numerical and experimental probes. Below a critical error rate, stabilizer measurements remove the accumulated magic in the circuit, effectively protecting against coherent errors; above the critical error rate measurements concentrate magic. A better understanding of this behaviour in the resource theory of magic could help to identify the origins of quantum speedup and lead to methods for more efficient magic state generation.
   Coherent noise affecting a random error correcting code is now shown to produce a transition between phases that accumulate and destroy magic.

TI Faithful Interconversions of Three-Logic-Qubit Entangled States Via
   Error-Predicted Module in Decoherence-Free Subspace
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The interconversion between different types of entangled states is an essential process. It is particularly important for tasks requiring specific forms of entanglement, as it greatly enhances the versatility, robustness, and efficiency of quantum systems. In the paper, deterministic schemes are proposed for interconversion between three-logic-qubit W state and three-logic-qubit Knill-Laflamme-Milburn state within a decoherence-free subspace (DFS). The process of mutual transformation leverages the state-selective nature of a quantum dot (QD) confined in a double-sided microcavity, along with high-fidelity, error-predictable quantum control gates. Furthermore, the incorporation of single-photon detectors helps to identify and mitigate potential failures arising from imperfect interactions between photons and the QD-cavity system, thereby significantly enhancing experimental viability. In-depth analyses of both protocols confirm that they can, in principle, achieve near-unit fidelities and outstanding efficiencies. Additionally, the protocols offer advanced solutions to decoherence challenges through the use of DFS, paving the way for the development of practical quantum technologies.

TI Fast unconditional reset and leakage reduction of a tunable
   superconducting qubit via an engineered dissipative bath
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Rapid and accurate initialization of qubits, known as reset, is a crucial building block for various tasks in quantum information processing, such as quantum error correction and estimation of the statistics of noisy quantum devices with many qubits. We demonstrate unconditional reset of a frequency-tunable transmon qubit that simultaneously resets multiple excited states using a metamaterial waveguide engineered to provide a cold bath over a wide spectral range, while providing strong protection against Purcell decay of the qubit. We report a reset error below 0.13% (0.16%) when prepared in the first (second) excited state of the transmon within 88 ns. In addition, through the sharp roll-off in the density of states of the metamaterial waveguide, we implement a leakage-reduction unit that selectively resets the transmon's second excited state to 0.285(3)% residual population within 44 ns while acting trivially in the computational subspace as an identity operation that preserves encoded information with an infidelity of 0.72(1)%.

TI Quantum Metabolic Avatar: A digital replica of metabolism enhanced by
   quantum algorithms
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB The integration of quantum computing (QC) into predictive modeling represents a transformative advancement in machine learning, providing substantial improvements over traditional methods. This study compares classical Echo State Networks (ESN) with quantum Echo State Networks (qESN) for time-series forecasting, emphasizing the concept of a metabolic avatar-a dynamic data-driven model of individual metabolic processes. Utilizing time-series data from six distinct users, we assessed both models' precision and adaptability through Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate consistent superiority of qESN over classical ESN, highlighted by a 30% RMSE reduction during cross-validation (CV). Notably, qESN showed remarkable stability and accuracy even with limited training data, underscoring its effectiveness in data-sparse scenarios. Furthermore, we examined model performance in datasets containing outliers. QESN significantly outperformed classical ESN, achieving approximately 76% lower RMSE in CV and about 55% lower RMSE in walk-forward validation (WFV). This demonstrates qESN's enhanced robustness and reduced susceptibility to overfitting. Crucially, our findings highlight the Quantum Metabolic Avatar's (QMA) profound potential for personalized predictive analytics, essential for applications in personalized healthcare and customized wellness programs. The study strongly supports integrating quantum algorithms into predictive modeling, marking a pivotal advancement towards highly personalized and dynamic metabolic avatars.

In this Mini-Review, we analyze how synergistic approaches that combine driven quantum dynamics, AI/machine learning, and quantum computing accelerate the discovery and design process of quantum materials with enhanced properties and novel functionalities. Building on the capabilities of each of the three methods, synergistic approaches can provide access to the materials' response to time-dependent fields, enable the rapid exploration of vast design spaces, and identify novel quantum phases and materials with optimal properties. We examine recent successes in next-gen materials science for quantum batteries, colloidal quantum dots solar cells, quantum phototransistors, rare-earth-free materials, and applications in quantum information processing. We conclude with a discussion of recent research efforts in AI-for-quantum computing and quantum machine learning for next-gen materials discovery.

TI Resonant metasurface-enabled quantum light sources for single-photon
   emission and entangled photon-pair generation
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Light encodes information in multiple degrees of freedom (e.g., frequency, amplitude, and phase), enabling high-speed, high-bandwidth communication through fiber optics. Unlike classical light, quantum light (single or entangled photons) can transmit quantum states over long distances without loss of coherence, thereby coherently interconnecting quantum nodes for distributed quantum entanglement. Quantum light sources are critical for developing scalable quantum networks aimed at distributed quantum computing, quantum teleportation, and secure quantum communications. However, existing quantum light sources suffer from limited integrability, insufficient spectral and spatial tunability, and inefficiencies in achieving mass-produced, deterministic, on-demand quantum light generation. These limitations significantly hinder progress toward direct, on-chip integration with quantum processing units and detectors - an essential step toward scalable quantum networks. Resonant metasurfaces that leverage photonic modes - such as Mie resonances, guided-mode resonances, or symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum - offer strong spatial and temporal confinement of electromagnetic fields, characterized by high quality factors and small mode volumes. These metasurfaces greatly enhance linear and nonlinear light-matter interactions, making them ideal for efficient on-chip quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we describe recent advances in nanoscale quantum light sources and quantum photonic state manipulation enabled by resonant metasurfaces. We also provide an outlook on next-generation miniaturized quantum light sources achievable through materials innovations in quantum emitters, the co-design of resonant metasurfaces, and ultimately, the heterogeneous integration of emerging layered van der Waals materials with resonant metasurfaces.

TI Experimental Test of High-Dimensional Quantum Contextuality Based on
   Contextuality Concentration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Contextuality is a distinctive feature of quantum theory and a fundamental resource for quantum computation. However, existing examples of contextuality in high-dimensional systems lack the necessary robustness required in experiments. Here, we address this problem by identifying a family of noncontextuality inequalities whose maximum quantum violation grows with the dimension of the system. At first glance, this contextuality is the single-system version of multipartite Bell nonlocality taken to an extreme form. What is interesting is that the single-system version achieves the same degree of contextuality but uses a Hilbert space of lower dimension. That is, contextuality "concentrates" as the degree of contextuality per dimension increases. We show the practicality of this result by presenting an experimental test of contextuality in a seven-dimensional system. By simulating sequences of quantum ideal measurements with destructive measurements and repreparation in an all-optical setup, we report a violation of 68.7 standard deviations of the simplest case of the noncontextuality inequalities identified. Our results advance the investigation of high-dimensional contextuality, its connection to the Clifford algebra, and its role in quantum computation.

TI Quantum computing formulation of some classical Hadamard matrix
   searching methods and its implementation on a quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Finding a Hadamard matrix (H-matrix) among all possible binary matrices of corresponding order is a hard problem that can be solved by a quantum computer. Due to the limitation on the number of qubits and connections in current quantum processors, only low order H-matrix search of orders 2 and 4 were implementable by previous method. In this paper, we show that by adopting classical searching techniques of the H-matrices, we can formulate new quantum computing methods for finding higher order ones. We present some results of finding H-matrices of order up to more than one hundred and a prototypical experiment of the classical-quantum resource balancing method that yields a 92-order H-matrix previously found by Jet Propulsion Laboratory researchers in 1961 using a mainframe computer. Since the exactness of the solutions can be verified by an orthogonality test performed in polynomial time; which is untypical for optimization of hard problems, the proposed method can potentially be used for demonstrating practical quantum supremacy in the near future.

TI Design and Analysis of Digital Communication Within an SoC-Based Control
   System for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Electronic control systems used for quantum computing have become increasingly complex as multiple qubit technologies employ larger numbers of qubits with higher fidelity target. Whereas the control systems for different technologies share some similarities, parameters, such as pulse duration, throughput, real-time feedback, and latency requirements, vary widely depending on the qubit type. In this article, we evaluate the performance of modern system-on-chip (SoC) architectures in meeting the control demands associated with performing quantum gates on trapped-ion qubits, particularly focusing on communication within the SoC. A principal focus of this article is the data transfer latency and throughput of several high-speed on-chip mechanisms on Xilinx multiprocessor SoCs, including those that utilize direct memory access (DMA). They are measured and evaluated to determine an upper bound on the time required to reconfigure a gate parameter. Worst-case and average-case bandwidth requirements for a custom gate sequencer core are compared with the experimental results. The lowest variability, highest throughput data-transfer mechanism is DMA between the real-time processing unit (RPU) and the programmable logic, where bandwidths up to 19.2 GB/s are possible. For context, this enables the reconfiguration of qubit gates in less than 2 mu s, comparable to the fastest gate time. Though this article focuses on trapped-ion control systems, the gate abstraction scheme and measured communication rates are applicable to a broad range of quantum computing technologies.

TI Blindly verifying partially unknown entanglement
SO ISCIENCE
AB Quantum entanglement has shown distinguished features beyond any classical state. Many methods have been presented to verify unknown entanglement with the complete information about the density matrices by quantum state tomography. In this work, we aim to identify unknown entanglement with only partial information of the state space. The witness consists of a generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like paradox expressed by Pauli observables, and a nonlinear entanglement witness expressed by density matrix elements. First, we verify unknown bipartite entanglement and study the robustness of entanglement witnesses against the white noise. Second, we generalize such verification to partially unknown multipartite entangled states, including the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type and W-type states. Third, we give a quantum-information application related to the quantum zero-knowledge proof. It further provides a useful method in blindly verifying universal quantum computation resources. These results may be interesting in entanglement theories, quantum communication, and quantum networks.

AB Distributed quantum computing allows the modular construction of large-scale quantum computers and enables new protocols for blind quantum computation. However, such applications in the large-scale, fault-tolerant regime place stringent demands on the fidelity and rate of entanglement generation, which are not met by existing methods for quantum interconnects.
   In this work, we develop constant-rate entanglement distillation methods to address this bottleneck in the setting of noisy local operations. By using a sequence of two-way entanglement distillation protocols based on quantum error detecting codes with increasing rate, and combining with standard fault tolerance techniques, we achieve constant-rate entanglement distillation. We show that the scheme has constant-rate in expectation, and further numerically optimize to achieve low practical overhead under memory constraints. We find that compared to existing quantum interconnect schemes, our methods reduce the communication overhead by more than 10x in relevant regimes, leading to a direct speed-up in the execution of distributed quantum algorithms.

TI A Remote Security Computational Ghost Imaging Method Based on Quantum
   Key Distribution Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Computational ghost imaging (CGI) is a method of acquiring object information by measuring light field intensity, which would be used to achieve imaging in a complicated environment. The main issue to be addressed in CGI technology is how to achieve rapid and high-quality imaging while assuring the secure transmission of detection data in practical distant imaging applications. In order to address the mentioned issues, this paper proposes a remote secure CGI method based on quantum communication technology. Using the quantum key distribution (QKD) network, the CGI system can be reconstructed while solving the problem of information security transmission between the detector and the reconstructed computing device. By exploring the influence of different random measurement matrices on the quality of image reconstruction, it is found that the randomness of the numerical sequence constituting the matrix is positively correlated with the imaging quality. Based on this discovery, a new type of quantum cryptography measurement matrix is constructed using quantum cryptography with good randomness. In addition, through further orthogonalization and normalization of the matrix, the matrix has both good randomness and orthogonality, and high-quality imaging results can be obtained at a low sampling rate. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by simulation imaging experiments. Compared with the traditional GI system, the method proposed in this paper has higher transmission security and high-quality imaging under this premise, which provides a new idea for the practical development of CGI technology.

TI Controller-Based Energy-Aware Wireless Sensor Network Routing Using
   Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Energy-efficient routing in wireless sensor networks has attracted attention from researchers in both academia and industry, most recently motivated by the opportunity to use software-defined network-inspired approaches. These problems are NP-hard, with algorithms needing computation time that scales faster than polynomials in the problem size. Consequently, heuristic algorithms are used in practice, which are unable to guarantee optimally. In this article, we show proof-of-principle for the use of a quantum annealing processor instead of a classical processor, to find optimal or nearly optimal solutions very quickly. Our preliminary results for small networks show that this approach using quantum computing has great promise and may open the door for other significant improvements in the efficacy of network algorithms.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose and analyze a setup to tailor the wave functions of quantum states. Our setup is based on the quantum teleportation circuit, but instead of the usual two-mode squeezed state, a two-mode non-Gaussian entangled state is used. Using this setup, we can generate various classes of quantum states such as Schrodinger cat states, four-component cat states, superpositions of Fock states, and cubic phase states. These results demonstrate the versatility of our system as a state generator and suggest that conditioning using homodyne measurements is an important tool in the generation of the non-Gaussian states complementarily to photon number detection.

TI SIC-POVM TOMOGRAPHY IN INTEGRATED PHOTONICS CHIPS
SO ROMANIAN REPORTS IN PHYSICS
AB Reconstructing the state of a quantum system, called quantum state tomography, is an essential task in quantum technologies. Standard methods are inefficient, as they scale exponentially with the number of qubits. Better scaling meth-ods, such as SIC-POVM tomography, are not yet widespread due to their measurement complexity. As such, there is an urgent need to find efficient and compact devices for performing tomography of photonic states. Here we present simulations of photonic devices implementing SIC-POVM tomography in photonic chips. We obtain fidelities F = 0.8452 (for qubits) and F = 0.7609 (for qutrits). Our results show that we can design efficient and compact SIC-POVM tomography modules for integrated-photonics quantum chips. Since integrated photonics is a major quantum technology platform, we expect our results to be instrumental in the future development of compact, costeffective quantum devices. Applications include quantum communications, quantum computing, quantum sensing and quantum imaging.

TI Quantum machine learning of graph-structured data

Here we develop an approach that exploits the quantum source's graph structure to improve learning via an arbitrary quantum neural network (QNN) ansatz. In particular, we devise and optimize a self-supervised objective to capture the information-theoretic closeness of the quantum states in the training of a QNN. Numerical simulations show that our approach improves the learning efficiency and the generalization behavior of the base QNN. On a practical note, scalable quantum implementations of the learning procedure described in this paper are likely feasible on the next generation of quantum computing devices.

TI Multi-qubit doilies: Enumeration for all ranks and classification for

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB For N >= 2, an N-qubit doily is a doily living in the N-qubit symplectic polar space. These doilies are related to operator-based proofs of quantum contextuality. Following and extending the strategy of Saniga et al. (Mathematics 9 (2021) 2272) that focused exclusively on three-qubit doilies, we first bring forth several formulas giving the number of both linear and quadratic doilies for any N > 2. Then we present an effective algorithm for the generation of all N-qubit doilies. Using this algorithm for N = 4 and N = 5, we provide a classification of N-qubit doilies in terms of types of observables they feature and number of negative lines they are endowed with. We also list several distinguished findings about N-qubit doilies that are absent in the three-qubit case, point out a couple of specific features exhibited by linear doilies and outline some prospective extensions of our approach.

TI Measurement-induced topological entanglement transitions in symmetric
   random quantum circuits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Random quantum circuits, in which an array of qubits is subjected to a series of randomly chosen unitary operations, have provided key insights into the dynamics of many-body quantum entanglement. Recent work has shown that interleaving the unitary operations with single-qubit measurements can drive a transition between high- and low-entanglement phases. Here we study a class of symmetric random quantum circuits with two competing types of measurement in addition to unitary dynamics. We find a rich phase diagram involving robust symmetry-protected topological, trivial and volume law entangled phases, where the transitions are hidden to expectation values of any operator and are only apparent by averaging the entanglement entropy over quantum trajectories. In the absence of unitary dynamics, we find a purely measurement-induced critical point, which maps exactly to two copies of a classical two-dimensional percolation problem. Numerical simulations indicate that this transition is a tricritical point that splits into two critical lines in the presence of arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics with an intervening volume law entangled phase. Our results show that measurements alone are sufficient to induce criticality and logarithmic entanglement scaling, and arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics can be sufficient to stabilize volume law entangled phases in the presence of rapid, yet competing, measurements.

TI Quantum circuits to measure scalar spin chirality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The scalar spin chirality is a three-body physical observable that plays an outstanding role both in classical magnetism, characterizing non-co-planar spin textures, and in quantum magnetism, as an order parameter for chiral spin liquids. In quantum information, the scalar spin chirality is a witness of genuine tripartite entanglement. Here we propose an indirect measurement scheme, based on the Hadamard test, to estimate the scalar spin chirality for general quantum states. We apply our method to study chirality in two types of quantum states: generic one-magnon states of a ferromagnet, and the ground state of a model with competing symmetric and antisymmetric exchange. We show a single-shot determination of the scalar chirality is possible for chirality eigenstates, via quantum phase estimation with a single auxiliary qutrit. Our approach provides a unified theory of chirality in classical and quantum magnetism.

TI An Efficient Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Parameter
   Optimization Using Elitist Elk Herd Random Immigrants Optimizer and
   Adaptive Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Quantum memory is essential for the prolonged storage and retrieval of quantum information. Nevertheless, no current studies have focused on the creation of effective quantum memory for continuous variables while accounting for the decoherence rate. This work presents an effective continuous-variable quantum key distribution method with parameter optimization utilizing the Elitist Elk Herd Random Immigrants Optimizer (2E-HRIO) technique. At the outset of transmission, the quantum device undergoes initialization and authentication via Compressed Hash-based Message Authentication Code with Encoded Post-Quantum Hash (CHMAC-EPQH). The settings are subsequently optimized from the authenticated device via 2E-HRIO, which mitigates the effects of decoherence by adaptively tuning system parameters. Subsequently, quantum bits are produced from the verified device, and pilot insertion is executed within the quantum bits. The pilot-inserted signal is thereafter subjected to pulse shaping using a Gaussian filter. The pulse-shaped signal undergoes modulation. Authenticated post-modulation, the prediction of link failure is conducted through an authenticated channel using Radial Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. Subsequently, transmission occurs via a non-failure connection. The receiver performs channel equalization on the received signal with Recursive Regularized Least Mean Squares. Subsequently, a dataset for side-channel attack authentication is gathered and preprocessed, followed by feature extraction and classification using Adaptive Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (ADS-CNNs), which enhances security against side-channel attacks. The quantum state is evaluated based on the signal received, and raw data are collected. Thereafter, a connection is established between the transmitter and receiver. Both the transmitter and receiver perform the scanning process. Thereafter, the calculation and correction of the error rate are performed based on the sifting results. Ultimately, privacy amplification and key authentication are performed using the repaired key via B-CHMAC-EPQH. The proposed system demonstrated improved resistance to decoherence and side-channel attacks, while achieving a reconciliation efficiency above 90% and increased key generation rate.

While QC holds the potential to accelerate optimization, drug discovery, and genomic analysis as hardware capabilities advance, current implementations remain limited compared to classical computing in many practical applications. Meanwhile, ML has already demonstrated significant success in medical imaging, predictive modeling, and decision support. Their convergence, particularly through quantum machine learning (QML), presents opportunities for future advancements in processing high-dimensional healthcare data and improving clinical outcomes.

TI Security intrusion detection using quantum machine learning techniques
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VIROLOGY AND HACKING TECHNIQUES
AB Conventional machine learning approaches applied for the security intrusion detection degrades in case of big data input (10(6) and more samples in a dataset). Model training and computing by traditional machine learning executed on big data at a common computing environment may produce accurate outputs but take a long time, or produce poor accuracy by quick training, both disparate to malicious activity. The paper observes the quantum machine learning (QMI,) methods overcoming the barriers of big data and the computing abilities of common hardware for the purpose of high performance intrusion detection. Quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and quantum convolution neural network (QCNN) as concurrent methods are discussed and evaluated comparing to the conventional intrusion detectors running on the traditional computer. The QML-based intrusion detection utilizes our own dataset that implements the grouping of the network packets into the input streams eatable for the QML. We have developed the software solution that encodes the network traffic streams ready to the quantum computing. Experimental results show the ability of the QML-based intrusion detection for processing big data inputs with high accuracy (98%) providing a twice faster speed comparing to the conventional machine learning algorithms utilized for the same task.

AB Point defects in diamond, particularly nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, have emerged as powerful tools for a broad range of quantum technologies. These defects are promising candidates for quantum information science, serving as deterministic single-photon sources and solid-state quantum memories. They have also been employed as nanoscale quantum sensors to detect various physical quantities, including magnetic fields, electric fields, and temperature, owing to their long spin coherence time at room temperature. Development of these diamond-based quantum technologies has been rapidly boosted by a recent quantum leap in nanofabrication technologies for high-quality single-crystal diamond.

TI Testing and Debugging Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article introduces a process framework for debugging quantum circuits, focusing on three distinct types of circuit blocks: amplitude-permutation, phase-modulation, and amplitude-redistribution circuit blocks. Our research addresses the critical need for specialized debugging approaches tailored to the unique properties of each circuit type. For amplitude-permutation circuits, we propose techniques to correct amplitude-permutations mimicking classical operations. In phase-modulation circuits, our proposed strategy targets the precise calibration of phase alterations essential for quantum computations. The most complex amplitude-redistribution circuits demand advanced methods to adjust probability amplitudes. This research bridges a vital gap in current methodologies and lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum circuit debugging. Our contributions are twofold: we present a comprehensive unit testing tool (Cirquo) and debugging approaches tailored to the unique demands of quantum computing, and we provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness in optimizing quantum circuit performance. This work is a crucial step toward realizing robust quantum computing systems and their applications in various domains.

TI Nonlinear quantum error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a theory of quantum error correction (QEC) for a subclass of states. In the standard theory of QEC, the set of all encoded states is formed by an arbitrary linear combination of the codewords. However, this can be more general than required for a given quantum protocol which may only traverse a subclass of states within the Hilbert space. Here we propose the concept of nonlinear QEC (NLQEC), where the encoded states are not necessarily a linear combination of codewords. We introduce a sufficiency criterion for NLQEC with respect to the subclass of states. The new criterion gives a more relaxed condition for the formation of a QEC code, such that under the assumption that the states are within the subclass of states, the errors are correctable. This allows us, for instance, to effectively circumvent the no-go theorems regarding optical QEC for Gaussian states and channels, for which we present explicit examples.

TI Quantum computing of chirality imbalance in SU(2) gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1 & thorn; 1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.

AB State-of-the-art quantum computers already comprise hundreds of cryogenic quantum bits (qubits), and prototypes with over 10k qubits are currently being developed. Such large-scale systems require local cryogenic electronics for qubit control and readout, leaving the digital controllers for algorithm execution and quantum error correction (QEC) at room temperature due to the limited cryogenic cooling budget. The entire process, including qubit readout, data transmission, QEC, and algorithm execution, should be completed well within the qubit decoherence time, thus requiring a low-power high-speed communication link between the cryogenic quantum processor and classical processor located at room temperature. To this end, this paper presents the first cryo-CMOS high-speed 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) wireline transmitter. Thanks to a power-efficient serializing architecture driving a 6-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), the 40-nm CMOS chip achieves a data rate of 40 Gb/s PAM4 with an efficiency of 2.46 pJ/b and a ratio of level mismatch (RLM) of 97.8% at 4.2 K. While demonstrating an energy efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art transmitters in more advanced CMOS nodes, the extremely wide temperature operating range (4.2K - 300 K) will enable future large-scale quantum computers.

TI Quantum Computing with Superconducting Circuits in the Picosecond Regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We discuss the realization of a universal set of ultrafast single- and two-qubit operations with superconducting quantum circuits and investigate the most relevant physical and technical limitations that arise when pushing for faster and faster gates. With the help of numerical optimization techniques, we establish a fundamental bound on the minimal gate time, which is determined independently of the qubit design solely by its nonlinearity. In addition, important practical restrictions arise from the finite qubit transition frequency and the limited bandwidth of the control pulses. We show that, for highly anharmonic flux qubits and commercially available control electronics, elementary single- and two-qubit operations can be implemented in about 100 ps with residual gate errors below 10-4. Under the same conditions, we simulate the complete execution of a compressed version of Shor's algorithm for factoring the number 15 in about 1 ns. These results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art implementations with transmon qubits, a hundredfold increase in the speed of gate operations with superconducting circuits is still feasible.

TI Quantum Computing for Healthcare: A Review
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB In recent years, the interdisciplinary field of quantum computing has rapidly developed and garnered substantial interest from both academia and industry due to its ability to process information in fundamentally different ways, leading to hitherto unattainable computational capabilities. However, despite its potential, the full extent of quantum computing's impact on healthcare remains largely unexplored. This survey paper presents the first systematic analysis of the various capabilities of quantum computing in enhancing healthcare systems, with a focus on its potential to revolutionize compute-intensive healthcare tasks such as drug discovery, personalized medicine, DNA sequencing, medical imaging, and operational optimization. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we have developed taxonomies across different dimensions, including background and enabling technologies, applications, requirements, architectures, security, open issues, and future research directions, providing a panoramic view of the quantum computing paradigm for healthcare. Our survey aims to aid both new and experienced researchers in quantum computing and healthcare by helping them understand the current research landscape, identifying potential opportunities and challenges, and making informed decisions when designing new architectures and applications for quantum computing in healthcare.

TI Efficient quantum algorithm for all quantum wavelet transforms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Wavelet transforms are widely used in various fields of science and engineering as a mathematical tool with features that reveal information ignored by the Fourier transform. Unlike the Fourier transform, which is unique, a wavelet transform is specified by a sequence of numbers associated with the type of wavelet used and an order parameter specifying the length of the sequence. While the quantum Fourier transform, a quantum analog of the classical Fourier transform, has been pivotal in quantum computing, prior works on quantum wavelet transforms (QWTs) were limited to the second and fourth order of a particular wavelet, the Daubechies wavelet. Here we develop a simple yet efficient quantum algorithm for executing any wavelet transform on a quantum computer. Our approach is to decompose the kernel matrix of a wavelet transform as a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) that are compilable by easy-to-implement modular quantum arithmetic operations and use the LCU technique to construct a probabilistic procedure to implement a QWT with a known success probability. We then use properties of wavelets to make this approach deterministic by a few executions of the amplitude amplification strategy. We extend our approach to a multilevel wavelet transform and a generalized version, the packet wavelet transform, establishing computational complexities in terms of three parameters: the wavelet order M, the dimension N of the transformation matrix, and the transformation level d. We show the cost is logarithmic in N, linear in d and superlinear in M. Moreover, we show the cost is independent of M for practical applications. Our proposed QWTs could be used in quantum computing algorithms in a similar manner to their well-established counterpart, the quantum Fourier transform.

In particular, some steps of the implementation, as the preparation of an arbitrary superposition state and readout of the final state, in most of the cases can surpass the complexity aspects of the algorithm itself. We present the complexity involved in the full implementation of circuit-based quantum algorithms, from state preparation to the number of measurements needed to obtain good statistics from the final states of the quantum system, in order to assess the overall space and time costs of the processes.

TI Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Packet switching revolutionized the Internet by allowing the efficient use of network resources for data transmission. In a previous work, we introduced packet switching in quantum networks as a path to the Quantum Internet and presented a proof-of-concept for its application to quantum key distribution (QKD). In this paper, we outline a three-step approach for key rate optimization in a packet-switched network. Our simulated results show that practical key rates may be achieved in a sixteen-user network with no optical storage capacity. Under certain network conditions, we may improve the key rate by using an ultra-low-loss fiber delay line to store packets during network delays. We also find that implementing cut-off storage times in a strategy analogous to real-time selection in free-space QKD can significantly enhance performance. Our work demonstrates that packet switching is imminently suitable as a platform for QKD, an important step towards developing large-scale and integrated quantum networks.

TI Ultra-high strained diamond spin register with coherent optical control
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Solid-state spin defects, such as color centers in diamond, are among the most promising candidates for scalable and integrated quantum technologies. In particular, the good optical properties of silicon-vacancy centers in diamond, combined with naturally occurring and exceptionally coherent nuclear spins, serve as a building block for quantum networking applications. Here, we show that leveraging an ultra-high-strained silicon-vacancy center inside a nanodiamond allows us to coherently and efficiently control its electron spin, while mitigating phonon-induced dephasing at liquid helium temperature. Moreover, we indirectly control and characterize a 13C nuclear spin and establish a quantum register. We overcome limited nuclear spin initialization by implementing single-shot nuclear spin readout. Lastly, we demonstrate coherent optical control with GHz rates, thus opening a potential connection of the register to the optical domain. Our work paves the way for future integration of quantum network registers into conventional, well-established photonics and hybrid quantum communication systems.

TI Quantum BER estimation modelling and analysis for satellite-based
   quantum key distribution scenarios
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The quantum communication channel is considered to be eavesdropped when the signal Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) exceeds a defined theoretical limit and is thus considered a figure of merit parameter for assessing the security of a quantum channel. This work presents a general mathematical model considering device imperfections and various sources of errors for estimating signal QBER in polarisation encoded satellite-based QKD systems. QBER performance for satellite-to-ground downlink scenarios has been investigated for multiple sky brightness conditions (day time and night time operations), two operating wavebands: 800 and 1550 nm as well as for different quantum transmitter and quantum receiver architectures. Further, a novel QBER estimation analysis for inter-satellite QKD links has also been presented. The estimation results obtained from the developed model have been validated against and found in good agreement with the measured results of the only reported satellite-to-ground QKD experiments till date. The presented QBER modelling and analysis will aid in system engineering and efficient design of future satellite-based QKD systems.
   This work introduces a general mathematical model for estimating the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) in polarisation encoded satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) scenarios. The model accounts for errors caused by stray light, polarisation errors, dark noise, and after-pulsing effects in single photon detectors. The performance of satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite QKD scenarios under different sky brightness conditions using standard wavebands (800 and 1550 nm), aiding in the efficient design of satellite-based QKD systems for longer distances with various transmitter and receiver architectures has been investigated. The estimated results from the model are validated against several reported experiments, demonstrating good agreement.image

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We answer an open question about Quantum Key Recycling (QKR): Is it possible to put the message entirely in the qubits without increasing the number of qubits compared to existing QKR schemes? We show that this is indeed possible. We introduce a prepareand-measure QKR protocol where the communication from Alice to Bob consists entirely of qubits. As usual, Bob responds with an authenticated one-bit accept/reject classical message.
   Compared to Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), QKR has reduced round complexity. Compared to previous qubit-based QKR protocols, our scheme has far less classical communication.
   We provide a security proof in the universal composability framework and find that the communication rate is asymptotically the same as for QKD with one-way post-processing.

TI Gauge-invariant quantum circuits for U(1) and Yang-Mills lattice
   gauge theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computation represents an emerging framework to solve lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with arbitrary gauge groups, a general and long-standing problem in computational physics. While quantum computers may encode LGTs using only polynomially increasing resources, a major open issue concerns the violation of gauge invariance during the dynamics and the search for ground states. Here, we propose a class of parametrized quantum circuits that can represent states belonging only to the physical sector of the total Hilbert space. This class of circuits is compact yet flexible enough to be used as a variational Ansatz to study ground-state properties, as well as representing states originating from a real-time dynamics. Concerning the first application, the structure of the wavefunction Ansatz guarantees the preservation of physical constraints such as the Gauss law along the entire optimization process, enabling reliable variational calculations. As for the second application, this class of quantum circuits can be used in combination with time-dependent variational quantum algorithms, thus drastically reducing the resource requirements to access dynamical properties.

TI Optimal measurement of field properties with quantum sensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a quantum sensor network of qubit sensors coupled to a field f (x; theta) analytically parameterized by the vector of parameters theta. The qubit sensors are fixed at positions x(1), ..., x(d). While the functional form of f (x; theta) is known, the parameters theta are not. We derive saturable bounds on the precision of measuring an arbitrary analytic function q(theta) of these parameters and construct the optimal protocols that achieve these bounds. Our results are obtained from a combination of techniques from quantum information theory and duality theorems for linear programming. They can be applied to many problems, including optimal placement of quantum sensors, field interpolation, and the measurement of functionals of parametrized fields.

   generalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Much attention has been paid to dynamical simulation and quantum machine learning (QML) independently as applications for quantum advantage, while the possibility of using QML to enhance dynamical simulations has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we develop a framework for using QML methods to simulate quantum dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. We use generalization bounds, which bound the error a machine learning model makes on unseen data, to rigorously analyze the training data requirements of an algorithm within this framework. Our algorithm is thus resource efficient in terms of qubit and data requirements. Furthermore, our preliminary numerics for the XY model exhibit efficient scaling with problem size, and we simulate 20 times longer than Trotterization on IBMQ-Bogota.

TI Improving the number of T gates and their spread in integer multipliers
   on quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum circuits performing arithmetic operations are critical in quantum computing because of the need for such operations in proven quantum algorithms. Although quantum computers are becoming increasingly resourceful, the number of qubits currently available is still limited. Furthermore, these qubits are heavily affected by internal and external noise. It has been proven that quantum circuits built using Clifford +T gates can be made fault tolerant. However, the use of the T gates comes at a very high cost. If the number of T gates used in a circuit is not optimized, the cost of the circuit will be increased excessively. As a consequence, it is essential to optimize the circuits so that they are as resource efficient as possible and also noise tolerant. This paper presents the design of a circuit to perform the multiplication of two integers. The circuit is built using only Clifford +T gates for compatibility with error detection and correction codes. It outperforms the circuits in the state of the art in terms of T count and T depth.

TI All-Photonic Architecture for Scalable Quantum Computing with
   Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Linear optical quantum computing is beset by the lack of deterministic entangling operations besides photon loss. Motivated by advancements at the experimental front in deterministic generation of various kinds of multiphoton entangled states, we propose an architecture for linear-optical quantum computing that harnesses the availability of three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Our architecture and its subvariants use polarized photons in GHZ states, polarization beam splitters, delay lines, optical switches, and on-off detectors. We concatenate the topological quantum error-correction code with three-qubit repetition codes and estimate that our architecture can tolerate a remarkably high photon-loss rate of 11.5%; this makes a drastic change that is at least an order higher than those of known proposals. Furthermore, considering three-photon GHZ states as resources, we estimate the resource overheads to perform gate operations with an accuracy of 10(-6) (10(-15)) to be 2.07 x 10(6) (5.03 x 10(7)). Compared to other all-photonic schemes, our architecture is also resource efficient. In addition, the resource overhead can be even further improved if larger GHZ states are available. Given its striking enhancement in the photon-loss threshold and the recent progress in generating multiphoton entanglement, our scheme moves scalable photonic quantum computing a step closer to reality.

TI q-analog qudit Dicke states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Dicke states are completely symmetric states of multiple qubits (2-level systems), and qudit Dicke states are their d-level generalization. We define here q-deformed qudit Dicke states using the quantum algebra suq(d) . We show that these states can be compactly expressed as a weighted sum over permutations with q-factors involving the so-called inversion number, an important permutation statistic in Combinatorics. We use this result to compute the bipartite entanglement entropy of these states. We also discuss the preparation of these states on a quantum computer, and show that introducing a q-dependence does not change the circuit gate count.

TI Preparation of heralded high-fidelity high-dimensional entangled states
   implemented with qudit-encoded photon systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Compared with traditional two-dimensional qubits, higher-dimensional qubits offer a larger state space for storing and processing information, which can manifest stronger non-classical correlations, simplify circuit complexity, reduce computational resources, and enhance loss tolerance in photon-based quantum information processing. To harness the potential, essential research on preparing qudit-based high-dimensional entangled states is necessary. In the paper, we propose the preparation procedure of arbitrary four-dimensional two-qudit entanglement and three-qudit entanglement for photon systems implemented with error-heralded quantum devices and controlled-not gates. Moreover, as the practical errors that grow out of defective photon scattering, i.e., coupling strength restriction of the quantum-dot-cavity system and cavity leakage imperfection, can be turned into the response of the single-photon detectors, the generation of arbitrary high-dimensional entanglement appears in an error-heralded way, and their fidelities are robust, enhancing experimental accessibility.

TI Multipartite continuous-variable optical quantum entanglement:
   Generation and application
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for various quantum applications and generation of largescale entanglement is a key quantum technology. In recent years, continuous-variable optical systems have shown promising results in this direction, thanks to deterministic generation and multiplexing via rich degrees of freedom naturally occurring in the optical system. In this paper, we review the generation and applications of multipartite optical quantum entanglement. We begin with a theoretical overview of how to represent and verify multimode continuous-variable quantum states and entanglement. Then, we discuss the multiplexing technique in time, frequency, and spatial domains, and their applications in generation of large-scale entangled states. Afterward, we review the current status and development of the basic technology used in the generation of multipartite quantum entanglement. Finally, we discuss the applications of large-scale quantum entanglement and possible future perspectives.

TI The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics in one dimension on a
   quantum computer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behaviour of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce colour-neutrality constraints. This work pioneers the quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colours, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.

TI Upper bounds for the clock speeds of fault-tolerant distributed quantum
   computation using satellites to supply entangled photon pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Despite recent advances in quantum repeater networks, entanglement distribution on a continental scale remains prohibitively difficult and resource intensive. Using satellites to distribute maximally entangled photons (Bell pairs) between distant stations is an intriguing alternative. Quantum satellite networks are known to be viable for quantum key distribution, but the question of if such a network is feasible for fault tolerant distributed quantum computation (FTDQC) has so far been unaddressed. In this paper we determine a closed form expression for the rate at which logical Bell pairs can be produced between distant surface code encoded qubits using a satellite network to supply imperfect physical Bell pairs. With generous parameter assumptions, our results show that FTDQC with satellite networks over statewide distances (500-999 km) is possible up to a collective clock rate on the order of 1 MHz, while continental (1000-4999 km) and transcontinental (5000+ km) distances run on the order of 10 kHz and 100 Hz, respectively.

TI Zero-error attack against coherent-one-way quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Coherent-one-way (COW) quantum key distribution (QKD) held the promise of distributing secret keys over long distances with a simple experimental setup. Indeed, this scheme is currently used in commercial applications. Surprisingly, however, it has been recently shown that its secret key rate scales at most quadratically with the system's transmittance and, thus, it is not appropriate for long distance QKD transmission. Such pessimistic result was derived by employing a so-called zero-error attack, in which the eavesdropper does not introduce any error, but still the legitimate users of the system cannot distill a secure key. Here, we present an improved zero-error attack against COW-QKD that significantly outperforms previous approaches, and provides stronger restrictions on its maximum achievable distance in the absence of errors. This translates into an upper bound on its secret key rate that is more than an order of magnitude lower than previously known upper bounds.

TI A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach to Mitigating Measurement Errors in
   Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB When noisy intermediate scalable quantum (NISQ) devices are applied in information processing, all of the stages through preparation, manipulation, and measurement of multipartite qubit states contain various types of noise that are generally hard to be verified in practice. In this article, we present a scheme to deal with unknown quantum noise and show that it can be used to mitigate errors in measurement readout with NISQ devices. Quantum detector tomography that identifies a type of noise in a measurement can be circumvented. The scheme applies single-qubit operations only, that are with relatively higher precision than measurement readout or two-qubit gates. A classical post-processing is then performed with measurement outcomes. The scheme is implemented in quantum algorithms with NISQ devices: the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and a quantum amplitude estimation algorithm in IBMQ_yorktown and IBMQ-essex. The enhancement in the statistics of the measurement outcomes is presented for both of the algorithms with NISQ devices.

TI Area and volume as emergent phenomena from entangled qubits
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Recently, a connection has been shown between certain geometric quantities and quantum information theory. In this paper, we demonstrate that geometric quantities such as area and volume can emerge directly from entangled multi-qubit states. In particular, the area of a two-dimensional parallelogram is derived from a 4-qubit entangled state, the vector area of a three-dimensional parallelogram from three 6-qubit entangled states, and the volume of a three-dimensional parallelepiped from a 9-qubit entangled state. Corresponding quantum circuits are constructed and implemented using Qiskit to generate the required entangled states. Given that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as elementary building blocks for more complex geometric structures, these results may offer a pathway toward exploring emergent geometry in quantum information frameworks.

TI Realization of Quantum Swap Gate and Generation of Entangled Coherent
   States
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The cross fusion of quantum mechanics and information science forms quantum information science. Quantum logic gates and quantum entanglement are very important building blocks in quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose one-step schemes for realizing quantum swap gates and generating two-mode entangled coherent states via circuit QED. In our scheme, due to the adiabatic elimination of the excited state of the qutrit under the condition of large detuning, the decoherence of the spontaneous emission of the qutrit can be ignored. The fidelity of the quantum swap gate remains at a very high level. In addition, we also explore the nonclassical properties of two-mode entangled coherent states prepared in our scheme by addressing the second-order correlation function and intermodal squeezing. In particular, two classes of entangled coherent states demonstrate distinct entanglement and nonclassical behavior.

AB Optimizing quantum circuits is critical: the number of quantum operations needs to be minimized for a successful evaluation of a circuit on a quantum processor. In this paper we unify two disparate ideas for optimizing quantum circuits, rewrite rules, which are fast standard optimizer passes, and unitary synthesis, which is slow, requiring a search through the space of circuits. We present a clean, unifying framework for thinking of rewriting and resynthesis as abstract circuit transformations. We then present a radically simple algorithm, guoq, for optimizing quantum circuits that exploits the synergies of rewriting and resynthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the ability of guoq to strongly outperform existing optimizers on a wide range of benchmarks.

TI Spin-photon entanglement with direct photon emission in the telecom
   C-band
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum networks, relying on the distribution of quantum entanglement between remote locations, have the potential to transform quantum computation and secure long-distance quantum communication. However, a fundamental ingredient for fibre-based implementations of such networks, namely entanglement between a single spin and a photon directly emitted at telecom wavelengths, has been unattainable so far. Here, we use a negatively charged exciton in an InAs/InP quantum dot to implement an optically active spin qubit taking advantage of the lowest-loss transmission window, the telecom C-band. We investigate the coherent interactions of the spin-qubit system under resonant excitation, demonstrating high fidelity spin initialisation and coherent control using picosecond pulses. We further use these tools to measure the coherence of a single, undisturbed electron spin in our system. Finally, we demonstrate spin-photon entanglement in a solid-state system with entanglement fidelity F = 80.07 +/- 2.9%, more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit.
   Quantum communication networks would greatly benefit from the possibility to have solid-state emitters being directly interfaced with telecom fibers, without the need for wavelength conversion. Here, the authors demonstrate coherent control of an InAs/InP quantum dot, as well as entanglement between its electron spin and the frequency of a telecom photon.

TI Reading the road: challenges and opportunities on the path to
   responsible innovation in quantum computing
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB Novel technologies such as quantum computing present new opportunities to support societal needs, but societal engagement is vital to secure public trust. Quantum computing technologies are at a pivotal point in their journey from foundational research to deployment, creating a moment for society to investigate, reflect, and consult on their implications. Responsible Innovation (RI) is one method for considering impacts, engaging with societal needs, reflecting on any concerns, and influencing the trajectory of the innovation in response. This paper draws on the empirical work of the RI team embedded in the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub. The team investigated researchers' perceptions of RI and their understanding of societal impacts of quantum technologies, and sought to gauge the challenges of embedding RI across a multi-disciplinary, large-scale enterprise such as the UK quantum programme. The work demonstrated some of the difficulties involved in embedding RI approaches, and in creating a dialogue between innovators and societies. Finally, the authors offer recommendations to policymakers, researchers, and industrial organisations, for better practice in responsible quantum computing, and to ensure that societal considerations are discussed alongside commercial motivations. Applying RI to quantum computing at this pivotal point has implications for RI in other emerging technologies.

Leveraging properties of multipartite quantum correlations, quantum conference key agreement can be implemented more efficiently in large-scale quantum networks. Inspired by the all-photonic quantum repeater, we propose an based on all-photonic architectures. The scheme enables flexible generation of common secret keys among users without the need for quantum memories, and it can even work if some users do not actively send signals. As an illustration, we show in detail a four-party network, in which secure communications are established among two or three participants. We present further simulation results that incorporate detector imperfections to evaluate the performance and feasibility in real-life situations.

TI Insights from incorporating quantum computing into drug design workflows
SO BIOINFORMATICS
AB Motivation: While many quantum computing (QC) methods promise theoretical advantages over classical counterparts, quantum hardware remains limited. Exploiting near-term QC in computer-aided drug design (CADD) thus requires judicious partitioning between classical and quantum calculations. Results: We present HypaCADD, a hybrid classical-quantum workflow for finding ligands binding to proteins, while accounting for genetic mutations. We explicitly identify modules of our drug-design workflow currently amenable to replacement by QC: non-intuitively, we identify the mutation-impact predictor as the best candidate. HypaCADD thus combines classical docking and molecular dynamics with quantum machine learning (QML) to infer the impact of mutations. We present a case study with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) protease and associated mutants. We map a classical machine-learning module onto QC, using a neural network constructed from qubit-rotation gates. We have implemented this in simulation and on two commercial quantum computers. We find that the QML models can perform on par with, if not better than, classical baselines. In summary, HypaCADD offers a successful strategy for leveraging QC for CADD.

TI Detecting a Target With Quantum Entanglement
SO IEEE AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
AB Over the last decade, research activity has focused on the use of quantum entanglement as a resource for remote target detection, i.e., on the design of a quantum radar. The literature on this subject uses tools of quantum optics and quantum information theory, and therefore, results are often obscure to radar engineers. This tutorial has been written with the purpose of removing this obscurity. As such, it contains a review of the main advances in quantum radar literature accompanied by a thorough introduction of the quantum optics background necessary for its understanding.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB With the ability to transfer and process quantum information, large-scale quantum networks will enable a suite of fundamentally new applications, from quantum communications to distributed sensing, metrology, and computing. This Perspective reviews requirements for quantum network nodes and color centers in diamond as suitable node candidates. We give a brief overview of state-of-the-art quantum network experiments employing color centers in diamond and discuss future research directions, focusing, in particular, on the control and coherence of qubits that distribute and store entangled states, and on efficient spin-photon interfaces. We discuss a route toward large-scale integrated devices combining color centers in diamond with other photonic materials and give an outlook toward realistic future quantum network protocol implementations and applications.

TI Leveraging Quantum Machine Learning Generalization to Significantly
   Speed up Quantum Compilation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Existing numerical optimizers deployed in quantum compilers use expensive O(4(n)) matrix-matrix operations. Inspired by recent advances in quantum machine learning, QFactor-Sample replaces matrix-matrix operations with simpler O(2(n)) circuit simulations on a set of sample inputs. The simpler the circuit, the lower the number of required input samples. We validate QFactor-Sample on a large set of circuits and discuss its hyperparameter. When incorporated in the BQSKit quantum compiler and compared against a state-of-the-art domain-specific optimizer, we demonstrate improved scalability and reduced compile time, achieving an average speedup factor of 69 for circuits with more than eight qubits. We also discuss how improved numerical optimization affects the dynamics of partitioning-based compilation schemes, which allow a tradeoff between compilation speed and solution quality.

TI Room-temperature photonic logical qubits via second-order nonlinearities
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recent progress in nonlinear optical materials and microresonators has brought quantum computing with bulk optical nonlinearities into the realm of possibility. This platform is of great interest, not only because photonics is an obvious choice for quantum networks, but also as a promising route to quantum information processing at room temperature. We propose an approach for reprogrammable room-temperature photonic quantum logic that significantly simplifies the realization of various quantum circuits, and in particular, of error correction. The key element is the programmable photonic multi-mode resonator that implements reprogrammable bosonic quantum logic gates, while using only the bulk chi ((2)) nonlinear susceptibility. We theoretically demonstrate that just two of these elements suffice for a complete, compact error-correction circuit on a bosonic code, without the need for measurement or feed-forward control. Encoding and logical operations on the code are also easily achieved with these reprogrammable quantum photonic processors. An extrapolation of current progress in nonlinear optical materials and photonic circuits indicates that such circuitry should be achievable within the next decade. Photonic quantum computation via bulk optical nonlinearities presents challenges, due to the weakness of nonlinearity and the difficulties in doing without feed-forward control. Here, the authors propose an all-unitary approach that is based on a triply-resonant cavity with a time-dependent drive.

TI Security and application of semi-quantum key distribution protocol for
   users with different quantum capabilities
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Semi-quantum protocols serve as a bridge between quantum users and "classical" users with limited quantum capabilities, providing support for application scenarios that cannot afford the excessively high cost of quantum resources. In this paper, we present a semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocol based on Bell states and single particles, which is designed for key distribution between different types of users. The protocol enables simultaneous key distribution between quantum and classical users, as well as key establishment between two classical users. The security analysis demonstrates that the protocol can reach the same level of security as the full quantum protocol. Furthermore, we extrapolate the proposed protocol to other semi-quantum protocols, such as semi-quantum key agreement and semi-quantum private comparison protocols. Compared with previous similar ones, our SQKD protocol and its extended versions can fulfill the requirements of their respective counterparts individually. Therefore, our SQKD protocol has the potential for broader applications in practical scenarios.

TI When are Quantum Algorithms Applicable for Signal Decoding in Wireless
   Communication?
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology utilizes multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver to enhance data transmission speeds and reliability. Traditional MIMO decoding methods, however, can become increasingly complex as the number of antennas and modulation order rises. Quantum computing brings forth a new realm of information processing with significant potential. This study investigates the applicability of quantum algorithms for decoding information in MIMO wireless communication systems. Specifically, the Durr-Hoyer quantum search, based on Grover's algorithm, and optimal quantum sorting algorithms are leveraged to reduce the query complexity with an analysis of the complexity and achievable bit error rate performance of the quantum-assisted decoders. The study considers cases of MIMO diversity, spatial modulation, and multiplexing transmission using both maximum-likelihood and fixed-complexity sphere decoders. By examining a variety of communication scenarios, this work aims to assess the applicability of quantum algorithms across different operational regimes and aids in extending the methodology to other communication systems.

TI One-Way Network Nonlocality of Continuous Variable Entangled Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nonlocality is a key feature of quantum networks and is being studied for its potential applications in quantum communication and computing. Understanding and harnessing nonlocality in quantum networks can lead to the development of faster and more secure communication systems. All the nonclassicalities are limited to discrete variable quantum networks. The first method is proposed to verify the network nonlocality of all optical quantum network consisting of two entangled states where one-way classical communication is allowed. This provides the first device-independent method to verify the quantum correlations generated from all optical continuous-variable quantum networks.

TI Enhancing Quantum Entanglement Through Parametric Control of Atom-Cavity

SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Dicke states form a class of entangled states that has attracted much attention for their applications in various quantum algorithms. They emerge as eigenstates of the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian, a simplification of the Dicke model, which describes an assembly of two-level atoms trapped in an electromagnetic cavity. In this letter, it is showed that in the regime where the field energy is large with respect to the atomic energy splitting, precise control of the ground state can be implemented. Specifically, pure Dicke states can be selected and produced by appropriate tuning of the parameters. This result may have important applications in quantum engineering and quantum information theory.

TI Variational quantum simulation of long-range interacting systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Current quantum simulators suffer from multiple limitations such as short coherence time, noisy operations, faulty readout and restricted qubit connectivity in some platforms. Variational quantum algorithms are the most promising approach in near-term quantum simulation to achieve practical quantum advantage over classical computers. Here, we explore variational quantum algorithms, with different levels of qubit connectivity, for digital simulation of the ground state of long-range interacting systems as well as generation of spin squeezed states. We find that as the interaction becomes more long-ranged, the variational algorithms become less efficient, achieving lower fidelity and demanding more optimization iterations. In particular, when the system is near its criticality the efficiency is even lower. Increasing the connectivity between distant qubits improves the results, even with less quantum and classical resources. Our results show that by mixing circuit layers with different levels of connectivity one can sensibly improve the performance. Interestingly, the order of layers becomes very important and grouping the layers with long-distance connectivity at the beginning of the circuit outperforms other permutations. The same design of circuits can also be used to variationally produce spin squeezed states, as a resource for quantum metrology.

TI Spectral quantum algorithm for passive scalar transport in shear flows
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The mixing of scalar substances in fluid flows by stirring and diffusion is ubiquitous in natural flows, chemical engineering, and microfluidic drug delivery. Here, we present a spectral quantum algorithm for scalar mixing by solving the advection-diffusion equation in a quantum computational fluid dynamics framework. The exact gate decompositions of the advection and diffusion operators in spectral space are derived. For all but the simplest one-dimensional flows, these operators do not commute. Therefore, we use operator splitting to construct quantum circuits capable of simulating arbitrary polynomial velocity profiles in multiple dimensions, such as the Blasius profile of a laminar boundary layer. Periodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed with the appropriate quantum spectral transform. We evaluate the approach in statevector simulations of a Couette flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and a polynomial Blasius profile approximation. For an advection-diffusion problem in one dimension, we compare the time evolution of an ideal quantum simulation with those of real quantum computers with superconducting and trapped-ion qubits. The required number of two-qubit gates grows with the logarithm of the number of grid points raised to one higher power than the order of the polynomial velocity profile.

TI Stabilizer Entanglement Distillation and Efficient Fault-Tolerant
   Encoders
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Entanglement is essential for quantum information processing, but is limited by noise. We address this by developing high-yield entanglement distillation protocols with several advancements. (1) We extend the 2-to-1 recurrence entanglement distillation protocol to higher-rate n-to-(n - 1) protocols that can correct any single-qubit errors. These protocols are evaluated through numerical simulations focusing on fidelity and yield. We also outline a method to adapt any classical error-correcting code for entanglement distillation, where the code can correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by incorporating Hadamard gates. (2) We propose a constant-depth decoder for stabilizer codes that transforms logical states into physical ones using single-qubit measurements. This decoder is applied to entanglement distillation protocols, reducing circuit depth and enabling protocols derived from high-performance quantum error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this by evaluating the circuit complexity for entanglement distillation protocols based on surface codes and quantum convolutional codes. (3) Our stabilizer entanglement distillation techniques advance quantum computing. We propose a fault-tolerant protocol for constant-depth encoding and decoding of arbitrary states in surface codes, with potential extensions to more general quantum low-density parity-check codes. This protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art reconfigurable atom arrays and surpasses the limits of conventional logarithmic depth encoders. Overall, our study integrates stabilizer formalism, measurement-based quantum computing, and entanglement distillation, advancing both quantum communication and computing.

TI Quantum Simulation with Hybrid Tensor Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Tensor network theory and quantum simulation are, respectively, the key classical and quantum computing methods in understanding quantum many-body physics. Here, we introduce the framework of hybrid tensor networks with building blocks consisting of measurable quantum states and classically contractable tensors, inheriting both their distinct features in efficient representation of many-body wave functions. With the example of hybrid tree tensor networks, we demonstrate efficient quantum simulation using a quantum computer whose size is significantly smaller than the one of the target system. We numerically benchmark our method for finding the ground state of 1D and 2D spin systems of up to 8 x 8 and 9 x 8 qubits with operations only acting on 8 + 1 and 9 + 1 qubits, respectively. Our approach sheds light on simulation of large practical problems with intermediate-scale quantum computers, with potential applications in chemistry, quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory, and quantum gravity thought experiments.

TI High-Dimensional Entanglement of Photonic Angular Qudits
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We propose a method for generation of entangled photonic states in high dimensions, the so-called qudits, by exploiting quantum correlations of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) entangled photons, produced via Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion. Diffraction masks containing N angular slits placed in the path of twin photons define a qudit space of dimension N-2, spanned by the alternative pathways of OAM-entangled photons. We quantify the high-dimensional entanglement of path-entangled photons by the Concurrence, using an analytic expression valid for pure states. We report numerical results for the Concurrence as a function of the angular aperture size for the case of high-dimensional OAM entanglement and for the case of high-dimensional path entanglement, produced by N x M angular slits. Our results provide additional means for preparation and characterization of entangled quantum states in high-dimensions, a fundamental resource for quantum simulation and quantum information protocols.

TI A parallel quantum eigensolver for quantum machine learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Eigensolvers have a wide range of applications in machine learning. Quantum eigensolvers have been developed for achieving quantum speedup. Here, we propose a parallel quantum eigensolver (PQE) for solving a set of machine learning problems, which is based on quantum multi-resonant transitions that simultaneously trigger multiple energy transitions in the systems on demand. PQE has a polylogarithmic cost in problem size under certain circumstances and is hardware efficient, such that it is implementable in near-term quantum computers. As a verification, we utilize it to construct a collaborative filtering quantum recommendation system and implement an experiment of the movie recommendation tasks on a nuclear spin quantum processor. As a result, our recommendation system accurately suggests movies to the user that he/she might be interested in. We further demonstrate the applications of PQE in classification and image completion. In the future, our work will shed light on more applications in quantum machine learning.

TI A Practical Implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography for Secure
   Wireless Communication
SO NETWORK
AB Recent advances in quantum computing have prompted urgent consideration of the migration of classical cryptographic systems to post-quantum alternatives. However, it is impossible to fully understand the impact that migrating to current Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms will have on various applications without the actual implementation of quantum-resistant cryptography. On the other hand, PQC algorithms come with complexity and long processing times, which may impact the quality of service (QoS) of many applications. Therefore, PQC-based protocols with practical implementations across various applications are essential. This paper introduces a new framework for PQC standalone and PQC-AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) hybrid public-key encryption (PKE) protocols. Building on prior results, we focus on securing applications such as file transfer, video streaming, and chat-based communication using enhanced PQC-based protocols. The extended PQC-based protocols use a sequence number-based mechanism to effectively counter replay and man-in-the-middle attacks and mitigate standard cybersecurity attack vectors. Experimental evaluations examined encryption/decryption speeds, throughput, and processing overhead for the standalone PQC and the PQC-AES hybrid schemes, benchmarking them against traditional AES-256 in an existing client-server environment. The results demonstrate that the new approaches achieve a significant balance between security and system performance compared to conventional deployments. Furthermore, a comprehensive security analysis confirms the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed PQC-based protocols across diverse attack scenarios. Notably, the PQC-AES hybrid protocol demonstrates greater efficiency for applications handling larger data volumes (e.g., 10-100 KB) with reduced latency, underscoring the practical necessity of carefully balancing security and operational efficiency in the post-quantum migration process.

AB In the evolving field of quantum computing, optimizing Quantum Error Correction (QEC) parameters is crucial due to the varying types and amounts of physical noise across quantum computers. Traditional simulators use a forward paradigm to derive logical error rates from inputs like code distance and rounds, but this can lead to resource wastage. Adjusting QEC parameters manually with tools like STIM is often inefficient, especially given the daily fluctuations in quantum error rates. To address this, we introduce MITS, a reverse engineering tool for STIM that automatically determines optimal QEC settings based on a given quantum computer's noise model and a target logical error rate. This approach minimizes qubit and gate usage by precisely matching the necessary logical error rate with the constraints of qubit numbers and gate fidelity. Our investigations into various heuristics and machine learning models for MITS show that XGBoost and Random Forest regressions, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively, are highly effective in this context.

TI Fast Preparation and Detection of a Rydberg Qubit Using Atomic Ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate a new approach for fast preparation, manipulation, and collective readout of an atomic Rydberg-state qubit. By making use of Rydberg blockade inside a small atomic ensemble, we prepare a single qubit within 3 mu s with a success probability of F-p = 0.93 +/- 0.02, rotate it, and read out its state in 6 mu s with a single-shot fidelity of F-d = 0.92 +/- 0.04. The ensemble-assisted detection is 10(3) times faster than imaging of a single atom with the same optical resolution, and enables fast repeated nondestructive measurement. We observe qubit coherence times of 15 mu s, much longer than the pi rotation time of 90 ns. Potential applications ranging from faster quantum information processing in atom arrays to efficient implementation of quantum error correction are discussed.

TI Pricing Multi-Asset Derivatives by Finite-Difference Method on a Quantum
   Computer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Following the recent great advance of quantum computing technology, there are growing interests in its applications to industries, including finance. In this article, we focus on derivative pricing based on solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation by the finite-difference method (FDM), which is a suitable approach for some types of derivatives but suffers from the curse of dimensionality, that is, exponential growth of complexity in the case of multiple underlying assets. We propose a quantum algorithm for FDM-based pricing of multi-asset derivative with exponential speedup with respect to dimensionality compared with classical algorithms. The proposed algorithm utilizes the quantum algorithm for solving differential equations, which is based on quantum linear system algorithms. Addressing the specific issue in derivative pricing, that is, extracting the derivative price for the present underlying asset prices from the output state of the quantum algorithm, we present the whole of the calculation process and estimate its complexity. We believe that the proposed method opens the new possibility of accurate and high-speed derivative pricing by quantum computers.

TI Strong entanglement distribution of quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Large-scale quantum networks have been employed to overcome practical constraints of transmission and storage for single entangled systems. Our goal in this paper is to explore the strong entanglement distribution of quantum networks. We firstly show that any connected network consisting of generalized Einstein-PodolskyRosen states and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states satisfies the strong Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality in terms of the bipartite entanglement measure; in addition, the monogamy inequalities are also considered for generic entangled quantum networks. This reveals the interesting feature of high-dimensional entanglement with local tensor decomposition going beyond qubit entanglement. We then apply the entanglement distribution relation in entangled networks to get a quantum maximum-flow minimum-cut theorem in terms of von Neumann entropy and Renyi-alpha entropy. We finally classify entangled quantum networks by distinguishing network configurations under local unitary operations. These results provide insights into characterizing quantum networks in quantum information processing.

TI Self-adaptive physics-informed quantum machine learning for solving
   differential equations
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations (DEs). In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order linear DE, system of DEs, nonlinear Duffing and Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order DEs. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of DEs on quantum devices.

TI Chemical and structural identification of material defects in
   superconducting quantum circuits
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum circuits show unprecedented sensitivity to external fluctuations compared to their classical counterparts, and it can take as little as a single atomic defect somewhere in a mm-sized area to completely spoil device performance. For improved device coherence it is thus essential to find ways to reduce the number of defects, thereby lowering the hardware threshold for achieving fault-tolerant large-scale error-corrected quantum computing. Given the evasive nature of these defects, the materials science required to understand them is at present in uncharted territories, and new techniques must be developed to bridge existing capabilities from materials science with the needs identified by the superconducting quantum circuit community. In this paper, we give an overview of methods for characterising the chemical and structural properties of defects in materials relevant for superconducting quantum circuits. We cover recent developments from in-operation techniques, where quantum circuits are used as probes of the defects themselves, to in situ analysis techniques and well-established ex situ materials analysis techniques. The latter is now increasingly explored by the quantum circuits community to correlate specific material properties with qubit performance. We highlight specific techniques which, given further development, look especially promising and will contribute towards a future toolbox of material analysis techniques for quantum.

TI Probing two-qubit capacitive interactions beyond bilinear regime using
   dual Hamiltonian parameter estimations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We report the simultaneous operation and two-qubit-coupling measurement of a pair of two-electron spin qubits, actively decoupled from quasi-static nuclear noise in a GaAs quadruple quantum dot array. Coherent Rabi oscillations of both qubits (decay time approximate to 2 mu s; frequency few MHz) are achieved by continuously tuning their drive frequency using rapidly converging real-time Hamiltonian estimators. We observe strong two-qubit capacitive interaction (>190 MHz), combined with detuning pulses, inducing a state-conditional frequency shift. The two-qubit capacitive interaction is beyond the bilinear regime, consistent with recent theoretical predictions. We observe a high ratio (>16) between coherence and conditional phase-flip time, which supports the possibility of generating high-fidelity and fast quantum entanglement between encoded spin qubits using a simple capacitive interaction.

Yet, limited information currently available on the internal spin-optical dynamics of these color centers prevents us from achieving the optimal operation conditions and reaching the maximum performance especially when integrated within quantum photonics. Here, we establish all the relevant intrinsic spin dynamics of the VSi-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{Si}}}<^>{-}$$\end{document} center at cubic lattice site (V2) in 4H-SiC by an in-depth electronic fine structure modeling including the intersystem-crossing and deshelving mechanisms. With carefully designed spin-dependent measurements, we obtain all the previously unknown spin-selective radiative and non-radiative decay rates. To showcase the relevance of our work for integrated quantum photonics, we use the obtained rates to propose a realistic implementation of time-bin entangled multi-photon GHZ and cluster state generation. We find that up to three-photon GHZ or cluster states are readily within reach using the existing nanophotonic cavity technology.

TI Detecting positive quantum capacities of quantum channels
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Determining whether a noisy quantum channel can be used to reliably transmit quantum information is a challenging problem in quantum information theory. This is because it requires computation of the channel's coherent information for an unbounded number of copies of the channel. In this paper, we devise an elementary perturbative technique to solve this problem in a wide variety of circumstances. Our analysis reveals that a channel's ability to transmit information is intimately connected to the relative sizes of its input, output, and environment spaces. We exploit this link to develop easy tests which can be used to detect positivity of quantum channel capacities simply by comparing the channels' input, output, and environment dimensions. Several noteworthy examples, such as the depolarizing and transpose-depolarizing channels (including the Werner-Holevo channel), dephasing channels, generalized Pauli channels, multi-level amplitude damping channels, and (conjugate) diagonal unitary covariant channels, serve to aptly exhibit the utility of our method. Notably, in all these examples, the coherent information of a single copy of the channel turns out to be positive.

TI Solving Burgers' equation with quantum computing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are a vital part of the design process in the aerospace industry. Although reliable CFD results can be obtained with turbulence models, direct numerical simulation of complex bodies in three spatial dimensions (3D) is impracticable due to the massive amount of computational elements. For instance, a 3D direct numerical simulation of a turbulent boundary-layer over the wing of a commercial jetliner that resolves all relevant length scales using a serial CFD solver on a modern digital computer would take approximately 750 million years or roughly 20% of the earth's age. Over the past 25 years, quantum computers have become the object of great interest worldwide as powerful quantum algorithms have been constructed for several important, computationally challenging problems that provide enormous speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms. In this paper, we adapt a recently introduced quantum algorithm for partial differential equations to Burgers' equation and develop a quantum CFD solver that determines its solutions. We used our quantum CFD solver to verify the quantum Burgers' equation algorithm to find the flow solution when a shockwave is and is not present. The quantum simulation results were compared to: (i) an exact analytical solution for a flow without a shockwave; and (ii) the results of a classical CFD solver for flows with and without a shockwave. Excellent agreement was found in both cases, and the error of the quantum CFD solver was comparable to that of the classical CFD solver.

TI Paradigm for Quantum Information Technology: Research Progress and
   Applications of Chiral Quantum Optics (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Chirality, a fundamental property of substances, is widely present in physical, chemical, and biological systems. Recent studies have made considerable progress on chiral interactions between light and matter, thereby opening up new research directions for quantum optics and information technology. In chiral interactions, the polarization state of the localized light field is closely associated with its propagation direction, thereby achieving nonreciprocal light-matter coupling. This phenomenon breaks through the fundamental assumption of time-reversal symmetry in traditional quantum optics. Consequently, it has yielded a series of novel chiral quantum optical platforms and technologies, including chiral quantum state transfer, deterministic spin photon interfaces, and complex quantum network construction. These advances not only promote the development of multi-quantum state superposition manipulation and direction-dependent state storage technology but also facilitate significant breakthroughs in fields such as quantum communication, computing, and simulation. However, the widespread application of chiral quantum optics is still plagued by several challenges. For example, the designing of efficient chiral interfaces, suppression of photon loss, and characterization of chiral interactions in complex systems are certain major issues that need urgent attention. This article reviews the latest research progress on chiral quantum optics and its applications in quantum information science. Furthermore, the possible future development directions and their potential impacts are explored in detail.

AB The distribution of entangled states across the nodes of a future quantum internet will unlock fundamentally new technologies. Here, we report on the realization of a three-node entanglement-based quantum network. We combine remote quantum nodes based on diamond communication qubits into a scalable phase-stabilized architecture, supplemented with a robust memory qubit and local quantum logic. In addition, we achieve real-time communication and feed-forward gate operations across the network. We demonstrate two quantum network protocols without postselection: the distribution of genuine multipartite entangled states across the three nodes and entanglement swapping through an intermediary node. Our work establishes a key platform for exploring, testing, and developing multinode quantum network protocols and a quantum network control stack.

   Qubits on an IBM Quantum Computer
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A quantum simulation experiment pairing Hamiltonians of nearest-neighbor interacting superconducting qubits was performed with a complete set of algorithms on an IBM Quantum Computer-IBMq Lima. The experiment revealed that the fidelity is a function of iteration using Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for four different types of nearest-neighbor Heisenberg, XY, transverse, and longitudinal Ising superconducting qubit couplings of Hamiltonians. The experiment displayed the models of how the experimental density matrices shift from the theoretical density matrices and how their behavior changes with different numbers of iterations. It also demonstrated the reconstruction of quantum states and how the states change as a function of iteration with the IBM Quantum Computer-IBMq Lima. The time evolutions of the states for different models were also shown to predict the dominance of each state.

More precisely, two participants with a private input from a finite field can perform local operations on a shared, Bell-like quantum state, and when these qubits are later sent to a third participant, the third participant can determine the product of the inputs, but without learning more about the individual inputs. We give a concrete way to realize this product computation for arbitrary finite fields of prime order.

TI Reducing the impact of radioactivity on quantum circuits in a
   deep-underground facility
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB As quantum coherence times of superconducting circuits have increased from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, they are currently one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing. However, coherence needs to further improve by orders of magnitude to reduce the prohibitive hardware overhead of current error correction schemes. Reaching this goal hinges on reducing the density of broken Cooper pairs, so-called quasi-particles. Here, we show that environmental radioactivity is a significant source of nonequilibrium quasiparticles. Moreover, ionizing radiation introduces time-correlated quasiparticle bursts in resonators on the same chip, further complicating quantum error correction. Operating in a deep-underground lead-shielded cryostat decreases the quasiparticle burst rate by a factor thirty and reduces dissipation up to a factor four, showcasing the importance of radiation abatement in future solid-state quantum hardware.

TI Designing Kerr Interactions for Quantum Information Processing via
   Counterrotating Terms of Asymmetric Josephson-Junction Loops
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Continuous-variable systems realized in high-coherence microwave cavities are a promising platform for quantum information processing. While strong dynamic nonlinear interactions are desired to implement fast and high-fidelity quantum operations, static cavity nonlinearities typically limit the performance of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes. Here we study theoretical models of nonlinear oscillators describing superconducting quantum circuits with asymmetric Josephson-junction loops. Treating the nonlinearity as a perturbation, we derive effective Hamiltonians using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. We support our analytical results by numerical experiments and show that the effective Kerr-type couplings can be canceled by an interplay of higher-order nonlinearities. This can be better understood in a simplified model supporting only cubic and quartic nonlinearities. Our results show that a cubic interaction allows an increase in the effective rates of both linear and nonlinear operations without an increase in the undesired anharmonicity of an oscillator which is crucial for many bosonic encodings.

TI Contextuality degree of quadrics in multi-qubit symplectic polar spaces
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum contextuality takes an important place amongst the concepts of quantum computing that bring an advantage over its classical counterpart. For a large class of contextuality proofs, aka. observable-based proofs of the Kochen-Specker Theorem, we formulate the contextuality property as the absence of solutions to a linear system and define for a contextual configuration its degree of contextuality. Then we explain why subgeometries of binary symplectic polar spaces are candidates for contextuality proofs. We report the results of a software that generates these subgeometries, decides their contextuality and computes their contextuality degree for some small symplectic polar spaces. We show that quadrics in the symplectic polar space Wn are contextual for n = 3, 4, 5. The proofs we consider involve more contexts and observables than the smallest known proofs. This intermediate size property of those proofs is interesting for experimental tests, but could also be interesting in quantumgame theory.

TI Solving Nonnative Combinatorial Optimization Problems Using Hybrid
   Quantum-Classical Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Combinatorial optimization is a challenging problem applicable in a wide range of fields from logistics to finance. Recently, quantum computing has been used to attempt to solve these problems using a range of algorithms, including parameterized quantum circuits, adiabatic protocols, and quantum annealing. These solutions typically have several challenges: 1) there is little to no performance gain over classical methods; 2) not all constraints and objectives may be efficiently encoded in the quantum ansatz; and 3) the solution domain of the objective function may not be the same as the bit strings of measurement outcomes. This work presents "nonnative hybrid algorithms": a framework to overcome these challenges by integrating quantum and classical resources with a hybrid approach. By designing nonnative quantum variational anosatzes that inherit some but not all problem structure, measurement outcomes from the quantum computer can act as a resource to be used by classical routines to indirectly compute optimal solutions, partially overcoming the challenges of contemporary quantum optimization approaches. These methods are demonstrated using a publicly available neutral-atom quantum computer on two simple problems of Max k-Cut and maximum independent set. We find improvements in solution quality when comparing the hybrid algorithm to its "no quantum" version, a demonstration of a "comparative advantage."

TI A review on quantum computing and deep learning algorithms and their
   applications
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB In this paper, we describe a review concerning the Quantum Computing (QC) and Deep Learning (DL) areas and their applications in Computational Intelligence (CI). Quantum algorithms (QAs), engage the rules of quantum mechanics to solve problems using quantum information, where the quantum information is concerning the state of a quantum system, which can be manipulated using quantum information algorithms and other processing techniques. Nowadays, many QAs have been proposed, whose general conclusion is that using the effects of quantum mechanics results in a significant speedup (exponential, polynomial, super polynomial) over the traditional algorithms. This implies that some complex problems currently intractable with traditional algorithms can be solved with QA. On the other hand, DL algorithms offer what is known as machine learning techniques. DL is concerned with teaching a computer to filter inputs through layers to learn how to predict and classify information. Observations can be in the form of plain text, images, or sound. The inspiration for deep learning is the way that the human brain filters information. Therefore, in this research, we analyzed these two areas to observe the most relevant works and applications developed by the researchers in the world.

TI Impact of correlations and heavy tails on quantum error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that space- and time-correlated single-qubit rotation errors can lead to high-weight errors in a quantum circuit when the rotation angles are drawn from heavy-tailed distributions. This leads to a breakdown of quantum error correction, yielding reduced or, in some cases, no protection of the encoded logical qubits. While heavy-tailed phenomena are prevalent in the natural world, there is very little research as to whether noise with these statistics exists in current quantum processing devices. Furthermore, it is an open problem to develop tomographic or noise spectroscopy protocols that could test for the existence of noise with such statistics. These results suggest the need for quantum characterization methods that can reliably detect or reject the presence of such errors together with continued first-principles studies of the origins of space- and time-correlated noise in quantum processors. If such noise does exist, physical or control-based mitigation protocols must be developed to mitigate this noise as it would severely hinder the performance of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

AB Large scale quantum networks of the future will have quantum nodes that are heterogeneous in their functional and performance capabilities. The heterogeneity that we consider for illustration, lies in the type of the nodes in the quantum network. We consider two types of nodes: (1) mono-functional ones that can perform only limited quantum operations including (Bell State) Measurements; such nodes can transfer qubits only through entanglement swap followed by teleportation and (2) bi-functional nodes that can perform both measurements and general purpose quantum operations, especially towards quantum error correction; such nodes are also capable of hop-by-hop transmission of qubits supported by error correction.
   Nodes of either type can perform their respective operations with a figure of merit -we consider (a) reliability -the probability of successfully performing an operation and (b) time taken to complete the operation.
   Given a path that has both these types of nodes, what is the best mode of operation at each node to transmit a qubit along the path to achieve maximum overall reliability and to adhere to timing constraints? This is the question that we address in this paper.
   In the absence of timing constraints on the transfer, we propose a greedy solution. For the case where timing constraints are present, we propose a dynamic programming solution. We also report simulation results that support the optimality of the proposed solution.

TI Arbitrary Nondemolition Measurements through Hamiltonian Stabilization
   for Quantum Error Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum measurement is performed by coupling a quantity A of a system to a "meter" and reading the meter. In the regime of strong measurement, the possible outcomes and the final state are entirely defined by A, with probabilities dictated by the initial state. In this work, we will be interested in the regime in which a strong self-Hamiltonian, and not the coupling, defines the measurement outcomes and the final state. In this regime, the expectation value of any arbitrary set of observables can be measured in a quantum nondemolition (QND) way without reset or repreparation of the state. We discuss applications that include single-shot measurement of the expectation value of all noncommuting observables from a single copy of the state, without any statistics or ensembles, and the decoding of dephasing errors in a Schr & ouml;dinger-cat qubit quantum error-correction (QEC) code. In the latter, the error syndrome is obtained from single-shot QND measurements of the mean photon number of the cat, even if neither the cat code words nor the stabilizing Hamiltonian commute with the photon-number operator.

TI Quantum annealing for jet clustering with thrust
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum computing holds the promise of substantially speeding up computationally expensive tasks, such as solving optimization problems over a large number of elements. In high-energy collider physics, quantum-assisted algorithms might accelerate the clustering of particles into jets. In this study, we benchmark quantum annealing strategies for jet clustering based on optimizing a quantity called "thrust" in electron-positron collision events. We find that quantum annealing yields similar performance to exact classical approaches and classical heuristics, after tuning the annealing parameters. Without tuning, comparable performance can be obtained through a hybrid quantum/classical approach.

TI Effectiveness of the Krotov method in finding controls for open quantum
   systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We apply the Krotov method (KM) for open and closed quantum systems to find optimized controls to manipulate qubit/qutrit systems in the presence of the external environment. In the case of unitary optimization, the KM is first applied to a quantum system neglecting its interaction with the environment. The resulting controls from the unitary optimization are then used to drive the system along with the environmental noise. In the case of non-unitary optimization, the KM already takes into account the noise during the optimization process. We consider two distinct computational tasks: target-state preparation and quantum gate implementation. These tasks are carried out in simple qubit/qutrit systems and also in systems presenting leakage states. For the state preparation cases, the controls from the non-unitary optimization outperform the controls from the unitary optimization. However, as we show here, this is not always true for the implementation of quantum gates. There are some situations where the unitary optimization performs equally well compared to the non-unitary optimization. We verify that these situations correspond to either the absence of leakage states or to the effects of dissipation being spread uniformly over the system, including non-computational levels. For such cases, the quantum gate implementation must cover the entire Hilbert space and there is no way to dodge dissipation. On the other hand, if the subspace containing the computational levels and its complement are differently affected by dissipation, the non-unitary optimization becomes effective.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for the Poisson equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Poisson equation has wide applications in many areas of science and engineering. Although there are some quantum algorithms that can efficiently solve the Poisson equation, they generally require a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which is beyond the current technology. We propose a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to solve the Poisson equation, which can be executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In detail, we first adopt the finite-difference method to transform the Poisson equation into a linear system. Then, according to the special structure of the linear system, we find an explicit tensor product decomposition, with only (2 log(2) n + 1) items, of its coefficient matrix under a specific set of simple operators, where n is the dimension of the coefficient matrix. This implies that the proposed VQA needs fewer quantum measurements, which dramatically reduces the required quantum resources. Additionally, we design observables to efficiently evaluate the expectation values of the simple operators on a quantum computer. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can solve the Poisson equation.

TI State preparation and evolution in quantum computing: A perspective from

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB Quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum ( NISQ) devices are expected to soon simulate quantum systems that are classically intractable. However, the non- negligible gate error present on NISQ devices impedes the implementation of many purely quantum algorithms, necessitating the use of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. One such hybrid quantum- classical algorithm, is based upon quantum computed Hamiltonian moments.j <^> H n j.D E on 1/4 1,2, THORN, with respect to quantum state j.i. In this tutorial review, we will give a brief review of these quantum algorithms with focuses on the typical ways of computing Hamiltonian moments using quantum hardware and improving the accuracy of the estimated state energies based on the quantum computed moments. We also present a computation of the Hamiltonian moments of a four-site Heisenberg model and compute the energy and magnetization of the model utilizing the imaginary time evolution on current IBM-Q hardware. Finally, we discuss some possible developments and applications of Hamiltonian moment methods.

TI Expressive quantum supervised machine learning using Kerr-nonlinear
   parametric oscillators
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning with variational quantum algorithms (VQA) has been actively investigated as a practical algorithm in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Recent researches reveal that the data reuploading, which repeatedly encode classical data into quantum circuit, is necessary for obtaining the expressive quantum machine learning model in the conventional quantum computing architecture. However, the data reuploading tends to require a large amount of quantum resources, which motivates us to find an alternative strategy for realizing the expressive quantum machine learning efficiently. In this paper, we propose quantum machine learning with Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), as another promising quantum computing device. We use not only the ground state and first excited state but also higher excited states, which allows us to use a large Hilbert space even if we have a single KPO. Our numerical simulations show that the expressibility of our method with only one mode of the KPO is much higher than that of the conventional method with six qubits. Our results pave the way towards resource-efficient quantum machine learning, which is essential for the practical applications in the NISQ era.

TI Estimating truncation effects of quantum bosonic systems using sampling
   algorithms
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB To simulate bosons on a qubit- or qudit-based quantum computer, one has to regularize the theory by truncating infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces to finite dimensions. In the search for practical quantum applications, it is important to know how big the truncation errors can be. In general, it is not easy to estimate errors unless we have a good quantum computer. In this paper, we show that traditional sampling methods on classical devices, specifically Markov Chain Monte Carlo, can address this issue for a rather generic class of bosonic systems with a reasonable amount of computational resources available today. As a demonstration, we apply this idea to the scalar field theory on a two-dimensional lattice, with a size that goes beyond what is achievable using exact diagonalization methods. This method can be used to estimate the resources needed for realistic quantum simulations of bosonic theories, and also, to check the validity of the results of the corresponding quantum simulations.

TI Universal, Unambiguous Concentration and Distillation of Bell pairs

AB The ability of preparing perfect Bell pairs with a practical scheme is of great relevance for quantum communication as well as distributed quantum computing. We propose a scheme which probabilistically, but universally and unambiguously produces the j Phi+) Bell pair from four copies of qubit pairs initially in the same unknown pure quantum state. The same scheme, extended to eight qubit pairs initially in the same, moderately mixed quantum state, unambiguously produces the j Phi +) Bell pair with quadratically suppressed noise. The core step of the proposed scheme consists of a pair of local two-qubit operations applied at each of the two distant locations, followed by a partial projective measurement and postselection at each party, with results communicated classically. While the scheme resembles standard entanglement distillation protocols, it achieves success within just three iterations, making it attractive for real-world applications.

Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a Rydberg atom approach to program the 3-SAT problem, the prototypical NP-complete problem which allows general programming of all NP problems. We use Rydberg atom graphs, each of which consists of Rydberg atom dimers and trimers coupled with quantum wires in the Rydberg blockade interaction regime, to formulate general Boolean expressions, and obtain their many-body ground states to determine the satisfiabilities of the given 3-SAT problem instances quantum mechanically.
