TI Intracellular biocompatible hexagonal boron nitride quantum emitters as
   single-photon sources and barcodes
SO NANOSCALE
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been emerging as a multifunctional platform for various optical applications including quantum information processing, quantum computing and imaging. Simultaneously, due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability hBN is a promising material for biomedical applications. In this work, we demonstrate single-photon emission from hBN color centers embedded inside live cells and their application to cellular barcoding. The generation and internalization of multiple color centers into cells was performed via simple and scalable procedure while keeping the cells unharmed. The emission from live cells was observed as multiple diffraction-limited spots, which exhibited excellent single-photon characteristics with high single-photon purity of 0.1 and superb emission stability without photobleaching or spectral shifts over several hours. Due to different emission wavelengths and peak widths of the color centers, they were employed as barcodes. We term them Quantum Photonic Barcodes (QPBs). Each QPB can exist in one out of 470 possible distinguishable states and a combination of a few QPBs per cell can be used to uniquely tag virtually an unlimited number of cells. The barcodes developed here offer some excellent properties, including ease of production by a single-step procedure, biocompatibility and biodegradability, emission stability, no photobleaching, small size and a huge number of unique barcodes. This work provides a basis for the use of hBN color centers for robust barcoding of cells and due to the single photon emission, presented concepts could in future be extended to quantum-limited sensing and super-resolution imaging.
   Hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles with color centers work as single-photon emitters from within live cells and enable robust photonic barcoding.

TI One Hundred Second Bit-Flip Time in a Two-Photon Dissipative Oscillator
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Bistable dynamical systems are widely employed to robustly encode classical bits of information. However, they owe their robustness to inherent losses, making them unsuitable to encode quantum information. Surprisingly, there exists a loss mechanism, known as two-photon dissipation, that provides stability without inducing decoherence. An oscillator exchanging pairs of photons with its environment is expected to reach macroscopic bit-flip times between dynamical states containing only a handful of photons. However, previous implementations have observed bit-flip times saturating in the millisecond range. In this experiment, we design a superconducting resonator endowed with two-photon dissipation, and free of all suspected sources of instabilities and inessential ancillary systems. We attain bit-flip times exceeding 100 s in between states containing about 40 photons. Although a full quantum model is necessary to explain our data, the preparation of coherent superposition states remains inaccessible. This experiment demonstrates that macroscopic bit-flip times are attainable with mesoscopic photon numbers in a two-photon dissipative oscillator.

TI Tight bound for estimating expectation values from a system of linear
   equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The system of linear equations problem (SLEP) is specified by a complex invertible matrix A, the condition number kappa of A, a vector b, a Hermitian matrix M, and an accuracy epsilon, and the task is to estimate x(dagger)Mx, where x is the solution vector to the equation Ax = b. We aim to establish a lower bound on the complexity of the end-to-end quantum algorithms for SLEP with respect to epsilon, and devise a quantum algorithm that saturates this bound. To make lower bounds attainable, we consider query complexity in the setting in which a block encoding of M is given, i.e., a unitary black box U-M that contains M/alpha as a block for some alpha is an element of R+. We show, by constructing a quantum algorithm and deriving a lower bound, that the quantum query complexity for SLEP in this setting is Theta(alpha/epsilon). Our lower bound is established by reducing the problem of estimating the mean of a black box function to SLEP. Our Theta(alpha/epsilon) result tightens and proves the common assertion of polynomial accuracy dependence [poly(1/epsilon)] for SLEP without making any complexity-theoretic assumptions, and shows that improvement beyond linear dependence on accuracy is not possible if M is provided via block encoding.

TI Magnon-magnon entanglement generation between two remote
   interaction-free optomagnonic systems via optical Bell-state measurement
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Finding new strategies for the generation and preservation of quantum resources, e.g. entanglement between spatially separated macroscopic systems enables reliable and fertile platforms to study both fundamental quantum physics and fruitful applications such as quantum networks and distant quantum information processing. Here, we want to address how to generate magnon-magnon entanglement (MME) in an optomagnonic system based on the optical Bell-state measurement. To do so, we consider a hybrid optomagnonic system comprising of two identical, but distant dissipative microwave cavities, each containing a ferromagnetic YIG sphere and a superconducting qubit. Besides, each subsystem is driven via an external laser field. We numerically simulate the solution of the corresponding master equation and discuss the time-dependent as well as the steady state entanglement between the distant magnon modes at different interaction regime. Also, the fidelity of the generated entangled states is studied in detail. Generally, the dissipative environmental effects plague the MME, however, it is possible to generate a considerable amount of MME even at the steady state regime. Also, the results show that the robust MME may be enhanced by applying a relatively strong external pump decreasing the relative magnon damping rate as well as increasing the relative qubit-photon coupling strength, while some other parameters involved in the model, i.e. the atomic damping rate and detuning parameter do not considerably affect the amplitude (the maximum value) of MME. Exceptionally, although the magnon damping rate decreases the amount of MME, the entanglement stability takes place in a longer time interval in the strong magnonic damping regime. Moreover, the maximum of the steady state entanglement may be obtained in the moderate magnon-photon coupling regime provided that the system is driven by strong external pumps. Furthermore, the system can generate robust MME at steady state, especially in the small detuning regime. Our further investigations show that the system can provide relatively high-fidelity magnonic entangled states even in the presence of inevitable environmental effects. The proposed model offers an attractive platform for the generation of quantum resources to establish long-distance quantum networks based on magnonic and photonic systems.

TI Lifting Topological Codes: Three-Dimensional Subsystem Codes from
   Two-Dimensional Anyon Models
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Topological subsystem codes in three spatial dimensions allow for quantum error correction with no time overhead, even in the presence of measurement noise. The physical origins of this single-shot property remain elusive, in part due to the scarcity of known models. To address this challenge, we provide a systematic construction of a class of topological subsystem codes in three dimensions built from Abelian quantum double models in one fewer dimension. Our construction not only generalizes the recently introduced subsystem toric code [Kubica and Vasmer, Nat. Commun. 13 , 6272 (2022)] but also provides a new perspective on several aspects of the original model, including the origin of the Gauss law for gauge flux, and boundary conditions for the code family. We then numerically study the performance of the first few codes in this class against phenomenological noise to verify their single-shot property. Lastly, we discuss Hamiltonians naturally associated with these codes, and argue that they may be gapless.

TI Parallel quantum chemistry on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A parallel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the solution of the quantum-chemical ground-state energy problem on gate-based quantum computers is presented. This approach is based on the reduced density-matrix functional theory (RDMFT) formulation of the electronic structure problem. For that purpose, the density-matrix functional of the full system is decomposed into an indirectly coupled sum of density-matrix functionals for all its subsystems using the adaptive cluster approximation to RDMFT. The approximations involved in the decomposition and the adaptive cluster approximation itself can be systematically converged to the exact result. The solutions for the density-matrix functionals of the effective subsystems involves a constrained minimization over many-particle states that are approximated by parametrized trial states on the quantum computer similarly to the variational quantum eigensolver. The independence of the density-matrix functionals of the effective subsystems introduces a new level of parallelization and allows for the computational treatment of much larger molecules on a quantum computer with a given qubit count. In addition, for the proposed algorithm techniques are presented to reduce the qubit count, the number of quantum programs, as well as its depth. The evaluation of a density-matrix functional as the essential part of our approach is demonstrated for Hubbard-like systems on IBM quantum computers based on superconducting transmon qubits.

TI Detecting a Photon-Number Splitting Attack in Decoy-State
   Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution via Statistical
   Hypothesis Testing
SO ENTROPY
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is innately immune to all detection-side attacks. Due to the limitations of technology, most MDI-QKD protocols use weak coherent photon sources (WCPs), which may suffer from a photon-number splitting (PNS) attack from eavesdroppers. Therefore, the existing MDI-QKD protocols also need the decoy-state method, which can resist PNS attacks very well. However, the existing decoy-state methods do not attend to the existence of PNS attacks, and the secure keys are only generated by single-photon components. In fact, multiphoton pulses can also form secure keys if we can confirm that there is no PNS attack. For simplicity, we only analyze the weaker version of a PNS attack in which a legitimate user's pulse count rate changes significantly after the attack. In this paper, under the null hypothesis of no PNS attack, we first determine whether there is an attack or not by retrieving the missing information of the existing decoy-state MDI-QKD protocols via statistical hypothesis testing, extract a normal distribution statistic, and provide a detection method and the corresponding Type I error probability. If the result is judged to be an attack, we use the existing decoy-state method to estimate the secure key rate. Otherwise, all pulses with the same basis leading to successful Bell state measurement (BSM) events including both single-photon pulses and multiphoton pulses can be used to generate secure keys, and we give the formula of the secure key rate in this case. Finally, based on actual experimental data from other literature, the associated experimental results (e.g., the significance level is 5%) show the correctness of our method.

TI Temporally ultralong biphotons with a linewidth of 50 kHz
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB We report the generation of biphotons, with a temporal full width at the half maximum (FWHM) of 13.4 &+/- 0.3 mu s and a spectral FWHM of 50 +/- 1 kHz, via the process of spontaneous four-wave mixing with laser-cooled atoms. The temporal width is the longest, and the spectral linewidth is the narrowest to date. This is also the first biphoton result that obtains a linewidth below 100 kHz, reaching a new milestone. The very long biphoton wave packet has a signal-to-background ratio of 3.4, which violates the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for classical light by 4.8 folds. Furthermore, we demonstrated a highly tunable-linewidth biphoton source and showed that while the biphoton source's temporal and spectral width were controllably varied by about 24 folds, its generation rate only changed by less than 15%. A spectral brightness or generation rate per pump power per linewidth of 1.2x 10(6) pairs/(s mW MHz) was achieved at the temporal width of 13.4 mu s. The above results were made possible by the low decoherence rate and high optical depth of the experimental system, as well as a novel scheme of classical fields' and biphotons' propagation directions in the experiment. This work has demonstrated a high-efficiency ultranarrow-linewidth biphoton source and has made substantial advancements in quantum technology utilizing heralded single photons.

TI Quantum correlation of microwave two-mode squeezed state generated by
   nonlinearity of InP HEMT
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study significantly concentrates on cryogenic InP HEMT high-frequency circuit analysis using quantum theory to find how the transistor nonlinearity can affect the quantum correlation of the modes generated. Firstly, the total Hamiltonian of the circuit is derived, and the dynamic equation of the motion contributed is examined using the Heisenberg-Langevin equation. Using the nonlinear Hamiltonian, some components are attached to the intrinsic internal circuit of InP HEMT to address the circuit characteristics fully. The components attached are arisen due to the nonlinearity effects. As a result, the theoretical calculations show that the states generated in the circuit are mixed, and no pure state is produced. Accordingly, the modified circuit generates the two-mode squeezed thermal state, which means one can focus on calculating the Gaussian quantum discord to evaluate quantum correlation. It is also found that the nonlinearity factors (addressed as the nonlinear components in the circuit) can intensely influence the squeezed thermal state by which the quantum discord is changed. Finally, as the primary point, it is concluded that although it is possible to enhance the quantum correlation between modes by engineering the nonlinear components; however, attaining quantum discord greater than unity, entangled microwave photons, seems a challenging task since InP HEMT operates at 4.2 K.

TI Quantum process matrices as images: New tools to design novel denoising
   methods
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Inferring a process matrix characterizing a quantum channel from experimental measurements is a key issue of quantum information. Noise affecting the measured counts could bring to matrices different from the expected ones and optimization methods usually employed, i.e. the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), are characterized by several drawbacks. Lowering the noise could be necessary to increase the experimental resources, e.g. time for each measurement. In this paper, an alternative procedure, based on suitable Neural Networks, has been implemented and optimized to obtain a denoised process matrix and this approach has been tested with a specific quantum channel, i.e. a Control Phase. This promising method relies on the analogy that can be established between the elements of a process matrix and the pixels of an image.

TI QTS2D: Quantum-based image encoding of time series
SO SOFTWAREX
AB Despite growing interest in quantum machine learning, the application of quantum principles to foundational tasks such as time series feature engineering remains underexplored. This paper introduces QTS2D, a Python library that addresses this gap by adapting established time series-to-image techniques, including Gramian Angular Fields, Markov Transition Fields, Recurrence Plots, and Spectrograms, using quantum-inspired formulations. Unlike many works focused on execution speed or hardware advantage, our primary aim is to investigate the representational power of quantum-derived transformations for feature extraction. QTS2D leverages concepts such as amplitude encoding, quantum fidelity, and the Quantum Fourier Transform to generate rich, structured representations simulated on classical hardware. Empirical results on physiological signals demonstrate that quantum-based representations not only improve classification accuracy over classical counterparts, even within fully classical machine learning pipelines, but also exhibit enhanced class separability in UMAP embeddings and consistently lower Davies-Bouldin Index scores. The library provides a practical and extensible foundation for exploring quantum-enhanced feature engineering, with promising applications in health monitoring, anomaly detection, and beyond.

TI Antibunched N-photon bundles emitted by a Josephson photonic
   device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an experimentally feasible scheme for generating antibunched N-photon bundles by a dc voltage-biased Josephson junction in series with a superconducting microwave resonator and a charge qubit. Each resonant tunneling Cooper pair leads to the excitation of the charge qubit and resonator with N photons simultaneously via the ac Josephson effect. Meanwhile, the charge qubit with strong anharmonicity is utilized to regulate the tunneling behavior of the Cooper pairs; that is, the presence of N photons in the resonator prevents the next tunnel event. So the resonator contains only N photons or none, and all other possibilities are greatly suppressed. Combined with the system's dissipation, the resonator can emit its energy in antibunched bundles of N strongly correlated photons with high purity and an in situ tunable emission rate. Such a nonclassical source could be useful in applications in the field of quantum information science.

TI Negative string tension of a higher-charge Schwinger model via digital
   quantum simulation
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB We study some properties of generalized global symmetry for the charge-q Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism, which is the (1 + 1)D quantum electrodynamics with a charge-q Dirac fermion. This model has the Z(q) 1-form symmetry, which is a remnant of the electric U(1) 1-form symmetry in the pure Maxwell theory. It is known that, if we put the theory on closed space, then the I Hilbert space is decomposed into q distinct sectors, called universes, and some states with higher energy density do not decay to the ground state due to the selection rule of the 1-form symmetry. Even with open boundaries, we can observe the stability of such states by seeing a negative string tension behavior, meaning that opposite charges repel each other. In order to see negative string tensions, the vacuum angle theta has to be large enough and the standard path-integral Monte Carlo method suffers from the sign problem. We develop a method based on the adiabatic state preparation to see this feature with digital quantum simulation and confirm it using a classical simulator of quantum devices. In particular, we measure the local energy density and see how it jumps between the inside and outside of the insertion of the probe charges. We explicitly sec that the energy density inside is lower than that outside. This is a clear signature of the negative string tension.

TI Understanding decoherence in molecular spin qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Molecular nanomagnets are quantum spin systems potentially serving as qudits for future quantum technologies thanks to their many accessible low-energy states. At low temperatures, the primary source of error in these systems is pure dephasing, caused by their interactions with the bath of surrounding nuclear spins degrees of freedom. Most importantly, as the system's dimensionality grows going from qubits to qudits, the control and mitigation of decoherence become more challenging. Here, we analyze the characteristics of pure dephasing in molecular qudits under spin-echo sequences. We use a realistic description of their interaction with the bath, whose non-Markovian dynamics is accurately computed by the cluster correlation expansion technique. First, we show that the differences in the expectation values of the local spin operators on the eigenstates of the qudit are the source of decoherence in these systems. Indeed, we demonstrate that this is a necessary and sufficient condition to prevent the decay of coherence with time, also introducing a parameter to quantify the deviation from such ideal condition. We illustrate this with two paradigmatic systems: a single giant spin and a composite antiferromagnetic spin system. We then advance a proposal for optimized nanomagnets, identifying key ingredients for engineering robust qudits for quantum technologies.

AB Recently, the "second quantum revolution" has been identified as crucial for technical innovation and a potential driver for workforce development and economic growth in the United States and beyond. However, there is a severe workforce shortage in the Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) domain QISE sits at the intersection of many fields, and there is no universally agreed-upon curriculum for it. It is thus necessary to produce an inter-disciplinary curriculum for QISE, which not only trains future smart workforce, but also makes sure that the workforce is diverse (e.g., in terms of gender and ethnicity). Our interdisciplinary team, including education researchers and content experts from across STEM, arts, and other disciplines, aims to fill this important gap by creating a modular, industry-connected curriculum called QuSTEAM. The modular nature of the curriculum will allow content to be applied at various institutions (e.g., R-1, community colleges, and HBCUs) in a seamless manner.

TI Exploring phase space properties of nonlinear Kerr-cavity interacting
   with a qubit: Spontaneous-emission damping effect
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In our work, we have explored the phase space nonlinear coherent-Kerr-cavity nonclassicality and purity loss induced by off -resonant intensity-dependent cavity-qubit interactions under atomic spontaneous-emission dissipation effect. The generation of the cavity purity loss (mixedness) dynamics, by using von Neumann entropy, is linked to the nonclassicality's Wigner distribution dynamics, which is investigated at spastic times chosen based on the von Neumann entropy's cavity dynamics. The temporal evolution of the largest negativity of the Wigner distribution is investigated under the physical system effects of the qubit spontaneous-emission dissipation, the detuning as well as the coherent-Kerr-cavity nonlinearity. The growths and the stability of the purity loss and the Wigner distribution negativity loss have the same behaviors. They depend on the Kerr-like nonlinearity and the dissipation couplings. These losses and their stability can be enhanced by increasing the dissipation coupling. It is found that the nonclassicality's phase space Wigner quasi-probability distribution and the mixedness of the generated coherent-Kerr-cavity states are highly sensitive to the physical system effects.

TI A Cryo-CMOS Controller With Class-DE Driver and DC Magnetic-Field Tuning
   for Quantum Computers Based on Color Centers in Diamond
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB Striving toward a scalable quantum processor, this article presents the first cryo-CMOS quantum bit (qubit) controller targeting color centers in diamond. Color-center qubits enable a modular architecture that allows for the 3-D integration of photonics, cryo-CMOS control electronics, and qubits in the same package. However, performing quantum operations in a scalable manner requires large currents in the driving coils due to low coil-to-qubit coupling. Moreover, active calibration of the qubit Larmor frequency is required to compensate inhomogeneities of the bias magnetic field. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes both a cryo-CMOS alternating current (AC) controller consisting of a class-DE series-resonant driver and a DC current regulator (DC CR) that uses a triode-biased H-bridge for scalable low-power qubit operations. By experimentally validating the cryo-CMOS performance with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color-center qubit, the AC controller can drive a Rabi oscillation up to 2.5 MHz with a supply draw of 6.5 mA, and the DC CR can tune the Larmor frequency by +/- 9 MHz while driving up to +/- 20 mA in the bias coil. T-2* coherence times up to 5.3 mu s and single-qubit gate fidelities above 98% are demonstrated with the cryo-CMOS control using Ramsey experiments and gate set tomography (GST), respectively. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cryo-CMOS chips and enable the development of a modular quantum processor based on color centers.

TI Optimal resource allocation for flexible-grid entanglement distribution
   networks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We use a genetic algorithm (GA) as a design aid for determining the optimal provisioning of entangled photon spectrum in flex-grid quantum networks with arbitrary numbers of channels and users. After introducing a general model for entanglement distribution based on frequency-polarization hyperentangled biphotons, we derive upper bounds on fidelity and entangled bit rate for networks comprising one-to-one user connections. Simple conditions based on user detector quality and link efficiencies are found that determine whether entanglement is possible. We successfully apply a GA to find optimal resource allocations in four different representative network scenarios and validate features of our model experimentally in a quantum local area network in deployed fiber. Our results show promise for the rapid design of large-scale entanglement distribution networks. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Generating Multi-hops Entangled Network Via Spin Dipolar Interaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The possibility of generating a multi-hops network between different entangled nodes (qubits) via spin Dipolar interaction is examined. The negativity, tangle and the non-local coherent advantage are used as quantifiers of the generated quantum correlations. The phenomena of the sudden death/birth is displayed for the entangled two nodes, while the sudden changes phenomena (increasing/ decreasing) is depicted for all entangled three nodes. The amount of correlations between the different nodes depend on the initial network settings, where the largest amount is predicted if the network is initially conducted via maximum entangled nodes. The generated quantum correlations between each three nodes are more robust than those generated between two nodes. For the generated entangled two nodes, the direction of the interaction and its strength have a remarkable effect on the correlation behavior, while they has a slightly effect on the correlation of the three nodes.

TI Integrated microcavity electric field sensors using Pound-Drever-Hall
   detection
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Discerning weak electric fields has important implications for cosmology, quantum technology, and identifying power system failures. Photonic integration of electric field sensors is highly desired for practical considerations and offers opportunities to improve performance by enhancing microwave and lightwave interactions. Here, we demonstrate a high-Q microcavity electric field sensor (MEFS) by leveraging the silicon chip-based thin film lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits. Using the Pound-Drever-Hall detection scheme, our MEFS achieves a detection sensitivity of 5.2 mu V/(m root Hz), which surpasses previous lithium niobate electro-optical electric field sensors by nearly two orders of magnitude, and is comparable to atom-based quantum sensing approaches. Furthermore, our MEFS has a bandwidth that can be up to three orders of magnitude broader than quantum sensing approaches and measures fast electric field amplitude and phase variations in real-time. The ultra-sensitive MEFSs represent a significant step towards building electric field sensing networks and broaden the application spectrum of integrated microcavities.

TI A small serving of mash: (Quantum) algorithms for SPDH-Sign with small
   parameters
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB We find an efficient method to solve the semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) over finite nonabelian groups of order p(3 )and exponent p(2) for certain exponentially large parameters. This implies an attack on SPDH-Sign, Pronounced "SPUD-Sign". a signature scheme based on the SDLP, for such parameters. In particular, SDLP instances over such groups are parameterised by an n < (p - 1)p6 : we develop a method to solve instances when n <= poly (log p)& sdot; p. Letting lambda be the security parameter of SPDH-Sign, which is taken p = exp lambda, we find we may solve instances of SDLP corresponding to SPDH-Sign instances with exponentially large p p . However, for n approximate to p(2 )and larger, our method no longer completely solves the SDLP instances. We also study the linear hidden shift problem for a group action corresponding to SDLP and take a step towards proving the quantum polynomial time equivalence of SDLP and the semidirect computational Diffie-Hellman problem.

AB An important requirement in implementing distributed computing and sensing application is the synchronization of clocks at various locations. The Internet relies on the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which synchronizes clocks with accuracy in the order of milliseconds. More recently an ensemble of atomic clocks is used for navigation based on GPS. These clocks are highly accurate and provide time with very low uncertainty. Even so, many physics experiments such as distributed LIGO-based systems may require more accurate clock synchronization that is achievable using quantum entanglement. This requires the deployment of a network of quantum clocks synchronized by exploiting entangled atomic clock qubits. In this paper, we carry out a simulation study of synchronizing a network of quantum clocks interconnected by a fiber plant that supports the ESnet; the latter is used to support the classical communication needed for teleportation. We consider an existing protocol for synchronizing the atomic clock qubits that relies on the GHZ states. To assess the performance of the protocol we developed a discrete-event simulation of the network using IBM Qiskit framework for underlying quantum gate operations and measurements. The simulation results shed light on the resources required in terms of the number entangled qubits and the time needed to achieve the synchronization of different number of nodes in ESnet.

TI Global Sensing and Its Impact for Quantum Many-Body Probes with
   Criticality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum sensing is one of the key areas that exemplify the superiority of quantum technologies. Nonetheless, most quantum sensing protocols operate efficiently only when the unknown parameters vary within a very narrow region, i.e., local sensing. Here, we provide a systematic formulation for quantifying the precision of a probe for multiparameter global sensing when there is no prior information about the parameters. In many-body probes, in which extra tunable parameters exist, our protocol can tune the performance for harnessing the quantum criticality over arbitrarily large sensing intervals. For the single-parameter sensing, our protocol optimizes a control field such that an Ising probe is tuned to always operate around its criticality. This significantly enhances the performance of the probe even when the interval of interest is so large that the precision is bounded by the standard limit. For the multiparameter case, our protocol optimizes the control fields such that the probe operates at the most efficient point along its critical line. Finally, it is shown that even a simple magnetization measurement significantly benefits from our global sensing protocol.

TI Photon entanglement through linear optics networks with birefringent
   crystals
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB We develop a linear optics network for the generation of photonic entangled states via designing a quantum circuit consisting of optical elements, i.e., beam splitters and birefringent crystals. To achieve the purpose, at first we introduce non-entangled single-photon states with their Gaussian spectral amplitude functions as the inputs of the circuit. Then, we show that the outcome of the circuit is an entangled Gaussian photonic state characterized with its covariance matrix. The quantum optical Gaussian states constitute an important class of robust quantum states which are manipulatable by the existing technologies. Meanwhile, we investigate the generation of biphoton entangled states, in detail. Also, we evaluate the concurrence (as a measure of entanglement) and also the probability density function (PDF) corresponding to biphoton states. In the continuation, we study other possible applications of such quantum circuits. We demonstrate that how one can estimate the position of outcome, i.e., the probability of finding entangled photons in a confidence ellipsoid. Our numerical results show that the entanglement of biphoton states strongly depends on their correlation matrix. As an outstanding feature, the PDF of the output state of the circuit provides an elegant criterion to identify the entangled photonic states from their separable counterparts. The designed quantum circuit and the obtained results may be implemented in the development of quantum information and communication protocols with continuous variables, besides their practical importance in realizing more complicated quantum networks.

TI Intrinsic noise of the single-electron box
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The radio-frequency (rf) single-electron box is becoming an attractive charge sensor for semiconductorbased quantum computing devices due to its high sensitivity and small footprint, which facilitate the design of highly connected qubit architectures. However, an understanding of its ultimate sensitivity is missing due to the lack of a noise model. Here, we quantify the intrinsic noise of the single-electron box arising from stochastic cyclic electron tunneling between a quantum dot and a reservoir driven by a periodic gate voltage. We use both a master-equation formalism and Markov Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the gate-noise current and find that the noise mechanism can be represented as a cyclostationary process. We consider the implications of this cyclostationary noise on the ultimate sensitivity of single-electron box sensors for fast high-fidelity readout of spin qubits, in particular evaluating results for rf reflectometry implementations and the back action of the sensor on a qubit. Furthermore, we determine the conditions under which the intrinsic noise limit could be measured experimentally and techniques by which the noise can be suppressed to enhance qubit-readout fidelity.

TI Quantum-based exact pattern matching algorithms for biological sequences
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB In computational biology, desired patterns are searched in large text databases, and an exact match is preferable. Classical benchmark algorithms obtain competent solutions for pattern matching in O(N) time, whereas quantum algorithm design is based on Grover's method, which completes the search in O (root N) time. This paper briefly explains existing quantum algorithms and defines their processing limitations. Our initial work overcomes existing algorithmic constraints by proposing the quantum--based combined exact (QBCE) algorithm for the pattern--matching problem to process exact patterns. Next, quantum random access memory (QRAM) processing is discussed, and based on it, we propose the QRAM processing--based exact (QPBE) pattern--matching algorithm. We show that to find all t occurrences of a pattern, the best case time complexities of the QBCE and QPBE algorithms are O (root N) and O (root N) and the exceptional worst case is bounded by O(t) andO(N). Thus, the proposed quantum algorithms achieve computational speedup. Our work is proved mathematically and validated with simulation, and complexity analysis demonstrates that our quantum algorithms are better than existing pattern--matching methods.

TI Detecting Clouds in Multispectral Satellite Images Using Quantum-Kernel
   Support Vector Machines
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB Support vector machines (SVMs) are well-established classifiers that are effectively deployed in an array of classification tasks. In this article, we consider extending classical SVMs with quantum kernels and applying them to satellite data analysis. The design and implementation of SVMs with quantum kernels (hybrid SVMs) are presented. Here, the pixels are mapped to the Hilbert space using a family of parameterized quantum feature maps (related to quantum kernels). The parameters are optimized to maximize the kernel-target alignment. The quantum kernels have been selected such that they enable the analysis of numerous relevant properties while being able to simulate them with classical computers on a real-life large-scale dataset. Specifically, we approach the problem of cloud detection in the multispectral satellite imagery, which is one of the pivotal steps in both on-the-ground and on-board satellite image analysis processing chains. The experiments performed over the benchmark Landsat-8 multispectral dataset revealed that the simulated hybrid SVM successfully classifies satellite images with accuracy comparable to the classical SVM with the radial basis function kernel for large datasets. Interestingly, for large datasets, the high accuracy was also observed for the simple quantum kernels, lacking quantum entanglement.

In this paper, a theoretical scheme of enhancing optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements is proposed, based on a coherent-feedback-assisted optomagnomechanical (OMM) system. By inserting a thin membrane between the input-output mirror and the high-reflective-mirror-attached YIG bridge, the system consists of four kinds of modes: optical mode, microwave mode, mechanical mode, and magnon mode. In this system, optical mode and microwave mode interact with each other through the mechanical mode, while the magnon mode couples with the microwave mode through magnetic-dipole interaction. The entanglement is originally generated between optical mode and phonon mode under the two-mode squeezing mechanism (blue-detuned driven), then the generated entanglement is transferred to the optical mode and microwave mode through the state transfer mechanism (red-detuned driven) between the microwave mode and phonon mode and is further transferred to the optical mode and magnon mode by the magnetic-dipole interaction between the microwave mode and magnon mode. Adopting the negative logarithm criterion, the variations of the optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements with detuning, coupling strength, and decay rate are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the optimal coherent feedback parameters and the physical mechanisms of generating and transferring entanglement are analyzed, and the entanglement enhancements by adding the feedback loop are discussed. The results show that after adding coherent feedback, optomicrowave entanglement and optomagnonic entanglement can be enhanced effectively within a wide range of parameters and the enhancement can also be well maintained. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for connecting different nodes (different physical systems) to construct hybrid quantum networks, flexibly controlling the quantum properties of magnons, and preparing macroscopic quantum states.

AB In this paper, we take advantage of a class of one-generator generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes of index 2 to construct quantum error-correcting codes. By studying the form of Hermitian dual codes and their algebraic structure, we propose a sufficient condition for self-orthogonality of GQC codes with Hermitian inner product. By comparison, the quantum codes we constructed have better parameters than known codes.

TI Trends of Biosensing: Plasmonics through Miniaturization and Quantum
   Sensing
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Despite being extremely old concepts, plasmonics and surface plasmon resonance-based biosensors have been increasingly popular in the recent two decades due to the growing interest in nanooptics and are now of relevant significance in regards to applications associated with human health. Plasmonics integration into point-of-care devices for health surveillance has enabled significant levels of sensitivity and limit of detection to be achieved and has encouraged the expansion of the fields of study and market niches devoted to the creation of quick and incredibly sensitive label-free detection. The trend reflects in wearable plasmonic sensor development as well as point-of-care applications for widespread applications, demonstrating the potential impact of the new generation of plasmonic biosensors on human well-being through the concepts of personalized medicine and global health. In this context, the aim here is to discuss the potential, limitations, and opportunities for improvement that have arisen as a result of the integration of plasmonics into microsystems and lab-on-chip over the past five years. Recent applications of plasmonic biosensors in microsystems and sensor performance are analyzed. The final analysis focuses on the integration of microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip with quantum plasmonics technology prospecting it as a promising solution for chemical and biological sensing. Here it is underlined how the research in the field of quantum plasmonic sensing for biological applications has flourished over the past decade with the aim to overcome the limits given by quantum fluctuations and noise. The significant advances in nanophotonics, plasmonics and microsystems used to create increasingly effective biosensors would continue to benefit this field if harnessed properly.

TI Entropy certification of a realistic quantum random-number generator
   based on single-particle entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In single-particle entanglement (SPE) two degrees of freedom of a single particle are entangled. SPE is a resource that can be exploited both in quantum communication protocols and in experimental tests of noncon-textuality based on the Kochen-Specker theorem. SPE can be certified via a test of quantum contextuality based on Bell inequalities. Experiments of Bell-type inequality violation by single-particle entangled systems may be affected by an analog of the locality loophole in this context, due to the presence of unavoidable nonidealities in the experimental devices which actually produce unwanted correlations between the two observables that are simultaneously measured. This issue is tackled here by quantitatively analyzing the behavior of realistic devices in SPE experiments with photons. In particular, we show how it is possible to provide a semi-device-independent randomness certification of realistic quantum random-number generators based on Bell-inequality violation by SPE states of photons. The analysis is further enlarged to encompass, with a Markovian model, memory effects due to dead time, dark counts, and afterpulsing affecting single-photon detectors, in particular when not dealing with coincidence measurements. An unbiased estimator is also proposed for quantum transition probabilities out of the collection of experimental data.

TI Utilitarian Qubit, Human Geography, and Pandemic Preparedness in the
   21st Century
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Human actions are ambivalent in nature and this in turn has an impact on all components of socio-ecological systems. Their ambivalence results from the fact that human actions have both positive and negative outcomes and properties, which occur and manifest concurrently in the ontological realm of human existence. In terms of space-time, both micro-geography and macro-geography of human existence are intertwined during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus affecting pre- and post-pandemic space-time continuum. The utilitarian qubit can be used to describe the nature of human existence, i.e., Homo sapiens has always been experiencing a state of existence where pain and pleasure are co-extensive. In this state, it is impossible to establish to what extent pain, and to what extent pleasure, will have a definitive impact on our status as individuals and humanity as a species. In this article, the authors explore how the record of an individual's life before and after the COVID-19 pandemic has been impacted by the wellbeing and actions of other humans and prior to one's existence. Drawing on the utilitarian qubit, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impacts on the members of Homo sapiens, can be understood as a partial outcome of the cumulative actions of humanity on the biosphere and other elements of the global ecosystem (the Age of the Anthropocene). We argue that this paper is also useful to foster disaster preparedness and resilience in the pandemic and post-pandemic era, at micro- and macro-geographical interfaces of human existence in the 21st century. The existence of individual members of Homo sapiens and humanity as a species is unfolding at the boundary between two levels: fundamental reality and situational reality. The result is the historical accumulation and ontological interconnectedness of humanity's activities with one's own actions. Pain and pleasure resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Age of Anthropocene, as well as the right and wrong consequences of humanity's actions, are posited here to be symptoms of the Anthropocenic (phase of) epidemiological transition.

TI Experimental Realization of Optimal Time-Reversal on an Atom Chip for
   Quantum Undo Operations
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The authors report the use of the dressed chopped random basis optimal control algorithm to realize time-reversal procedures. The latter are aimed for the implementation of quantum undo operations in quantum technology contexts as quantum computing and quantum communications.. The last performed operation can be time-reversed via the undo command so as to perfectly restore a condition in which any new operation, chosen by the external user, can be applied. By generalizing this concept, the undo command can also allow for the reversing of a quantum operation in a generic time instant of the past. Here, thanks to optimal time-reversal routines, all these functionalities are experimentally implemented on the fivefold F=2$F=2$ Hilbert space of a Bose-Einstein condensate of non-interacting Rb-87 atoms in the ground state, realized with an atom chip. Each time-reversal transformation is attained by designing an optimal modulated radio frequency field, achieving on average an accuracy of around 92% in any performed test. The experimental results are accompanied by a thermodynamic interpretation based on the Loschmidt echo. These findings are expected to promote the implementation of time-reversal operations in a real scenario of gate-based quantum computing with a more complex structure than the five-level system considered here.

TI Qubit lattice algorithm simulations of Maxwell's equations for
   scattering from anisotropic dielectric objects
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB A Dyson map explicitly determines the appropriate basis of electromagnetic fields which yields a unitary representation of the Maxwell equations in an inhomogeneous medium. A qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is then developed perturbatively to solve this representation of Maxwell equations. A QLA consists of an interleaved unitary sequence of collision operators (that entangle on lattice-site qubits) and streaming operators (that move this entanglement throughout the lattice). External potential operators are introduced to handle gradients in the refractive indices, and these operators are typically non-unitary but sparse matrices. By also interleaving the external potential operators with the unitary collide-stream operators, one achieves a QLA which conserves energy to high accuracy. Some two dimensional simulations results are presented for the scattering of a one-dimensional (1D) pulse off a localized anisotropic dielectric object.

We measure internal quality factors of a million for test resonators excited at single-photon levels, on chips with superconducting vias used to stitch ground planes on the front and back sides of the chips. This resonator performance is on par with the state of the art for silicon-based planar solutions, despite the presence of vias. Via stitching of ground planes is an important enabling technology for increasing the physical size of quantum processor chips and is a first step toward more complex quantum devices with 3-D integration.

TI Predicting Gibbs-State Expectation Values with Pure Thermal Shadows
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The preparation and computation of many properties of quantum Gibbs states is essential for algorithms such as quantum semidefinite programming and quantum Boltzmann machines. We propose a quantum algorithm that can predict M linear functions of an arbitrary Gibbs state with only O(logM) experimental measurements. Our main insight is that for sufficiently large systems we do not need to prepare the n- qubit mixed Gibbs state explicitly but, instead, we can evolve a random n-qubit pure state in imaginary time. The result then follows by constructing classical shadows of these random pure states. We propose a quantum circuit that implements this algorithm by using quantum signal processing for the imaginary time evolution. We numerically verify the efficiency of the algorithm by simulating the circuit for a ten -spin-1/2 XXZ-Heisenberg model. In addition, we show that the algorithm can be successfully employed as a subroutine for training an eight-qubit fully connected quantum Boltzmann machine.

TI Silicon Vacancy Color Centers in 6H-SiC Fabricated by Femtosecond Laser

SO NANOMANUFACTURING AND METROLOGY
AB As a single photon source, silicon vacancy (VSi) centers in wide bandgap semiconductor silicon carbide (SiC) are expected to be used in quantum technology as spin qubits to participate in quantum sensing and quantum computing. Simultaneously, the new direct femtosecond (fs) laser writing technology has been successfully applied to preparing VSis in SiC. In this study, 6H-SiC, which has been less studied, was used as the processed material. VSi center arrays were formed on the 6H-SiC surface using a 1030-nm-wavelength fs pulsed laser. The surface was characterized by white light microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and confocal photoluminescence (PL)/Raman spectrometry. The effect of fs laser energy, vector polarization, pulse number, and repetition rate on 6H-SiC VSi defect preparation was analyzed by measuring the VSi PL signal at 785-nm laser excitation. The results show that fs laser energy and pulse number greatly influence the preparation of the color center, which plays a key role in optimizing the yield of VSis prepared by fs laser nanomachining.

TI Diamond Quantum Sensing Revealing the Relation between Free Radicals and
   Huntington's Disease
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB Huntington's disease (HD) is a well-studied yetrare diseasecaused by a specific mutation that results in the expression of polyglutamine(PolyQ). The formation of aggregates of PolyQ leads to disease andincreases the level of free radicals. However, it is unclear wherefree radicals are generated and how they impact cells. To addressthis, a new method called relaxometry was used to perform nanoscaleMRI measurements with a subcellular resolution. The method uses adefect in fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) that changes its optical propertiesbased on its magnetic surroundings, allowing for sensitive detectionof free radicals. To investigate if radical generation occurs nearPolyQ aggregates, stable tetracycline (tet)-inducible HDQ119-EGFP-expressinghuman embryonic kidney cells (HEK PQ) were used to induce the PolyQformation and Huntington aggregation. The study found that NDs arehighly colocalized with PolyQ aggregates at autolysosomes, and asthe amount of PolyQ aggregation increased, so did the production offree radicals, indicating a relationship between PolyQ aggregationand autolysosome dysfunction.
   Relaxometryand nanoscale MRI measurements reveals thatfree radicals are generated near PolyQ aggregates at autolysosomes.This is likely either a cause or consequence of the Huntington diseasephenotype.

TI Single Bell inequality to detect genuine nonlocality in three-qubit pure
   genuinely entangled states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB It remains an open question whether every pure multipartite state that is genuinely entangled is also genuinely nonlocal. Recently, a new general construction of Bell inequalities allowing the detection of genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) in quantum states was proposed in Curchod et al (2019 New J. Phys. 21 023016) with the aim of addressing the above problem. Here we show how, in a simple manner, one can improve this construction to deliver finer Bell inequalities for detection of GMNL. Remarkably, we then prove one of the improved Bell inequalities to be powerful enough to detect GMNL in every three-qubit genuinely entangled state. We also generalize some of these inequalities to detect not only GMNL but also nonlocality depth in multipartite states and we present a possible way of generalizing them to the case of more outcomes.

TI Near-periodic behavior and parameter-insensitive dynamics of a giant
   atom interacting with a continuum
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We consider the solutions of a two-level atom (qubit) coupled to a discretized continuum in the case when the system initially start out in a continuum state. By solving the model we explain the origin of two new pronounced features of a widely used model which has been used for numerous recent studies related to quantum information. In this work we document two new phenomena related to the dynamics which occur when the system is starting out in the continuum. First, dissipatively non-periodic dynamics is replaced by near-periodic oscillatory dynamics when the initial state is switched to be an initially populated continuum state, in combination with a qubit ground state. Second, when the qubit is coupled to two well separated points, the initial state exhibits an exact linear, stepwise decay which is completely insensitive to the coupling parameters.

TI Carbon quantum dots as modulators of hydroxyapatite c-axis orientation
   and mechanical reinforcement in dentin: Unlocking quantum entanglement
   and coherence on biomineralization
SO JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB Objective: This laboratory and in-silico study investigated the potential of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to modulate the crystal orientation and mechanical properties of dentin hydroxyapatite (HAp), with a focus on the structurally critical c-axis. Methods: Dentin specimens were treated with varying concentrations of functionalized CQDs (0.1 %-0.5 %) and subjected to artificial demineralization. Structural and mechanical changes were assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanoindentation, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Collagen organization and mineral crystallinity were evaluated through SAXS and NMR spectroscopy. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and the Tukey Post hoc tests. Results: CQD-treated groups, particularly at 0.3 % and 0.5 % concentrations, exhibited enhanced HAp crystallinity, improved alignment along the c-axis, and increased collagen fibril organization. Raman and XRD analyses confirmed higher mineral-to-matrix ratios and reduced lattice disorder. Mechanical testing revealed significant increases in hardness and elastic modulus. DFT simulations (p < 0.05) supported the hypothesis of CQD-induced lattice stabilization via Ca-site substitution and spin-orbital coupling. Conclusion: Functionalized CQDs represent a novel strategy for reinforcing dentin by modulating and modifying HAp crystal orientation and collagen architecture through quantum-level interactions.

TI Exploring magnetic field impacts on electromagnetically induced
   transparency: Decoherence and nonlinear effects in rubidium vapor
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This study explores electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with a focus on the influence of external magnetic fields, examining effects such as decoherence, Faraday rotation, coherence decay, and signal detuning. This model extends previous analyses by introducing dimensions of coherence decay across atomic densities, nonlinear Faraday rotation dependencies, and transmission responses to detuning. The findings show strong agreement with experimental observations in rubidium vapor systems and provide new insights relevant to applications in quantum memory, magnetic sensing, and optical modulation. Additionally, an analogy to classical RLC circuits is employed to offer an intuitive framework for understanding decoherence's impact on EIT.

TI M-neighbor approximation in one-qubit state transfer along zigzag
   and alternating spin-1/2 chains
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We consider the M-neighbor approximation in the problem of one-qubit pure state transfer along the N-node zigzag and alternating spin chains governed by the XXZ-Hamiltonian with the dipole-dipole interaction. We show that always M > 1, i.e., the nearest neighbor approximation is not applicable to such interaction. Moreover, only all-node interaction (M = N - 1) properly describes the dynamics in the alternating chain. We reveal the region in the parameter space characterizing the chain geometry and orientation which provide the high-probability state-transfer. The optimal state-transfer probability and appropriate time instant for the zigzag and alternating chains are compared.

TI Implementation of the quantum full-adder algorithm using integrated
   optics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB One of the main challenges in quantum computing is implementing algorithms within quantum optical free-space and integrated circuits. This research focuses on the quantum addition algorithm, derived from the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, to advance quantum computing using optical technologies. The developed quantum optical integrated circuit is built on a hybrid substrate with interconnected components on a silicon dioxide base. Qubits and their states are arranged according to the requirements of each quantum algorithm. In the Fourier transform section, qubits act as propagation modes within silicon waveguides, with emitted photons representing the Fourier transform after traveling a distance of pi/2. The phase-shifting section consists of two parts: one shifts the phase of incoming photons by pi, while the other modulates this shift based on the quantum full adder algorithm. The first employs a photonic crystal for short phase shifts, which are adjusted via impurities in the silicon substrate and controlled by an electro-optic circuit. Additionally, single-mode waveguides made of silicon dioxide and air serve as qubits. By coupling photon amplitudes, a comparator circuit is triggered based on the generated output. Through these integrations, the sum of two quantum numbers can be represented at the output. This underscores the importance of designing and simulating a full adder within quantum optical integrated circuits to address the complexities inherent in quantum computing.

TI Syrga2: Post-Quantum Hash-Based Signature Scheme
SO COMPUTATION
AB This paper proposes a new post-quantum signature scheme, Syrga2, based on hash functions. As known, existing post-quantum algorithms are classified based on their structures. The proposed Syrga2 scheme belongs to the class of multi-use signatures with state retention. A distinctive feature of state-retaining signatures is achieving a compromise between performance and signature size. This scheme enables the creation of a secure signature for r messages using a single pair of secret and public keys. The strength of signature algorithms based on hash functions depends on the properties of the hash function used in their structure. Additionally, for such algorithms, it is possible to specify the security level precisely. In the proposed scheme, the HBC-256 algorithm developed at the Institute of Information and Computational Technologies (IICT) is used as the hash function. The security of the HBC-256 algorithm has been thoroughly studied in other works by the authors. In contrast to the Syrga1 scheme presented in previous works by the authors, the Syrga2 scheme provides for the definition of different security levels determined by the parameter tau. This paper experimentally demonstrates the impossibility of breaking the proposed scheme using a chosen-plaintext attack. Additionally, the scheme's performance is evaluated for signature creation, signing, and message verification.

TI Modular Tunable Coupler for Superconducting Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The development of modular and versatile quantum interconnect hardware is a key next step in the scaling of quantum information platforms to larger size and greater functionality. For superconducting quantum systems, fast and well-controlled tunable circuit couplers will be paramount for achieving highfidelity and resource-efficient connectivity, whether for performing two-qubit gate operations, encoding or decoding a quantum data bus, or interfacing across modalities. Here we propose a versatile and internally tunable double-transmon coupler (DTC) architecture that implements tunable coupling via flux-controlled interference in a three-junction dc superconducting quantum interference device. Crucially, the DTC possesses an internally defined zero-coupling state that is independent of the coupled data qubits or circuit resonators. This makes it particularly attractive as a modular and versatile design element for realizing fast and robust linear coupling in several applications such as high-fidelity two-qubit gate operations, qubit readout, and quantum bus interfacing.

TI Nonlocal correlations in an asymmetric quantum network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The nonlocality revealed in a multiparty multisource network Bell experiment is conceptually different than the standard multiparty Bell nonlocality involving a single common source. Here, by introducing variants of asymmetric bilocal as well as trilocal network scenarios, we go beyond the typical bilocal network scenario where both the edge parties have an equal number of measurement settings. We first introduce an asymmetric bilocal network where one of the edge parties (say, Alice) receives 2n-1 inputs and the other edge party (say, Charlie) receives n inputs. We derive two variants of asymmetric bilocality inequalities and demonstrate their optimal quantum violations. Further, we explore two types of asymmetric trilocal scenarios: (i) when two edge parties receive 2n-1 inputs each and the other edge party receives n inputs, and (ii) when one edge party receives 2n-1 inputs and the other two edge parties have n inputs each. We use an elegant sum-of-squares technique that enables us to evaluate the quantum optimal values of the proposed network inequalities without assuming the dimension of the systems for both the asymmetric bilocal as well as the trilocal scenarios. Further, we demonstrate the robustness of the quantum violations of the proposed inequalities in the presence of white noise.

TI Coherent optical processes with an all-optical atomic simulator

AB We show how novel photonic devices such as broadband quantum memory and efficient quantum frequency transduction can be implemented using three-wave mixing processes in a 1D array of nonlinear waveguides evanescently coupled to nearest neighbors. We do this using an analogy of an atom interacting with an external optical field using both classical and quantum models of the optical fields and adapting well-known coherent processes from atomic optics, such as electromagnetically induced transparency and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage to design. This approach allows the implementation of devices that are very difficult or impossible to implement by conventional techniques.

TI Quantum computational advantage with a programmable photonic processor
SO NATURE
AB A quantum computer attains computational advantage when outperforming the best classical computers running the best-known algorithms on well-defined tasks. No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines(1,2) were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing(3), in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling(4) (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity(5), using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000 years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36 mu s. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal.

TI Integration of bright color centers into arrays of silicon carbide
   nanopillars
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor combining mature fabrication processes with the ability to host optically active point defects, called color centers, making it ideal for quantum technologies. This study focuses on silicon vacancy defects in 4H-SiC, integrated into nanopillar arrays fabricated via ion implantation, e-beam lithography, and reactive ion etching. SiC nanopillars with a height of 1.4 mu m are formed and arrays with varying pillar diameters and spacings are obtained. Cathodoluminescence measurements at 80 K reveal a two to four times improvement in light collection efficiency from the defects compared to unstructured SiC. The cathodoluminescence intensity increases with a smaller pillar spacing and a larger diameter. These findings demonstrate the potential of SiC nanopillar arrays as scalable platforms for enhancing quantum photonic device performance.

Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.

TI O2MD2: A New Post-Quantum Cryptosystem With One-to-Many
   Distributed Key Management Based on Prime Modulo Double Encapsulation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Polynomial-time attacks designed to run on quantum computers and capable of breaking RSA and AES are already known. It is imperative to develop quantum-resistant algorithms before quantum computers become available. Computationally hard problems defined on lattices have been proposed as the fundamental security bases for a new type of cryptography. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently hosted the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project, aiming to create a roster of innovative post-quantum cryptosystems. These candidates have been publicly available for testing since early 2017. As they are currently under analysis, new proposals are still desirable. As such, we use the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem combined with arithmetic functions to propose the O2MD(2) cryptosystem, which provides a one-to-many private/public key architecture having a distributed key refresh for a network of users while working on multiple polynomial rings over different prime order fields. Our solution has three different frameworks that reach AES-256 equivalent security, and provides message integrity and message authenticity verifications. We compare our solution's speed against the speed of the twenty-six different implementations from seven popular candidates in the NIST project, and our cryptosystem performs from 2 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than them. We also propose six different implementations that reach the security levels 1, 3 and 5 proposed in the NIST competition. Finally, we used the NIST Statistical Test Suite to verify the indistinguishability of our produced ciphertexts against randomly generated noise.

TI On the learnability of quantum state fidelity
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Current quantum processing technology is generally noisy with a limited number of qubits, stressing the importance of quantum state fidelity estimation. The complexity of this problem is mainly due to not only accounting for single gates and readout errors but also for interactions among which. Existing methods generally rely on either reconstructing the given circuit state, ideal state, and computing the distance of which; or forcing the system to be on a specific state. Both rely on conducting circuit measurements, in which computational efficiency is traded off with obtained fidelity details, requiring an exponential number of experiments for full information. This paper poses the question: Is the mapping between a given quantum circuit and its state fidelity learnable? If learnable, this would be a step towards an alternative approach that relies on machine learning, providing much more efficient computation. To answer this question, we propose three deep learning models for 1-, 3-, and 5-qubit circuits and experiment on the following real-quantum processors: ibmq_armonk (1-qubit), ibmq_lima (5-qubit) and ibmq_quito (5-qubit) backends, respectively. Our models achieved a mean correlation factor of 0.74, 0.67 and 0.66 for 1-, 3-, and 5-qubit random circuits, respectively, with the exponential state tomography method. Additionally, our 5-qubit model outperforms simple baseline state fidelity estimation method on three quantum benchmarks. Our method, trained on random circuits only, achieved a mean correlation factor of 0.968 while the baseline method achieved 0.738. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of dynamic noise on state fidelity estimation. The correlation factor substantially improved to 0.82 and 0.74 for the 3- and 5-qubit models, respectively. The results show that machine learning is promising for predicting state fidelity from circuit representation and this work may be considered a step towards efficient end-to-end learning.

TI Global Realism with Bipolar Strings: From Bell Test to Real-World
   Causal-Logical Quantum Gravity and Brain-Universe Similarity for
   Entangled Machine Thinking and Imagination
SO INFORMATION
AB Following Einstein's prediction that "Physics constitutes a logical system of thought" and "Nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas", this topical review outlines a formal extension of local realism limited by the speed of light to global realism with bipolar strings (GRBS) that unifies the principle of locality with quantum nonlocality. The related literature is critically reviewed to justify GRBS which is shown as a necessary and inevitable consequence of the Bell test and an equilibrium-based axiomatization of physics and quantum information science for brain-universe similarity and human-level intelligence. With definable causality in regularity and mind-light-matter unity for quantum superposition/entanglement, bipolar universal modus ponens (BUMP) in GRBS makes quantum emergence and submergence of spacetime logically ubiquitous in both the physical and mental worlds-an unexpected but long-sought simplification of quantum gravity with complete background independence. It is shown that GRBS forms a basis for quantum intelligence (QI)-a spacetime transcendent, quantum-digital compatible, analytical quantum computing paradigm where bipolar strings lead to bipolar entropy as a nonlinear bipolar dynamic and set-theoretic unification of order and disorder as well as linearity and nonlinearity for energy/information conservation, regeneration, and degeneration toward quantum cognition and quantum biology (QCQB) as well as information-conservational blackhole keypad compression and big bang data recovery. Subsequently, GRBS is justified as a real-world quantum gravity (RWQG) theory-a bipolar relativistic causal-logical reconceptualization and unification of string theory, loop quantum gravity, and M-theory-the three roads to quantum gravity. Based on GRBS, the following is posited: (1) life is a living bipolar superstring regulated by bipolar entropy; (2) thinking with consciousness and memory growth as a prerequisite for human-level intelligence is fundamentally mind-light-matter unitary QI logically equivalent to quantum emergence (entanglement) and submergence (collapse) of spacetime. These two posits lead to a positive answer to the question "If AI machine cannot think, can QI machine think?". Causal-logical brain modeling (CLBM) for entangled machine thinking and imagination (EMTI) is proposed and graphically illustrated. The testability and falsifiability of GRBS are discussed.

TI The Entanglement Wedge Duality and Hilbert Space Factorization in
   AdS/CFT, Karch-Randall Braneworld and Black Hole Physics
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB The entanglement wedge duality in AdS/CFT, Karch-Randall braneworld and black hole (BH) physics is discussed, critically (as in critiques) revolving around Terashima (2024) and Mathur (2009). Emphasis are placed on the semiclassicality requirement and potential breakdown of bulk-wise effective Hilbert space factorization between the BH exterior and the interior, supported by various examples. In particular, a simple quasi-paradox for the entanglement wedge duality in AdS/BCFT is put forward, suggesting that it is not possible to have all of semiclassicality, the entanglement wedge duality and bulk-wise Hilbert space factorization in Karch-Randall braneworld. Giving up factorization, a toy qudit model of BCFT is developed as to derive purification of the BH exterior, despite mostly sharing the setup with the small corrections theorem of Mathur (2009). Put together, the entanglement wedge duality is yet to be disproved despite some results by Terashima, and a toy qudit model cannot disprove semiclassicality in BH physics. The precise understanding of the duality also helps identify how the BH information paradox is dissolved within double holography beyond Karch-Randall braneworld setups.

SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We prove a generalization of the strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy for bosonic quantum Gaussian systems. Such generalization determines the minimum values of linear combinations of the entropies of subsystems associated to arbitrary linear functions of the quadratures, and holds for arbitrary quantum states including the scenario where the entropies are conditioned on a memory quantum system. We apply our result to prove new entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory, a generalization of the quantum Entropy Power Inequality, and the linear time scaling of the entanglement entropy produced by quadratic Hamiltonians.

TI Concentration estimates for random subspaces of a tensor product and
   application to quantum information theory
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Given a random subspace H-n chosen uniformly in a tensor product of Hilbert spaces V-n & OTIMES; W, we consider the collection K-n of all singular values of all norm one elements of H-n with respect to the tensor structure. A law of large numbers has been obtained for this random set in the context of W fixed and the dimension of H-n, V-n tending to infinity at the same speed by Belinschi, Collins, and Nechita [Commun. Math. Phys. 341(3), 885-909 (2016)]. In this paper, we provide measure concentration estimates in this context. The probabilistic study of K-n was motivated by important questions in quantum information theory and allowed us to provide the smallest known dimension for the dimension of an ancilla space, allowing for Minimum Output Entropy (MOE) violation. With our estimates, we are able, as an application, to provide actual bounds for the dimension of spaces where the violation of MOE occurs. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Teleportation Revealed
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum teleportation is the name of a problem: How can the real-valued parameters encoding the state at Alice's location make their way to Bob's location via shared entanglement and only two bits of classical communication? Without an explanation, teleportation appears to be a conjuring trick. Investigating the phenomenon with Schr & ouml;dinger states and reduced density matrices shall always leave loose ends because they are not local and complete descriptions of quantum systems. Upon demonstrating that the Heisenberg picture admits a local and complete description, Deutsch and Hayden rendered its explanatory power manifest by revealing the trick behind teleportation, namely, by providing an entirely local account. Their analysis is re-exposed and further developed.

AB Monogamy of entanglement essentially characterizes the entanglement distributions among the subsystems. It is generally given by summation-form monogamy inequalities. In this paper, we present the product-form monogamy inequalities satisfied by the nu th ( nu >= 2) power of the concurrence. We demonstrate that they are tighter than the existing ones through a detailed examples. We then establish tighter product-form monogamy inequalities based on the negativity. We show that they are valid even for high-dimensional states for which the well-known Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters inequality are violated.

TI Quantum Biotech and Internet of Virus Things: Towards a Theoretical
   Framework
SO APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION
AB Quantumization, the process of converting information into quantum (qubit) format, is a key enabler for propelling a new and distinct infrastructure in the pharmaceutical space. Quantum messenger RNA (QmRNA) technology, an indispensable constituent of quantum biotech (QB), is a compelling alternative to conventional vaccine methods because of its capacity for rapid development, high efficacy, and low-cost manufacturing to combat infectious diseases. Internet of Virus Things (IoVT), a biological version of Internet of Things (IoT), comprises applications to fight against pandemics and provides effective vaccine administration. The integration of QB and IoVT constitutes the QBIoVT system to advance the prospect of QmRNA vaccine discovery within a few days. This research disseminates the QBIoVT system paradigm, including architectural aspects, priority areas, challenges, applications, and QmRNA research engine design to accelerate QmRNA vaccines discovery. A comprehensive review of the literature was accomplished, and a context-centered methodology was applied to the QBIoVT paradigm forensic investigations to impel QmRNA vaccine discovery. Based on the above rumination, the principal motive for this study was to develop a novel QBIoVT theoretical framework which has not been produced through earlier theories. The proposed framework shall inspire future QBIoVT system research activities to improve pandemics detection and protection.

TI Shannon theory beyond quantum: Information content of a source
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The information content of a source is defined in terms of the minimum number of bits needed to store the output of the source in a perfectly recoverable way. A similar definition can be given in the case of quantum sources, with qubits replacing bits. In the mentioned cases the information content can be quantified through Shannon???s and von Neumann???s entropy, respectively. Here we extend the definition of information content to operational probabilistic theories, and prove relevant properties such as the subadditivity and the relation between purity and information content of a state. We prove the consistency of the present notion of information content when applied to the classical and the quantum case. Finally, the relation with one of the notions of entropy that can be introduced in general probabilistic theories, the maximum accessible information, is given in terms of a lower bound.

TI Multi-Layer QCA Reversible Full Adder-Subtractor Using Reversible Gates
   for Reliable Information Transfer and Minimal Power Dissipation on
   Universal Quantum Computer
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The effects of quantum mechanics dominate nanoscale devices, where Moore's law no longer holds true. Additionally, with the recent rapid development of quantum computers, the development of reversible gates to overcome the problems of energy and information loss and the nano-level quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) technology to efficiently implement them are in the spotlight. In this study, a full adder-subtractor, a core operation of the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), the most important hardware device in computer operations, is implemented as a circuit capable of reversible operation using QCA-based reversible gates. The proposed circuit consists of one reversible QCA gate and two Feynman gates and is designed as a multi-layer structure for efficient use of area and minimization of delay. The proposed circuit is tested on QCADesigner 2.0.3 and QCADesigner-E 2.2 and shows the best performance and lowest energy dissipation. In particular, it shows tremendous improvement rates of 180% and 562% in two representative standard design cost indicators compared to the best existing studies, and also shows the highest circuit average output polarization.

TI Entanglement generation between distant spins via quasilocal reservoir
   engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The generation and preservation of entanglement is a central goal in quantum technology. Traditionally, dissipation in quantum systems is thought to be detrimental to entanglement, however dissipation can also be utilized as a means of generating entanglement between quantum spins that are not directly interacting. In particular, entanglement can be generated between two qubits, or multiqubit systems via a collective coupling to a reservoir. In this work, we explore multiple spin domains pairwise coupled to different reservoirs and show that entanglement can be generated between spins which are not coupled to each other, or even coupled to the same reservoir.

TI Efficient fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates with

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB To achieve scalable universal quantum computing, we need to implement a universal set of logical gates fault-tolerantly, for which the main difficulty lies with non-Clifford gates. We demonstrate that several characteristic features of the reconfigurable atom array platform are inherently well-suited for addressing this key challenge, potentially leading to significant advantages in fidelity and efficiency. Specifically, we consider a series of different strategies, including magic state distillation, concatenated code array, and fault-tolerant logical multi-controlled-Z gates, leveraging key platform features such as nonlocal connectivity, parallel gate action, collective mobility, and native multi-controlled-Z gates. Our analysis provides valuable insights into the efficient experimental realization of logical gates, serving as a guide for the full-cycle demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computation with reconfigurable atom arrays.

TI Uncertainty Relation and Quantum Phase Transition in the Two-Dimensional
   Ising Model
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB By using quantum renormalization group (QRG) approach, we first derive the effective Hamiltonian and QRG equations of the two-dimensional (2D) Ising models with two different time-dependent transverse magnetic fields analytically. Then we examine the nonanalytic and scaling behaviors of the linear-entropy-based uncertainty relation and quantum entanglement of the models near the critical point through numerical analysis. Moreover, we investigate the relation between the quantum critical point and the external magnetic field. Our results show that both the uncertainty relation and the quantum entanglement are feasible to detect the quantum phase transition (QPT), and the uncertainty relation may be a better indicator of QPT than quantum entanglement. Our findings could shed new light on the observable of the QPTs of the solid-state system with the uncertainty relation.

TI Experimental extraction of coherent ergotropy and its energetic cost in
   a superconducting qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum coherence, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of a system's density matrix, is a key resource in quantum thermodynamics, fundamentally limiting the maximum extractable work known as ergotropy. While previous experiments have isolated coherence-related contributions to work extraction, it remains unclear how coherence can be harnessed in a controllable and energy-efficient manner. Here, we experimentally investigate the role of initial-state coherence in work extraction from a superconducting transmon qubit. By preparing a variety of pure states and implementing three complementary extraction protocols, we reveal how coherence governs the partitioning of ergotropy. We find that the choice of initial state depends on the dominant decoherence channel-energy relaxation or dephasing. By further accounting for thermodynamic costs, we identify optimal initial states that maximize the efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the initial-state design provides a scalable approach to coherence control and advances the development of efficient quantum thermodynamic devices.

TI Large-N Chern insulators: Lattice field theory and quantum
   simulation approaches to correlation effects in the quantum anomalous
   Hall effect
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Four-Fermi quantum field theories in (2+1) dimensions lie among the simplest models in high-energy physics, the understanding of which requires a non-perturbative lattice formulation addressing their strongly-coupled fixed points. These lattice models are also relevant in condensed matter, as they offer a neat playground to explore strong correlations in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. We give a detailed description of our multidisciplinary approach to understand the fate of the QAH phases as the four-Fermi interactions are increased, which combines strong-coupling and effective-potential techniques, unveiling a rich phase diagram with large -N Chern insulators and Lorentz breaking fermion condensates. Moreover, this toolbox can be enlarged with recent advances in quantum information science, as we show that tensor-network algorithms based on projected entangled pairs can be used to improve our understanding of the strong-coupling limit. We also present a detailed scheme that uses ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices with synthetic spin- orbit coupling to build quantum simulators of these four-Fermi models. This yields a promising alternative to characterize the strongly-coupled fixed points and, moreover, could also explore real-time dynamics and finite-fermion densities.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Algorithmic means of ensuring network security and websites: trends,
   models, future cases
SO AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
AB The purpose of the study is to establish probable trends in the development of algorithmic means of network security and the protection of web resources in the future. The research methods used in this publication are a bibliometric analysis of 500 relevant publications, which allowed us to establish probable trends in the future development of the subject field. The study found that currently the most likely algorithmic means of network security and website protection that will be intensively developed in the future are blockchain technologies (to protect inter-resource contact), deep and machine learning (to analyze and detect attacks and digital anomalies), artificial intelligence and neural networks (to develop complex security algorithms), and predictive analysis (to prevent possible attacks and malicious data injections). At the same time, technological development makes it possible to identify alternative security tools, including quantum and post-quantum cryptography (which is possible due to the development of quantum computing), augmented reality (which is the next iteration of the development of the interface between machine-human interaction), biometric identification (which is the next iteration of authentication and recognition systems) and DevSecOps (which is a promising technology for the production of digital tools and systems that have a relatively lower level of vulnerability to known digital threats). The correlative impact of Industry 4.0 technologies and solutions on the studied aspects of the security sector of the World Wide Web has been established. The growth of the network of devices requires the improvement of security algorithms in the paradigm of Industry 4.0 technologies, which will allow more effective detection and prevention of cyberattacks and protection of user data.

TI Electron spin resonance with scanning tunneling microscopy: a tool for
   an on-surface quantum platform of identical qubits
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Integration of electron spin resonance (ESR) in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has enabled all-electrical control of atomic and molecular spins on solid surfaces with atomic-scale precision and energy resolution beyond thermal limitations. Further, coherent manipulation and detection of individual spins in an ESR-STM establishes a powerful quantum platform, allowing for the implementation of fundamental quantum logic operations to on-surface identical qubits (same chemical species but ESR-adressable). In this review, we introduce recent advances of ESR-STM, focusing on its application to atomic-scale qubits and extension to molecular qubit systems. We discuss the principles underlying ESR-STM, followed by single-spin addressability, coherent control via Rabi oscillations, and quantum state readout through frequency-resolved detection. We further demonstrate multi-qubit control architectures enabled by atom manipulation and local magnetic field engineering, culminating in the realization of multi-qubit logic gates such as the Controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates. These implementations highlight the specialty of ESR-STM towards atomic-scale quantum circuits. Indeed, ESR-STM can be an excellent tool to perform and evaluate quantum operations in molecular qubits.

TI The effects of single-quantum states and entangled states in quantum
   information based on fractional time Schrodinger equation
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Fractional time quantum mechanics is a method for the description of time evolution of quantum dynamics based on fractional derivatives. In this research, by applying fractional order quantum mechanics to quantum information, we introduced a new fractional time Schrodinger equation (FTSE) and constructed two models for the simulation of single-quantum states and entangled states under noise. We find that the results obtained from the two models are consistent with existing physical phenomena under the influence of the FTSE. We also prove that these two models are stable for fractional order alpha. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Efficiently Verifiable Quantum Advantage on Near-Term Analog Quantum
   Simulators
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Existing schemes for demonstrating quantum computational advantage are subject to various practical restrictions, including the hardness of verification and challenges in experimental implementation. Meanwhile, analog quantum simulators have been realized in many experiments to study novel physics. In this work, we propose a quantum advantage protocol based on single-step Feynman-Kitaev verification of an analog quantum simulation, in which the verifier need only run an O(lambda 2)-time classical computation, and the prover need only prepare O(1) samples of a history state and perform O(lambda 2) single-qubit measurements, for a security parameter lambda. We also propose a near-term feasible strategy for honest provers and discuss potential experimental realizations.

TI Two-qubit quantum nonlocality dynamics induced by interacting of two
   coupled superconducting flux qubits with a resonator under intrinsic
   decoherence
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This paper explores the dynamics of two spatially separated superconducting flux qubits, initially in a maximally correlated state, without mutual interaction. The system is modeled using the master intrinsic decoherence equation with the flux-qubits-resonator interaction Hamiltonian. The effects of initial state, detuning, and decoherence on the generated oscillatory correlation dynamics and the sudden death-birth phenomenon of the two flux-qubits entanglement are exam-ined. The results demonstrate that qubit-resonator-qubit interactions have a high ability to generate quantum interferometric power and local quantum uncertainty correlations beyond that of concur-rence entanglement.& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

TI Architectural patterns for designing quantum artificial intelligence
   systems☆
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Utilising quantum computing technology to enhance artificial intelligence systems is expected to improve training and inference times, increase robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, and reduce the number of parameters without compromising accuracy. However, moving beyond proof-of-concept or simulations to develop practical applications of these systems while ensuring high software quality faces significant challenges due to the limitations of quantum hardware and the underdeveloped knowledge base in software engineering for such systems. In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. The results of the systematic mapping study reveal several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. Each pattern realises a trade-off between various software quality attributes, such as efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability, and deployability. The outcomes of this work have been compiled into a catalogue of architectural patterns.

TI Quantum AI simulator using a hybrid CPU-FPGA approach
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum kernel method has attracted considerable attention in the field of quantum machine learning. However, exploring the applicability of quantum kernels in more realistic settings has been hindered by the number of physical qubits current noisy quantum computers have, thereby limiting the number of features encoded for quantum kernels. Hence, there is a need for an efficient, application-specific simulator for quantum computing by using classical technology. Here we focus on quantum kernels empirically designed for image classification and demonstrate a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) implementation. We show that the quantum kernel estimation by our heterogeneous CPU-FPGA computing is 470 times faster than that by a conventional CPU implementation. The co-design of our application-specific quantum kernel and its efficient FPGA implementation enabled us to perform one of the largest numerical simulations of a gate-based quantum kernel in terms of features, up to 780-dimensional features. We apply our quantum kernel to classification tasks using the Fashion-MNIST dataset and show that our quantum kernel is comparable to Gaussian kernels with the optimized hyperparameter.

TI Generation and transfer of entangled states between two connected
   microtoroidal cavities: Analysis of different types of coupling
SO OPTIK
AB We investigate the generation and transfer of entangled states between two coupled micro -toroidal cavities considering two different types of couplings, namely i) via a bridge qubit and ii) via evanescent fields. The cavities support two counter-propagating whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) that may also interact with each other. We firstly show that it is possible to transfer, with high fidelity, a maximally entangled state between the two modes of the first cavity (cavity 1) to the two modes of the second cavity (cavity 2), independently of the type of coupling. Interesting differences, though, arise concerning the generation of entangled states from initial product states; if the cavities are coupled via a bridge qubit, we show that it is possible to generate a 4-partite entangled state involving all four cavity modes. On the other hand, contrarily to what happens in the qubit coupling case, it is possible to generate bipartite maximally entangled states between modes of different cavities from initial separable states for cavities coupled by evanescent waves. Besides, we show that different entangled states between the propagating and counter-propagating modes of distinct cavities may be generated by tuning the interaction between modes belonging to the same cavity (intra-cavity couplings). Again, this is possible only for the couplings via evanescent waves. For the completion of our work, we discuss the effects of losses on the dynamics of the system.

TI Quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion method for computing
   molecular excitation energies, ionization potentials, and electron
   affinities on a quantum computer
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Near-term quantum computers are expected to facilitate material and chemical research through accurate molecular simulations. Several developments have already shown that accurate ground-state energies for small molecules can be evaluated on present-day quantum devices. Although electronically excited states play a vital role in chemical processes and applications, the search for a reliable and practical approach for routine excited-state calculations on near-term quantum devices is ongoing. Inspired by excited-state methods developed for the unitary coupled-cluster theory in quantum chemistry, we present an equation-of-motion-based method to compute excitation energies following the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm for ground-state calculations on a quantum computer. We perform numerical simulations on H-2, H-4, H2O, and LiH molecules to test our quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion (q-sc-EOM) method and compare it to other current state-of-the-art methods. q-sc-EOM makes use of self-consistent operators to satisfy the vacuum annihilation condition, a critical property for accurate calculations. It provides real and size-intensive energy differences corresponding to vertical excitation energies, ionization potentials and electron affinities. We also find that q-sc-EOM is more suitable for implementation on NISQ devices as it is expected to be more resilient to noise compared with the currently available methods.

TI A quantum k-nearest neighbors algorithm based on the Euclidean distance
   estimation
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) is a basic machine learning (ML) algorithm, and several quantum versions of it, employing different distance metrics, have been presented in the last few years. Although the Euclidean distance is one of the most widely used distance metrics in ML, it has not received much consideration in the development of these quantum variants. In this article, a novel quantum k-NN algorithm based on the Euclidean distance is introduced. Specifically, the algorithm is characterized by a quantum encoding requiring a low number of qubits and a simple quantum circuit not involving oracles, aspects that favor its realization. In addition to the mathematical formulation and some complexity observations, a detailed empirical evaluation with simulations is presented. In particular, the results have shown the correctness of the formulation, a drop in the performance of the algorithm when the number of measurements is limited, the competitiveness with respect to some classical baseline methods in the ideal case, and the possibility of improving the performance by increasing the number of measurements.

TI Coherent Control and Magnetic Detection of Divacancy Spins in Silicon
   Carbide at High Pressures
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Spin defects in silicon carbide appear to be a promising tool for various quantum technologies, especially for quantum sensing. However, this technique has been used only at ambient pressure until now. Here, by combining this technique with diamond anvil cell, we systematically study the optical and spin properties of divacancy defects created at the surface of SiC at pressures up to 40 GPa. The zero-field-splitting of the divacancy spins increases linearly with pressure with a slope of 25.1 MHz/GPa, which is almost two-times larger than that of nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. The corresponding pressure sensing sensitivity is about 0.28 MPa/Hz(-1/2). The coherent control of divacancy demonstrates that coherence time decreases as pressure increases. Based on these, the pressure-induced magnetic phase transition of Nd2Fe14B sample at high pressures was detected. These experiments pave the way to use divacancy in quantum technologies such as pressure sensing and magnetic detection at high pressures.

TI Gaussian Amplitude Amplification for Quantum Pathfinding
SO ENTROPY
AB We study an oracle operation, along with its circuit design, which combined with the Grover diffusion operator boosts the probability of finding the minimum or maximum solutions on a weighted directed graph. We focus on the geometry of sequentially connected bipartite graphs, which naturally gives rise to solution spaces describable by Gaussian distributions. We then demonstrate how an oracle that encodes these distributions can be used to solve for the optimal path via amplitude amplification. And finally, we explore the degree to which this algorithm is capable of solving cases that are generated using randomized weights, as well as a theoretical application for solving the Traveling Salesman problem.

TI Quantum information scrambling and chemical reactions
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The ultimate regularity of quantum mechanics creates a tension with the assumption of classical chaos used in many of our pictures of chemical reaction dynamics. Out- of- time- order correlators (OTOCs) provide a quantum analog to the Lyapunov exponents that characterize classical chaotic motion. Maldacena, Shenker, and Stanford have suggested a fundamental quantum bound for the rate of information scrambling, which resembles a limit suggested by Herzfeld for chemical reaction rates. Here, we use OTOCs to study model reactions based on a double- well reaction coordinate coupled to anharmonic oscillators or to a continuum oscillator bath. Upon cooling, as one enters the tunneling regime where the reaction rate does not strongly depend on temperature, the quantum Lyapunov exponent can approach the scrambling bound and the effective reaction rate obtained from a population correlation function can approach the Herzfeld limit on reaction rates: Tunneling increases scrambling by expanding the state space available to the system. The coupling of a dissipative continuum bath to the reaction coordinate reduces the scrambling rate obtained from the early- time OTOC, thus making the scrambling bound harder to reach, in the same way that friction is known to lower the temperature at which thermally activated barrier crossing goes over to the low- temperature activationless tunneling regime. Thus, chemical reactions entering the tunneling regime can be information scramblers as powerful as the black holes to which the quantum Lyapunov exponent bound has usually been applied.

TI The hBN Defects Database: A Theoretical Compilation of Color Centers in
   Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become an intensively researched system due to their potential applications in quantum technologies. There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments. Here, we publish a density functional theory-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime, quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field sensing or quantum memory applications.

TI Linear Ascending Metrological Algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ubiquitous presence of shot noise sets a fundamental limit to the measurement precision in classical metrology. Recent advances in quantum devices and novel quantum algorithms utilizing interference effects are opening new routes for overcoming the detrimental noise tyranny. However, further progress is limited by the restricted capability of existing algorithms to account for the decoherence pervading experimental implementations. Here, adopting a systematic approach to the evaluation of effectiveness of metrological procedures, we devise the Linear Ascending Metrological Algorithm (LAMA), which offers a remarkable increase in precision in the demanding situation where a decohering quantum system is used to measure a continuously distributed variable. We introduce our protocol in the context of magnetic field measurements, assuming superconducting transmon devices as sensors operated in a qudit mode. Our findings demonstrate a quantum-metrological procedure capable of mitigating detrimental dephasing and relaxation effects.

TI Protecting collective qubits from non-Markovian dephasing
SO OPTICA
AB In quantum technologies, qubits encoded as collective atomic or solid-state excitations present important practical advantages, such as strong directional coupling to light. Unfortunately, they are affected by inhomogeneities between the emitters, which make them decay into dark states. In most cases, this process is non-Markovian. Through a simple formalism, we unveil a regime where this decay is suppressed by a combination of driving and non-Markovianity.We experimentally demonstrate this "driving protection" using a Rydberg superatom, making its coherent Rabi oscillations last about 14 times longer than the free lifetime of the collective qubit.

TI Coherence of a dynamically decoupled single neutral atom
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Long qubit coherence and efficient atom-photon coupling are essential for advanced applications in quantum communication. One technique to maintain coherence is dynamical decoupling (DD), where a periodic sequence of refocusing pulses is employed to reduce the interaction of the system with the environment. We experimentally study the implementation of DD on an optically trapped, spin-polarized Rb-87 atom. We use the two magnetic-sensitive 5S(1/2) Zeeman levels vertical bar F = 2, m(F)= -2 > and vertical bar F = 1, m(F) = -1 > as qubit states, motivated by the possibility of coupling vertical bar F = 2, m(F) = -2 > to 5P(3/2) the excited state vertical bar F' = 3, m(F)' = -3 > via a closed optical transition. With more refocusing pulses in the DD technique, we manage to extend the coherence time from 38(3) mu s to around 7 ms. We also observe a strong correlation between the motional states of the atom and the qubit coherence after the refocusing, which can be used as a measurement basis to resolve trapping parameters.

TI Process-optimized phase-covariant quantum cloning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB After the appearance of the no-cloning theorem, approximate quantum cloning machines (QCMs) has become a well-studied subject in quantum information theory. Among several measures to quantify the performance of a QCM, single-qudit fidelity and global fidelity have been most widely used. In this paper we compute the optimal global fidelity for phase-covariant cloning machines via semidefinite programming optimization, thereby completing a remaining gap in the previous results on QCMs. We also consider optimal simulations of the cloning and transpose cloning map, both by a direct optimization and by a composition of component-wise optimal QCMs. For the cloning map the composition method is suboptimal whereas for the transpose cloning map the method is asymptotically optimal.

TI A compact and versatile cryogenic probe station for quantum device
   testing
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Fast feedback from cryogenic electrical characterization measurements is key for the development of scalable quantum computing technology. At room temperature, high-throughput device testing is accomplished with a probe-based solution, where electrical probes are repeatedly positioned onto devices for acquiring statistical data. In this work we present a probe station that can be operated from room temperature down to below 2$\,$K. Its small size makes it compatible with standard cryogenic measurement setups with a magnet. A large variety of electronic devices can be tested. Here, we demonstrate the performance of the prober by characterizing silicon fin field-effect transistors as a host for quantum dot spin qubits. Such a tool can massively accelerate the design-fabrication-measurement cycle and provide important feedback for process optimization towards building scalable quantum circuits.

TI Does Quantum Mechanics Breed Larger, More Intricate Quantum Theories?
   The Case for Experience-Centric Quantum Theory and the Interactome of
   Quantum Theories
SO UNIVERSE
AB We pose and address the radical question of whether quantum mechanics, known for its firm internal structure and enormous empirical success, carries in itself the genomes of larger quantum theories that have higher internal intricacy and phenomenological versatility. In other words, we consider, at the basic level of closed quantum systems and regardless of interpretational aspects, whether standard quantum theory (SQT) harbors quantum theories with context-based deformed principles or structures, having definite predictive power within much broader scopes. We answer this question in the affirmative following complementary evidence and reasoning arising from quantum-computation-based quantum simulation and fundamental, general, and abstract rationales within the frameworks of information theory, fundamental or functional emergence, and participatory agency. In this light, as we show, one is led to the recently proposed experience-centric quantum theory (ECQT), which is a larger and richer theory of quantum behaviors with drastically generalized quantum dynamics. ECQT allows the quantum information of the closed quantum system's developed state history to continually contribute to defining and updating the many-body interactions, the Hamiltonians, and even the internal elements and "particles" of the total system. Hence, the unitary evolutions are continually impacted and become guidable by the agent system's experience. The intrinsic interplay of unitarity and non-Markovianity in ECQT brings about a host of diverse behavioral phases, which concurrently infuse closed and open quantum system characteristics, and it even surpasses the theory of open systems in SQT. From a broader perspective, a focus of our investigation is the existence of the quantum interactome-the interactive landscape of all coexisting, independent, context-based quantum theories that emerge from inferential participatory agencies-and its predictive phenomenological utility.

Alternatively, it can be seen as a quantum repeater protocol along a line, with neighboring repeaters placed at a short distance to allow constant-fidelity nearest-neighbor operations.

TI Benchmarking hybrid digitized-counterdiabatic quantum optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid digitized-counterdiabatic quantum computing (DCQC) is a promising approach for leveraging the capabilities of nearterm quantum computers, utilizing parameterized quantum circuits designed with counterdiabatic protocols. However, the classical aspect of this approach has received limited attention. In this study, we systematically analyze the convergence behavior and solution quality of various classical optimizers when used in conjunction with the digitized-counterdiabatic approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid algorithm by comparing its performance to the traditional QAOA on systems containing up to 28 qubits. Furthermore, we employ principal component analysis to investigate the cost landscape and explore the crucial influence of parametrization on the performance of the counterdiabatic ansatz. Our findings indicate that fewer iterations are required when local cost landscape minima are present, and the SPSA-based BFGS optimizer emerges as a standout choice for the hybrid DCQC paradigm.

TI Spectrally-resolved higher-order photon statistics of spontaneous
   parametric down-conversion
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB The photon statistics of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) exhibit dependencies on wavelength, pump power, and coincidence time. Notably, the average photon numbers were found to asymmetrically increase with increasing pump power around the degenerate wavelength of emission. We employ a four-detector Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometer to study the photon statistics of the signal beam. Coupling the detection scheme to a spectrometer enabled the dynamic probing of different bandwidths within the broadband emission. Spectrally resolving the photon statistics revealed that shorter wavelengths increased nonlinearly with pump power, while longer wavelengths showed more linear behavior, indicating a wavelength-dependent efficiency in the generation of the SPDC. The detection and characterization of complex light sources has wide ranging applications in the fields of quantum metrology, quantum communications, and quantum computing, more specifically, a system that is sensitive to wavelength and photon number distribution.

TI Classification of translation invariant topological Pauli stabilizer
   codes for prime dimensional qudits on two-dimensional lattices

AB We prove that on any two-dimensional lattice of qudits of a prime dimension, every translation invariant Pauli stabilizer group with local generators and with the code distance being the linear system size is decomposed by a local Clifford circuit of constant depth into a finite number of copies of the toric code stabilizer group (Abelian discrete gauge theory). This means that under local Clifford circuits, the number of toric code copies is the complete invariant of topological Pauli stabilizer codes. Previously, the same conclusion was obtained under the assumption of nonchirality for qubit codes or the Calderbank-Shor-Steane structure for prime qudit codes; we do not assume any of these.

AB Path sums are a convenient symbolic formalism for quantum operations with applications to the simulation, optimization, and verification of quantum protocols. Unlike quantum circuits, path sums are not limited to unitary operations, but can express arbitrary linear ones. Two problems, therefore, naturally arise in the study of path sums: the unitarity problem and the extraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding whether a given path sum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of constructing a quantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary operator.In this paper, we show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general, but that it is in P when restricted to Clifford path sums. We then provide an algorithm to synthesize a Clifford circuit from a unitary Clifford path sum. The circuits produced by our extraction algorithm are of the form C1HC2, where C1 and C2 are Hadamard-free circuits and H is a layer of Hadamard gates. We also provide a heuristic generalization of our extraction algorithm to arbitrary path sums. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to succeed, it often succeeds and typically produces natural looking circuits. Alongside applications to the optimization and decompilation of quantum circuits, we demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by synthesizing the standard quantum Fourier transform directly from a path sum.

TI Controllable operations of edge states in cross-one-dimensional
   topological chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Topological edge states have recently attracted intense interest due to their robustness in the presence of disorder and defects. However, most approaches for manipulating such states require global modulations of the system's Hamiltonian. In this work, we develop a method to control edge states using local interactions of a four-node junction between cross-one-dimensional topological atomic chains. These junction interactions can give rise to tunable couplings between the hybridized edge states within different geometric symmetries, allowing us to implement robust quantum state transfer and SWAP gate between the two topological chains via a double-quench protocol. Moreover, when the atoms in chains are precisely positioned and coupled to waveguides, the correlated decay caused by the environment enables the symmetric edge states to present subradiant dynamics and thus show extremely long coherence time. These findings open up possibilities for future quantum technologies with topological edge states.

TI Partial-transpose-guided entanglement classes and minimum noise
   filtering in many-body Gaussian quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The reduction and distortion of quantum correlations in the presence of classical noise leads to varied levels of inefficiency in the availability of entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing protocols. While generically minimizing required entanglement for mixed quantum states remains challenging, a class of many-body Gaussian quantum states (denoted NIC) is here identified that exhibits two-mode bipartite entanglement structure, resembling that of pure states, for which the logarithmic negativity entanglement measure remains invariant upon inclusion of the classical correlations and optimal entanglement resources can be clearly quantified. This subclass is found to be embedded within a broader class of many-body Gaussian states (denoted N-SOL) that retain two-mode entanglement structure for detection processes. These two entanglement classes are relevant in theoretical and experimental applications from the scalar field vacuum to the local axial motional modes of trapped ion chains. Utilizing the subspace that heralds inseparability in response to partial transposition, a minimum noise filtering process is designed to be necessary, sufficient, and computable for determining membership in these classes of entanglement structure. Application of this process to spacelike regions of the free scalar field vacuum is found to improve resource upper bounds, providing new understanding of the entanglement required for the quantum simulation of quantum fields as observed by arrays of local detectors.

AB Graph rewriting is a popular tool for the optimisation and modification of graph expressions in domains such as compilers, machine learning and quantum computing. The underlying data structures are often port graphs-graphs with labels at edge endpoints. A pre-requisite for graph rewriting is the ability to find graph patterns. We propose a new solution to pattern matching in port graphs. Its novelty lies in the use of a pre-computed data structure that makes the pattern matching runtime complexity independent of the number of patterns. This offers a significant advantage over existing solutions for use cases with large sets of small patterns. Our approach is particularly well-suited for quantum superoptimisation. We provide an implementation and benchmarks showing that our algorithm offers a 20x speedup over current implementations on a dataset of 10000 real world patterns describing quantum circuits.

The concentration of applied nitrogen directly determines the properties of the superconducting thin films. We observe samples displaying critical temperatures up to 3.38 +/- 0.01 K and resilience to in-plane magnetic fields well above 1 T, with good reproducibility of the results. This work represents an unambiguous demonstration of tunable superconductivity in aluminum-based nitridized thin films.

TI Exploring the relationship between deposition method, microstructure,
   and performance of Nb/Si-based superconducting coplanar waveguide
   resonators
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Superconducting quantum circuits (SQC) are one of the most promising hardware platforms for quantum computing, yet their performance is currently limited by the presence of various structural defects inside the circuit's structure. Despite impressive progress in the past decade, a precise understanding of the origin of these defects from various fabrication processes and their impact on coherence is still lacking. In this study, we performed a comprehensive investigation on the microstructure, superconductivity, and resonator quality factor of Nb films deposited by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering. A suite of characterization techniques, including electron microscopy with spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, magneto-optical microscopy, and pump-probe reflectivity spectroscopy is used. We reveal that niobium (Nb) resonators fabricated using HiPIMS exhibit a smaller average grain size, thicker surface oxide with larger thickness variations (rougher surface), and a thicker amorphous Nb/Si interface layer compared to samples deposited by DC sputtering. We identified that the amorphous Nb oxides (mainly located at the Nb surface and along the grain boundaries) and Nb-Si amorphous layers (at the Nb/Si interface) are major and potential sources of two-level system (TLS), while off-stochiometric oxides and suboxides of Nb close to the surface, crystalline defects (i.e., dislocations at grain boundary, point defects introduced during deposition) are main contributors of non-TLS sources. Our findings clarify the relationship between different defects and coherence loss mechanisms, highlighting the importance of material microstructure control on performance optimization in SQC.

This lack of covariance manifests itself as an ambiguity in the time-ordering operation. We analyze how the breakdown of covariance affects typical detector models in quantum field theory such as the Unruh-DeWitt model. Specifically, we show how the violations of covariance depend on the state of the detectors-field system, the shape and state of motion of the detectors, and the spacetime geometry. Furthermore, we provide the tools to explicitly evaluate the magnitude of the violation and identify the regimes where the predictions of smeared detectors are either exactly or approximately covariant in perturbative analyses, thus providing limits of validity of smeared particle detector models.

TI Loss-Induced Quantum Information Jet in an Infinite Temperature Hubbard
   Chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Information propagation in the one-dimensional infinite temperature Hubbard model with a dissipative particle sink at the end of a semi-infinite chain is studied. In the strongly interacting limit, the two-site mutual information and the operator entanglement entropy exhibit a rich structure with two propagating information fronts and superimposed interference fringes. A classical reversible cellular automaton model quantitatively captures the transport and the slow, classical part of the correlations but fails to describe the rapidly propagating information jet. The fast quantum jet resembles coherent free particle propagation, with the accompanying long-ranged interference fringes that are exponentially damped by short-ranged spin correlations in the many-body background.

TI Elementary characterization of Bargmann invariants
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bargmann invariants, also known as multivariate traces of quantum states Tr(rho 1 rho 2 <middle dot> <middle dot> <middle dot> rho n), are unitary invariant quantities used to characterize weak values, Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities, out-of-time-order correlators, and geometric phases. Here we give a complete characterization of the set Bn of complex values that nth-order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that Bn is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the nth power of the complex unit n-gon and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order n is realizable using either qubit states or circulant qutrit states.

TI Nonlocal correlations dynamics of two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ states with
   influence of intrinsic decoherence and y-component of
   Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we explore nonlocal correlation and Bell non-locality in a two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ model by using Bell-CHSH inequality and uncertainty induced nonlocality (UIN) as well as log-negativity. We consider the effects of spin-qubits XYZ-Heisenberg couplings, the y-component of DM interaction, and intrinsic decoherence. Our results show that spin-qubits Heisenberg couplings have a strong ability to create two-qubit nonlocal correlations, enhanced by combining with DM interactions. The generated Bell-CHSH nonlocality and entanglement conform to the hierarchy principle. The UIN correlation is more resistant to intrinsic decoherence compared to Bell-CHSH inequality and log-negativity. Intrinsic decoherence causes the disappearance of Bell-CHSH non-locality and log-negativity entanglement, while leading to the appearance of partial stationary spin-qubits UIN correlation.

TI Ultrathin Magnesium-Based Coating as an Efficient Oxygen Barrier for
   Superconducting Circuit Materials
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer is presented. Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher-temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, an atomic-scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation is established based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, the findings pave the way for the realization of large-scale, high-performance quantum computing systems.
   Through a combined experimental and computational study, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin Mg capping layer effectively suppresses the oxidation of tantalum (Ta), a promising material for superconducting qubits. With Mg acting as an oxygen barrier and getter, the superconducting properties of the underlaying Ta thin films are improved, exhibiting sharper transition to the Meissner state at higher critical temperature. image

TI Efficient methods for extracting superconducting resonator loss in the
   single-photon regime
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Superconducting micro-resonators have application in sensors and quantum computing. Measurement of the resonator internal loss in the single-photon regime is a common tool to study the origins of dissipation, noise, and decoherence in quantum circuits, as well as characterization of materials used for quantum devices. However, such measurements are challenging and time-consuming with large uncertainties due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio when measured at single-photon power levels. We developed methods to extract a subset of the resonator fitting parameters at high power and fix them in the analysis of low power data, which reduce the parameter space in the regression analysis. By comparing the analysis with and without partial extraction, we show that these methods reduce the uncertainty of the results, while improving the robustness and efficiency of the loss measurement.

TI Controlling long ion strings for quantum simulation and precision
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Scaling a trapped-ion based quantum simulator to a large number of ions creates a fully controllable quantum system that becomes inaccessible to numerical methods. When highly anisotropic trapping potentials are used to confine the ions in the form of a long linear string, several challenges have to be overcome to achieve high-fidelity coherent control of a quantum system extending over hundreds of micrometers. In this paper, we describe a setup for carrying out many-ion quantum simulations including single-ion coherent control that we use for demonstrating entanglement in 50-ion strings. Furthermore, we present a set of experimental techniques probing ion qubits by Ramsey and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequences that enable detection (and compensation) of power-line-synchronous magnetic-field variations, measurement of path-length fluctuations, and detection of the wavefronts of elliptical laser beams coupling to the ion string.

TI Early fault-tolerant simulations of the Hubbard model
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Simulation of the Hubbard model is a leading candidate for the first useful applications of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A recent study of quantum algorithms for early simulations of the Hubbard model [Kivlichan et al 2019 Quantum 4 296] found that the lowest resource costs were achieved by split-operator Trotterization combined with the fast-fermionic Fourier transform (FFFT) on an L x L lattice with length L = 2(k). On lattices with length L not equal 2(k), Givens rotations can be used instead of the FFFT but lead to considerably higher resource costs. We present a new analytic approach to bounding the simulation error due to Trotterization that provides much tighter bounds for the split-operator FFFT method, leading to 16x improvement in error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce plaquette Trotterization that works on any size lattice and apply our improved error bound analysis to show competitive resource costs. We consider a phase estimation task and show plaquette Trotterization reduces the number of non-Clifford gates by a factor 5.5 x to 9x (depending on the parameter regime) over the best previous estimates for 8 x 8 and 16 x 16 lattices and a much larger factor for other lattice sizes not of the form L = 2(k). In conclusion, we find there is a potentially useful application for fault-tolerant quantum computers using around one million Toffoli gates.

TI Emergence of Spinmerism for Molecular Spin-Qubits Generation
SO CHEMPHYSCHEM
AB Molecular platforms are regarded as promising candidates in the generation of units of information for quantum computing. Herein, a strategy combining spin-crossover metal ions and radical ligands is proposed from a model Hamiltonian first restricted to exchange interactions. Unusual spin states structures emerge from the linkage of a singlet/triplet commutable metal centre with two doublet-radical ligands. The ground state nature is modulated by charge transfers and can exhibit a mixture of triplet and singlet local metal spin states. Besides, the superposition reaches a maximum for 2KM=K1+K2 ${2{K}_{M}={K}_{1}+{K}_{2}}$ , suggesting a necessary competition between the intramolecular KM ${{K}_{M}}$ and inter-metal-ligand K1 ${{K}_{1}}$ and K2 ${{K}_{2}}$ direct exchange interactions. The results promote spinmerism, an original manifestation of quantum entanglement between the spin states of a metal centre and radical ligands. The study provides insights into spin-coupled compounds and inspiration for the development of molecular spin-qubits.

TI Fermionic approach to variational quantum simulation of Kitaev spin
   models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We use the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to simulate Kitaev spin models with and without integrability-breaking perturbations, focusing in particular on the honeycomb and square-octagon lattices. These models are well known for being exactly solvable in a certain parameter regime via a mapping to free fermions. We use classical simulations to explore a variational ansatz that takes advantage of this fermionic representation and is capable of expressing the exact ground state in the solvable limit. We also demonstrate that this ansatz can be extended beyond this limit to provide excellent accuracy when compared to other VQE approaches. In certain cases, this fermionic representation is advantageous because it reduces by a factor of two the number of qubits required to perform the simulation. We also comment on the implications of our results for simulating non-Abelian anyons on quantum computers.

TI Analogue quantum simulation of the Hawking effect in a polariton
   superfluid
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Quantum effects of fields on curved spacetimes may be studied in the laboratory thanks to quantum fluids. Here we use a polariton fluid to study the Hawking effect, the correlated emission from the quantum vacuum at the acoustic horizon. We show how out-of-equilibrium physics affects the dispersion relation, and hence the emission and propagation of correlated waves: the fluid properties on either side of the horizon are critical to observing the Hawking effect. We find that emission may be optimised by supporting the phase and density of the fluid upstream of the horizon in a regime of optical bistability. This opens new avenues for the observation of the Hawking effect in out-of-equilibrium systems as well as for the study of new phenomenology of fields on curved spacetimes.

TI An in-principle super-polynomial quantum advantage for approximating
   combinatorial optimization problems via computational learning theory
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB It is unclear to what extent quantum algorithms can outperform classical algorithms for problems of combinatorial optimization. In this work, by resorting to computational learning theory and cryptographic notions, we give a fully constructive proof that quantum computers feature a super-polynomial advantage over classical computers in approximating combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, by building on seminal work by Kearns and Valiant, we provide special instances that are hard for classical computers to approximate up to polynomial factors. Simultaneously, we give a quantum algorithm that can efficiently approximate the optimal solution within a polynomial factor. The quantum advantage in this work is ultimately borrowed from Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring. We introduce an explicit and comprehensive end-to-end construction for the advantage bearing instances. For these instances, quantum computers have, in principle, the power to approximate combinatorial optimization solutions beyond the reach of classical efficient algorithms.

TI High-On-Off-Ratio Beam-Splitter Interaction for Gates on Bosonically
   Encoded Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Encoding a qubit in a high-quality superconducting microwave cavity offers the opportunity to perform the first layer of error correction in a single device but presents a challenge: how can quantum oscillators be controlled while introducing a minimal number of additional error channels? We focus on the two-qubit portion of this control problem by using a three-wave-mixing coupling element to engineer a programmable beam-splitter interaction between two bosonic modes separated by more than an octave in frequency, without introducing major additional sources of decoherence. Combining this with single oscillator control provided by a dispersively coupled transmon provides a framework for quantum control of multiple encoded qubits. The beam-splitter interaction gbs is fast relative to the time scale of oscillator decoherence, enabling over 103 beam-splitter operations per coherence time and approaching the typical rate of the dispersive coupling & chi; used for individual oscillator control. Further, the programmable coupling is engineered without adding unwanted interactions between the oscillators, as evidenced by the high on-off ratio of the operations, which can exceed 105. We then introduce a new protocol to realize a hybrid controlled -SWAP operation in the regime gbs & AP; & chi;, in which a transmon provides the control bit for the SWAP of two bosonic modes.

TI Quantum-inspired Arecanut X-ray image classification using transfer
   learning
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Arecanut X-ray images accurately represent their internal structure. A comparative analysis of transfer learning-based classification, employing both a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) and an advanced quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) approach is conducted. The investigation explores various transfer learning models with different sizes to identify the most suitable one for achieving enhanced accuracy. The Shufflenet model with a scale factor of 2.0 attains the highest classification accuracy of 97.72% using the QCNN approach, with a model size of 28.40 MB. Out of the 12 transfer learning models tested, 9 exhibit improved classification accuracy when using QCNN models compared to the traditional CNN-based transfer learning approach. Consequently, the exploration of CNN and QCNN-based classification reveals that QCNN outperforms traditional CNN models in accuracy within the transfer learning framework. Further experiments with qubits suggest that utilising 4 qubits is optimal for classification operations in this context.

TI Cryogenic Performance and Modeling of Sub-5nm Fin-Width Bulk FinFETs for
   Quantum Computing Applications
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB The article discusses characterization and modeling of sub-5nm fin-width bulk FinFETs over temperature. Analysis of the impact of process-induced fin recess defects at cryogenic temperatures reveals that n-FinFET demonstrates superior performance in comparison to p-FinFET. The observation is supported by the extraction of electron and hole mobilities across different temperatures, as well as the extracted values of the channel and series resistance. Increased surface roughness scattering at cryogenic temperatures appears to be the primary cause of performance degradation in p-FinFET. To accurately predict the device behavior at cryogenic temperatures, enhancements are proposed for the BSIM CMG based cryo-compact model. These enhancements accurately capture characteristics of the device over a wide bias range, as well as the trends in threshold voltage, subthreshold swing (SS), and the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) across a broad temperature range. The proposed model is also validated with a standard ring oscillator (RO) simulation, demonstrating its capability for cryo-CMOS circuit design.

TI Evanescent-field assisted photon collection from quantum emitters under
   a solid immersion lens
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Solid-state quantum light sources are being intensively investigated for applications in quantum technology. A key challenge is to extract light from host materials with high refractive index, where efficiency is limited by refraction and total internal reflection. Here we show that an index-matched solid immersion lens can, if placed sufficiently close to the semiconductor, extract light coupled through the evanescent field at the surface. Using both numerical simulations and experiments, we investigate how changing the thickness of the spacer between the semiconductor and lens impacts the collection efficiency (CE). Using automatic selection and measurement of 100 s of individually addressable colour centres in several aluminium nitride samples we demonstrate spacer-thickness dependent photon CE enhancement, with a mean enhancement factor of 4.2 and a highest measured photon detection rate of 743 +/- 4kcps.

TI Optimal Hadamard Gate Count for Clifford+T Synthesis of Pauli
   Rotations Sequences
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The Clifford+T gate set is commonly used to perform universal quantum computation. In such setup the T gate is typically much more expensive to implement in a fault-tolerant way than Clifford gates. To improve the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computing it is then crucial tominimize the number ofT gates. Many algorithms, yielding effective results, have been designed to address this problem. It has been demonstrated that performing a pre-processing step consisting of reducing the number of Hadamard gates in the circuit can help to exploit the full potential of these algorithms and thereby lead to a substantial T-count reduction. Moreover, minimizing the number of Hadamard gates also restrains the number of additional qubits and operations resulting from the gadgetization of Hadamard gates, a procedure used by some compilers to further reduce the number of T gates. In this work we tackle the Hadamard gate reduction problem, and propose an algorithm for synthesizing a sequence of pi/4 Pauli rotations with a minimal number of Hadamard gates. Based on this result, we present an algorithm which optimally minimizes the number of Hadamard gates lying between the first and the last T gate of the circuit.

TI Quantum simulation of tunable and ultrastrong mixed-optomechanics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a reliable scheme to simulate tunable and ultrastrong mixed (first-order and quadratic optomechanical couplings coexisting) optomechanical interactions in a coupled two-mode bosonic system, in which the two modes are coupled by a cross-Kerr interaction and one of the two modes is driven through both the single- and two-excitation processes. We show that the mixed-optomechanical interactions can enter the single-photon strong-coupling and even ultrastrong-coupling regimes. The strengths of both the first-order and quadratic optomechanical couplings can be controlled on demand, and hence first-order, quadratic, and mixed optomechanical models can be realized. In particular, the thermal noise of the driven mode can be suppressed totally by introducing a proper squeezed vacuum bath. We also study how to generate the superposition of coherent squeezed state and vacuum state based on the simulated interactions. The quantum coherence effect in the generated states is characterized by calculating the Wigner function in both the closed- and open-system cases. This work will pave the way to the observation and application of ultrastrong optomechanical effects in quantum simulators.

TI Template Attack of LWE/LWR-Based Schemes with Cyclic Message Rotation
SO ENTROPY
AB The side-channel security of lattice-based post-quantum cryptography has gained extensive attention since the standardization of post-quantum cryptography. Based on the leakage mechanism in the decapsulation stage of LWE/LWR-based post-quantum cryptography, a message recovery method, with templates and cyclic message rotation targeting the message decoding operation, was proposed. The templates were constructed for the intermediate state based on the Hamming weight model and cyclic message rotation was used to construct special ciphertexts. Using the power leakage during operation, secret messages in the LWE/LWR-based schemes were recovered. The proposed method was verified on CRYSTAL-Kyber. The experimental results demonstrated that this method could successfully recover the secret messages used in the encapsulation stage, thereby recovering the shared key. Compared with existing methods, the power traces required for templates and attack were both reduced. The success rate was significantly increased under the low SNR, indicating a better performance with lower recovery cost. The message recovery success rate could reach 99.6% with sufficient SNR.

TI Quantum causal correlations and non-Markovianity of quantum evolution
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB A non-Markovianity measure for quantum channels is introduced based on causality measure - a monotone of causal (temporal) correlations - arising out of the pseudo-density matrix (PDM) formalism which treats quantum correlations in space and time on an equal footing. Using the well known damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a two-level system interacting with a bosonic reservoir at zero temperature as an example, it is shown that breakdown of monotonicity of the causality measure is associated with the revival of temporal (causal) correlations hence with the negativity of the decay rate. Also, a note on the comparison with other well known non-Markovianity measures is given. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Controlling the uncontrollable: Quantum control of open-system dynamics
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Control of open quantum systems is essential for the realization of contemporary quantum science and technology. We demonstrate such control using a thermodynamically consistent framework, taking into account the fact that the drive can modify the system's interaction with the environment. Such an effect is incorporated within the dynamical equation, leading to control-dependent dissipation. This relation serves as the key element for open-system control. The control paradigm is displayed by analyzing entropy-changing state-to-state transformations, such as heating and cooling. The difficult task of controlling quantum gates is achieved for nonunitary reset maps with complete memory loss. In addition, we identify a mechanism for controlling unitary gates by actively removing entropy from the system to the environment. We demonstrate a universal set of single- and double-qubit unitary gates under dissipation.

AB In this paper, we study random instances of the classical marginal problem. We encode the problem in a graph, where the vertices have assigned fixed binary probability distributions, and edges have assigned random bivariate distributions having the incident vertex distributions as marginals. We provide estimates on the probability that a joint distribution on the graph exists, having the bivariate edge distributions as marginals. Our study is motivated by Fine's theorem in quantum mechanics. We study in great detail the graphs corresponding to CHSH and Bell-Wigner scenarios providing rations of volumes between the local and non-signaling polytopes.

AB Optical signal processing has been playing a crucial part as powerful engine for various information systems in the practical applications. In particular, achieving large-scale programmable chips for signal processing are highly desirable for high flexibility, low cost and powerful processing. Silicon photonics, which has been developed successfully in the past decade, provides a promising option due to its unique advantages. Here, recent progress of large-scale programmable silicon photonic chip for signal processing in microwave photonics, optical communications, optical computing, quantum photonics as well as dispersion controlling are reviewed. Particularly, we give a discussion about the realization of high-performance building-blocks, including ultra-low-loss silicon photonic waveguides, 2 x 2 Mach-Zehnder switches and microring resonator switches. The methods for configuring large-scale programmable silicon photonic chips are also discussed. The representative examples are summarized for the applications of beam steering, optical switching, optical computing, quantum photonic processing as well as optical dispersion controlling. Finally, we give an outlook for the challenges of further developing large-scale programmable silicon photonic chips.

TI Experimental feasibility analysis of quantum/classical coexistence over
   fibre and free space links
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The authors present a novel approach to Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) research, emphasising cost-effectiveness and practicality using a single photon polarisation-encoded system employing mainly commercial off-the-shelf components. This study diverges from previous high-cost, high-end setups by exploring the viability of QKD in more accessible and realistic settings. Our approach focuses on practical measurements of the signal-to-noise ratio by analysing polarisation-encoded photonic qubits over various transmission scenarios. The authors introduce a simplified evaluation method that incorporates experimental measurements, such as noise sources and losses, into a semi-empirical theoretical framework. This framework simulates the standard DS-BB84 protocol to estimate Secure Key Rates (SKRs), offering an alternative approach on the evaluation of the practical implementation of QKD. Specifically, the authors examine the feasibility of QKD over a 2.2 km intra-campus fibre link in coexistence scenarios, identifying optimal Wavelength-Division Multiplexing allocations to minimise Raman noise, achieving an expected SKR of up to 300 bps. Additionally, the authors' study extends to 40 m indoor and 100 m outdoor Free-Space Optical (FSO) links using low-cost components, where the authors recorded Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) values below 3.2%, allowing for possible SKRs up to 600 bps even in daylight operation. The converged fibre/FSO scenario demonstrated robust performance, with QBER values below 3.7% and an expected SKR of over 200 bps. Our research bridges the gap between high-end and economical QKD solutions, providing valuable insights into the feasibility of QKD in everyday scenarios, especially within metropolitan fibre based and FSO links. By leveraging cost-effective components and a simplified single photon exchange setup, the authors work paves the way for the effortless characterisation of deployed infrastructure, highlighting its potential in diverse settings and its accessibility for widespread implementation.

TI All-optical control of pendular qubit states with nonresonant two-color
   laser pulses
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Practical methodologies for qubit controls are established by two prerequisites, i.e., preparation of a well-defined initial quantum state and coherent control of that quantum state. Here we propose a quantum control method, realized by irradiating nonresonant nanosecond two-color (omega and 2 omega) laser pulses to molecules in the pendular (field-dressed) ground state. The two-color field nonadiabatically splits the initial pendular ground state vertical bar(0) over tilde,(0) over tilde > to a superposition state of vertical bar(0) over tilde,(0) over tilde > and vertical bar(1) over tilde,(0) over tilde >, whose relative probability amplitudes can be controlled by the peak intensity of one wavelength component (omega) while the peak intensity of the other component (2 omega) is fixed. The splitting of the quantum paths is evidenced by observing degrees of orientation of ground-state-selected OCS molecules by the velocity map imaging technique. This quantum control method is highly advantageous because any polar molecule can be controlled regardless of the molecular energy structures.

TI Distinguishing pure and thermal states by Landauer's principle in open

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Starting from Polchinski's thought experiment on how to distinguish between pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement, as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero, and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal pure quantum (CTPQ) state.

TI Embedded Majorana islands
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Mesoscopic superconducting islands hosting Majorana zero modes (MZMs), or Majorana islands in short, offer a prototype of topological qubits. In this work we investigate theoretically the model of a generic Majorana island tunneling-coupled to a single-piece metallic substrate, hence an embedded Majorana island. We show the crucial consequences of an interplay between the topological ground states nonlocally addressed by the MZMs and the metallic bath with coherent electron propagation: on the one hand, the topological degeneracy on the Majorana island can be preserved, by virtue of the particle-hole symmetry, despite the apparent bath-induced coupling between MZMs; on the other hand, the electronic interference in the metallic bath may lead to profound alterations to the renormalization group behavior of the hybrid system towards low energy/temperature compared with conventional Kondo physics. This work serves to establish the model of embedded Majorana islands as an experimentally relevant and theoretically intriguing problem particularly in the direction of topological quantum computation.

TI Generation of High-Resolution Handwritten Digits with an Ion-Trap
   Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Generating high-quality data (e.g., images or video) is one of the most exciting and challenging frontiers in unsupervised machine learning. Utilizing quantum computers in such tasks to potentially enhance conventional machine-learning algorithms has emerged as a promising application but poses big challenges due to the limited number of qubits and the level of gate noise in available devices. In this work, we provide the first practical and experimental implementation of a quantum-classical generative algorithm capable of generating high-resolution images of handwritten digits with state-of-the-art gate-based quantum computers. In our quantum-assisted machine-learning framework, we implement a quantum-circuit-based generative model to learn and sample the prior distribution of a generative adversarial network. We introduce a multibasis technique which leverages the unique possibility of measuring quantum states in different bases, hence enhancing the expressivity of the prior distribution. We train this hybrid algorithm on an ion-trap device based on Yb-171(+) ion qubits to generate high-quality images and quantitatively outperform comparable classical generative adversarial networks trained on the popular MNIST dataset for handwritten digits.

TI Role of Coherence for Quantum Computational Advantage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantifying the resources available to a quantum computer appears to be necessary to separate quantum from classical computation. Among them, entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and coherence are arguably of great significance. We introduce "path coherence" as a measure of the coherent path interferences arising in a quantum computation. Leveraging the sum-over-paths formalism, we obtain a classical algorithm for estimating quantum transition amplitudes, the complexity of which scales with path coherence. As path coherence relates to the hardness of classical estimation of quantum transition amplitudes, it provides a new perspective on the role of coherence in quantum computational advantage. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have practical applications for simulating large classes of quantum computations with classical computers.

TI Nonlocal boxes for networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonlocal boxes are conceptual tools that capture the essence of the phenomenon of quantum nonlocality, central to modern quantum theory and quantum technologies. We introduce network nonlocal boxes tailored for quantum networks under the natural assumption that these networks connect independent sources and do not allow signaling. Hence, these boxes satisfy the no-signaling and independence principle. For the case of boxes without inputs, connecting pairs of bipartite sources and producing binary outputs, we prove that the sources root and boxes producing local random outputs and maximal two-box correlations, i.e., E2 = 2 - 1, E2o = 1, are essentially unique.

TI VAN-DAMME: GPU-accelerated and symmetry-assisted quantum optimal control
   of multi-qubit systems
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present an open-source software package, VAN-DAMME (Versatile Approaches to Numerically Design, Accelerate, and Manipulate Magnetic Excitations), for massively-parallelized quantum optimal control (QOC) calculations of multi-qubit systems. To enable large QOC calculations, the VAN-DAMME software package utilizes symmetry-based techniques with custom GPU-enhanced algorithms. This combined approach allows for the simultaneous computation of hundreds of matrix exponential propagators that efficiently leverage the intraGPU parallelism found in high-performance GPUs. In addition, to maximize the computational efficiency of the VAN-DAMME code, we carried out several extensive tests on data layout, computational complexity, memory requirements, and performance. These extensive analyses allowed us to develop computationally efficient approaches for evaluating complex-valued matrix exponential propagators based on Pad & eacute; approximants. To assess the computational performance of our GPU-accelerated VAN-DAMME code, we carried out QOC calculations of systems containing 10- 15 qubits, which showed that our GPU implementation is 18.4x faster than the corresponding CPU implementation. Our GPU-accelerated enhancements allow efficient calculations of multiqubit systems, which can be used for the efficient implementation of QOC applications across multiple domains.

TI Single-Shot Readout of a Solid-State Spin in a Decoherence-Free Subspace
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The efficient single-photon-emission capabilities of quantum dot molecules position them as promising platforms for quantum information processing. Furthermore, quantum dot molecules feature a "decoherence-free" subspace that enables spin qubits with long coherence times. To efficiently read out the spin state within this subspace requires the optical cycling of isolated transitions that originate from a triplet manifold within the quantum dot molecule. We propose and theoretically study a two-stage spinreadout protocol within this decoherence-free subspace that allows single-shot readout performance. The process incorporates a microwave pi pulse and optical cycling of the isolated transitions, which induces fluorescence that allows us to identify the initial spin state. This protocol offers enhanced readout fidelity compared to previous schemes that rely on the excitation of transitions that strongly decay to multiple ground states or require long initialization via slow optically forbidden transitions. By simulating the performance of the protocol, we show that an optimal spin-readout fidelity of over 97% and single-shot readout performance are achievable for a photon-collection efficiency of just 0.12%. This high readout performance for such realistic photon-collection conditions within the decoherence-free subspace expands the potential of quantum dot molecules as building blocks for quantum networks.

TI Dispersively Probed Microwave Spectroscopy of a Silicon Hole Double
   Quantum Dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Owing to ever increasing gate fidelities and to a potential transferability to industrial CMOS technology, silicon spin qubits have become a compelling option in the strive for quantum computation. In a scalable architecture, each spin qubit will have to be finely tuned and its operating conditions accurately determined. In view of this, spectroscopic tools compatible with a scalable device layout are of primary importance. Here we report a two-tone spectroscopy technique providing access to the spindependent energy-level spectrum of a hole double quantum dot defined in a split-gate silicon device. A first gigahertz-frequency tone drives electric dipole spin resonance enabled by the valence-band spinorbit coupling. A second lower-frequency tone (approximately 500 MHz) allows for dispersive readout via rf-gate reflectometry. We compare the measured dispersive response to the linear response calculated in an extended Jaynes-Cummings model and we obtain characteristic parameters such as g factors and tunnel and spin-orbit couplings for both even and odd occupation.

TI Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parametrized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed by Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020), by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.

TI O-band single-photon quantum key distributor master-to-slave
   injection-locked DFBLD pair
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB In comparison with the rapidly developing progress on the optical C -band (15251565 nm) master -to -slave injection -locked transmitter to perform the coherent single -photon quantum key distribution (QKD), the development on the O -band (1250-1350 nm) QKD transmitter is somewhat delayed as the commercially available wavelength -matched narrowlinewidth distributed feedback laser diode (DFBLD) pair is hardly accessible up to now. By using the DFBLDs with only sub -MHz linewidth and relatively deviated wavelength for the first time, this work demonstrates the optically differential -phase -shift -keying (DPS) QKD by an O -band master -to -slave injection -locked DFBLD pair. The master and slave DFBLDs with wavelength fluctuations of +/- 0.05% and +/- 0.2 pm are controlled by a thermo-electric cooler with a feedback gain of 100. The 1 -bit delay interferometer (DI) under thermo-insulation maintains its visibility at > 96% with dP(o) /P-o and dP(o)/dt measured below +/- 0.1% and +/- 1 x 10( - 3 )mW/s. By RZ-OOK modulating the master DFBLD with step -like power coding at 150 mu W to induce pi phase shift in the injection -locked slave DFBLD, the rising -/falling -edge DPS envelope distortion of the slave DFBLD diminishes by decreasing the bias current of the master DFBLD from 7I th (35 mA) to 2I(th) (10 mA). This phenomenon enables the 128 -bit DPS-QKD transmission with a quantum bit -error rate (QBER) of 3.57% and a secure key rate of 3.524 kbit/s in the 6 -km SMF link. The O -band injection -locked single -photon DPS-QKD bit -stream with a mean photon number of 0.2 #/bit minimizes its decoding QBER to 3.88% and 4.84% for 512 -bit and 1024 -bit, respectively.<br /> (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Majorana noise model and its influence on the power spectrum
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Majorana quantum computation offers a potential approach to securely manipulating and storing quantum data in a topological manner that may effectively resist the decoherence induced by local noise. However, actual Majorana qubit setups are susceptible to noise. In this study, from a quantum dynamics perspective, we develop a noise model for Majorana qubits that accounts for quasi-particle poisoning and Majorana overlapping with fluctuation. Furthermore, we focus on Majorana parity readout methodologies, specifically those leveraging an ancillary quantum dot, and carry out an in-depth exploration of continuous measurement techniques founded on the quantum jump model of a quantum point contact. Utilizing these methodologies, we proceed to analyze the influence of noise on the afore-mentioned noise model, employing numerical computation to evaluate the power spectrum and frequency curve. In the culmination of our study, we put forward a strategy to benchmark the presence and detailed properties of noise in Majorana qubits.

TI First-quantized eigensolver for ground and excited states of electrons
   under a uniform magnetic field
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB First-quantized eigensolver (FQE) is a recently proposed quantum computation framework for obtaining the ground state of an interacting electronic system based on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution. Here, we propose a method for introducing a uniform magnetic field to the FQE calculation. Our resource estimation demonstrates that the additional circuit responsible for the magnetic field can be implemented with a linear depth in terms of the number of qubits assigned to each electron. Hence, introduction of the magnetic field has no impact on the leading order of the entire computational cost. The proposed method is validated by numerical simulations of the ground and excited states employing filtration circuits for the energy eigenstates. We also provide a generic construction of the derivative circuits together with measurement-based formulae. As a special case of them, we can obtain the electric-current density in an electronic system to gain insights into the microscopic origin of the magnetic response.

TI Unextendible entangled bases and more nonlocality with less entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a general version of the phenomenon of more nonlocality with less entanglement within the framework of the unambiguous (i.e., conclusive) quantum state discrimination problem under local quantum operations and classical communication. We show that although the phenomenon was obtained before for two qutrits, it can also be observed for two qubits, whereas still being at the single-copy level. We establish that the phenomenon is intrinsically connected to the concept of unextendible entangled bases in the two-qubit case. In the process, we demonstrate a hierarchy of nonlocality among sets of two-qubit orthogonal pure states where the "nonlocality" is in the sense of a difference between global and local abilities of quantum state discrimination. We present a complete characterization of two-qubit pure orthogonal state sets of cardinality three with respect to their nonlocality in terms of unambiguous local distinguishability, the status for other cardinalities being already known. The results are potentially useful for secure quantum communication technologies with an optimal amount of resources.

TI First-order phase transition of the Schwinger model with a quantum

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We explore the first-order phase transition in the lattice Schwinger model in the presence of a topological theta-term by means of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Using two different fermion discretizations, Wilson and staggered fermions, we develop parametric ansatz circuits suitable for both discretizations, and compare their performance by simulating classically an ideal VQE optimization in the absence of noise. The states obtained by the classical simulation are then prepared on the IBM's superconducting quantum hardware. Applying state-of-the art error-mitigation methods, we show that the electric field density and particle number, observables which reveal the phase structure of the model, can be reliably obtained from the quantum hardware. To investigate the minimum system sizes required for a continuum extrapolation, we study the continuum limit using matrix product states, and compare our results to continuum mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that taking the additive mass renormalization into account is vital for enhancing the precision that can be obtained with smaller system sizes. Furthermore, for the observables we investigate we observe excellent agreement in the continuum limit of both fermion discretizations.

TI Entanglement Domain Walls in Monitored Quantum Circuits and the Directed
   Polymer in a Random Environment
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Monitored quantum dynamics reveal quantum state trajectories, which exhibit a rich phenomenology of entanglement structures, including a transition from a weakly monitored volume-law-entangled phase to a strongly monitored area-law phase. For one-dimensional hybrid circuits with both random unitary dynamics and interspersed measurements, we combine analytic mappings to an effective statistical mechanics model with extensive numerical simulations on hybrid Clifford circuits to demonstrate that the universal entanglement properties of the volume-law phase can be quantitatively described by a fluctuating entanglement domain wall that is equivalent to a "directed polymer in a random environment" (DPRE). This relationship improves upon a qualitative "mean-field" statistical mechanics of the volume-law-entangled phase [Ruihua Fan, Sagar Vijay, Ashvin Vishwanath, and Yi-Zhuang You, Phys. Rev. B 103, 174309 (2021), Yaodong Li and Matthew P. A. Fisher, Phys. Rev. B 103, 104306 (2021)]. For the Clifford circuit in various geometries, we obtain agreement between the subleading entanglement entropies and errorcorrecting properties of the volume-law phase (which quantify its stability to projective measurements) with predictions of the DPRE. We further demonstrate that depolarizing noise in the hybrid dynamics near the final circuit time can drive a continuous phase transition to a non-error-correcting volume-law phase that is not immune to the disentangling action of projective measurements. We observe this transition in hybrid Clifford dynamics, and obtain quantitative agreement with critical exponents for a "pinning" phase transition of the DPRE in the presence of an attractive interface.

TI Hybrid integration of ensemble nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   single-crystal diamond based on pick-flip-and-place transfer printing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Incorporating color centers in diamond with mature integrated photonics using hybrid integration techniques such as transfer printing provides a promising route toward scalable quantum applications. However, single-crystal diamond nanostructures fabricated using current etching technologies have triangular bottoms that are unsuitable for conventional pick-and-place integration. Herein, we present an alternative approach for deterministically integrating diamond nanostructures on chip. We demonstrate the hybrid integration of a diamond triangular nanobeam containing a nitrogen-vacancy ensemble on an SiO2 chip by picking it up using a weak adhesive film, flipping it, and transferring it to a stronger one. This "pick-flip-and-place" approach provides a flat diamond-chip interface, enabling the high-yield hybrid integration regardless of the shape of diamond nanostructures. Additionally, diamond nanofabrication is facilitated by transfer-printing hard masks for diamond etching. We also show that the integrated diamond nanobeam functions as a nanoscale quantum sensor. Our proposed approach paves the way toward scalable hybrid-diamond quantum photonics.

TI Toward Prediction of Financial Crashes with a D-Wave Quantum Annealer
SO ENTROPY
AB The prediction of financial crashes in a complex financial network is known to be an NP-hard problem, which means that no known algorithm can efficiently find optimal solutions. We experimentally explore a novel approach to this problem by using a D-Wave quantum annealer, benchmarking its performance for attaining a financial equilibrium. To be specific, the equilibrium condition of a nonlinear financial model is embedded into a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem, which is then transformed into a spin-1/2 Hamiltonian with at most, two-qubit interactions. The problem is thus equivalent to finding the ground state of an interacting spin Hamiltonian, which can be approximated with a quantum annealer. The size of the simulation is mainly constrained by the necessity of a large number of physical qubits representing a logical qubit with the correct connectivity. Our experiment paves the way for the codification of this quantitative macroeconomics problem in quantum annealers.

TI Decoherence in the three-state quantum walk
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum walks are dynamic systems with a wide range of applications in quantum computation and quantum simulation of analog systems, therefore it is of common interest to understand what changes from an isolated process to one embedded in an environment. In the present work, we analyze the decoherence in a three-state uni-dimensional quantum walk. The approaches taken into consideration to account for the environment effects are phase and amplitude damping Kraus operators, unitary noise on the coin space, and broken links. The results are compared with the two-state quantum walk.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Time-optimal control of driven oscillators by variational circuit
   learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The simulation of quantum dynamics on a digital quantum computer with parametrized circuits has widespread applications in fundamental and applied physics and chemistry. In this context, using the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, combining classical optimizers and quantum computers, is a competitive strategy for solving specific problems. We put forward its use for optimal quantum control. We simulate the wave-packet expansion of a trapped quantum particle on a quantum device with a finite number of qubits. We then use circuit learning based on gradient descent to work out the intrinsic connection between the control phase transition and the quantum speed limit imposed by unitary dynamics. We further discuss the robustness of our method against errors and demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in the circuit. The combination of digital quantum simulation and hybrid circuit learning opens up new prospects for quantum optimal control.

TI Generating and detecting bound entanglement in two-qutrits using a
   family of indecomposable positive maps
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The problem of bound entanglement detection is a challenging aspect of quantum information theory for higher dimensional systems. Here, we propose an indecomposable positive map for two-qutrit systems, which is shown to detect a class of positive partial transposed (PPT) states. A corresponding witness operator is constructed and shown to be weakly optimal and locally implementable. Further, we perform a structural physical approximation of the indecomposable map to make it a completely positive one, and find a new PPT-entangled state which is not detectable by certain other well-known entanglement detection criteria.

TI Optimization of a Controlled-Z Gate with Data-Driven
   Gradient-Ascent Pulse Engineering in a Superconducting-Qubit System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The experimental optimization of a two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gate is realized following two different data-driven gradient-ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) protocols with the aim of optimizing the gate operator and the output quantum state, respectively. For both GRAPE protocols, the key computation of gradients utilizes mixed information of the input Z-control pulse and the experimental measurement. With an imperfect initial pulse in a flattop waveform, our experimental implementation shows that the CZ gate is quickly improved and the gate fidelities subject to the two optimized pulses are around 99%. Our experimental study confirms the applicability of the data-driven GRAPE protocols in the gate optimization problem.

TI Bridging paradigms: Designing for HPC-Quantum convergence
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB This paper presents a comprehensive software stack architecture for integrating quantum computing (QC) capabilities with High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. While quantum computers show promise as specialized accelerators for scientific computing, their effective integration with classical HPC systems presents significant technical challenges. We propose a hardware-agnostic software framework that supports both current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, while maintaining compatibility with existing HPC workflows. The architecture includes a quantum gateway interface, standardized APIs for resource management, and robust scheduling mechanisms to handle both simultaneous and interleaved quantum-classical workloads. Key innovations include: (1) a unified resource management system that efficiently coordinates quantum and classical resources, (2) a flexible quantum programming interface that abstracts hardware-specific details, (3) A Quantum Platform Manager API that simplifies the integration of various quantum hardware systems, and (4) a comprehensive tool chain for quantum circuit optimization and execution. We demonstrate our architecture through implementation of quantum-classical algorithms, including the variational quantum linear solver, showcasing the framework's ability to handle complex hybrid workflows while maximizing resource utilization. This work provides a foundational blueprint for integrating QC capabilities into existing HPC infrastructures, addressing critical challenges in resource management, job scheduling, and efficient data movement between classical and quantum resources.

TI Comparing a radiation damage model for avalanche photodiodes through
   in-situ observation of CubeSat based devices
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Space-based quantum technologies are essential building blocks for global quantum networks. However, the optoelectronic components used can be susceptible to radiation damage. Predicting long-term instrument performance in the presence of radiation remains a challenging part of space missions. We present a model that accounts for differences in radiation shielding and can predict the trends for dark count rates of space-based silicon Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (GM-APD). We find that the predicted trends are correlated with in-situ observations from GM-APDs on-board the SpooQy-1 CubeSat mission.

TI The effect of intrinsic decoherence on the dynamics of an Ξ-type qutrit
   system interacting with a coherent field
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This paper solves milburn's intrinsic noise (IN) model for a 3-level atom of an & UXi;-type interacting with a coherent cavity field via multiphoton transitions. Therefore, the effects of the intrinsic noise and the multi-photon interactions are investigated for some quantum phenomena, such as total correlation, entanglement, and atomic inversion. In general, we found that the collapse-revival phenomenon occurs during the oscillatory behaviour of atomic population dynamics. In addition, the birth-death phenomenon is observed in the negativity dynamics. Entropy, negativity, and mutual information have various dynamics. It is found that, as the entropy increases, the negativity and mutual information diminish to stationary levels. When intrinsic noise is considered, all the phenomena of atomic inversion, entropies, negativity and mutual information exhibit high sensitivity to high intrinsic noise values, except the mutual information dynamics, which is more resistant than that of the other quantifiers.

TI Estimating Bell diagonal states with separable measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum network protocols depend on the availability of shared entanglement. Given that entanglement generation and distribution are affected by noise, characterization of the shared entangled states is essential to bound the errors of the protocols. This work analyzes the estimation of Bell diagonal states within quantum networks, where operations are limited to local actions and classical communication. We demonstrate the advantages of Bayesian mean estimation over direct inversion and maximum-likelihood estimation, providing analytical expressions for estimation risk and supporting our findings with numerical simulations.

TI Photon-phonon quantum cloning in optomechanical system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum cloning is an essential operation in quantum information and quantum computing. Similar to the 'copy' operation in classical computing, the cloning of flying bits for further processing from the solid-state quantum bits in storage is an operation frequently used in quantum information processing. Here we propose a high-fidelity and controllable quantum cloning scheme between solid bits and flying bits. In order to overcome the obstacles from the no-cloning theorem and the weak phonon-photon interaction, we introduce a hybrid optomechanical system that performs both the probabilistic cloning and deterministic cloning closed to the theoretical optimal limit with the help of designed driving pulse in the presence of dissipation. In addition, our scheme allows a highly tunable switching between two cloning methods, namely the probabilistic and deterministic cloning, by simply changing the input laser pulse. This provides a promising platform for experimental executability.

AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a recent technology for secure distribution of symmetric keys, which is currently being deployed to increase communications security against quantum attacks. However, the key rate achievable over a weak quantum signal is limited by the link performance (e.g., loss and noise) and propagation distance, especially in multinode QKD networks, making it necessary to design a scheme to efficiently and timely distribute keys to the various nodes. In this work, we formulate, using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, a novel Routing, Channel, and Key-rate Assignment (RCKA) problem for QKD with Quantum Key Pool (QKP), which exploits the opportunity of using trusted relays and optical bypass. Our formulation accounts for the possibility to build a quantum key distribution path that combines both quantum channels and trusted relays to increase the acceptance ratio of key rate requests. Leveraging different versions of the proposed MILP model, we evaluate several strategies exploiting different combinations of trusted relays and optical bypass for the RCKA problem. Results show how different trade-offs between security and resource-efficiency (expressed in terms of acceptance ratio of key rate requests vs. key storing rate in QKP) can be achieved when adopting trusted-relay and/or optical-bypass technologies. Trusted relays can provide a higher acceptance ratio when the number of QKD modules (transmitters or receivers) is sufficiently large, while optical bypass, which does not require the implementation of expensive trusted relays, is preferable when the number of QKD modules is a limiting factor.

TI Fast and automated optical polarization compensation of fiber unitaries
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB The polarization of light is critical in various applications, including quantum communication, where the photon polarization encoding a qubit can undergo uncontrolled changes when transmitted through optical fibers. Bends in the fiber, internal and external stresses, and environmental factors cause these polarization changes, which lead to errors and therein limit the range of quantum communication. To prevent this, we present a fast and automated method for polarization compensation using liquid crystals. This approach combines polarimetry based on a rotating quarter-waveplate with high-speed control of the liquid-crystal cell, offering high-fidelity compensation suitable for diverse applications. Our method directly solves for the compensation parameters, avoiding reliance on stochastic approaches or cryptographic metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves over 99% fidelity within an average of fewer than six iterations, with further fine-tuning to reach above 99.5% fidelity, providing a robust solution for maintaining precise polarization states in optical systems.

To show the versatility of our method, we sort the same atomic sample into multiple geometries with success probabilities of 0.996(2) per rearrangement cycle.

TI Adaptively controlled fast production of defect-free beryllium ion
   crystals using pulsed laser ablation
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Trapped atomic ions find wide applications ranging from precision measurement to quantum information science and quantum computing. Beryllium ions are widely used due to the light mass and convenient atomic structure of beryllium; however, conventional ion loading from thermal ovens exerts undesirable gas loads for a prolonged duration. Here, we demonstrate a method to rapidly produce pure linear chains of beryllium ions with pulsed laser ablation, serving as a starting point for large-scale quantum information processing. Our method is fast compared to thermal ovens, reduces the gas load to only 10(-12) Torr (10(-10) Pa) level, yields a short recovery time of a few seconds, and also eliminates the need for a deep ultraviolet laser for photoionization. We also study the loading dynamics, which show non-Poissonian statistics in the presence of sympathetic cooling. In addition, we apply feedback control to obtain defect-free ion chains with desirable lengths.

TI From complexity geometry to holographic spacetime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB An important conjecture within the AdS/CFT correspondence relates holographic spacetime to the quantum computational complexity of the dual quantum field theory. However, the quantitative under-standing of this relation is largely an open question. In this work, to address this question we establish a map between a computational complexity measure and its holographic counterpart from first principles. We consider quantum circuits built out of conformal transformations in two-dimensional conformal field theory anda complexity measure based on assigning a cost to quantum gates via the Fubini-Study distance. We find a novel geometric object in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes that is dual to this distance. This duality also provides a more general map between holographic geometry of anti-de Sitter universes and complexity geometry as defined in information theory, in which each point represents a state and distances between states are measured by the Fubini-Study metric. We apply the newly found duality to the eternal black hole spacetime and discuss both the origin of linear growth of complexity and the switchback effect within our approach.

TI Topological and geometric patterns in optimal bang-bang protocols for
   variational quantum algorithms: Application to the XXZ model on
   the square lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we address the challenge of uncovering patterns in variational optimal protocols for taking the system to ground states of many-body Hamiltonians, using variational quantum algorithms. We develop highly optimized classical Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms to find the optimal protocols for transformations between the ground states of the square-lattice XXZ model for finite system sizes. The MC method obtains optimal bang-bang protocols, as predicted by Pontryagin's minimum principle. We identify the minimum time needed for reaching an acceptable error for different system sizes as a function of the initial and target states and uncover correlations between the total time and the wave-function overlap. We determine a dynamical phase diagram for the optimal protocols, with different phases characterized by a topological number, namely, the number of on pulses. Bifurcation transitions as a function of initial and final states, associated with new jumps in the optimal protocols, demarcate these different phases. The number of pulses correlates with the total evolution time. In addition to identifying the topological characteristic above, i.e., the number of pulses, we introduce a correlation function to characterize bang-bang protocols' quantitative geometric similarities. We find that protocols within one phase are indeed geometrically correlated. Identifying and extrapolating patterns in these protocols may inform efficient large-scale simulations on quantum devices.

TI Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum operations in continuous variable
   systems
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Quantum operations by utilizing the underlying geometric phases produced in physical systems are favoured due to their potential robustness. When a system in a non-degenerate eigenstate undergoes an adiabatically cyclic evolution dominated by its Hamiltonian, it will get a geometric phase, referred to as the Berry Phase. While a non-adiabatically cyclic evolution produces an Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. The two types of Abelian geometric phases are extended to the non-Abelian cases, where the phase factors become matrix-valued and the transformations associated with different loops are non-commutable. Abelian and non-Abelian (holonomic) operations are prevalent in discrete variable systems, whose limited (say, two) energy levels, form the qubit. While their developments in continuous systems have also been investigated, mainly due to that, bosonic modes (in, such as, cat states) with large Hilbert spaces, provide potential advantages in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we propose a feasible scheme to realize non-adiabatic holonomic quantum logic operations in continuous variable systems with cat codes. We construct arbitrary single-qubit (two-qubit) gates with the combination of single- and two-photon drivings applied to a Kerr Parametric Oscillator (KPO) (the coupled KPOs). Our scheme relaxes the requirements of the previously proposed quantum geometric operation strategies in continuous variable systems, providing an effective way for quantum control.

TI Straddling-gates problem in multipartite quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study a variant of quantum circuit complexity, the binding complexity: Consider an n-qubit system divided into two sets of k(1), k(2) qubits each (k(1) <= k(2)) and gates within each set are free; what is the least cost of two-qubit gates "straddling" the sets for preparing an arbitrary quantum state, assuming no ancilla qubits allowed? First, our work suggests that, without making assumptions on the entanglement spectrum, Theta(2(k1)) straddling gates always suffice. We then prove any U(2(n)) unitary synthesis can be accomplished with Theta(4(k1)) straddling gates. Furthermore, we extend our results to multipartite systems, and show that any m-partite Schmidt decomposable state has binding complexity linear in m, which hints its multiseparable property. This result not only resolves an open problem posed by Vijay Balasubramanian, who was initially motivated by the complexity = volume conjecture in quantum gravity, but also offers realistic applications in distributed quantum computation in the near future.

TI Federated quantum long short-term memory (FedQLSTM)
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum federated learning (QFL) can facilitate collaborative learning across multiple clients using quantum machine learning (QML) models, while preserving data privacy. Although recent advances in QFL span different tasks like classification while leveraging several data types, no prior work has focused on developing a QFL framework that utilizes temporal data to approximate functions useful to analyze the performance of distributed quantum sensing networks. In this paper, a novel QFL framework that is the first to integrate quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) models with temporal data is proposed. The proposed federated QLSTM (FedQLSTM) framework is exploited for performing the task of function approximation. In this regard, three key use cases are presented: Bessel function approximation, sinusoidal delayed quantum feedback control function approximation, and Struve function approximation. Simulation results confirm that, for all considered use cases, the proposed FedQLSTM framework achieves a faster convergence rate under one local training epoch, minimizing the overall computations, and saving 25-33% of the number of communication rounds needed until convergence compared to an FL framework with classical LSTM models.

TI Application and Development of QKD-Based Quantum Secure Communication
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have unique advantages of enabling symmetric key sharing with information-theoretic security (ITS) between remote locations, which ensure the long-term security even in the era of quantum computation. QKD-based quantum secure communication (QSC) enhancing the security of key generation and update rate of keys, which could be integrated with a variety of cryptographic applications and communication protocols, has become one of the important solutions to improve information security. In recent years, the research on QKD has been active and productive, the performance of novel protocol systems has been improved significantly, and the feasibility of satellite-based QKD has been experimentally verified. QKD network construction, application exploration, and standardization have been carried out in China as well as other countries and regions around the world. Although QKD-based QSC applications and industrialization are still in the initial stage, the research and exploration momentum is positive and more achievements could be expected in the future.

TI Subspace methods for electronic structure simulations on quantum
   computers
SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB Quantum subspace methods (QSMs) are a class of quantum computing algorithms where the time-independent Schr & ouml;dinger equation for a quantum system is projected onto a subspace of the underlying Hilbert space. This projection transforms the Schr & ouml;dinger equation into an eigenvalue problem determined by measurements carried out on a quantum device. The eigenvalue problem is then solved on a classical computer, yielding approximations to ground- and excited-state energies and wavefunctions. QSMs are examples of hybrid quantum-classical methods, where a quantum device supported by classical computational resources is employed to tackle a problem. QSMs are rapidly gaining traction as a strategy to simulate electronic wavefunctions on quantum computers, and thus their design, development, and application is a key research field at the interface between quantum computation and electronic structure (ES). In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to QSMs, with emphasis on their application to the ES of molecules. We present the theoretical foundations and applications of QSMs, and we discuss their implementation on quantum hardware, illustrating the impact of noise on their performance.

TI Monogamy relations of entropic non-contextual inequalities and their
   experimental demonstration
SO EPL
AB - We analyze monogamous relationships of abritrary entropic non-contextuality (ENC) inequalities via a graph theoretic approach. While ENC inequalities are important in quantum information theory, a theoretical and experimental understanding of their monogamous nature is still elusive. We analyze conditions for ENC inequalities to exhibit a monogamous relationship and derive the same explicitly for an entropic version of the Bell-CHSH scenario. Next, we consider two different sets of three qubit states and experimentally show that they exhibit monogamy of entropic Bell-CHSH inequality. The monogamous relationship of these inequalities is theoretically exhibited via an insightful proof and is experimentally demonstrated on an NMR quantum information processor. We also develop a novel and easy-to-implement experimental method to evaluate entropies on an NMR quantum information processor using only the information about expectation values of the observables.

TI Comparative study on compact quantum circuits of hybrid
   quantum-classical algorithms for quantum impurity models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Predicting the properties of strongly correlated materials is a significant challenge in condensed matter theory. The widely used dynamical mean-field theory faces difficulty in solving quantum impurity models numerically. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as variational quantum eigensolvers emerge as a potential solution for quantum impurity models. A common challenge in these algorithms is the rapid growth of the number of variational parameters with the number of spin-orbitals in the impurity. In our approach to this problem, we develop compact Ans & auml;tze using a combination of two different strategies. First, we employ a compact physics-inspired ansatz, k-unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz, developed in the field of quantum chemistry. Second, we eliminate largely redundant variational parameters of physics-inspired Ans & auml;tze associated with bath sites based on physical intuition. This is based on the fact that a quantum impurity model with a star-like geometry has no direct hopping between bath sites. We benchmark the accuracy of these Ans & auml;tze for both ground-state energy and dynamic quantities by solving typical quantum impurity models with and without shot noise. The results suggest that we can maintain the accuracy of ground-state energy while we drop the number of variational parameters associated with bath sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moment expansion, when combined with the proposed Ans & auml;tze, can calculate the imaginary-time Green's functions under the influence of shot noise. This study demonstrates the potential for addressing complex impurity models in large-scale quantum simulations with fewer variational parameters without sacrificing accuracy.

TI Toward Fully-Fledged Quantum and Classical Communication Over Deployed
   Fiber with Up-Conversion Module
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD), the distribution of quantum secured keys useful for data encryption, is expected to have a crucial impact in the next decades. However, despite the notable achievements accomplished in the last 20 years, many practical and serious challenges are limiting the full deployment of this novel quantum technology in the current telecommunication infrastructures. In particular, the co-propagation of quantum signals and high-speed data traffic within the same optical fiber is not completely resolved, due to the intrinsic noise caused by the high-intensity of the classical signals. As a consequence, current co-propagation schemes limit the amount of classical optical power in order to reduce the overall link noise. However, this ad-hoc solution restrains the range of possibilities for a large scale QKD deployment. Here, a new method, based on up-conversion assisted receiver, for co-propagating classical light and QKD signals is proposed and demonstrated. In addition, its performances are compared with an off-the-shelf quantum receiver, equipped with a standard single-photon detector, over different lengths of an installed fiber link. The authors' proposal exhibits higher tolerance for noise in comparison to the standard receiver, thus enabling the distribution of secret keys in the condition of 4 dB-higher classical power.

AB With continuous advances in physical technology, the number of qubits has increased from just a few to several thousand. To further extend the scale, the density of control lines has become one of the major limitations that decides the cost and control fidelity. Specifically, each superconducting qubit requires dedicated control lines to manipulate its state; however, these lines reach the spatial upper limit of the cryostat when scaling up the quantum chip. Inspired by collinear signal transmission, a promising solution is to adopt multiplexing methods-such as frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) and time-division multiplexing (TDM)-to share control lines among superconducting qubits. However, existing methods lack a systematic architectural approach to support multiplexing-aware wiring, which leads to low parallelism and high crosstalk during deployment. In this work, we propose a multiplexing-aware design for the peripheral control lines of superconducting quantum processors, combining cryostat-level wiring optimization with on-chip routing. Our key novelty lies in a hybrid multiplexing architecture that adopts FDM for XY control and readout lines, and TDM for Z control lines. This enables high utilization of natural non-parallel operations, thereby cutting the additional circuit depth for TDM control. Finally, we develop an interaction model that co-optimizes qubit layout and multiplexed channel allocation. Our experiments use the data collected from self-developed Xmon quantum chips. The results show that YOUTIAO achieves a 67.7% reduction in cryostat-level coaxial wiring complexity and overall superconducting quantum system costs, while reducing on-chip routing area by 23%. With these improvements, we still keep the 1q-gate fidelity at 99.98%, and only introduce 5% extra circuit latency compared to the partial-multiplexing system.

TI The Bloch vectors formalism for a finite-dimensional quantum system
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In the present article, we consistently develop the main issues of the Bloch vectors formalism for an arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum system. In the frame of this formalism, qudit states and their evolution in time, qudit observables and their expectations, entanglement and nonlocality, etc are expressed in terms of the Bloch vectors-the vectors in the Euclidean space Rd2-1, arising under decompositions of observables and states in different operator bases. Within this formalism, we specify for all d >= 2 the set of Bloch vectors of traceless qudit observables and describe its properties; also, find for the sets of the Bloch vectors of qudit states, pure and mixed, the new compact expressions in terms of the operator norms that explicitly reveal the general properties of these sets and have the unified form for all d >= 2. For the sets of the Bloch vectors of qudit states under the generalized Gell-Mann representation, these general properties cannot be analytically extracted from the known equivalent specifications of these sets via the system of algebraic equations. We derive the general equations describing the time evolution of the Bloch vector of a qudit state if a qudit system is isolated and if it is open and find for both cases the main properties of the Bloch vector evolution in time. For a pure bipartite state of a dimension d(1) x d(2), we quantify its entanglement via the characteristics of the Bloch vectors for its reduced states. The introduced general formalism is important both for the theoretical analysis of quantum system properties and for quantum applications, in particular, for optimal quantum control, since, for systems where states are described by vectors in the Euclidean space, the methods of optimal control, analytical and numerical, are well developed.

TI Continuous variable QKD in flexible optical networks for future quantum
   secure connectivity
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Future optical networks, envisioning the support of 6G services and related demanding requirements, should provide ultra-high-capacity and reliable connectivity, ensuring sustainability and security. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technology to address the limitations of classical cryptography, enabling quantum secure communications. Continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) offers potential cost savings and enhanced compatibility with classical systems. This facilitates the integration within the network infrastructure, particularly in synergy with software-defined networking (SDN), further promoting interoperability and resource sharing/saving. For the adoption and practical implementation of CV-QKD, it is relevant to consider composable security and a finite number of symbols employed in the protocol (block size). In this work, we present the comparison of two models, to provide a figure of the required block size. We also assess the results using a simulation software. Furthermore, we explore a coexistence scenario considering a flexible grid, to exploit the CV-QKD capability of arbitrarily tuning the operating wavelength. This is a relevant feature enabling flexible allocation of the quantum channel to mitigate impairment and saving spectral resources. Considering realistic parameters aligned to commercially available CV-QKD systems and finite block size, we show an improvement with respect to our previous results. A minimum quantum-classical channel spacing of 112.5 GHz is required in a coexistence scenario with 8 x 200G transceivers and 9 dBm of total power over a 15 km link. In case of 10 dBm of total power, 125 GHz quantum-classical channel spacing is required to generate keys for practical implementation over the analyzed links. Finally, we discuss SDN aspects relevant for dynamic quantum channel allocation and flexible network management, enabling coexistence and efficient resource sharing, facilitating QKD technology integration in deployed networks. The presented results and envisioned potentialities of CV-QKD for practical implementation in optical networks pave the way for its adoption in the network infrastructure toward future quantum secure communications.

TI Spatial Entanglement of Fermions in One-Dimensional Quantum Dots
SO ENTROPY
AB The time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo method for fermions is introduced and applied in the calculation of the entanglement of electrons in one-dimensional quantum dots with several spin-polarized and spin-compensated electron configurations. The rich statistics of wave functions provided by this method allow one to build reduced density matrices for each electron, and to quantify the spatial entanglement using measures such as quantum entropy by treating the electrons as identical or distinguishable particles. Our results indicate that the spatial entanglement in parallel-spin configurations is rather small, and is determined mostly by the spatial quantum nonlocality introduced by the ground state. By contrast, in the spin-compensated case, the outermost opposite-spin electrons interact like bosons, which prevails their entanglement, while the inner-shell electrons remain largely at their Hartree-Fock geometry. Our findings are in close correspondence with the numerically exact results, wherever such comparison is possible.

TI Crystallography of hyperbolic lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hyperbolic lattices are a revolutionary platform for tabletop simulations of holography and quantum physics in curved space and facilitate efficient quantum error correcting codes. Their underlying geometry is non-Euclidean, and the absence of Bloch's theorem precludes the straightforward application of the often indispensable energy band theory to study model Hamiltonians on hyperbolic lattices. Motivated by recent insights into hyperbolic band theory, we initiate a crystallography of hyperbolic lattices. We show that many hyperbolic lattices feature a hidden crystal structure characterized by unit cells, hyperbolic Bravais lattices, and associated symmetry groups. Using the mathematical framework of higher-genus Riemann surfaces and Fuchsian groups, we derive a list of example hyperbolic {p, q} lattices and their hyperbolic Bravais lattices, including five infinite families and several graphs relevant for experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics and topolectrical circuits. This dramatically simplifies the computation of energy spectra of tight-binding Hamiltonians on hyperbolic lattices, from exact diagonalization on the graph to solving a finite set of equations in terms of irreducible representations. The significance of this achievement needs to be compared to the all-important role played by conventional Euclidean crystallography in the study of solids. We exemplify the high potential of this approach by constructing and diagonalizing finite-dimensional Bloch wave Hamiltonians.

TI Shuttling an Electron Spin through a Silicon Quantum Dot Array
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Coherent links between qubits separated by tens of micrometers are expected to facilitate scalable quantum computing architectures for spin qubits in electrically defined quantum dots. These links create space for classical on-chip control electronics between qubit arrays, which can help to alleviate the so-called wiring bottleneck. A promising method of achieving coherent links between distant spin qubits consists of shuttling the spin through an array of quantum dots. Here, we use a linear array of four tunnel-coupled quantum dots in a 28Si/SiGe heterostructure to create a short quantum link. We move an electron spin through the quantum dot array by adjusting the electrochemical potential for each quantum dot sequentially. By pulsing the gates repeatedly, we shuttle an electron forward and backward through the array up to 250 times, which corresponds to a total distance of approximately 80 & mu;m. We make an estimate of the spin-flip probability per hop in these experiments and conclude that this is well below 0.01% per hop.

TI Coherent Hole Transport in Selective Area Grown Ge Nanowire Networks
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Holes in germanium nanowires have emerged as a realistic platform for quantum computing based on spin qubit logic. On top of the large spin-orbit coupling that allows fast qubit operation, nanowire geometry and orientation can be tuned to cancel out charge noise and hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate a scalable approach to synthesize and organize Ge nanowires on silicon (100)-oriented substrates. Germanium nanowire networks are obtained by selectively growing on nanopatterned slits in a metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy system. Low-temperature electronic transport measurements are performed on nanowire Hall bar devices revealing high hole doping of similar to 10(18) cm(-3) and mean free path of similar to 10 nm. Quantum diffusive transport phenomena, universal conductance fluctuations, and weak antilocalization are revealed through magneto transport measurements yielding a coherence and a spin-orbit length of the order of 100 and 10 nm, respectively.

TI Correlations and energy in mediated dynamics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The minimum time required for a quantum system to evolve to a distinguishable state is set by the quantum speed limit, and consequently influences the change of quantum correlations and other physical properties. Here we study the time required to maximally entangle two principal systems interacting either directly or via a mediating ancillary system, under the same energy constraints. The direct interactions are proved to provide the fastest way to entangle the principal systems, but it turns out that there exist mediated dynamics that are just as fast. We show that this can only happen if the mediator is initially correlated with the principal systems. These correlations can be fully classical and can remain classical during the entangling process. The final message is that correlations save energy: one has to supply extra energy if maximal entanglement across the principal systems is to be obtained as fast as with an initially correlated mediator.

TI Managing spectral properties and Schmidt mode content of squeezed vacuum
   light using sum-frequency converter
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Capabilities of quantum optical sum-frequency converter seeded by squeezed light are investigated and described analytically in the case when several frequency Schmidt modes are involved in nonlinear process. Methods to manage and manipulate extensively the properties and mode content of multimode multipartite non-classical squeezed field state are developed. Possibility to control the photon numbers in different Schmidt modes of squeezed light simultaneously is demonstrated. The significant phase sensitivity of the converter is established. Tailoring the spectral distribution of the output light due to the phase effects and variable coupling between modes in the converter is demonstrated. In the case of twin-beam seeding the effect of changing the conjugated correlated frequency mode is found which allows to manipulate the correlations between photons. The developed methods to vary the efficient number of Schmidt modes of squeezed light are strongly required for important practical applications and quantum technology.

TI Gaussian quantum steering under the influence of a dilaton black hole
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We study the dynamics of Gaussian quantum steering in the background of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilaton black hole. It is found that the gravity induced by dilaton field will destroy the quantum steerability between the inertial observer Alice and the observer Bob who hovers outside the event horizon, while it generates steering-type quantum correlations between the causally disconnected regions. Therefore, the observers can steer each other's state by local measurements even though they are separated by the event horizon. Unlike quantum entanglement in the dilaton spacetime, the quantum steering experiences catastrophic behaviors such as "sudden death" and "sudden birth" with increasing dilaton charge. In addition, the dilaton gravity destroys the symmetry of Gaussian steering and the latter is always asymmetric in the dilation spacetime. Interestingly, the attainment of maximal steering asymmetry indicates the critical point between one-way and two-way steering for the two-mode Gaussian state in the dilaton spacetime.

TI Enhanced quantum resources via two distant atom-cavity systems under the
   influence of atomic dissipation
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence are the holy grail for modern quantum technologies. Although the unwanted environmental effects tackle quantum information processing tasks, suprisingly these key quantum resources may be protected and even enhanced by the implementation of some special hybrid open quantum systems. Here, we aim to show how a dissipative atom-cavity-system can be accomplished to generate enhanced quantum resources. To do so, we consider a couple of dissipative cavities, where each one contains two effective two-level atoms interacting with a single-mode cavity field. In practical applications, a classical laser field may be applied to drive each atomic subsystem. After driving the system, a Bell-state measurement is performed on the output of the system to quantify the entanglement and coherence. The obtained results reveal that the remote entanglement and coherence between the atoms existing inside the two distant cavities are not only enhanced, but can be stabilized, even under the action of dissipation. In contrast, the local entanglement between two atoms inside each dissipative cavity attenuates due to the presence of unwanted environmental effects. Nevertheless, the local coherence may show the same behavior as the remote coherence. Besides, the system provides the steady state entanglement in various interaction regimes, particularly in the strong atom-cavity coupling and with relatively large detuning. More interestingly, our numerical analyses demonstrate that the system may show a memory effect due to the fact that the death and revival of the entanglement take place during the interaction. Our proposed model may find potential applications for the implementation of long distance quantum networks. In particular, it facilitates the distribution of quantum resources between the nodes of large-scale quantum networks for secure communication.

TI How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers in 8 hours using 20 million noisy
   qubits
SO QUANTUM
AB We significantly reduce the cost of factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms in finite fields on a quantum computer by combining techniques from Shor 1994, Griffiths-Niu 1996, Zalka 2006, Fowler 2012, Ekera-Hastad 2017, Ekerg, 2017, EkerS, 2018, Gidney-Fowler 2019, Gidney 2019. We estimate the approximate cost of our construction using plausible physical assumptions for large-scale superconducting qubit platforms: a planar grid of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity, a characteristic physical gate error rate of 10(-3), a surface code cycle time of 1. microsecond, and a reaction time of 1.0 microseconds. We account for factors that are normally ignored such as noise, the need to make repeated attempts, and the spacetime layout of the computation. When factoring 2048 bit RSA integers, our construction's spacetime volume is a hundredfold less than comparable estimates from earlier works (Van Meter et al. 2009, Jones et al. 2010, Fowler et al. 2012, Gheorghiu et al. 2019). In the abstract circuit model (which ignores overheads from distillation, routing, and error correction) our construction uses 3n + 0.002n lg n logical qubits, 0.3n(3) + 0.0005n(3) lg n Toffolis, and 500n(2) +n(2) lg n measurement depth to factor n-bit RSA integers. We quantify the cryptographic implications of our work, both for RSA and for schemes based on the DLP in finite fields.

TI Simultaneous stoquasticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Stoquastic Hamiltonians play a role in the computational complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem as well as the study of classical simulability. In particular, stoquastic Hamiltonians can be straightforwardly simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. We address the question of whether two or more Hamiltonians may be made simultaneously stoquastic via a unitary transformation. This question has important implications for the complexity of simulating quantum annealing where quantum advantage is related to the stoquasticity of the Hamiltonians involved in the anneal. We find that for almost all problems no such unitary exists and show that the problem of determining the existence of such a unitary is equivalent to identifying if there is a solution to a system of polynomial (in)equalities in the matrix elements of the initial and transformed Hamiltonians. Solving such a system of equations is NP-hard. We highlight a geometric understanding of this problem in terms of a collection of generalized Bloch vectors.

TI Generative Music with Partitioned Quantum Cellular Automata
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Cellular automata (CA) are abstract computational models of dynamic systems that change some features with space and time. Music is the art of organising sounds in space and time, and it can be modelled as a dynamic system. Hence, CA are of interest to composers working with generative music. The art of generating music with CA hinges on the design of algorithms to evolve patterns of data and methods to render those patterns into musical forms. This paper introduces methods for creating original music using partitioned quantum cellular automata (PQCA). PQCA consist of an approach to implementing CA on quantum computers. Quantum computers leverage properties of quantum mechanics to perform computations differently from classical computers, with alleged advantages. The paper begins with some explanations of background concepts, including CA, quantum computing, and PQCA. Then, it details the PQCA systems that we have been developing to generate music and discusses practical examples. PQCA-generated materials for Qubism, a professional piece of music composed for London Sinfonietta, are included. The PQCA systems presented here were run on real quantum computers rather than simulations thereof. The rationale for doing so is also discussed.

TI Self-testing with finite statistics enabling the certification of a
   quantum network link
SO QUANTUM
AB Self-testing is a method to certify devices from the result of a Bell test. Although examples of noise tolerant self-testing are known, it is not clear how to deal efficiently with a finite number of experimental trials to certify the average quality of a device without assuming that it behaves identically at each run. As a result, existing self-testing results with finite statistics have been limited to guarantee the proper working of a device in just one of all experimental trials, thereby limiting their practical applicability. We here derive a method to certify through self-testing that a device produces states on average close to a Bell state without assumption on the actual state at each run. Thus the method is free of the I.I.D. (independent and identically distributed) assumption. Applying this new analysis on the data from a recent loophole-free Bell experiment, we demonstrate the successful distribution of Bell states over 398 meters with an average fidelity of >= 55.50% at a confidence level of 99%. Being based on a Bell test free of detection and locality loopholes, our certification is evidently device-independent, that is, it does not rely on trust in the devices or knowledge of how the devices work. This guarantees that our link can be integrated in a quantum network for performing long-distance quantum communications with security guarantees that are independent of the details of the actual implementation.

TI Multiphoton quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Recent progress on quantum state engineering has enabled the preparation of quantum photonic systems comprising multiple interacting particles. Interestingly, multiphoton quantum systems can host many complex forms of interference and scattering processes that are essential to perform operations that are intractable on classical systems. Unfortunately, the quantum coherence properties of multiphoton systems degrade upon propagation leading to undesired quantum-to-classical transitions. Furthermore, the manipulation of multiphoton quantum systems requires nonlinear interactions at the few-photon level. Here, we introduce the quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem to describe the scattering and interference effects of propagating multiphoton systems. This fundamental theorem demonstrates that the quantum statistical fluctuations, can be modified upon propagation in the absence of conventional light-matter interactions. The generality of our formalism unveils the conditions under which the evolution of multiphoton systems can lead to surprising photon statistics modifications. Specifically, we show that the implementation of conditional measurements may enable the all-optical preparation of multiphoton systems with attenuated quantum statistics below the shot-noise limit. Remarkably, this effect cannot be explained through the classical theory of optical coherence. As such, our work opens new paradigms within the established field of quantum coherence.

TI Hybrid actor-critic algorithm for quantum reinforcement learning at CERN
   beam lines
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Free energy-based reinforcement learning (FERL) with clamped quantum Boltzmann machines (QBM) was shown to significantly improve the learning efficiency compared to classical Q-learning with the restriction, however, to discrete state-action space environments. In this paper, the FERL approach is extended to multi-dimensional continuous state-action space environments to open the doors for a broader range of real-world applications. First, free energy-based Q-learning is studied for discrete action spaces, but continuous state spaces and the impact of experience replay on sample efficiency is assessed. In a second step, a hybrid actor-critic (A-C) scheme for continuous state-action spaces is developed based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm combining a classical actor network with a QBM-based critic. The results obtained with quantum annealing (QA), both simulated and with D-Wave QA hardware, are discussed, and the performance is compared to classical reinforcement learning methods. The environments used throughout represent existing particle accelerator beam lines at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research. Among others, the hybrid A-C agent is evaluated on the actual electron beam line of the Advanced Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE).

TI Quantum state estimation of multipartite single-photon path entanglement
   via local measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Multipartite entanglement plays a critical role in various applications of quantum internet. In these applications, the entanglement is usually shared by the distant parties. Experimentally, the distributed entanglement should be estimated by only local measurements. Furthermore, for network experiments, it is desirable to employ measurement techniques that are straightforward to implement. In this paper, we propose a method to measure arbitrary multipartite single-photon path entangled states by only local measurements. By considering practically reasonable assumptions, our method is relatively easy to implement. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of this method by reconstructing the density matrix of a 3-qubit W state.

TI Quantum Language Model With Entanglement Embedding for Question
   Answering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB Quantum language models (QLMs) in which words are modeled as a quantum superposition of sememes have demonstrated a high level of model transparency and good post-hoc interpretability. Nevertheless, in the current literature, word sequences are basically modeled as a classical mixture of word states, which cannot fully exploit the potential of a quantum probabilistic description. A quantum-inspired neural network (NN) module is yet to be developed to explicitly capture the nonclassical correlations within the word sequences. We propose a NN model with a novel entanglement embedding (EE) module, whose function is to transform the word sequence into an entangled pure state representation. Strong quantum entanglement, which is the central concept of quantum information and an indication of parallelized correlations among the words, is observed within the word sequences. The proposed QLM with EE (QLM-EE) is proposed to implement on classical computing devices with a quantum-inspired NN structure, and numerical experiments show that QLM-EE achieves superior performance compared with the classical deep NN models and other QLMs on question answering (QA) datasets. In addition, the post-hoc interpretability of the model can be improved by quantifying the degree of entanglement among the word states.

TI Faithful entanglement distribution using quantum multiplexing in noisy
   channel
SO EPL
AB Quantum multiplexing provides us with a powerful approach that can distribute entanglement using only a single photonic pulse to interact with remote quantum memories. In common entanglement distribution protocols, the entanglement purification is often exploited if the distributed entanglement is degraded by the channel noise. In this protocol, we propose a faithful entanglement distribution protocol using quantum multiplexing of photon in a collective noise channel. By designing the encoding and decoding setup, our protocol can resist the collective noise. When the protocol is successful, the parties can obtain two pairs of maximally entangled states. When the protocol fails, the parties can still obtain one pair of maximally entangled state. Our protocol does not require the entanglement purification, so that it is more efficient. The above advantages enable our protocol to have important application potential in the future quantum communication field. Copyright (C) 2021 EPLA

AB Lasers are imperative in quantum simulation experiments to trap and cool atoms. With the growing complexity of experimental setups, precise control and stability of the position and exotic shape of lasers have become essential for high-fidelity operations. However, disturbances such as temperature fluctuations, mechanical vibrations, deformation of materials, and acoustic noise pose challenges to fulfill these requirements. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the first system for stabilizing the laser's beam position using two high-resolution cameras with high frame-rates, and image processing in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with low latency and subsequent in-loop feedback to the laser control. The proposed image processing hardware extracts the Gaussian beam distribution from two 5 MP cameras at 47 fps and 435 ns latency. These are fed to four proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers implemented on the FPGA. The PID modules provide feedback through parallel digital-to-analog converter (DAC) channels for steering mirrors to stabilize the beam within 5 mu m accuracy. Using two cameras at distinct sample distances on the optical axis allows for controlling the incidence angle of the laser beam onto the image planes. The current system is a building block for future extensions allowing real-time phase-feedback on optical lattices, stabilization of independent optical tweezers in an array, and focus position stabilization of transverse electromagnetic (e.g. TEM01) modes enabling large-scale quantum simulations.

TI Generation of photonic matrix product states with Rydberg atomic arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show how one can deterministically generate photonic matrix product states with high bond and physical dimensions with an atomic array if one has access to a Rydberg-blockade mechanism. We develop both a quantum gate and an optimal control approach to universally control the system and analyze the photon retrieval efficiency of atomic arrays. Comprehensive modeling of the system shows that our scheme is capable of generating a large number of entangled photons. We further develop a multi-port photon emission approach that can efficiently distribute entangled photons into free space in several directions, which can become a useful tool in future quantum networks.

TI Estimating QSVT angles for matrix inversion with large condition numbers
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a state-of-the-art, near-optimal quantum algorithm that can be used for matrix inversion. The QSVT circuit is parameterized by a sequence of angles that must be pre-calculated classically, with the number of angles increasing as the matrix condition number grows. Computing QSVT angles for ill-conditioned problems is a numerically challenging task. We propose a numerical technique for estimating QSVT angles for large condition numbers. This technique allows one to avoid expensive numerical computations of QSVT angles and to emulate QSVT circuits for solving ill-conditioned problems.

TI A Post-Quantum Digital Signature Using Verkle Trees and Lattices
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Research on quantum computers has advanced significantly in recent years. If humanity ever creates an effective quantum computer, many of the present public key cryptosystems can be compromised. These cryptosystems are currently found in many commercial products. We have devised solutions that seem to protect us from quantum attacks, but they are unsafe and inefficient for use in everyday life. In the paper, hash-based digital signature techniques are analyzed. A Merkle-tree-based digital signature is assessed. Using a Verkle tree and vector commitments, the paper explores novel ideas. The authors of this article present a unique technology for developing a post-quantum digital signature system using state-of-the-art Verkle tree technology. A Verkle tree, vector commitments, and vector commitments based on lattices for post-quantum features are used for this purpose. The concepts of post-quantum signature design utilizing a Verkle tree are also provided in the paper.

TI Curvature-enhanced multipartite coherence in the multiverse
SO CHINESE PHYSICS C
AB Here, we study the quantum coherence of N-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states in the multiverse consisting of N causally disconnected de Sitter spaces. Interestingly, N-partite coherence increases monotonically with curvature, whereas the curvature effect destroys quantum entanglement and discord, indicating that the curvature effect is beneficial to quantum coherence and harmful to quantum correlations in the multiverse. We find that with an increase in n expanding de Sitter spaces, the N-partite coherence of the GHZ state increases monotonically for any curvature, whereas the quantum coherence of the W state decreases or increases monotonically depending on the curvature. We find a distribution relationship, which indicates that the correlated coherence of the N-partite W state is equal to the sum of all bipartite correlated coherence in the multiverse. Multipartite coherence exhibits unique properties in the multiverse, suggesting that it may provide some evidence for the existence of the multiverse.

TI Digital sovereignty, digital infrastructures, and quantum horizons
SO AI & SOCIETY
AB This article holds that governmental investments in quantum technologies speak to the imaginable futures of digital sovereignty and digital infrastructures, two major areas of change driven by related technologies like AI and Big Data, among other things, in international law today. Under intense development today for future interpolation into digital systems that they may alter, quantum technologies occupy a sort of liminal position, rooted in existing assemblages of computational technologies while pointing to new horizons for them. The possibilities they raise are neither certain nor determinate, but active investments in them (legal, political and material investments) offer perspective on digital technology-driven influences on an international legal imagination. In contributing to visions of the future that are guiding ambitions for digital sovereignty and digital infrastructures, quantum technologies condition digital technology-driven changes to international law and legal imagination in the present. Privileging observation and description, I adapt and utilize a diffractive method with the aim to discern what emerges out of the interference among the several related things assembled for this article, including material technologies and legal institutions. In conclusion, I observe ambivalent changes to an international legal imagination, changes which promise transformation but appear nonetheless to reproduce current distributions of power and resources.

This article is concerned with the current iteration of this dynamic, with the questions of which emerging technologies are likely to impact intelligence work most significantly over the medium-term, and how this impact will manifest. It identifies artificial intelligence and quantum technologies as being the most significant, and claims that their impact will be catalysed by the next generation of data-generating technologies that will continue to proliferate in society. It argues that elements of these emerging technologies have already disrupted core features of intelligence work, but that for the medium-term intelligence work will be characterised by gradual development, rather than abrupt change.

TI Design of a novel hybrid quantum deep neural network in INEQR images
   classification
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We redesign the parameterized quantum circuit in the quantum deep neural network, construct a three-layer structure as the hidden layer, and then use classical optimization algorithms to train the parameterized quantum circuit, thereby propose a novel hybrid quantum deep neural network (HQDNN) used for image classification. After bilinear interpolation reduces the original image to a suitable size, an improved novel enhanced quantum representation (INEQR) is used to encode it into quantum states as the input of the HQDNN. Multi-layer parameterized quantum circuits are used as the main structure to implement feature extraction and classification. The output results of parameterized quantum circuits are converted into classical data through quantum measurements and then optimized on a classical computer. To verify the performance of the HQDNN, we conduct binary classification and three classification experiments on the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) data set. In the first binary classification, the accuracy of 0 and 4 exceeds 98%. Then we compare the performance of three classification with other algorithms, the results on two datasets show that the classification accuracy is higher than that of quantum deep neural network and general quantum convolutional neural network.

TI Rate-compatible multi-edge type low-density parity-check code ensembles
   for continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we propose a design rule of rate-compatible punctured multi-edge type low-density parity-check (MET-LDPC) code ensembles with degree-one variable nodes for the information reconciliation (IR) of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems. In addition to the rate compatibility, the design rule effectively resolves the high error-floor issue which has been known as a technical challenge of MET-LDPC codes at low rates. Thus, the proposed design rule allows one to implement rate-compatible MET-LDPC codes with good performances both in the threshold and low-error-rate regions. The rate compatibility and the improved error-rate performances significantly enhance the efficiency of IR for CV-QKD systems. The performance improvements are confirmed by comparing complexities and secret key rates of IR schemes with MET-LDPC codes whose ensembles are optimized with the proposed and existing design rules. In particular, the SNR range of positive secrecy rate increases by 1.44 times, and the maximum secret key rate improves by 2.10 times as compared to the existing design rules. The comparisons clearly show that an IR scheme can achieve drastic performance improvements in terms of both the complexity and secret key rate by employing rate-compatible MET-LDPC codes constructed with code ensembles optimized with the proposed design rule.

TI Quantum smoothed particle hydrodynamics algorithm inspired by quantum

SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB Recent years have seen great progress in quantum computing, providing opportunities to overcome computational bottlenecks in many scientific applications. In particular, the intersection of computational fluid dynamics and quantum computing has become an active area of research with exponential computational speedup as an ultimate goal. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the time-dependent smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Our algorithm uses concepts from discrete-time quantum walks to solve the one-dimensional advection partial differential equation via an SPH formalism. Hence, we construct a quantum circuit to carry out the calculations for a two-particle system over one, two, and three time steps. We compare its outputs with results from the classical SPH algorithm and show there is excellent agreement. The methodology and findings, here, are a key step toward developing a more general quantum SPH algorithm for solving practical engineering problems on gate-based quantum computers.

TI Deep learning framework for time series classification based on multiple
   imaging and hybrid quantum neural networks
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Time series classification (TSC) has attracted a lot of attention for time series data mining tasks and has been applied in various fields. With the success of deep learning (DL) in computer vision recognition, people are starting to use deep learning to tackle TSC tasks. Quantum neural networks (QNN) have recently demonstrated their superiority over traditional machine learning in methods such as image processing and natural language processing, but research using quantum neural networks to handle TSC tasks has not received enough attention. Therefore, we proposed a learning framework based on multiple imaging and hybrid QNN (MIHQNN) for TSC tasks. We investigate the possibility of converting 1D time series to 2D images and classifying the converted images using hybrid QNN. We explored the differences between MIHQNN based on single time series imaging and MIHQNN based on the fusion of multiple time series imaging. Four quantum circuits were also selected and designed to study the impact of quantum circuits on TSC tasks. We tested our method on several standard datasets and achieved significant results compared to several current TSC methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of MIHQNN. This research highlights the potential of applying quantum computing to TSC and provides the theoretical and experimental background for future research.

TI Edge-based quantum approximate optimization algorithm for MAX-CUT
   problem
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle computationally intensive problems that classical computers struggle with. In this study, we explore the application of the Edge-based quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to the MAX-CUT problem, a well-known combinatorial optimization challenge. MAX-CUT aims to partition the vertices of a graph into two subsets such that the number of edges between the subsets is maximized. We define the edge-based MAX-CUT problem and propose a method for applying QAOA specifically tailored to this formulation. We conduct simulations using IBM's Qiskit framework, examining both vertex-based and edge-based QAOA implementations across various graph structures. Our results highlight the comparative performance of these approaches in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Specifically, we analyze the impact of different graph sizes and edge densities on the complexity and CNOT gate counts of the proposed algorithms. This analysis provides insights into leveraging quantum computing for combinatorial optimization tasks, particularly focusing on the implications for practical applications and future research directions.

TI Source coherence-induced control of spatiotemporal coherency vortices
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A novel method to achieve the coherence control of spatiotemporal coherency vortices of spatially and temporally partially coherent pulsed vortex (STPCPV) beams is proposed. The influence of spatial and temporal coherence of the source on the phase distributions and the positions of spatiotemporal coherency vortices of the STPCPV beams propagating through fused silica is investigated in detail, for the first time to our knowledge. It is found that the coherence width and the coherence time of the incident beam can be regarded as a perfect tool for controlling the phase distribution and position of a spatiotemporal coherency vortex. The results obtained in this paper will benefit a number of applications relating to light-matter interaction, quantum entanglement, quantum imaging, optical trapping and spatiotemporal spin-orbit angular momentum coupling.

AB ContextFrom a nuclear spin prospective, water exists as para and ortho nuclear spin isomers (isotopomers). Spin interconversions in isolated molecules of water are forbidden, but many recent reports have shown them to happen in bulk, through dynamic proton exchanges happening between interconnected networks of a large array of water molecules. In this contribution, a possible explanation for an unexpected slow or delayed interconversion of ortho-para water in ice observed in an earlier reported experiment is provided. Using the results of quantum mechanical investigations, we have discussed the roles played by Bjerrum defects in the dynamic proton exchanges and ortho-para spin state interconversions. We guess that at the sites of the Bjerrum defects, there are possibilities of quantum entanglements of states, through pairwise interactions. Based on the perfectly correlated exchange happening via a replica transition state, we speculate that it can have significant influences on ortho-para interconversions of water. We also conjecture that the overall ortho-para interconversion is not a continuous process, rather can be imagined to be happening serendipitously, but within the boundary of the rules of quantum mechanics.MethodsAll computations were performed with Gaussian 09 program. B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) methodology was used to compute all the stationary points. Further energy corrections were computed using CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ methodology. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) path computations were carried out for the transition states.

TI Applications of quantum computing for investigations of electronic
   transitions in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF emitters
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB A quantum chemistry study of the first singlet (S-1) and triplet (T-1) excited states of phenylsulfonyl-carbazole compounds, proposed as useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for organic light emitting diode (OLED) applications, was performed with the quantum Equation-Of-Motion Variational Quantum Eigensolver (qEOM-VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithms on quantum simulators and devices. These quantum simulations were performed with double zeta quality basis sets on an active space comprising the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, LUMO) of the TADF molecules. The differences in energy separations between S-1 and T-1 (Delta E-ST) predicted by calculations on quantum simulators were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. Differences of 17 and 88 mHa with respect to exact energies were found for excited states by using the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms, respectively, to perform simulations on quantum devices without error mitigation. By utilizing state tomography to purify the quantum states and correct energy values, the large errors found for unmitigated results could be improved to differences of, at most, 4 mHa with respect to exact values. Consequently, excellent agreement could be found between values of Delta E-ST predicted by quantum simulations and those found in experiments.

AB Quantum cryptography leverages unique properties of quantum information in order to construct cryptographic primitives that are oftentimes impossible classically. In this work, we build on the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics and design cryptographic schemes with key revocation capabilities. We consider schemes where secret keys are represented as quantum states with the guarantee that, once the secret key is successfully revoked from a user, they no longer have the ability to perform the same functionality as before.
   We define and construct several fundamental cryptographic primitives with key-revocation capabilities, namely pseudorandom functions, secret-key and public-key encryption, and even fully homomorphic encryption, assuming the quantum sub-exponential hardness of the learning with errors problem. Central to all our constructions is our method of making the Dual-Regev encryption (Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2008) scheme revocable.

TI Quantum Circuit Learning With Parameterized Boson Sampling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB A quantum circuit learning approach is studied to carry out the fast-fitting of Gaussian functions. First, a parameterized structure is designed for quantum circuits based on the boson sampling model. And then, the training procedure of exploiting gradient based optimizations is presented to iteratively update the gradient of the loss function concerning circuit parameters. For efficiency, two kinds of circuit loss, the kernel maximum mean discrepancy and the mean absolute error, are used in the training procedure, which are both competent to achieve quantum circuit learning well. It is significant that the two circuit losses assist in reducing the variance to 2.54 x 10(-6 )and 6.91 x 10(-6), respectively. Finally, a kind of quantum circuit fixed structure is developed with the boson sampling model that can decrease the model complexity as the circuit depth d grows. Sets of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed quantum circuit learning scheme, and demonstrate that our parameterized approach is efficient and promising, and it is worth looking forward to solving practical application problems with quantum computers since valid quantum circuits for Gaussian function fast-fitting can be designed indeed.

TI Sagnac interferometer and the quantum nature of gravity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We use a quantum variant of the Sagnac interferometer to argue for the quantum nature of gravity assuming the equivalence principle, which we formulate in its quantum version. We first present an original derivation of the phase acquired in the conventional Sagnac matter-wave interferometer, within the Hamiltonian formalism. Then we modify the interferometer in two crucial respects. The interfering matter wave is interfered along two different distances from the centre and the interferometer is prepared in a superposition of two different angular velocities. We argue that if the radial and angular degrees of freedom of the matter wave become entangled through this experiment, then, via the equivalence principle, the gravitational field must be non-classical.

TI Deterministic all-versus-nothing proofs of Bell nonlocality based on
   non-stabilizer states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The all-versus-nothing proof of Bell nonlocality is a prominent demonstration of Bell's theorem without inequalities. There are two kinds of such proofs: the deterministic all-versus-nothing proof and the probabilistic all-versus-nothing proof, which have received extensive research attention. Traditionally, all previous deterministic all-versus-nothing proofs are constructed based on stabilizer states. However, this work presents new deterministic proofs derived from non-stabilizer states, thereby breaking away from this conventional approach. These novel results not only significantly broaden the range of demonstrations of Bell nonlocality without inequalities but also offer valuable resources for certain quantum information processing applications.

TI Kalman filter-enabled parameter estimation for simultaneous quantum key
   distribution and classical communication scheme over a
   satellite-mediated link
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB An accurate estimation of system parameters is of significance for the practical implementation of the simultaneous quantum key distribution and classical communication (SQCC) over a satellite-mediated link when considering the finite-size effect. In this paper, we propose a Kalman filter (KF)-enabled parameter estimation method for the SQCC over a satellite-mediated link. The fast and slow phase drift can be both estimated by using the improved vector KF carrier phase estimation algorithm, and thus the phase estimation error can be tracked in real time and be almost approximate to the theoretical mean square error limit. Taking advantage of the achieved phase estimation and the dual modulation of the SQCC scheme, the excess noise can be estimated with not only a higher precise but also a lower sacrificing rate of raw keys. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the SQCC in both the downlink and uplink in terms of the finite-size effect. As a comparison of the Mth-power algorithm, we find that the secret key rate and achievable zenith angle perform better by using the vector KF algorithm. It paves the way of practical implementations for the SQCC system. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Multi-Scale Modeling of Tunneling in Nanoscale Atomically Precise Si:P
   Tunnel Junctions
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Controlling electron tunneling is of fundamental importance in the design and operation of semiconductor nanostructures such as field effect transistors (FETs) and quantum computing device architectures. The exponential sensitivity of tunneling with distance requires precise fabrication techniques to engineer the desired device dimensions to achieve the appropriate tunneling resistances/tunnel rates. This is particularly important for high fidelity spin readout and qubit exchange in quantum computing architectures. Here, it is shown by combining precision fabrication techniques with accurate atomistic modeling, predictive device design criteria are achieved at atomic length scales. Such a tool is useful when devices become more complex or have arbitrary shapes/geometries. In particular, in this study, atomic precision patterning of monolayer degenerately phosphorus-doped silicon tunnel junctions patterned by scanning tunnelling microscopy lithography and tight-binding non-equilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF) modeling is combined to describe the dependence of tunnel junction resistance R-T on junction length. An agreement with experiment to within a factor of 2 over 4 orders of magnitude in R-T is found, and this model allows to accurately determine the barrier height V-0 = 57.5 +/- 1 meV and lateral seam s(xy) = 0.39 +/- 0.01 nm in these nanoscale junctions. This study confirms the use of the TB-NEGF formalism to accurately model highly doped atomically precise tunnel junctions in silicon. Further applications of this model will enable improved device performance at the nanoscale.

TI Corrected Bell and non-contextuality inequalities for realistic
   experiments
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Contextuality is a feature of quantum correlations. It is crucial from a foundational perspective as a non-classical phenomenon, and from an applied perspective as a resource for quantum advantage. It is commonly defined in terms of hidden variables, for which it forces a contradiction with the assumptions of parameter-independence and determinism. The former can be justified by the empirical property of non-signalling or non-disturbance, and the latter by the empirical property of measurement sharpness. However, in realistic experiments neither empirical property holds exactly, which leads to possible objections to contextuality as a form of non-classicality, and potential vulnerabilities for supposed quantum advantages. We introduce measures to quantify both properties, and introduce quantified relaxations of the corresponding assumptions. We prove the continuity of a known measure of contextuality, the contextual fraction, which ensures its robustness to noise. We then bound the extent to which these relaxations can account for contextuality, via corrections terms to the contextual fraction (or to any non-contextuality inequality), culminating in a notion of genuine contextuality, which is robust to experimental imperfections. We then show that our result is general enough to apply or relate to a variety of established results and experimental set-ups.This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum contextuality, causality and freedom of choice'.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We consider the optimal control problem in a two-qubit system with bounded amplitude. Two cases are studied: quantum state preparation and entanglement creation. Cost functions, fidelity and concurrence, are optimized over bang-off controls for various values of the total duration, respectively. For quantum state preparation problem, three critical time points are determined accurately, and optimal controls are estimated. A better estimation of the quantum speed limit is obtained, so is the time-optimal control. For entanglement creation problem, two critical time points are determined, one of them is the minimal time to achieve maximal entanglement (unit concurrence) starting from the product state. In addition, the comparisons between bang-off and chopped random basis (CRAB) are made.

TI A Backgate for Enhanced Tunability of Holes in Planar Germanium
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Planar semiconductor heterostructures offer versatile device designs and are promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. Notably, heterostructures based on strained germanium have been extensively studied in recent years, with an emphasis on their strong and tunable spin-orbit interaction, low effective mass, and high hole mobility. However, planar systems are still limited by the fact that the shape of the confinement potential is directly related to the density. In this work, we present the successful implementation of a backgate for a planar germanium heterostructure. The backgate, in combination with a topgate, enables independent control over the density and the electric field, which determines important state properties such as the effective mass, the g-factor, and the quantum lifetime. This unparalleled degree of control paves the way toward engineering qubit properties and facilitates the targeted tuning of bilayer quantum wells, which promise denser qubit packing.

TI Electrical Control of Uniformity in Quantum Dot Devices
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Highly uniform quantum systems are essential for the practical implementation of scalable quantum processors. While quantum dot spin qubits based on semiconductor technology are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing, their small size makes them particularly sensitive to their local environment. Here, we present a method to electrically obtain a high degree of uniformity in the intrinsic potential landscape using hysteretic shifts of the gate voltage characteristics. We demonstrate the tuning of pinch-off voltages in quantum dot devices over hundreds of millivolts that then remain stable at least for hours. Applying our method, we homogenize the pinch-off voltages of the plunger gates in a linear array for four quantum dots, reducing the spread in pinch-off voltages by one order of magnitude. This work provides a new tool for the tuning of quantum dot devices and offers new perspectives for the implementation of scalable spin qubit arrays.

TI Using machine learning to improve multi- qubit state discrimination of
   trapped ions from uncertain EMCCD measurements
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB This paper proposes a residual network (ResNet)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model to improve multi-qubit state measurements using an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD). The CNN model is developed to simultaneously use the intensity of pixel values and the shape of ion images in determining the quantum states of ions. In contrast, conventional methods use only the intensity values. In our experiments, the proposed model achieved a 99.53 +/- 0.14% mean individual measurement fidelity (MIMF) of 4 trapped ions, reducing the error by 46% when compared to the MIMF of maximum likelihood estimation method of 99.13 +/- 0.08%. In addition, it is experimentally shown that the model is also robust against the ion image drift, which was tested by intentionally shifting the ion images.

TI Quantum image processing on real superconducting and trapped-ion based
   quantum computers
SO TM-TECHNISCHES MESSEN
AB The size and number of images and the amount of data we process every day have grown rapidly over the last years. Quantum computers promise to process this data more efficiently since classical images can be stored in quantum states. Experiments on quantum computer simulators prove the paradigms this promise is built on to be correct. However, currently, running the very same algorithms on a real quantum computer is often too error-prone to be of any practical use. We explore the current possibilities for image processing on real quantum computers. We redesign a commonly used quantum image encoding technique to reduce its susceptibility to errors. We show experimentally that the current size limit for images to be encoded on a quantum computer and subsequently retrieved with an error of at most 5 % is 2 x 2 pixels. A way to circumvent this limitation is to combine ideas of classical filtering with a quantum algorithm operating locally, only. We show the practicability of this strategy using the application example of edge detection. Our hybrid filtering scheme's quantum part is an artificial neuron, working well on real quantum computers, too.

   dissipation
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. The exact simulation of these reactions is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. Here, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multispecies trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.

TI A Secure Scheme Based on a Hybrid of Classical-Quantum Communications
   Protocols for Managing Classical Blockchains
SO ENTROPY
AB Blockchain technology affords data integrity protection and building trust mechanisms in transactions for distributed networks, and, therefore, is seen as a promising revolutionary information technology. At the same time, the ongoing breakthrough in quantum computation technology contributes toward large-scale quantum computers, which might attack classic cryptography, seriously threatening the classic cryptography security currently employed in the blockchain. As a better alternative, a quantum blockchain has high expectations of being immune to quantum computing attacks perpetrated by quantum adversaries. Although several works have been presented, the problems of impracticality and inefficiency in quantum blockchain systems remain prominent and need to be addressed. First, this paper develops a quantum-secure blockchain (QSB) scheme by introducing a consensus mechanism-quantum proof of authority (QPoA) and an identity-based quantum signature (IQS)-wherein QPoA is used for new block generation and IQS is used for transaction signing and verification. Second, QPoA is developed by adopting a quantum voting protocol to achieve secure and efficient decentralization for the blockchain system, and a quantum random number generator (QRNG) is deployed for randomized leader node election to protect the blockchain system from centralized attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS). Compared to previous work, our scheme is more practical and efficient without sacrificing security, greatly contributing to better addressing the challenges in the quantum era. Extensive security analysis demonstrates that our scheme provides better protection against quantum computing attacks than classic blockchains. Overall, our scheme presents a feasible solution for blockchain systems against quantum computing attacks through a quantum strategy, contributing toward quantum-secured blockchain in the quantum era.

TI Quantum many-body scarring in a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.

TI Contextual Advantages and Certification for Maximum-Confidence
   Discrimination
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB One of the most fundamental results in quantum information theory is that no measurement can perfectly discriminate between nonorthogonal quantum states. In this work, we investigate quantum advantages for discrimination tasks over noncontextual theories by considering a maximum-confidence measurement that unifies different strategies of quantum state discrimination, including minimum-error and unambiguous discrimination. We first show that maximum-confidence discrimination, as well as unambiguous discrimi-nation, contains contextual advantages. We then consider a semi-device-independent scenario of certifying maximum-confidence measurement. The scenario naturally contains undetected events, making it a natural setting to explore maximum-confidence measurements. We show that the certified maximum confidence in quantum theory also contains contextual advantages. Our results establish how the advantages of quantum theory over a classical model may appear in a realistic scenario of a discrimination task.

TI Single-Electron Occupation in Quantum Dot Arrays at Selectable Plunger
   Gate Voltage
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The small footprint of semiconductor qubits is favorable for scalable quantum computing. However, their size also makes them sensitive to their local environment and variations in the gate structure. Currently, each device requires tailored gate voltages to confine a single charge per quantum dot, clearly challenging scalability. Here, we tune these gate voltages and equalize them solely through the temporary application of stress voltages. In a double quantum dot, we reach a stable (1,1) charge state at identical and predetermined plunger gate voltage and for various interdot couplings. Applying our findings, we tune a 2 x 2 quadruple quantum dot such that the (1,1,1,1) charge state is reached when all plunger gates are set to 1 V. The ability to define required gate voltages may relax requirements on control electronics and operations for spin qubit devices, providing means to advance quantum hardware.

TI A quantum Hopfield associative memory implemented on an actual quantum
   processor
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this work, we present a Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) and demonstrate its capabilities in simulation and hardware using IBM Quantum Experience.. The QHAM is based on a quantum neuron design which can be utilized for many different machine learning applications and can be implemented on real quantum hardware without requiring mid-circuit measurement or reset operations. We analyze the accuracy of the neuron and the full QHAM considering hardware errors via simulation with hardware noise models as well as with implementation on the 15-qubit ibmq_16_melbourne device. The quantum neuron and the QHAM are shown to be resilient to noise and require low qubit overhead and gate complexity. We benchmark the QHAM by testing its effective memory capacity and demonstrate its capabilities in the NISQ-era of quantum hardware. This demonstration of the first functional QHAM to be implemented in NISQ-era quantum hardware is a significant step in machine learning at the leading edge of quantum computing.

We translate this scenario into the quantum setting and describe how the HHL algorithm could be used to attack this construction. Further, we give simple and verifiable criteria under which a black-box attack on stream ciphers with the HHL algorithm is not efficiently feasible. Usually, these criteria follow from already known design principles for symmetric ciphers and should apply to the ciphers used today. We complement the criteria with a simple test, which confirms the resistance of said cipher. Moreover, we use our technique to test the currently used stream ciphers: Trivium, HC-128, and Salsa20.

TI Cloud Data Security through BB84 Protocol and Genetic Algorithm
SO BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB In the current digitalized world, cloud computing becomes a feasible solution for the virtualization of cloud computing resources. Though cloud computing has many advantages to outsourcing an organization's information, but the strong security is the main aspect of cloud computing. Identity authentication theft becomes a vital part of the protection of cloud computing data. In this process, the intruders violate the security protocols and perform attacks on the organizations or user's data. The situation of cloud data disclosure leads to the cloud user feeling insecure while using the cloud platform. The different traditional cryptographic techniques are not able to stop such kinds of attacks. BB84 protocol is the first quantum cryptography protocol developed by Bennett and Brassard in the year 1984. In the present work, three ways BB84GA security systems have been demonstrated using trusted cryptographic techniques like an attribute-based authentication system, BB84 protocol, and genetic algorithm. Firstly, attribute-based authentication is used for identity-based access control and thereafter BB84 protocol is used for quantum key distribution between both parties and later the concept of genetic algorithm is applied for encryption/decryption of sensitive information across the private/public clouds. The proposed concept of involvement of hybrid algorithms is highly secure and technologically feasible. It is a unique algorithm which may be used to minimize the security threats over the clouds. The computed results are presented in the form of tables and graphs.

TI Quantum-Dot Single-Electron Transistors as Thermoelectric Quantum
   Detectors at Terahertz Frequencies
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Low-dimensional nanosystems are promising candidates for manipulating, controlling, and capturing photons with large sensitivities and low noise. If quantum engineered to tailor the energy of the localized electrons across the desired frequency range, they can allow devising of efficient quantum sensors across any frequency domain. Here, we exploit the rich few-electron physics to develop millimeter-wave nanodetectors employing as a sensing element an InAs/InAs0.3P0.7 quantum-dot nanowire, embedded in a singleelectron transistor. Once irradiated with light, the deeply localized quantum element exhibits an extra electromotive force driven by the photothermoelectric effect, which is exploited to efficiently sense radiation at 0.6 THz with a noise equivalent power <8 pWHz(-1/2) and almost zero dark current. The achieved results open intriguing perspectives for quantum key distributions, quantum communications, and quantum cryptography at terahertz frequencies.

TI Experimental error mitigation using linear rescaling for variational
   quantum eigensolving with up to 20 qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computers have the potential to help solve a range of physics and chemistry problems, but noise in quantum hardware currently limits our ability to obtain accurate results from the execution of quantum-simulation algorithms. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate the impact of noise on variational algorithms, including several that model the noise as damping expectation values of observables. In this work, we benchmark various methods, including a new method proposed here. We compare their performance in estimating the ground-state energies of several instances of the 1D mixed-field Ising model using the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm with up to 20 qubits on two of IBM's quantum computers. We find that several error-mitigation techniques allow us to recover energies to within 10% of the true values for circuits containing up to about 25 ansatz layers, where each layer consists of CNOT gates between all neighboring qubits and Y-rotations on all qubits.

TI Correlations in the EPR State Observables
SO ENTROPY
AB The identification and physical interpretation of arbitrary quantum correlations are not always effortless. Two features that can significantly influence the dispersion of the joint observable outcomes in a quantum bipartite system composed of systems I and II are: (a) All possible pairs of observables describing the composite are equally probable upon measurement, and (b) The absence of concurrence (positive reinforcement) between any of the observables within a particular system; implying that their associated operators do not commute. The so-called EPR states are known to observe (a). Here, we demonstrate in very general (but straightforward) terms that they also satisfy condition (b), a relevant technical fact often overlooked. As an illustration, we work out in detail the three-level systems, i.e., qutrits. Furthermore, given the special characteristics of EPR states (such as maximal entanglement, among others), one might intuitively expect the CHSH correlation, computed exclusively for the observables of qubit EPR states, to yield values greater than two, thereby violating Bell's inequality. We show such a prediction does not hold true. In fact, the combined properties of (a) and (b) lead to a more limited range of values for the CHSH measure, not surpassing the nonlocality threshold of two. The present constitutes an instructive example of the subtleties of quantum correlations.

TI On the Atmospheric Turbulence-Based Cryptosystems With High Secret-Key
   Rate
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In our recent paper, we proposed using the atmospheric turbulent channel as a source of randomness to simultaneously address various challenges in physical-layer security (PLS), quantum key distribution (QKD), and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). However, the long coherence time of atmospheric turbulence channels limits the achievable secret-key rates (SKRs). To address this issue, we initially leveraged the turbulence effects only during the system's initialization phase. In this paper, we present a source-based secret key generation scheme that overcomes the limitations imposed by the long coherence time of the turbulent channel, without requiring initialization. The scheme utilizes both atmospheric turbulence and background radiation as sources of randomness. It offers security superior to PQC and is comparable to QKD, while enabling significantly higher SKRs, making it fully compatible with state-of-the-art optical communications.

TI Phase encoded quantum key distribution up to 380 km in standard telecom
   grade fiber enabled by baseline error optimization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Phase encoding in quantum key distribution (QKD) enables long-distance information-theoretic secure communication in optical fibers. We present a novel theoretical model characterizing errors from various sources in practical phase encoding-based QKD systems, namely the laser linewidth, detector dark counts, and channel dispersion. This model provides optimized optical pulse parameters and less distortion in pulses, which eliminates system imperfections and leads to a reduced quantum bit error rate (QBER) for practical QKD scenario. This analysis is applicable to various fiber-based phase and time encoding protocols. In particular, we implement this to a differential phase shift (DPS) QKD scheme operating at a 2.5 GHz clock, which produces a secure key rate of 193 bits/s at a fiber length of 265 km and an unprecedented QBER < 1% up to 225 km length with standard telecom components. We show that by adjusting the quantum efficiency and dark count rates of detectors, proposed system can establish secure keys up to 380 km distance using standard telecom grade fiber with a QBER of 1.48%. Moreover, the system is compatible with existing optical fiber networks and capable of establishing a secure key exchange between two cities 432 km apart using ultra-low-loss (ULL) specialty fiber.

TI Implementation of an 8-bit bit-slice AES S-box with rapid single
   flux quantum circuits
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) circuits are a kind of superconducting digital circuits, having properties of a natural gate-level pipelining synchronous sequential circuit, which demonstrates high energy efficiency and high throughput advantage. We find that the high-throughput and high-speed performance of RSFQ circuits can take the advantage of a hardware implementation of the encryption algorithm, whereas these are rarely applied to this field. Among the available encryption algorithms, the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm is an advanced encryption standard algorithm. It is currently the most widely used symmetric cryptography algorithm. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the SubByte operation of an AES-128 algorithm using RSFQ circuits based on the SIMIT Nb03 process. We design an AES S-box circuit in the RSFQ logic, and compare its operational frequency, power dissipation, and throughput with those of the CMOS-based circuit post-simulated in the same structure. The complete RSFQ S-box circuit costs a total of 42237 Josephson junctions with nearly 130 Gbps throughput under the maximum simulated frequency of 16.28 GHz. Our analysis shows that the frequency and throughput of the RSFQ-based S-box are about four times higher than those of the CMOS-based S-box. Further, we design and fabricate a few typical modules of the S-box. Subsequent measurements demonstrate the correct functioning of the modules in both low and high frequencies up to 28.8 GHz.

TI Enhancement of key generation rate in QKD systems using dual branch PNR
   detectors
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB What we believe to be a new architecture based on dual -branch photon -numberresolving (DB-PNR) detectors for the receiver in the hybrid quantum key distribution (QKD) is introduced. DB-PNR scheme empowers the receiver to detect both quadratures of the coherent state simultaneously. Our results show that using DB-PNR detectors, the key generation rate (KGR) is almost doubled as compared to homodyne detection which detects only one quadrature at a time. The mutual information is enhanced by around 0.85 bits/symbol using DB-PNR as compared to heterodyne detection. DB-PNR is also found to outperform the heterodyne detection against Eve's individual and collective attacks. PNR-based detection schemes require less local oscillator (LO) power compared to homodyne/heterodyne detection schemes and thereby, the power efficiency of the receiver is enhanced.

TI Quantum identity authentication based on the extension of quantum
   rotation
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, we propose a bit-oriented QIA protocol based on special properties of quantum rotation and the public key cryptographic framework. The proposed protocol exhibited good resistance to both forward search and measure-resend attacks, whereby its security performance was directly related to the length of the authentication code. From our analysis, it was demonstrated that the protocol has good performance, in terms of quantum bit efficiency. In addition, the protocol is well-expandable. The developed protocol is resource-efficient and can be also applied in quantum computing networks.

TI Measurement-based interleaved randomised benchmarking using IBM
   processors
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum computers have the potential to outperform classical computers in a range of computational tasks, such as prime factorisation and unstructured searching. However, real-world quantum computers are subject to noise. Quantifying noise is of vital importance, since it is often the dominant factor preventing the successful realisation of advanced quantum computations. Here we propose and demonstrate an interleaved randomised benchmarking protocol for measurement-based quantum computers that can be used to estimate the fidelity of any single-qubit measurement-based gate. We tested the protocol on IBM superconducting quantum processors by estimating the fidelity of the Hadamard and T gates-a universal single-qubit gate set. Measurements were performed on entangled cluster states of up to 31 qubits. Our estimated gate fidelities show good agreement with those calculated from quantum process tomography. By artificially increasing noise, we were able to show that our protocol detects large noise variations in different implementations of a gate.

TI Revisiting the impact of dissipation on time-reversed one-axis-twist
   quantum-sensing protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Spin squeezing can increase the sensitivity of interferometric measurements of small signals in large spin ensembles beyond the standard quantum limit. In many practical settings, the ideal metrological gain is limited by imperfect readout of the sensor. To overcome this issue, protocols based on time reversal of unitary one-axis-twist (OAT) spin-squeezing dynamics have been proposed. Such protocols mitigate readout noise and, when implemented using cavity feedback, have been argued to also be robust against dissipation as long as the collective cooperativity of the system is sufficiently large [Davis et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 053601 (2016)]. Here, we perform a careful systematic study of dissipative effects on three different implementations of a OAT twist-untwist sensing scheme (based on symmetric as well as asymmetric cavity feedback and on a Tavis-Cummings interaction). Our full treatment shows that the three approaches have markedly different properties and resilience when subject to dissipation. Moreover, the metrological gain for an implementation using symmetric cavity feedback is more sensitive to undesired dissipation than was previously appreciated.

TI Bright semiconductor single-photon sources pumped by heterogeneously
   integrated micropillar lasers with electrical injections
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The emerging hybrid integrated quantum photonics combines the advantages of different functional components into a single chip to meet the stringent requirements for quantum information processing. Despite the tremendous progress in hybrid integrations of III-V quantum emitters with silicon-based photonic circuits and superconducting single-photon detectors, on-chip optical excitations of quantum emitters via miniaturized lasers towards single-photon sources (SPSs) with low power consumptions, small device footprints, and excellent coherence properties is highly desirable yet illusive. In this work, we present realizations of bright semiconductor SPSs heterogeneously integrated with on-chip electrically-injected microlasers. Different from previous one-by-one transfer printing technique implemented in hybrid quantum dot (QD) photonic devices, multiple deterministically coupled QD-circular Bragg Grating (CBG) SPSs were integrated with electrically-injected micropillar lasers at one time via a potentially scalable transfer printing process assisted by the wide-field photoluminescence (PL) imaging technique. Optically pumped by electrically-injected microlasers, pure single photons are generated with a high-brightness of a count rate of 3.8 M/s and an extraction efficiency of 25.44%. Such a high-brightness is due to the enhancement by the cavity mode of the CBG, which is confirmed by a Purcell factor of 2.5. Our work provides a powerful tool for advancing hybrid integrated quantum photonics in general and boosts the developments for realizing highly-compact, energy-efficient and coherent SPSs in particular.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Framework for Urban Traffic State
   Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical approach for multiclass traffic state classification using a benchmark urban mobility dataset collected in Daejeon, South Korea. The proposed architecture, called the Multilayer Perceptron-Variational Quantum Classifier (MVQC), combines classical feature extraction via a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with quantum-based classification using a variational quantum classifier (VQC). On the medium-scale subset of the dataset, the MVQC model achieved a test accuracy of 91.4%, outperforming the standalone VQC model, which achieved 61.8%. Although MVQC did not reach the accuracy of the classical MLP model (98.6%), it consistently outperformed purely quantum models and demonstrated better scalability with increasing data complexity. All quantum operations were simulated under noise-free conditions using IBM Qiskit's statevector simulator. These results demonstrate that classical feature extraction can effectively guide quantum circuits, enhance learning performance, and highlight the hybrid MVQC architecture as a viable solution for time-series classification in intelligent transportation systems.

SE Lecture Notes in Computer Science

CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB The security of code-based cryptography usually relies on the hardness of the Syndrome Decoding (SD) problem for the Hamming weight. The best generic algorithms are all improvements of an old algorithm by Prange, and they are known under the name of Information Set Decoding (ISD) algorithms. This work aims to extend ISD algorithms' scope by changing the underlying weight function and alphabet size of SD. More precisely, we show how to use Wagner's algorithm in the ISD framework to solve SD for a wide range of weight functions. We also calculate the asymptotic complexities of ISD algorithms, both for the classical and quantum case. We then apply our results to the Lee metric, which is currently receiving a significant amount of attention. By providing the parameters of SD for the Lee weight for which decoding seems to be the hardest, our study could have several applications for designing code-based cryptosystems and their security analysis, especially against quantum adversaries.

TI Postponing the choice: advantage of deferred measurements in quantum
   information processing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Simultaneously implementing two arbitrary quantum measurements on the same system is impossible. The consequence of this limitation is that selecting one measurement actively excludes other possibilities. Two incompatible choices can then be forced together only at the cost of adding enough noise to the measurements. An intriguing alternative is to postpone the choice, or part of it, until a later stage. We explore the advantages of this deferred decision-making and discover that the benefits critically depend on the assumptions about the forthcoming choice. In certain scenarios postponing the choice introduces no additional cost, while in others partial postponement can be effectively the same as full postponement.

TI High sensitivity pressure and temperature quantum sensing in
   pentacene-doped p-terphenyl single crystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum sensors' responsiveness to their physical environment enables detection of variables such as temperature (T), pressure (P), and strain. We present a molecular platform for PT sensing using para-terphenyl crystals doped with pentacene (PDP), leveraging optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of photoexcited triplet electron spins. We observe maximal frequency variations of df/dP=1.8 MHz/bar from 0-8 bar and df/dT=247 kHz/K from 79-330 K, over 1200 times and threefold greater, respectively, than those seen with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and > 85-fold greater pressure sensitivity over the previous record. Density functional theory calculations indicate picometer-level PT-induced molecular orbital shifts are measurable via ODMR. PDP offers additional advantages including high sensor doping levels, narrow ODMR linewidths, high contrast, and low-cost single crystal growth. Overall, this work reports low-cost, optically-interrogated PT sensors and lays the foundation for increased versatility of quantum sensors through synthetic molecular design.

TI Accelerating variational quantum eigensolver convergence using parameter

SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB One impediment to the useful application of variational quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry is slow convergence with large numbers of classical optimization parameters. In this work, we evaluate a quantum computational warm-start approach for potential energy surface calculations. Our approach, which is inspired by conventional computational methods, is evaluated using simulations of the variational quantum eigensolver. Significant speedup is demonstrated relative to calculations that rely on a Hartree-Fock initial state, both for ideal and sampled simulations. The general approach of transferring parameters between similar problems is promising for accelerating current and near-term quantum chemistry calculations on quantum hardware, and is likely applicable beyond the tested algorithm and use case.

TI Hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks for particle track
   reconstruction
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) will be upgraded to further increase the instantaneous rate of particle collisions (luminosity) and become the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). This increase in luminosity will significantly increase the number of particles interacting with the detector. The interaction of particles with a detector is referred to as "hit". The HL-LHC will yield many more detector hits, which will pose a combinatorial challenge by using reconstruction algorithms to determine particle trajectories from those hits. This work explores the possibility of converting a novel graph neural network model, that can optimally take into account the sparse nature of the tracking detector data and their complex geometry, to a hybrid quantum-classical graph neural network that benefits from using variational quantum layers. We show that this hybrid model can perform similar to the classical approach. Also, we explore parametrized quantum circuits (PQC) with different expressibility and entangling capacities, and compare their training performance in order to quantify the expected benefits. These results can be used to build a future road map to further develop circuit-based hybrid quantum-classical graph neural networks.

TI Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a
   Lorentz-violating vector field
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ-like black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the entanglement shadow region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.

TI Polarization purity and dispersion characteristics of nested
   antiresonant nodeless hollow-core optical fiber at near- and
   short-wave-IR wavelengths for quantum communications
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Advancements in quantum communication and sensing require improved optical transmission that ensures excellent state purity and reduced losses. While free-space optical communication is often preferred, its use becomes challenging over long distances due to beam divergence, atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence, among other factors. In the case of polarization encoding, traditional silica-core optical fibers, though commonly used, struggle with maintaining state purity due to stress-induced birefringence. Hollow core fibers, and in particular nested antiresonant nodeless fibers (NANF), have recently been shown to possess unparalleled polarization purity with minimal birefringence in the telecom wavelength range using continuous-wave (CW) laser light. Here, we investigate a 1-km NANF designed for wavelengths up to the 2-mu m waveband. Our results show a polarization extinction ratio between similar to-30 dB and similar to-70 dB across the 1520 to 1620 nm range in CW operation, peaking at similar to-60 dB at the 2-mu m design wavelength. Our study also includes the pulsed regime, providing insights beyond previous CW studies, e.g., on the propagation of broadband quantum states of light in NANF at 2 mu m, and corresponding extinction-ratio-limited quantum bit error rates (QBER) for prepare-measure and entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Our findings highlight the potential of these fibers in emerging applications such as QKD, pointing towards a new standard in optical quantum technologies.

TI The travelling salesperson problem and the challenges of near-term
   quantum advantage
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Over the last two decades, the travelling salesperson problem (TSP) has been cited as a benchmark problem to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computers over conventional computers. Its advantage is that it is a well-studied NP-hard optimisation problem that can be easily communicated to highlight the challenges of searching through an exponentially growing number of possible solutions to find the optimal solution. It is therefore a tempting problem to choose to explore quantum advantage. At what point, however, is a call made that quantum advantage is not likely, and efforts should be focused on other problems? This article challenges the continued use of the TSP as a benchmark for quantum optimisation methods-such as quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing-that require the TSP to be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problem. We offer explanations for why such quantum approaches are not well suited, nor competitive against state-of-the-art classical methods, for tackling the challenges of the TSP landscape, and we draw parallels with similar observations made almost four decades ago when QUBO-based neural networks proved to be uncompetitive for solving the TSP. After critically reviewing two decades of research effort to solve TSPs using QUBO-based quantum methods, we note a gradual shift in focus: from initial attempts to solve small sized TSPs with general-purpose QUBO-based quantum approaches, to growing evidence that competitiveness is only enhanced where TSP domain knowledge is integrated, via either modified formulations or hybridisation with TSP classical heuristics. We discuss the numerous challenges that must be overcome before QUBO-based quantum optimisers could ever be competitive with classical state-of-the-art TSP solvers. Acknowledging that there may be more promise for non-QUBO-based hybrid approaches, where quantum search accelerates components of conventional algorithms, we offer recommendations for how future studies should be conducted to compare fairly and rigorously any proposed quantum methods against state-of-the-art TSP solvers, or any classical optimisation method, when seeking to establish quantum advantage.

TI Optimization of shadow evaporation and oxidation for reproducible
   quantum Josephson junction circuits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The most commonly used physical realization of superconducting qubits for quantum circuits is a transmon. There are a number of superconducting quantum circuits applications, where Josephson junction critical current reproducibility over a chip is crucial. Here, we report on a robust chip scale Al/AlOx/Al junctions fabrication method due to comprehensive study of shadow evaporation and oxidation steps. We experimentally demonstrate the evidence of optimal Josephson junction electrodes thickness, deposition rate and deposition angle, which ensure minimal electrode surface and line edge roughness. The influence of oxidation method, pressure and time on critical current reproducibility is determined. With the proposed method we demonstrate Al/AlOx/Al junction fabrication with the critical current variation (s/?I-c?) less than 3.9% (from 150 x 200 to 150 x 600 nm(2) area) and 7.7% (for 100 x 100 nm(2) area) over 20 x 20 mm(2) chip. Finally, we fabricate separately three 5 x 10 mm(2) chips with 18 transmon qubits (near 4.3 GHz frequency) showing less than 1.9% frequency variation between qubits on different chips. The proposed approach and optimization criteria can be utilized for a robust wafer-scale superconducting qubit circuits fabrication.

TI Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum
   Low-Density Parity-Check Codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes offer a promising path to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation but lack systematic strategies for exploration. In this Letter, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. In addition to efficient characterizations using Gr & ouml;bner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem. This approach allows us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choices of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasifractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their intrinsic link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and derive an efficient method for generating finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our Letter provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced algebraic structures.

TI Circuit-QED for Multi-Loop Fluxonium-Type Qubits
SO PHOTONICS
AB Fluxonium qubits, designed to mitigate charge noise and enhance anharmonicity, are among the most promising superconducting platforms for quantum computing. To understand and exploit their quantum properties and design novel fluxonium-based architectures with improved functionalities, these systems require an accurate Hamiltonian formulation to capture their energy level structure and quantum dynamics. This work presents a systematic method for constructing the Hamiltonian for multi-loop circuits that partitions the system into a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators and a coupled anharmonic part originating from the Josephson circuit elements, allowing clear identification of independent modes and isolating the nonlinearity in the Josephson terms. While demonstrated for fluxonium-type multi-loop circuits, this method can be generalized to other superconducting qubit architectures within the broader context of circuit QED, making it a versatile tool for exploring different circuit configurations. Our systematic and flexible modeling approach forms the theoretical basis for the qubit measurement and control experiments validating multi-loop fluxonium architectures.

TI Symmetrized persistency of Bell correlations for Dicke states and
   GHZ-based mixtures
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum correlations, in particular those, which enable to violate a Bell inequality, open a way to advantage in certain communication tasks. However, the main difficulty in harnessing quantumness is its fragility to, e.g, noise or loss of particles. We study the persistency of Bell correlations of GHZ based mixtures and Dicke states. For the former, we consider quantum communication complexity reduction (QCCR) scheme, and propose new Bell inequalities (BIs), which can be used in that scheme for higher persistency in the limit of large number of particles N. In case of Dicke states, we show that persistency can reach 0.482N, significantly more than reported in previous studies.

TI KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum architecture Search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS emphasize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based deep Q-networks. However, their interpretability remains challenging due to the large number of learnable parameters and the complexities involved in selecting appropriate activation functions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success is 2x to 5x higher than MLPs. In noisy environments, KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required 2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.

TI Quantum rectangular MinRank attack on multi-layer UOV signature schemes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recent rank-based attacks have reduced the security of Rainbow, which is one of the multi-layer UOV signatures, below the NIST security requirements by speeding up iterative kernel-finding operations using classical mathematics techniques. If quantum algorithms are applied to perform these iterative operations, the rank-based attacks may be more threatening to multi-layer UOV, including Rainbow. In this paper, we propose a quantum rectangular MinRank attack called the Q-rMinRank attack, the first quantum approach to key recovery attacks on multi-layer UOV signatures. Our attack is a general model applicable to multi-layer UOV signature schemes, and in this paper, we provide examples of its application to Rainbow and the Korean TTA standard, HiMQ. We design two quantum oracle circuits to find the kernel in consideration of the depth-width trade-off of quantum circuits. One is to reduce the width of the quantum circuits using qubits as a minimum, and the other is to reduce the depth using parallelization instead of using a lot of qubits. By designing quantum circuits to find kernels with fewer quantum resources and complexity by adding mathematical techniques, we achieve quadratic speedup for the MinRank attack to recover the private keys of multi-layer UOV signatures. We also estimate quantum resources for the designed quantum circuits and analyze quantum complexity based on them. The width-optimized circuit recovers the private keys of Rainbow parameter set V with only 1089 logical qubits. The depth-optimized circuit recovers the private keys of Rainbow parameter set V with a quantum complexity of 2174\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>{174}$$\end{document}, which is lower than the complexity of 2221\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>{221}$$\end{document} recovering the secret key of AES-192, which provides the same security level as parameter set III.

TI Fundamental limits of electron and nuclear spin qubit lifetimes in an
   isolated self-assembled quantum dot
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Combining external control with long spin lifetime and coherence is a key challenge for solid state spin qubits. Tunnel coupling with electron Fermi reservoir provides robust charge state control in semiconductor quantum dots, but results in undesired relaxation of electron and nuclear spins through mechanisms that lack complete understanding. Here, we unravel the contributions of tunnelling-assisted and phonon-assisted spin relaxation mechanisms by systematically adjusting the tunnelling coupling in a wide range, including the limit of an isolated quantum dot. These experiments reveal fundamental limits and trade-offs of quantum dot spin dynamics: while reduced tunnelling can be used to achieve electron spin qubit lifetimes exceeding 1 s, the optical spin initialisation fidelity is reduced below 80%, limited by Auger recombination. Comprehensive understanding of electron-nuclear spin relaxation attained here provides a roadmap for design of the optimal operating conditions in quantum dot spin qubits.

AB Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices fail to produce outputs with sufficient fidelity for deep circuits with many gates today. Such devices suffer from read-out, multi-qubit gate and crosstalk noise combined with short decoherence times limiting circuit depth. This work develops a methodology to generate shorter circuits with fewer multi-qubit gates whose unitary transformations approximate the original reference one. It explores the benefit of such generated approximations under NISQ devices. Experimental results with Grover's algorithm, multiple -control Toffoli gates, and the Transverse Field Ising Model show that such approximate circuits produce higher fidelity results than longer, theoretically precise circuits on NISQ devices, especially when the reference circuits have many CNOT gates to begin with. With this ability to fine-tune circuits, it is demonstrated that quantum computations can be performed for more complex problems on today's devices than was feasible before, sometimes even with a gain in overall precision by up to 60%.

TI Quantum-centric high performance computing for quantum chemistry
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB High performance computing (HPC) is renowned for its capacity to tackle complex problems. Meanwhile, quantum computing (QC) provides a potential way to accurately and efficiently solve quantum chemistry problems. The emerging field of quantum-centric high performance computing (QCHPC), which merges these two powerful technologies, is anticipated to enhance computational capabilities for solving challenging problems in quantum chemistry. The implementation of QCHPC for quantum chemistry requires interdisciplinary research and collaboration across multiple fields, including quantum chemistry, quantum physics, computer science and so on. This perspective provides an introduction to the quantum algorithms that are suitable for deployment in QCHPC, focusing on conceptual insights rather than technical details. Parallel strategies to implement these algorithms on quantum-centric supercomputers are discussed. We also summarize high performance quantum emulating simulators, which are considered a viable tool to explore QCHPC. We conclude with challenges and outlooks in this field.

AB Secure communications have become a requirement for virtually all kind of applications. Currently, two distant parties can generate shared random secret keys by using public key cryptography. However, quantum computing represents one of the greatest threats for the finite complexity of the mathematics behind public key cryptography. In contrast, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on properties of quantum mechanics, which enables eavesdropping detection and guarantees the security of the key. Among QKD systems, polarization encoded QKD has been successfully tested in laboratory experiments and recently demonstrated in closed environments. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) -based polarization tracking and compensation that is able to keep shared secret key exchange to high rates even under large fiber stressing events. Exhaustive results using both synthetic and experimental data show remarkable performance, which can simplify the design of both quantum transmitter and receiver, as well as enable the use of aerial optical cables, thus reducing total QKD system cost.

TI Biphoton engineering using modal spatial overlap on-chip
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down -conversion are essential for optical quantum information processing, in which the quality of biphoton states is crucial for the performance. To engineer the biphoton wave func-tion (BWF) on-chip, the pump envelope function and the phase matching function are commonly adjusted, while the modal field overlap has been considered as a constant in the frequency range of interest. In this work, by using modal coupling in a system of coupled waveguides, we explore the modal field overlap as a new degree of freedom for biphoton engineering. We provide design examples for on-chip gener-ations of polarization entangled photons and heralded single photons. This strategy can be applied to waveguides of dif-ferent materials and structures, offering new possibilities for photonic quantum state engineering. (c) 2022 Optica Publish-ing Group

Hitherto, owing to the salient properties of quantum optics, quantum interference has been widely studied and provides useful tools that ultimately broaden the path towards ultra-sensitive quantum metrology, ranging from sub-shot-noise quantum sensing to high-resolution optical spectroscopy. In particular, quantum interferometric metrology is an essential requisite for extracting information about the structure and dynamics of photon-sensitive biological and chemical molecules. This article reviews the theoretical and experimental progress of this quantum interferometric metrology technology along with their advanced applications. The scope of this review includes Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry with ultrahigh timing resolution, entanglement-assisted absorption spectroscopy based on a Fourier transform, and virtual-state spectroscopy using tunable energy-time entangled photons.

TI Bilayer ion trap design for 2D arrays
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Junctions are fundamental elements that support qubit locomotion in two-dimensional ion trap arrays and enhance connectivity in emerging trapped-ion quantum computers. In surface ion traps they have typically been implemented by shaping radio frequency (RF) electrodes in a single plane to minimize the disturbance to the pseudopotential. However, this method introduces issues related to RF lead routing that can increase power dissipation and the likelihood of voltage breakdown. Here, we propose and simulate a novel two-layer junction design incorporating two perpendicularly rotoreflected (rotated, then reflected) linear ion traps. The traps are vertically separated, and create a trapping potential between their respective planes. The orthogonal orientation of the RF electrodes of each trap relative to the other provides perpendicular axes of confinement that can be used to realize transport in two dimensions. While this design introduces manufacturing and operating challenges, as now two separate structures have to be precisely positioned relative to each other in the vertical direction and optical access from the top is obscured, it obviates the need to route RF leads below the top surface of the trap and eliminates the pseudopotential bumps that occur in typical junctions. In this paper the stability of idealized ion transfer in the new configuration is demonstrated, both by solving the Mathieu equation analytically to identify the stable regions and by numerically modeling ion dynamics. Our novel junction layout has the potential to enhance the flexibility of microfabricated ion trap control to enable large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.

TI Design and Implementation of a Quantum-Assisted Digital Signature
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB We propose a new quantum-assisted digital signature (Q-DS) protocol based on the composite of truly random symmetric keys generated by quantum key distribution with secure standardized hash functions, which allows for high parameterization to provide different security levels. The protocol is demonstrated to be secure, it is implemented, and its performance is tested for several system configurations. A comparative evaluation of the results obtained for Q-DS is carried out with 6 pre-quantum and 12 post-quantum digital signature algorithms. The results show that the Q-DS overperforms during the signature generation and verification processes, while its performance is affected by the key generation process. However, using more efficient QKD devices, this process can be highly improved, making the Q-DS protocol comparable to the most efficient post-quantum solution, i.e., CRYSTALS-Dilithium.

AB Superposition of trajectories, which modify quantum evolutions by superposing paths through interferom-etry, has been utilized to enhance various quantum communication tasks. However, little is known about its impact from the viewpoint of open quantum systems. Thus we examine this subject from the perspective of system-environment interactions. We show that the superposition of multiple trajectories can result in quantum state freezing, suggesting a space-time dual to the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, nontrivial Dicke-like super(sub)radiance can be triggered without utilizing multiatom correlations.

TI An average photon number measurement scheme based on balanced homodyne
   detection
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has become an alternative technology defensing the security threat resulting from quantum computing. Owing to its superiority in coexistence with optical infrastructures and cost-effective, continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) is widely studied and developed towards the practical application stage. The standardized measurement of critical parameters of the system should be studied urgently.
   In this work we propose a scheme based on balanced homodyne detection with phase-randomized local oscillator to realize the average photon number measurement. By controlling local oscillator phase positively, which obeys [0, 2 pi] uniform distribution, a linear relationship between average photon numbers and the variance of detector output can be obtained in simulation and experiment. With high-accuracy (similar to 0.1) photons/pulse and large range similar to 23 dB, this average photon number measurement scheme provides a great reference to evaluating the critical parameters of CV-QKD system in the practical process.

TI Experimental Quantum State Measurement with Classical Shadows
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A crucial subroutine for various quantum computing and communication algorithms is to efficiently extract different classical properties of quantum states. In a notable recent theoretical work by Huang, Kueng, and Preskill [Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], a thrifty scheme showed how to project the quantum state into classical shadows and simultaneously predict M different functions of a state with only O(log2M) measurements, independent of the system size and saturating the information-theoretical limit. Here, we experimentally explore the feasibility of the scheme in the realistic scenario with a finite number of measurements and noisy operations. We prepare a four-qubit GHZ state and show how to estimate expectation values of multiple observables and Hamiltonians. We compare the measurement strategies with uniform, biased, and derandomized classical shadows to conventional ones that sequentially measure each state function exploiting either importance sampling or observable grouping. We next demonstrate the estimation of nonlinear functions using classical shadows and analyze the entanglement of the prepared quantum state. Our experiment verifies the efficacy of exploiting (derandomized) classical shadows and sheds light on efficient quantum computing with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.

TI Adaptive variational ground state preparation for spin-1 models on
   qubit-based architectures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We apply the adaptive variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE) method to prepare ground states of one-dimensional spin S = 1 models. We compare different spin-to-qubit encodings (standard binary, Gray, unary, and multiplet) with regard to the performance and quantum resource cost of the algorithm. Using state-vector simulations, we study two well-known spin-1 models: the Blume-Capel model of transverse-field Ising spins with single-ion anisotropy, and the XXZ model with single-ion anisotropy. We consider system sizes of up to 20 qubits, which corresponds to spin-1 chains up to length 10. We determine the dependence of the number of CNOT gates in the AVQITE state preparation circuit on the encoding, the initial state, and the choice of operator pool in the adaptive method. Independent of the choice of encoding, we find that the CNOT gate count scales cubically with the number of spins for the Blume-Capel model and quartically for the anisotropic XXZ model. However, the multiplet and Gray encodings present smaller prefactors in the scaling relations. These results provide useful insights for the implementation of AVQITE on quantum hardware.

AB The fast development of quantum technologies over the last decades has offered a glimpse into a future where the quantum properties of multi-particle systems might be more fully understood. In particular, quantum computing might prove crucial to explore many aspects of high-energy physics inaccessible to classical methods. In this paper, we will describe how one can use digital quantum computers to study the evolution of QCD jets in quark-gluons plasmas. We construct a quantum circuit to study single-particle evolution in a dense QCD medium. Focusing on the jet quenching parameter (q) over cap, we present some early numerical results for a small quantum circuit. Future extensions of this strategy are also addressed.

TI Compact All-Optical Quantum Sensor Device Based on Nitrogen Vacancy
   Centers in Diamond
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB An integrated magnetic sensor is designed and tested that utilizes the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy centers (NVC) in diamond as a magnetic field-sensitive quantum material, which is accessed and readout solely optically. The compact sensor device features a side length of 10 mm and includes a small HPHT diamond slab, light-emitting diode (LED) for excitation, and integrated photodiodes. A microwave-free approach is used. With the device, DC sensitivity to magnetic fields of 49 nA mT(-1) in the range of 5-50 mT is achieved. The sensor device is also capable of detecting very small magnetic fields: Magnetic field dependencies at very low flux densities in the mu T range (zero-magnetic field) show a characteristic fluorescence behavior revealing a sensitivity of 4.8 pA mu T-1. Additionally, a ray-tracing model is applied, to identify loss mechanisms in the setup. Using this device, an ultracompact, reliable, and industry-ready package is made available for sensor developments in industry and academia.

TI Quantum trajectory approach to error mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error mitigation (EM) is a collection of strategies to reduce errors on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices on which proper quantum error correction is not feasible. One of such strategies entails implementing the inverse of a known noise map of an environment by using a set of completely positive maps weighted by a quasiprobability distribution, i.e., a probability distribution with positive and negative values. This distribution is realized using classical postprocessing after final measurements of desired observables have been made. Here we make a connection with quasiprobability EM and recent results from quantum trajectory theory for open quantum systems. We show that the inverse of noise maps can be realized by performing classical postprocessing with a quasiprobability measure called the influence martingale on the quantum trajectories generated by an additional engineered reservoir coupled to the system. We demonstrate our result on a model relevant for current NISQ devices. Finally, we show the required quantum trajectories themselves can be simulated by coupling an ancillary qubit to the system. In this way, we can avoid the introduction of the engineered reservoir.

TI Open quantum systems theory of ultraweak ultraviolet photon emissions:
   Revisiting Gurwitsch's onion experiment as a prototype for quantum
   biology
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB A century ago it was discovered that metabolic processes in living cells emit a spectrum of very low intensity radiation. This was based on observations that radiant energy from proliferating cells can amplify the rate of cell division in other nearby cellular life. Although metabolic radiation is now thoroughly documented in research on ultraweak photon emissions (UPE), the original finding that UPE can enhance mitogenesis remains controversial. This controversy is addressed by establishing a physical basis for phenomenological observations that biological UPE can amplify mitogenesis in living cells. Enhanced mitosis is rationalized as a resonance effect based on open quantum systems theory using Fano and Feshbach's methods. This application of quantum theory to biology has important consequences for understanding health, medicine, and principles of living matter.

TI Stabilizer Subsystem Decompositions for Single- and Multimode
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error-correcting code encodes a finite-dimensional logical space in one or more bosonic modes, and has recently been demonstrated in trapped ions and superconducting microwave cavities. In this work we introduce a new subsystem decomposition for GKP codes that we call the stabilizer subsystem decomposition, analogous to the usual approach to quantum stabilizer codes. The decomposition has the defining property that a partial trace over the nonlogical stabilizer subsystem is equivalent to an ideal decoding of the logical state, distinguishing it from previous GKP subsystem decompositions. We describe how to decompose arbitrary states across the subsystem decomposition using a set of transformations that move between the decompositions of different GKP codes. Besides providing a convenient theoretical view on GKP codes, such a decomposition is also of practical use. We use the stabilizer subsystem decomposition to efficiently simulate noise acting on single-mode GKP codes, and in contrast to more conventional Fock basis simulations, we are able to consider essentially arbitrarily large photon numbers for realistic noise channels, such as loss and dephasing.

TI Electric and Magnetic Fields Effects in Vertically Coupled
   GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs Conical Quantum Dots
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB Vertically coupled quantum dots have emerged as promising structures for various applications such as single photon sources, entangled quantum pairs, quantum computation, and quantum cryptography. We start with a structure composed of two vertically coupled GaAs conical quantum dots surrounded by AlxGa1-x, and the effects of the applied electric and magnetic fields on the energies are evaluated using the finite element method. In addition, the effects are evaluated by including the presence of a shallow-donor impurity. The electron binding energy behavior is analyzed, and the effects on the photoionization cross-section are studied. Calculations are carried out in the effective mass and parabolic conduction band approximations. Our results show a notable dependence on the electric and magnetic fields applied to the photoionization cross-section. In general, it has been observed that both the electric and magnetic fields are useful parameters for inducing blueshifts of the resonant photoionization cross-section structure, which is accompanied by a drop in its magnitude.

TI Heart Failure Detection Using Instance Quantum Circuit Approach and
   Traditional Predictive Analysis
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The earlier prediction of heart diseases and appropriate treatment are important for preventing cardiac failure complications and reducing the mortality rate. The traditional prediction and classification approaches have resulted in a minimum rate of prediction accuracy and hence to overcome the pitfalls in existing systems, the present research is aimed to perform the prediction of heart diseases with quantum learning. When quantum learning is employed in ML (Machine Learning) and DL (Deep Learning) algorithms, complex data can be performed efficiently with less time and a higher accuracy rate. Moreover, the proposed ML and DL algorithms possess the ability to adapt to predictions with alterations in the dataset integrated with quantum computing that provides robustness in the earlier detection of chronic diseases. The Cleveland heart disease dataset is being pre-processed for the checking of missing values to avoid incorrect predictions and also for improvising the rate of accuracy. Further, SVM (Support Vector Machine), DT (Decision Tree) and RF (Random Forest) are used to perform classification. Finally, disease prediction is performed with the proposed instance-based quantum ML and DL method in which the number of qubits is computed with respect to features and optimized with instance-based learning. Additionally, a comparative assessment is provided for quantifying the differences between the standard classification algorithms with quantum-based learning in order to determine the significance of quantum-based detection in heart failure. From the results, the accuracy of the proposed system using instance-based quantum DL and instance-based quantum ML is found to be 98% and 83.6% respectively.

TI Stirring the false vacuum via interacting quantized bubbles on a
   5,564-qubit quantum annealer
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB False vacuum decay-the transition from a metastable quantum state to a true vacuum state-plays an important role in quantum field theory and non-equilibrium phenomena such as phase transitions and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative nature of false vacuum decay and the limited experimental access to this process make it challenging to study, leaving several open questions regarding how true vacuum bubbles form, move and interact. Here we observe quantized bubble formation in real time, a key feature of false vacuum decay dynamics, using a quantum annealer with 5,564 superconducting flux qubits. We develop an effective model that captures both initial bubble creation and subsequent interactions, and remains accurate under dissipation. The annealer reveals coherent scaling laws in the driven many-body dynamics for more than 1,000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work provides a method for investigating false vacuum dynamics of large quantum systems in quantum annealers.

TI A microwave scattering spectral method to detect the nanomechanical
   vibrations embedded in a superconducting qubit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nanomechanical resonators (NMRs), as the quantum mechanical sensing probers, have played the important roles for various high-precision quantum measurements. Differing from the previous emission spectral probes (i.e., the NMR modified the atomic emission), in this paper we propose an alternative approach, i.e., by probing the scattering spectra of the quantum mechanical prober coupled to the driving microwaves, to characterize the physical features of the NMR embedded in a rf-SQUID based superconducting qubit. It is shown that, from the observed specifical frequency points in the spectra, i.e., either the dips or the peaks, the vibrational features (i.e., they are classical vibration or quantum mechanical one) and the physical parameters (typically such as the vibrational frequency and displacements) of the NMR can be determined effectively. The proposal is feasible with the current technique and should be useful to design the desired NMRs for various quantum metrological applications.

TI Polarization-Enabled Tuning of Anapole Resonances in Vertically Stacked
   Elliptical Silicon Nanodisks
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB This work presents the polarization-dependent behavior of the anapole state in stacked amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanodisks with elliptical geometries. Using SiO2 as a spacer layer between the a-Si disks, the high index contrast between these materials can be used to significantly reduce the fabrication complexity of the system compared to traditional methods that require additional etching of the spacers. A novel way of continuous tuning of the electric dipole anapole excitation within elliptical stacked a-Si nanoresonators is demonstrated. By rotating the incident electric field's polarization angle, the anapole state can be selectively excited at two distinct wavelength positions separated by 80 nm. Experimental results show characteristic dips in the reflectance of the fabricated elliptical a-Si stacks with wavelength positions between 1135 and 1217 nm depending on the polarization angle of the incident field which is corroborated by FDTD simulations. Through simulating the internal electric field in the resonators and using multipole decomposition, it is shown that the reflectance dips are due to anapole excitation in the individual disks. The capability to excite anapoles at two distinct wavelengths in the same structure has promising implications for the development of tunable sensors, frequency converters, and quantum memory applications.
   This study explores the polarization-dependent behavior of anapole states in stacked elliptical amorphous silicon nanodisks separated by silicon-di-oxide spacer layers. By rotating the incident electric field's polarization angle, the anapole state can be selectively excited at two distinct wavelength positions separated by 80 nm.

TI Multi-photon multi-quantum transitions in the spin-3/2 silicon-vacancy
   centers of SiC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Silicon vacancy centers in silicon carbide are promising candidates for storing and manipulating quantum information. Implementation of fast quantum gates is an essential requirement for quantum information processing. In a low magnetic field, the resonance frequencies of silicon vacancy spins are in the range of a few MHz, the same order of magnitude as the Rabi frequencies of typical control fields. As a consequence, the rotating wave approximation becomes invalid and nonlinear processes like the absorption and emission of multiple photons become relevant. This paper focuses on multi-photon transitions of negatively charged silicon vacancies driven by a strong RF field. We present continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra measured at different RF powers to identify the 1-, 2-, and 3 RF photon transitions of different types of the silicon vacancy in the 6H-SIC polytype. Time-resolved experiments of Rabi oscillations and free induction decays of these multiple RF photon transitions were observed. Apart from zero-field data, we also present spectra in magnetic fields with different strength and orientation with respect to the system's symmetry axis.

TI Exact asymptotics of long-range quantum correlations in a
   non-equilibrium steady state
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB Out-of-equilibrium states of many-body systems tend to evade a description by standard statistical mechanics, and their uniqueness is epitomized by the possibility of certain long-range correlations that cannot occur in equilibrium. In quantum many-body systems, coherent correlations of this sort may lead to the emergence of remarkable entanglement structures. In this work, we analytically study the asymptotic scaling of quantum correlation measures-the mutual information (MI) and the fermionic negativity-within the zero-temperature steady state of voltage-biased free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice containing a non-interacting impurity. Previously, we have shown that two subsystems on opposite sides of the impurity exhibit volume-law entanglement, which is independent of the absolute distances of the subsystems from the impurity. Here, we go beyond that result and derive the exact form of the subleading logarithmic corrections to the extensive terms of correlation measures, in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. In particular, the logarithmic term of the MI asymptotics can be encapsulated in a concise formula, depending only on simple four-point ratios of subsystem length scales and on the impurity scattering probabilities at the Fermi energies. This echoes the case of equilibrium states, where such logarithmic terms may convey universal information about the physical system. To compute these exact results, we devise a hybrid method that relies on Toeplitz determinant asymptotics for correlation matrices in both real space and momentum space, successfully circumventing the inhomogeneity of the system. This method could potentially find wider use for analytical calculations of entanglement measures in similar scenarios.

TI Generating Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations for teleporting
   collective spin states in a two-dimensional trapped ion crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose the use of phonon-mediated interactions as an entanglement resource to engineer EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen correlations and to perform teleportation of collective spin states in two-dimensional ion crystals. We emulate continuous variable quantum teleportation protocols between subsystems corresponding to different nuclear spin degrees of freedom. In each of them, a quantum state is encoded in an electronic spin degree of freedom that couples to the vibrational modes of the crystal. We show that high fidelity teleportation of spin-coherent states and their phase-displaced variant, entangled spin-squeezed states, and Dicke states, is possible for realistic experimental conditions in arrays from a few tens to a few hundred ions.

TI High-bandwidth FPGA based randomized voltage states for controlling
   optoelectronic devices in QKD systems
SO ENGINEERING RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB We have developed an inexpensive system for generating random voltage states (RVS) on a FPGA platform. This system can be used for controlling optoelectronic devices in a quantum-key-distribution (QKD) system. We use an all-digital operation at the FPGA layer to generate two uncorrelated Boolean bit strings. These bit strings are converted to RVS using a multiplexer and a voltage buffer in order to drive commercially available optoelectronic devices. A National Instruments (N.I) real-time IO (RIO) platform was used for FPGA implementation. The FPGA layer was coupled to the desktop layer for real-time monitoring and logging of the Boolean bit strings. We characterize the performance of the multiplexer and the buffer and describe how their engineering performance trades-off with the fidelity of RVS generation.

TI Chirality-induced one-way quantum steering between two
   waveguide-mediated ferrimagnetic microspheres
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB One-way quantum steering is of importance for quantum technologies, such as secure quantum teleportation. In this paper, we study the generation of one-way quantum steering between two distant yttrium iron garnet (YIG) microspheres in chiral waveguide electromagnonics. We consider that the magnon mode with the Kerr nonlinearity in each YIG sphere is chirally coupled to left- and right-propagating guided photons in the waveguide. We find that quantum steering between the magnon modes is absent with nonchirality but is present merely in the form of one way (i.e., one-way steering) when the chirality occurs. The maximal achievable steering is obviously improved as the chirality degree increases. We further find that when the waveguide's outputs are subjected to continuous homodyne detection, the steering can be considerably enhanced and asymmetric steering with strong entanglement can also be achieved by tuning the chirality. Our study shows that chirality can be explored to effectively realize one-way quantum steering. Compared to other studies on achieving asymmetric steering via controlling intrinsic dissipation, e.g., cavity loss rates, our scheme merely depends on the chirality enabled via positioning the micromagnets in the waveguide and is continuously adjustable and experimentally more feasible.

TI Propagation of Gaussian vortex beams in electromagnetically induced
   transparency media
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is an important phenomenon in quantum optics, and has a wide range of applications in the fields of quantum information processing and quantum precision metrology. Recently, with the rapid progress of the generation and detection of structured light, the EIT with structured light has attracted enormous interests and offers new and novel functionalities and applications. Here, we theoretically study the propagation and evolution of Gaussian vortex beams, a typical type of structured light, in an EIT medium with A-type three-level atoms. Based on the generalized Huygens-Fresnel principle, we derive the analytical expressions of fully and partially coherent Gaussian vortex beams propagating in the EIT medium, and study the evolution of the intensity and phase distributions of the beams and their dependencies on parameters such topological charge, coherence length, Rabi frequency, etc. It is shown that both the fully and partially coherent Gaussian vortex beams undergo focusing and diverging periodically during propagation. The phase singularity of the fully coherent beam keeps unchanged, while the phase singularity of the partially coherent beam experiences splitting and recombination periodically. In addition, new phase singularities with opposite topological charge are generated in the latter case. Our results not only advance the study of the interaction between structured light and coherent media, but also pave the avenue for manipulating structured light via EIT.

TI Quantum OPTICS and deep self-learning on swarm intelligence algorithms
   for Covid-19 emergency transportation
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB In this paper, the quantum technology is exploited to empower the OPTICS unsupervised learning algorithm, which is a density-based clustering algorithm with numerous applications in the real world. We design an algorithm called Quantum Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (QOPTICS) and demonstrate that its computational complexity outperforms that of its classical counterpart. On the other hand, we propose a Deep self-learning approach for modeling the improvement of two Swarm Intelligence Algorithms, namely Artificial Orca Algorithm (AOA) and Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) in order to improve their effectiveness. The deep self-learning approach is based on two well-known dynamic mutation operators, namely Cauchy mutation operator and Gaussian mutation operator. And in order to improve the efficiency of these algorithms, they are hybridized with QOPTICS and executed on just one cluster it yields. This way, both effectiveness and efficiency are handled. To evaluate the proposed approaches, an intelligent application is developed to manage the dispatching of emergency vehicles in a large geographic region and in the context of Covid-19 crisis in order to avoid an important loss in human lives. A theoretical model is designed to describe the issue mathematically. Extensive experiments are then performed to validate the mathematical model and evaluate the performance of the proposed deep self-learning algorithms. Comparison with a state-of-the-art technique shows a significant positive impact of hybridizing Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with Deep Self Learning (DSL) on solving the Covid-19 EMS transportation.

TI First end-to-end PQC protected DPU-to-DPU communications
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB The appearance of quantum computing in the short foreseeable future and its capability to break conventional cryptographic algorithms forces to change the paradigm of secure real-time communications. Thus, government organizations, data centers, and enterprises among others are migrating their public key infrastructure towards using post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms in order to mitigate the security threats posed by quantum computers. This letter presents the first quantum resilient secure end-to-end communication link based on PQC algorithms operating between two data-processing units DPU. Both data-processing units employ on-board ARM processors to perform the computationally expensive cryptographic building blocks-in that case CRYSTALS-Kyber as a key encapsulation mechanism and CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signature scheme in combination with advanced encryption standard with 256-bit key.
   This letter presents the first post-quantum link between data processing units. It uses the quantum resilient algorithms Dilihtium and Kyber for authentication and key exchange respectively and AES-256 for encrypting application data.image

TI Quantum Secret Aggregation Utilizing a Network of Agents
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Suppose that the renowned spymaster Alice controls a network of spies who all happen to be deployed in different geographical locations. Let us further assume that all spies have managed to get their hands on a small, albeit incomplete by itself, secret, which actually is just a part of a bigger secret. In this work, we consider the following problem: given the above situation, is it possible for the spies to securely transmit all these partial secrets to the spymaster so that they can be combined together in order to reveal the big secret to Alice? We call this problem, which, to the best of our knowledge, is a novel one for the relevant literature, the quantum secret aggregation problem. We propose a protocol, in the form of a quantum game, that addresses this problem in complete generality. Our protocol relies on the use of maximally entangled GHZ tuples, shared among Alice and all her spies. It is the power of entanglement that makes possible the secure transmission of the small partial secrets from the agents to the spymaster. As an additional bonus, entanglement guarantees the security of the protocol, by making it statistically improbable for the notorious eavesdropper Eve to steal the big secret.

TI SyReC Synthesizer: An MQT tool for synthesis of reversible circuits
SO SOFTWARE IMPACTS
AB Reversible circuits form the backbone for many promising emerging technologies such as quantum computing, low power/adiabatic design, encoder/decoder devices, and several other applications. In the recent years, the scalable synthesis of such circuits has gained significant attention. In this work, we present the SyReC Synthesizer, a synthesis tool for reversible circuits based on the hardware description language SyReC. SyReC allows to describe reversible functionality at a high level of abstraction. The provided SyReC Synthesizer then realizes this functionality in a push-button fashion. Corresponding options allow for a trade-off between the number of needed circuit signals/lines (relevant, e.g., for quantum computing in which every circuit line corresponds to a qubit) and the respectively needed gates (corresponding to the circuit's costs). Furthermore, the tool allows to simulate the resulting circuit as well as to determine the gate costs of it. The SyReC Synthesizer is available as an open-source software package at https://github.com/cda-tum/syrec as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT).

TI Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption: A Case for Code-Based Alternatives
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows secure and privacy-protected computation on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it. Since Shor's algorithm rendered prime factorisation and discrete logarithm-based ciphers insecure with quantum computations, researchers have been working on building post-quantum homomorphic encryption (PQHE) algorithms. Most of the current PQHE algorithms are secured by Lattice-based problems and there have been limited attempts to build ciphers based on error-correcting code-based problems. This review presents an overview of the current approaches to building PQHE schemes and justifies code-based encryption as a novel way to diversify post-quantum algorithms. We present the mathematical underpinnings of existing code-based cryptographic frameworks and their security and efficiency guarantees. We compare lattice-based and code-based homomorphic encryption solutions identifying challenges that have inhibited the progress of code-based schemes. We finally propose five new research directions to advance post-quantum code-based homomorphic encryption.

We then further combine the protocol with the previously proposed breeding protocol by Vasconcelos et al. to relax the demands on the quality of the QED system, finding that GKP states with more than 10 dB squeezing could be achieved in near-future experiments.

TI Asymptotic Freedom at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition
   without Fine-Tuning Using a Qubit Regularization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a two-dimensional hard-core loop -gas model as a way to regularize the asymptotically free massive continuum quantum field theory that emerges at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Without fine-tuning, our model can reproduce the universal step -scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition. This is achieved by lowering the fugacity of Fock-vacuum sites in the loop -gas configuration space to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Some of the universal quantities at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition show smaller finite size effects in our model as compared to the traditional XY model. Our model is a prime example of qubit regularization of an asymptotically free massive quantum field theory in Euclidean space-time and helps understand how asymptotic freedom can arise as a relevant perturbation at a decoupled fixed point without fine-tuning.

TI Quantum Iterative Methods for Solving Differential Equations with
   Application to Computational Fluid Dynamics
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum methods are proposed for solving differential equations that are based on a gradual improvement of the solution via an iterative process, and are targeted at applications in fluid dynamics. First, the Jacobi iteration is implemented on a quantum register that utilizes a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) approach to store the trajectory information. Second, quantum methods are extended to Gauss-Seidel iterative methods. Additionally, a quantum-suitable resolvent decomposition is proposed based on the Woodbury identity. From a technical perspective, tools are developed and utilized for the block encoding of specific matrices as well as their multiplication. The approach is benchmarked on paradigmatic fluid dynamics problems. These results stress that instead of inverting large matrices, one can program quantum computers to perform multigrid-type computations and leverage corresponding advances in scientific computing.

TI Extending Learning and Collaboration in Quantum Information with
   Internet Support: A Future Perspective on Research Education beyond
   Boundaries, Limitations, and Frontiers
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Quantum information is an emerging scientific and technological discipline attracting a growing number of professionals from various related fields. Although it can potentially serve as a valuable source of skilled labor, the Internet provides a way to disseminate information about education, opportunities, and collaboration. In this work, we analyzed, through a blended approach, the sustained effort over 12 years to involve science and engineering students in research education and collaboration, emphasizing the role played by the Internet. Three main spaces have been promoted, workshops, research stays, and a minor, all successfully developed through distance education in 2021-2022, involving students from various locations in Mexico and the United States. The success of these efforts was measured by research-oriented indicators, the number of participants, and their surveyed opinions. The decisive inclusion of the Internet to facilitate the blended approach has accelerated the boost in human resources and research production. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet played a crucial role in the digital transformation of this research education initiative, leading to effective educative and collaborative experiences in the "New Normal".

TI Experimental Measurement of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators at Finite
   Temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) are a key observable in a wide range of interconnected fields including many-body physics, quantum information science, and quantum gravity. Measuring OTOCs using near-term quantum simulators will extend our ability to explore fundamental aspects of these fields and the subtle connections between them. Here, we demonstrate an experimental method to measure OTOCs at finite temperatures and use the method to study their temperature dependence. These measurements are performed on a digital quantum computer running a simulation of the transverse field Ising model. Our flexible method, based on the creation of a thermofield double state, can be extended to other models and enables us to probe the OTOC's temperature-dependent decay rate. Measuring this decay rate opens up the possibility of testing the fundamental temperature-dependent bounds on quantum information scrambling.

TI Quantum Sensing Unravels Antioxidant Efficacy Within PCL/Matrigel Skin
   Equivalents
SO SMALL
AB Skin equivalents (SE) that recapitulate biological and mechanical characteristics of the native tissue are promising platforms for assessing cosmetics and studying fundamental biological processes. Methods to achieve SEs with well-organized structure, and ideal biological and mechanical properties are limited. Here, the combination of melt electrowritten PCL scaffolds and cell-laden Matrigel to fabricate SE is described. The PCL scaffold provides ideal structural and mechanical properties, preventing deformation of the model. The model consists of a top layer for seeding keratinocytes to mimic the epidermis, and a bottom layer of Matrigel-based dermal compartment with fibroblasts. The compressive modulus and the biological properties after 3-day coculture indicate a close resemblance with the native skin. Using the SE, a testing system to study the damage caused by UVA irradiation and evaluate antioxidant efficacy is established. The effectiveness of Tea polyphenols (TPs) and L-ascorbic acid (Laa) is compared based on free radical generation. TPs are demonstrated to be more effective in downregulating free radical generation. Further, T1 relaxometry is used to detect the generation of free radicals at a single-cell level, which allows tracking of the same cell before and after UVA treatment.

TI Experimentally accessible nonseparability criteria for
   multipartite-entanglement-structure detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The description of the complex separability structure of quantum states in terms of partially ordered sets has been recently put forward. In this work, we address the question of how to efficiently determine these structures for unknown states. We propose an experimentally accessible and scalable iterative methodology that identifies, on solid statistical grounds, sufficient conditions for nonseparability with respect to certain partitions. In addition, we propose an algorithm to determine the minimal partitions (those that do not admit further splitting) consistent with the experimental observations. We test our methodology experimentally on a 20-qubit IBM quantum computer by inferring the structure of the 4-qubit Smolin and an 8-qubit W state. In the first case, our results reveal that, while the fidelity of the state is low, it nevertheless exhibits the partitioning structure expected from the theory. In the case of the W state, we obtain very disparate results in different runs on the device, which range from nonseparable states to very fragmented minimal partitions with little entanglement in the system. Furthermore, our work demonstrates the applicability of informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements for practical purposes on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Multiqudit interactions in molecular spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study photon-mediated interactions between molecular spin qudits in the dispersive regime of operation. We derive from a microscopic model the effective interaction between molecular spins, including their crystal field anisotropy (i.e., the presence of nonlinear spin terms) and their multilevel structure. Finally, we calculate the long-time dynamics for a pair of interacting molecular spins using the method of multiple-scale analysis. This allows us to find a set of two-qudit gates that can be realized for a specific choice of molecular spins and to determine the time required for their implementation. Our results are relevant for the implementation of logical gates in general systems of qudits with unequally spaced levels or to determine an adequate computational subspace to encode and process the information.

TI Path integral quantum algorithm for simulating non-Markovian quantum
   dynamics in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Research in open quantum system dynamics has received growing interest in recent years, and its ongoing investigation has uncovered many intriguing physics departing from closed systems. A particularly useful application of the open quantum system theory is to simulate quantum dynamical processes in condensed phase materials. As the quantum degree of freedom is constantly under the influence of its thermal environment, the accurate description of the dynamics often requires non-Markovian time evolution at finite temperature. Such calculation is usually quite challenging on classical computers as extensive memory storage is required. In this work, we focus on a quantum system linearly coupled to its harmonic bath and present a path integral based quantum algorithm that time -evolves the reduced density matrix under finite temperature non-Markovian dynamics. To treat the nonunitary time evolution, the Sz.-Nagy dilation scheme is used for the conversion to unitary dynamics that can be implementable on gate -based quantum computers. The modified Hadamard test is then used to retrieve all the information of the reduced density matrix. Complexity analysis shows that the memory requirement has exponential reduction on the quantum machine whereas the runtime complexity stays roughly the same as for the classical computer. It points to the possibility of using this algorithm to simulate multilevel and multisite non-Markovian quantum dynamics that are beyond the reach of classical computers. The algorithm makes no ad hoc assumptions and extends naturally beyond Markovian and weak coupling regimes. We validated the algorithm on the quantum simulator with the spin -boson model and demonstrated its excellent agreement with the classical computer benchmark.

Computing the Q-score entails solving the Max-Cut problem for increasingly large graphs. This work presents the first computation of the Q-score on a quantum device and shows how these quantum devices compare to classical devices at solving optimisation problems. We use D-Wave's standard methods out of the box with a time limit of 60 seconds. The Q-score for D-Wave's 2000Q and Advantage devices are 70 and 140, respectively. The Q-score for two of D-Wave's classical algorithms, based on tabu search and simulated annealing respectively, are 2,300 and 5,800. Finally, we report the out-of-the-box hybrid approach to have a Q-score of 12,500.

TI Dynamic Cooling on Contemporary Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the problem of dynamic cooling whereby a target qubit is cooled at the expense of heating up N - 1 further identical qubits by means of a global unitary operation. A standard back-of-the-envelope high-temperature estimate establishes that the target qubit temperature can be dynamically cooled by at most a factor of 1/./N. Here we provide the exact expression for the minimum temperature to which the target qubit can be cooled and reveal that there is a crossover from the high initial temperature regime, where the scaling is 1/./N, to a low initial temperature regime, where a much faster scaling of 1/N occurs. This slow, 1/./N scaling, which was relevant for early high-temperature NMR quantum computers, is the reason dynamic cooling was dismissed as ineffectual around 20 years ago; the fact that current low-temperature quantum computers fall in the fast, 1/N scaling regime, reinstates the appeal of dynamic cooling today. We further show that the associated work cost of cooling is exponentially more advantageous in the low-temperature regime. We discuss the implementation of dynamic cooling in terms of quantum circuits and examine the effects of hardware noise. We successfully demonstrate dynamic cooling in a three-qubit system on a real quantum processor. Since the circuit size grows quickly with N, scaling dynamic cooling to larger systems on noisy devices poses a challenge. We therefore propose a suboptimal cooling algorithm, whereby relinquishing a small amount of cooling capability results in a drastically reduced circuit complexity, greatly facilitating the implementation of dynamic cooling on near-future quantum computers.

TI Ising Models for Solving the N-Queens Puzzle Based on the Domain-Wall
   Vectors
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB An Ising model is a mathematical model defined by an objective function comprising a quadratic formula of multiple spin variables, each taking values of either -1$$ -1 $$ or +1$$ +1 $$. The task of determining a spin value assignment to these variables that minimizes the resulting value of an Ising model is a challenging optimization problem. Recently, quantum annealers, consisting of qubit cells interconnected according to principles of quantum mechanics, have emerged as a solution for tackling such problems. Ising models characterized by fewer quadratic terms are preferable as they reduce the resource requirements of quantum annealers. Additionally, it is advantageous for the absolute values of coefficients associated with linear and quadratic terms to be small to facilitate the discovery of good solutions, given the inherent limitations in the resolution of quantum annealers. The primary contribution of this article lies in presenting Ising models tailored for solving the n$$ n $$-Queens puzzle. The conventional Ising model for this puzzle involves 53n3-2n2+n3$$ \frac{5}{3}{n}<^>3-2{n}<^>2+\frac{n}{3} $$ quadratic terms, with the maximum absolute value of coefficients being 4n+(nmod2)-7$$ 4n+\left(n\kern0.2em \operatorname{mod}\kern0.2em 2\right)-7 $$. Our novel Ising model significantly reduces the number of quadratic terms to only 12n2-24n+12$$ 12{n}<^>2-24n+12 $$, with a maximum absolute coefficient of 6. Furthermore, we provide embedding results for a quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage utilizing a Pegasus graph P(16)$$ P(16) $$. We succeeded in embedding our novel Ising model for up to the 21-Queens puzzle, while the conventional Ising model can be embedded only for up to the 14-Queens puzzle.

TI Quantum optical communication in the presence of strong attenuation
   noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Is quantum communication possible over an optical fiber with transmissivity lambda <= 1/2? The answer is well known to be negative if the environment with which the incoming signal interacts is initialized in a thermal state. However, Lami et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 110504 (2020)] found the quantum capacity to be always bounded away from zero for all lambda > 0, a phenomenon dubbed "die-hard quantum communication" (D-HQCOM), provided that the initial environment state can be chosen appropriately, depending on lambda. Here we show an even stronger version of D-HQCOM in the context of entanglement-assisted classical communication: entanglement assistance and control of the environment enable communication with performance at least equal to that of the ideal case of absence of noise, even if lambda > 0 is arbitrarily small. These two phenomena of D-HQCOM have technological potential provided that we are able to control the environment. How can we achieve this? Our second main result answers this question. Here we provide a fully consistent protocol to activate the phenomena of D-HQCOM without directly accessing the environment state. This is done by sending over the channel "trigger signals," i.e., signals which do not encode information, prior to the actual communication, with the goal of modifying the environment in an advantageous way. This is possible due to the memory effects which arise when the sender feeds signals separated by a sufficiently short temporal interval. Our results may offer a concrete scheme to communicate across arbitrarily long optical fibers, without using quantum repeaters. As a by-product of our analysis, we derive a simple Kraus representation of the thermal attenuator exploiting the associated Lindblad master equation.

TI Quantum electrodynamics of non-demolition detection of single microwave
   photon by superconducting qubit array
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB By consistently applying the formalism of quantum electrodynamics, we developed a comprehensive theoretical framework describing the interaction of single microwave photons with an array of superconducting transmon qubits in a waveguide cavity resonator. In particular, we analyze the effects of microwave photons on the array's response to a weak probe signal exciting the resonator. The study reveals that high quality factor cavities provide a better spectral resolution of the response, while cavities with moderate quality factors allow better sensitivity for a single-photon detection. Remarkably, our analysis showed that a single-photon signal can be detected by even a sole qubit in a cavity under the realistic range of system parameters. We also discuss how the quantum properties of the microwave radiation and electrodynamical properties of resonators affect the response of qubits' array. Our results provide an efficient theoretical background for informing the development and design of quantum devices consisting of arrays of qubits, especially for those using a cavity where an explicit expression for the transmission or reflection is required.

SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information science and technology provide contemporary contexts for teaching and learning foundational principles of quantum physics by accessing them via two-state systems. In this study, a teaching approach based on a Spin First approach is developed for introducing quantum physics at lower secondary level in a qualitative way. The teaching approach follows research-based design principles. It introduces electron spin as an exemplary two-state system and embeds basic concepts of quantum physics related to the context of quantum computing. To examine the feasibility and suitability of this teaching approach in principle and to formatively evaluate the content structure, semi-structured individual interviews with alternating intervention and survey phases ("Teaching Experiments") were conducted with N=11\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$N=11$\end{document} grade 9 students. Learning outcomes were assessed based on an evaluative qualitative content analysis, and further general assessments regarding learning difficulties, prior knowledge and student assessment could be derived based on the interviews. The results of this evaluation reveal the approach to appear suitable for the addressed target group. Students seem to qualitatively understand foundational principles of quantum physics, and no significant mixing of classical and quantum physical principles is observed. Nevertheless, evidence of potential learning difficulties becomes apparent (e.g., adequate use of language and verbal reasoning, unreflective reasoning based on hidden variables, inert knowledge and lacks of prior knowledge), which in turn results in amendments to the teaching approach and supports the further development of ready-to-use teaching materials and the preparation of an extensive field study in the future.

TI Mapping the metal-insulator phase diagram by algebraically
   fast-forwarding dynamics on a cloud quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) maps the local Green's function of the Hubbard model to that of the Anderson impurity model and thus gives an approximate solution of the Hubbard model from the solution of a simpler quantum impurity model. Accurate solutions to the Anderson impurity model nonetheless become intractable for large systems. Quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to effi-ciently solve impurity models by preparing and evolving the ground state under the impurity Hamiltonian on a quantum computer that is assumed to have the scalability and accuracy far beyond the current state-of-the-art quantum hardware. As a proof of principle demonstration targeting the Anderson impurity model we, for the first time, close the DMFT loop with current noisy hardware. With a highly optimized fast-forwarding quantum circuit and a noise-resilient spectral analysis we observe both the metallic and Mott-insulating phases. Based on a Cartan decomposition, our algorithm gives a fixed depth, fast-forwarding, quantum circuit that can evolve the initial state over arbitrarily long times without time-discretization errors typical of other product decomposition formulas such as Trotter decomposition. By exploiting the structure of the fast-forwarding circuits we reduce the gate count (to 77 CNOTs after optimization), simulate the dynamics, and extract frequencies from the Anderson impurity model on noisy quantum hardware. We then demonstrate the Mott transition by mapping both phases of the metal-insulator phase diagram. Near the Mott phase transition, our method maintains accuracy where the Trotter error would otherwise dominate due to the long-time evolution required to resolve quasiparticle resonance frequency extremely close to zero. This work presents the first computation on both sides of the Mott phase transition using noisy digital quantum hardware, made viable by a highly optimized computation in terms of gate depth, simulation error, and runtime on quantum hardware. To inform future computations we analyze the accuracy of our method versus a noisy Trotter evolution in the time domain. Both algebraic circuit decompositions and error mitigation techniques adopted could be applied in an attempt to solve other correlated electronic phenomena beyond DMFT on noisy quantum computers.

TI Entangled Photon Pair Source Demonstrator Using the Quantum
   Instrumentation Control Kit System
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB We report the first demonstration of using the Quantum Instrumentation and Control Kit (QICK) system on RFSoC-FPGA technology to drive the electro-optic intensity modulator that generate time-bin entangled photon pairs and to detect the photon signals. With the QICK system, we achieve high levels of performance metrics including coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 150, and entanglement visibility exceeding 95%, consistent with performance metrics achieved using conventional waveform generators. We also demonstrate simultaneous detector readout using the digitization functional of QICK, achieving internal system synchronization time resolution of 3.2 ps. The work reported in this paper represents an explicit demonstration of the feasibility for replacing commercial waveform generators and time taggers with RFSoC-FPGA technology in the operation of a quantum network, representing a cost reduction of more than an order of magnitude.

TI Incentivizing Demand-Side Response Through Discount Scheduling Using
   Hybrid Quantum Optimization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Demand-side response (DSR) is a strategy that enables consumers to actively participate in managing electricity demand. It aims to alleviate strain on the grid during high demand and promote a more balanced and efficient use of (renewable) electricity resources. We implement DSR through discount scheduling, which involves offering discrete price incentives to consumers to adjust their electricity consumption patterns to times when their local energy mix consists of more renewable energy. Since we tailor the discounts to individual customers' consumption, the discount scheduling problem (DSP) becomes a large combinatorial optimization task. Consequently, we adopt a hybrid quantum computing approach, using D-Wave's Leap Hybrid Cloud. We benchmark Leap against Gurobi, a classical mixed-integer optimizer, in terms of solution quality at fixed runtime and fairness in terms of discount allocation. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale decomposition algorithm/heuristic for the DSP, applied with either quantum or classical computers running the subroutines, which significantly reduces the problem size while maintaining solution quality. Using synthetic data generated from real-world data, we observe that the classical decomposition method obtains the best overall solution quality for problem sizes up to 3200 consumers; however, the hybrid quantum approach provides more evenly distributed discounts across consumers.

TI Generating k EPR-pairs from an n-party resource state
SO QUANTUM
AB Motivated by quantum network applications over classical channels, we initiate the study of n -party resource states from which LOCC protocols can create EPRpairs between any k disjoint pairs of parties. We give constructions of such states where k is not too far from the optimal n/2 while the individual parties need to hold only a constant number of qubits. In the special case when each party holds only one qubit, we describe a family of n-qubit states with k proportional to log n based on Reed -Muller codes, as well as small numerically found examples for k = 2 and k = 3. We also prove some lower bounds, for example showing that if k = n/2 then the parties must have at least ohm(log log n) qubits each.

TI Cryogenic Floating-Gate CMOS Circuits for Quantum Control
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Voltage biases are often required to bias Qubits, and yet applying a static bias requires separate chip wires, dramatically increasing the system complexity. An ideal approach would be having a nonvolatile digital or analog memory to avoid these issues. This article shows floating-gate (FG) structures could be used to set and forget potentials and tunnel barrier tuning as well as enable memory applications. It reports FG measurements at cryogenic temperatures (T = 4 K), enabling reprogrammable FG devices in cryogenic environments. Using a multipurpose FG test structure, measurements show the FG device and circuit operation as well as charge programming measurements based on electron tunneling and hot-electron injection at T = 4 K and T = 300 K. These results open applications in classical cryogenic computing, controlling quantum computation, and other cryogenic temperature applications.

TI Improving adiabatic quantum factorization via chopped random-basis
   optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Integer factorization remains a significant challenge for classical computers and is fundamental to the security of RSA encryption. Adiabatic quantum algorithms present a promising solution, yet their practical implementation is limited by the short coherence times of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and quantum simulators. In this work, we apply the chopped random-basis (CRAB) optimization technique to enhance adiabatic quantum factorization algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAB by applying it to factor the integers ranging from 21 to 2479, achieving significantly improved fidelity of the target state when the evolution time exceeds the quantum speed limit. Notably, this performance improvement shows resilience in the presence of dephasing noise, highlighting CRAB's practical utility in noisy quantum systems. Our findings suggest that CRAB optimization can serve as a powerful tool for advancing adiabatic quantum algorithms, with broader implications for quantum information processing tasks.

TI Mitigating the effect of atmospheric turbulence on orbital angular
   momentum-based quantum key distribution using real-time adaptive optics
   with phase unwrapping
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) employed orbital angular momentum (OAM) for high-dimensional encoding enhances the system security and information capacity between two communication parties. However, such advantages are significantly degraded because of the fragility of OAM states in atmospheric turbulence. Unlike previous researches, we first investigate the performance degradation of OAM-based QKD by infinitely long phase screen (ILPS), which offers a feasible way to study how adaptive optics (AO) dynamically corrects the turbulence-induced aberrations in real time. Secondly, considering the failure of AO while encountering phase cuts, we evaluate the quality enhancement of OAM-based QKD under a moderate turbulence strength by AO after implementing the wrapped cuts elimination. Finally, we simulate that, with more realistic considerations; real-time AO can still mitigate the impact of atmospheric turbulence on OAM-based QKD even in the large wind velocity regime.

TI High-purity single-photon generation based on cavity QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity QED. This scheme employs an atom as a four-level system and the structure allows the suppression of the reexcitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the reexcitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of a driving laser between two excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.

TI Quantum unitary matrix representation of the lattice Boltzmann model for
   low Reynolds fluid flow simulation
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We propose a quantum algorithm for the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to simulate fluid flows in the low Reynolds number regime. First, we encode the particle distribution functions (PDFs) as probability amplitudes of the quantum state and demonstrate the need to control the state of the ancilla qubit during the initial state preparation. Second, we express the LB algorithm as a matrix-vector product by neglecting the quadratic non-linearity in the equilibrium distribution function, wherein the vector represents the PDFs, and the matrix represents the collision and streaming operators. Third, we employ classical singular value decomposition to decompose the non-unitary collision and streaming operators into a product of unitary matrices. Finally, we show the importance of having a Hadamard gate between the collision and the streaming operations. Our approach has been tested on linear/linearized flow problems such as the advection-diffusion of a Gaussian hill, Poiseuille flow, Couette flow, and lid-driven cavity problems. We provide counts for two-qubit controlled-NOT and single-qubit U gates for test cases involving 9-12 qubits with grid sizes ranging from 24 to 216 points. While the gate count aligns closely with theoretical limits, the high number of two-qubit gates on the order of 107 necessitates careful attention to circuit synthesis.

AB Quantum light sources using single-walled carbon nanotubes show promise for quantum technologies but face challenges in achieving precise control over color center formation. Here, we present a novel technique for deterministic creation of single organic color centers in carbon nanotubes using in situ photochemical reaction. By monitoring discrete intensity changes in photoluminescence spectra, we achieve precise control over the formation of individual color centers. Furthermore, our method allows for position-controlled formation of color centers as validated through photoluminescence imaging. We also demonstrate photon antibunching from a color center, confirming the quantum nature of the defects formed. This technique represents a significant step forward in the precise engineering of atomically defined quantum emitters in carbon nanotubes, facilitating their integration into advanced quantum photonic devices and systems.

TI Ground-State Energy Estimation on Current Quantum Hardware through the
   Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Practical Study
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We investigate the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for estimating the ground-state energy of the BeH2 molecule, emphasizing practical implementation and performance on current quantum hardware. Our research presents a comparative study of HEA and UCCSD ansatze on noiseless and noisy simulations and implements VQE on recent IBM quantum computer noise models and a real quantum computer, IBM Fez, providing a fully functional code employing Qiskit 1.2. Our experiments confirm UCCSD's reliability in ideal conditions, while the HEA demonstrates greater robustness to hardware noise, achieving chemical accuracy on state-vector simulation (SVS). The results reveal that achieving ground-state energy within chemical accuracy is feasible without error mitigation during VQE convergence. We demonstrate that current quantum devices effectively optimize circuit parameters despite misestimating simulated energies. The SVS-evaluated energies provide a more accurate representation of the solution quality compared to QPU-estimated energy values, indicating that VQE converges to the correct ground state despite quantum noise. Our study also applies noise mitigation as a postprocessing technique, using zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) on a real quantum computer. The detailed methodologies presented in this study, including Hamiltonian construction and Fermionic-to-qubit transformations, facilitate flexible adaptation of the VQE approach for various algorithm variants and across different levels of algorithmic implementation.

TI Donor-acceptor pairs in wide-bandgap semiconductors for quantum
   technology applications
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB We propose a quantum science platform utilizing the dipole-dipole coupling between donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide bandgap semiconductors to realize optically controllable, long-range interactions between defects in the solid state. We carry out calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure and interactions of DAPs formed by various substitutional point-defects in diamond and silicon carbide (SiC). We determine the most stable charge states and evaluate zero phonon lines using constrained DFT and compare our results with those of simple donor-acceptor pair (DAP) models. We show that polarization differences between ground and excited states lead to unusually large electric dipole moments for several DAPs in diamond and SiC. We predict photoluminescence spectra for selected substitutional atoms and show that while B-N pairs in diamond are challenging to control due to their large electron-phonon coupling, DAPs in SiC, especially Al-N pairs, are suitable candidates to realize long-range optically controllable interactions.

TI Differential Phase Shift Quantum Secret Sharing Using a Twin Field with
   Asymmetric Source Intensities
SO ENTROPY
AB As an essential application of quantum mechanics in classical cryptography, quantum secret sharing has become an indispensable component of quantum internet. Recently, a differential phase shift quantum secret sharing protocol using a twin field has been proposed to break the linear rate-distance boundary. However, this original protocol has a poor performance over channels with asymmetric transmittances. To make it more practical, we present a differential phase shift quantum secret sharing protocol with asymmetric source intensities and give the security proof of our protocol against individual attacks. Taking finite-key effects into account, our asymmetric protocol can theoretically obtain the key rate two orders of magnitude higher than that of the original protocol when the difference in length between Alice's channel and Bob's is fixed at 14 km. Moreover, our protocol can provide a high key rate even when the difference is quite large and has great robustness against finite-key effects. Therefore, our work is meaningful for the real-life applications of quantum secret sharing.

TI Natural quantum reservoir computing for temporal information processing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Reservoir computing is a temporal information processing system that exploits artificial or physical dissipative dynamics to learn a dynamical system and generate the target time-series. This paper proposes the use of real superconducting quantum computing devices as the reservoir, where the dissipative property is served by the natural noise added to the quantum bits. The performance of this natural quantum reservoir is demonstrated in a benchmark time-series regression problem and a practical problem classifying different objects based on temporal sensor data. In both cases the proposed reservoir computer shows a higher performance than a linear regression or classification model. The results indicate that a noisy quantum device potentially functions as a reservoir computer, and notably, the quantum noise, which is undesirable in the conventional quantum computation, can be used as a rich computation resource.

   Entanglement, and Q-Bits
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB By utilizing a generalized version of the Madelung quantum hydrodynamic framework that incorporates noise, we derive a solution using the path integral method to investigate how a quantum superposition of states evolves over time. This exploration seeks to comprehend the process through which a stable quantum state emerges when fluctuations induced by the noisy gravitational background are present. The model defines the conditions that give rise to a limited range of interactions for the quantum potential, allowing for the existence of coarse-grained classical descriptions at a macroscopic level. The theory uncovers the smallest attainable level of uncertainty in an open quantum system and examines its consistency with the localized behavior observed in large-scale classical systems. The research delves into connections and similarities alongside other theories such as decoherence and the Copenhagen foundation of quantum mechanics. Additionally, it assesses the potential consequences of wave function decay on the measurement of photon entanglement. To validate the proposed theory, an experiment involving entangled photons transmitted between detectors on the moon and Mars is discussed. Finally, the findings of the theory are applied to the creation of larger Q-bit systems at room temperatures.

The coupling strength between the spins of the rare-earth ions and the microwave photons is characterized by the cooperativity. Here, we report an ultrahigh cooperativity of C -650 between rare-earth spins and a planar superconducting microwave resonator that features a highly uniform magnetic field for harnessing the strong anisotropic coupling strength of erbium-doped yttrium orthosilicate. This cooperativity rivals that from a bulk dielectric resonator and may pave a path for efficient coupling of spins with microwave photons on an integrated platform.

TI Motion-insensitive time-optimal control of optical qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We derive new, fundamental insights into the dynamics of an optical qubit, revealing how this is influenced by the motion of the trapped particle. Leveraging these new insights, we show that photon-recoil heating can be suppressed at relatively high Rabi frequencies by modulating the phase of the driving laser field in time. This technique enables single-qubit gates that are up to 20 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining the same fidelity. Remarkably, even when photon recoil is eliminated (i.e. when occupation of Fock states is preserved), we find that the gate infidelity does not vanish, but is rather limited by a fundamental mechanism, which we identify as thermal motion-induced entanglement. To overcome this limitation and the effect of recoil, we derive motion-insensitive control pulses that enable the execution of fast, very high-fidelity gates with optical qubits.

TI Multi-site integrated optical addressing of trapped ions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB One of the most effective ways to advance the performance of quantum computers and quantum sensors is to increase the number of qubits or quantum resources in the system. A major technical challenge that must be solved to realize this goal for trapped-ion systems is scaling the delivery of optical signals to many individual ions. In this paper we demonstrate an approach employing waveguides and multi-mode interferometer splitters to optically address multiple 171Yb+ ions in a surface trap by delivering all wavelengths required for full qubit control. Measurements of hyperfine spectra and Rabi flopping were performed on the E2 clock transition, using integrated waveguides for delivering the light needed for Doppler cooling, state preparation, coherent operations, and detection. We describe the use of splitters to address multiple ions using a single optical input per wavelength and use them to demonstrate simultaneous Rabi flopping on two different transitions occurring at distinct trap sites. This work represents an important step towards the realization of scalable integrated photonics for atomic clocks and trapped-ion quantum information systems.
   A promising strategy for scaling trapped-ion-based quantum technologies is to use fully integrated optical waveguides to deliver light to numerous ions at multiple sites. Here, the authors. optically address three ions using on-chip waveguides to deliver three distinct wavelengths per ion, and perform Rabi flopping on each ion simultaneously.

TI Recapture probability for antitrapped Rydberg states in optical tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In a neutral-atom quantum computer, the qubits are individual neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers. Excitations to Rydberg states form the basis for the entanglement procedure that is at the basis of multiqubit quantum gates. However, these Rydberg atoms are often antitrapped, leading to decoherence and atom loss. In this work, we give a quantum-mechanical description of the antitrapping loss rates and determine the recapture probability after Rydberg excitation, distinguishing between having the laser traps turned on and off. We find that ample time (approximate to 30 mu s, in a Sr-88 system) is needed for the wave functions to expand out of the trap. Therefore, even with traps on, approximate to 100% recapture probabilities can be expected for times in which significant entanglement operations between atoms can be performed. We find that for two-dimensional radial traps with bosonic Sr-88 atoms, the time in which perfect recapture can be achieved is of the same order of magnitude for traps turned on and off.

TI Sparse Probabilistic Synthesis of Quantum Operations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Successful implementations of quantum technologies require protocols and algorithms that use as few quantum resources as possible. However, many important quantum operations, such as continuous rotation gates in quantum computing or broadband pulses in NMR or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications, can only be implemented approximately using finite quantum resources. This work develops an approach that, on average-at the cost of a modestly increased measurement repetition rate-enables exact implementations. One proceeds by first building a library of a large number of different approximations to the desired gate operation; by randomly selecting these operations according to a preoptimized probability distribution, one can on average implement the desired operation with a rigorously controllable approximation error. The approach relies on sophisticated tools from convex optimization to efficiently find optimal probability distributions. A diverse spectrum of applications are demonstrated as (a) exactly synthesizing rotations in fault-tolerant quantum computers using only low T-count circuits and (b) synthesizing broadband and band-selective pulses of superior performance in quantum optimal control with (c) further applications in NMR or MRI. The approach is very general and a broad spectrum of practical applications in quantum technologies are explicitly demonstrated.

TI Security of Neural Network-Based Key Agreement Protocol for Smart Grids
SO ENERGIES
AB Recent developments in quantum computing pose a significant threat to the asymmetric cryptography currently in use. Neural cryptography offers a potential alternative that is resistant to attacks of known quantum computer algorithms. The considered solution is lightweight and computationally efficient. If a quantum computer algorithm were successfully implemented, it could expose IoT sensors and smart grid components to a wide range of attack vectors. Given the lightweight nature of neural cryptography and the potential risks, neural cryptography could have potential applications in both IoT sensors and smart grid systems. This paper evaluates one of the suggested enhancements: the use of integer-valued input vectors that accelerate the synchronization of the Tree Parity Machine. This enhancement introduces a new parameter M that indicates the minimum and maximum values of input vector elements. This study evaluates the nonbinary version of the mutual learning algorithm in a simulated insecure environment. The results indicate that, while the Nonbinary Tree Parity Machine may involve some trade-offs between security and synchronization time, the speed improvement is more substantial than the decrease in security. The impact of this enhancement is particularly significant for smaller adjustments to parameter M.

TI RadicalPy: A Tool for Spin Dynamics Simulations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Radical pairs (electron-hole pairs, polaron pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and exploited in all areas of science, from the hard realm of physics in the form of organic semiconductors, spintronics, quantum computing, and solar cells to the soft domain of chemistry and biology under the guise of chemical reactions in solution, biomimetic systems, and quantum biology. Quantitative analysis of radical pair phenomena has historically been successful by a few select groups. With this in mind, we present an intuitive open-source framework in the Python programming language that provides classical, semiclassical, and quantum simulation methodologies. A radical pair kinetic rate equation solver, Monte Carlo-based spin dephasing rate estimations, and molecule database functionalities are implemented. We introduce the kine-quantum method, a new approach that amalgamates classical rate equations, semiclassical, and quantum techniques. This method resolves the prohibitively large memory requirement issues of quantum approaches while achieving higher accuracy, and it also offers wavelength-resolved simulations, producing time- and wavelength-resolved magnetic field effect simulations. Model examples illustrate the versatility and ease of use of the software, including the new approach applied to the magnetosensitive absorption and fluorescence of flavin adenine dinucleotide photochemistry, spin-spin interaction estimation from molecular dynamics simulations on radical pairs inside reverse micelles, radical pair anisotropy inside proteins, and triplet exciton pairs in anthracene crystals. The intuitive interface also allows this software to be used as a teaching or learning aid for those interested in the field of spin chemistry. Furthermore, the software aims to be modular and extensible, with the aim to standardize how spin dynamics simulations are performed.

TI Computing marginal and conditional divergences between decomposable
   models with applications in quantum computing and earth observation
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The ability to compute the exact divergence between two high-dimensional distributions is useful in many applications, but doing so naively is intractable. Computing the alpha beta-divergence-a family of divergences that includes the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hellinger distance-between the joint distribution of two decomposable models, i.e., chordal Markov networks, can be done in time exponential in the treewidth of these models. Extending this result, we propose an approach to compute the exact alpha beta-divergence between any marginal or conditional distribution of two decomposable models. In order to do so tractably, we provide a decomposition over the marginal and conditional distributions of decomposable models. We then show how our method can be used to analyze distributional changes by first applying it to the benchmark image dataset QMNIST and a dataset containing observations from various areas at the Roosevelt Nation Forest and their cover type. Finally, based on our framework, we propose a novel way to quantify the error in contemporary superconducting quantum computers.

TI Experimenting with D-Wave quantum annealers on prime factorization
   problems
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB This paper builds on top of a paper we have published very recently, in which we have proposed a novel approach to prime factorization (PF) by quantum annealing, where 8, 219, 999 = 32, 749 x 251 was the highest prime product we were able to factorize-which, to the best of our knowledge is the largest number which was ever factorized by means of a quantum device. The series of annealing experiments which led us to these results, however, did not follow a straight-line path; rather, they involved a convoluted trial-and-error process, full of failed or partially-failed attempts and backtracks, which only in the end drove us to find the successful annealing strategies. In this paper, we delve into the reasoning behind our experimental decisions and provide an account of some of the attempts we have taken before conceiving the final strategies that allowed us to achieve the results. This involves also a bunch of ideas, techniques, and strategies we investigated which, although turned out to be inferior wrt. those we adopted in the end, may instead provide insights to a more-specialized audience of D-Wave users and practitioners. In particular, we show the following insights: (i) different initialization techniques affect performances, among which flux biases are effective when targeting locally-structured embeddings; (ii) chain strengths have a lower impact in locally-structured embeddings compared to problem relying on global embeddings; (iii) there is a trade-off between broken chain and excited CFAs, suggesting an incremental annealing offset remedy approach based on the modules instead of single qubits. Thus, by sharing the details of our experiences, we aim to provide insights into the evolving landscape of quantum annealing, and help people access and effectively use D-Wave quantum annealers.

TI Multidimensional Entanglement Generation with Multicore Optical Fibers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Trends in photonic quantum information follow closely the technical progress in classical optics and telecommunications. In this regard, advances in multiplexing optical communications channels have also been pursued for the generation of multidimensional quantum states (qudits), since their use is advantageous for several quantum information tasks. One current path leading in this direction is through the use of space-division multiplexing multicore optical fibers, which provides a platform for efficiently controlling path-encoded qudit states. Here, we report on a parametric down-conversion source of entangled qudits that is fully based on (and therefore compatible with) state-of-the-art multicore-fiber technology. The source design uses modern multicore-fiber beam splitters to prepare the pump-laser beam as well as measure the generated entangled state, achieving high spectral brightness while providing a stable architecture. In addition, it can be readily used with any core geometry, which is crucial since widespread standards for multicore fibers in telecommunications have yet to be established. Our source represents a step toward the compatibility of quantum communications with the next-generation optical networks.

TI Retrieval of exudate-affected retinal image patches using Siamese
   quantum classical neural network
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Deep neural networks were previously used in the arena of image retrieval. Siamese network architecture is also used for image similarity comparison. Recently, the application of quantum computing in different fields has gained research interest. Researchers are keen to explore the prospect of quantum circuit implementation in terms of supervised learning, resource utilization, and energy-efficient reversible computing. In this study, the authors propose an application of quantum circuit in Siamese architecture and explored its efficiency in the field of exudate-affected retinal image patch retrieval. Quantum computing applied within Siamese network architecture may be effective for image patch characteristic comparison and retrieval work. Although there is a restriction of managing high-dimensional inner product space, the circuit with a limited number of qubits represents exudate-affected retinal image patches and retrieves similar patches from the patch database. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is implemented using a quantum machine learning library on Google Cirq framework. PQC model is composed of classical pre/post-processing and parameterized quantum circuit. System efficiency is evaluated with the most widely used retrieval evaluation metrics: mean average precision (MAP) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). The system achieved an encouraging and promising result of 98.1336% MAP and 100% MRR. Image pixels are implicitly converted to rectangular grid qubits in this experiment. The experimentation was further extended to IBM Qiskit framework also. In Qiskit, individual pixels are explicitly encoded using novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR) image encoding algorithm. The probability distributions of both query and database patches are compared through Jeffreys distance to retrieve similar patches.

TI Stable Many-Body Resonances in Open Quantum Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Periodically driven quantum many-body systems exhibit novel nonequilibrium states, such as prethermalization, discrete time crystals, and many-body localization. Recently, the general mechanism of fractional resonances has been proposed that leads to slowing the many-body dynamics in systems with both U(1) and parity symmetry. Here, we show that fractional resonance is stable under local noise models. To corroborate our finding, we numerically study the dynamics of a small-scale Bose-Hubbard model that can readily be implemented in existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our findings suggest a possible pathway toward a stable nonequilibrium state of matter, with potential applications of quantum memories for quantum information processing.

TI Roadmap on quantum nanotechnologies
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum phenomena are typically observable at length and time scales smaller than those of our everyday experience, often involving individual particles or excitations. The past few decades have seen a revolution in the ability to structure matter at the nanoscale, and experiments at the single particle level have become commonplace. This has opened wide new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum mechanical effects in condensed matter. These quantum phenomena, in turn, have the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate, compute and probe the nanoscale world. Here, we review developments in key areas of quantum research in light of the nanotechnologies that enable them, with a view to what the future holds. Materials and devices with nanoscale features are used for quantum metrology and sensing, as building blocks for quantum computing, and as sources and detectors for quantum communication. They enable explorations of quantum behaviour and unconventional states in nano- and opto-mechanical systems, low-dimensional systems, molecular devices, nano-plasmonics, quantum electrodynamics, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and more. This rapidly expanding intersection of nanotechnology and quantum science/technology is mutually beneficial to both fields, laying claim to some of the most exciting scientific leaps of the last decade, with more on the horizon.

TI Parametric Multielement Coupling Architecture for Coherent and
   Dissipative Control of Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB As systems for quantum computing keep growing in size and number of qubits, challenges in scaling the control capabilities are becoming increasingly relevant. Efficient schemes to simultaneously mediate coherent interactions between multiple quantum systems and to reduce decoherence errors can minimize the control overhead in next-generation quantum processors. Here, we present a superconducting qubit architecture based on tunable parametric interactions to perform two-qubit gates, reset, leakage recovery, and to read out the qubits. In this architecture, parametrically driven multielement couplers selectively couple qubits to resonators and neighboring qubits, according to the frequency of the drive. We consider a system with two qubits and one readout resonator interacting via a single coupling circuit and experimentally demonstrate a controlled-Z gate with a fidelity of 98.30 f 0.23%, a reset operation that unconditionally prepares the qubit ground state with a fidelity of 99.80 f 0.02% and a leakage recovery operation with a 98.5 f 0.3% success probability. Furthermore, we implement a parametric readout with a single-shot assignment fidelity of 88.0 f 0.4%. These operations are all realized using a single tunable coupler and a statically decoupled resonator, demonstrating the experimental feasibility of the proposed architecture and its potential for reducing the system complexity in scalable quantum processors.

TI A Multi-Class Quantum Kernel-Based Classifier
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Multi-class classification problems are fundamental in many varied domains in research and industry. A popular strategy for solving multi-class classification problems involves first transforming the problem into many binary classification problems. However, this requires the number of binary classification models that need to be developed to grow with the number of classes. Recent work in quantum machine learning has seen the development of multi-class quantum classifiers that circumvent this growth by learning a mapping between the data and a set of label states. This work presents the first multi-class SWAP-Test classifier inspired by its binary predecessor and the use of label states in recent work. With this classifier, the cost of developing multiple models is avoided. In contrast to previous work, the number of qubits required, the measurement strategy, and the topology of the circuits used is invariant to the number of classes. In addition, unlike other architectures for multi-class quantum classifiers, the state reconstruction of a single qubit yields sufficient information for multi-class classification tasks. Both analytical results and numerical simulations show that this classifier is not only effective when applied to diverse classification problems but also robust to certain conditions of noise.

TI Solving nuclear structure problems with the adaptive variational quantum
   algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We use the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model and the valence-space nuclear shell model to examine the likely performance of variational quantum eigensolvers in nuclear-structure theory. The LMG model exhibits both a phase transition and spontaneous symmetry breaking at the mean-field level in one of the phases, features that characterize collective dynamics in medium-mass and heavy nuclei. We show that with appropriate modifications, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm, a particularly flexible and accurate variational approach, is not troubled by these complications. We treat up to 12 particles and show that the number of quantum operations needed to approach the ground-state energy scales linearly with the number of qubits. We find similar scaling when the algorithm is applied to the nuclear shell model with realistic interactions in the sd and pf shells. Although most of these simulations contain no noise, we use a noise model from real IBM hardware to show that for the LMG model with four particles, weak noise has no effect on the efficiency of the algorithm.

TI Universal conservation laws of the wave-particle-entanglement triad:
   theory and experiment
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB When observed, a quantum system exhibits either wave-like or particle-like properties, depending on how it is measured. However, this duality is affected by the entanglement of the system with its quantum memory, raising a fundamental question: how are wave-particle duality and entanglement related? Here, we broaden the scope of wave-particle duality to include entanglement, introduce universal conservation laws for the wave-particle-entanglement triad, and perform demonstrations on silicon-integrated nanophotonic quantum chips. Our experiments not only mark the first confirmation of universal conservation laws but also highlight the potential of integrated photonics for exploring complex quantum phenomena in high-dimensional systems.

TI Quantum Simulation of the Bosonic Creutz Ladder with a Parametric Cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB There has been a growing interest in realizing quantum simulators for physical systems where perturbative methods are ineffective. The scalability and flexibility of circuit quantum electrodynamics make it a promising platform for implementing various types of simulators, including lattice models of strongly coupled field theories. Here, we use a multimode superconducting parametric cavity as a hardware-efficient analog quantum simulator, realizing a lattice in synthetic dimensions with complex hopping interactions. The coupling graph, i.e., the realized model, can be programmed in situ. The complex-valued hopping interaction further allows us to simulate, for instance, gauge potentials and topological models. As a demonstration, we simulate a plaquette of the bosonic Creutz ladder. We characterize the lattice with scattering measurements, reconstructing the experimental Hamiltonian and observing important precursors of topological features including nonreciprocal transport and Aharonov-Bohm caging. This platform can be easily extended to larger lattices and different models involving other interactions.

TI Towards the generation of mechanical Kerr-cats: awakening the
   perturbative quantum Moyal corrections to classical motion
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The quantum to classical transition is determined by the interplay of a trio of parameters: dissipation, nonlinearity, and macroscopicity. Why is nonlinearity needed to see quantum effects? And, is not an ordinary pendulum quite nonlinear already? In this manuscript, we discuss the parameter regime where the dynamics of a massive oscillator should be quantum mechanical in the presence of dissipation. We review the outstanding challenge of the dynamical generation of highly quantum mechanical cat states of a massive 'pendulum', known as Kerr-cats. We argue that state-of-the-art cold atom experiments may be in a position to reach such a nonlinear regime, which today singles out superconducting quantum circuits. A way to stabilize Schrodinger cat superpositions of a mechanical atomic oscillator via parametric squeezing and further protected by an unusual form of quantum interference is discussed. The encoding of a neutral atom Kerr-cat qubit is proposed.

TI The Nature of Pointer States and Their Role in Macroscopic Quantum
   Coherence
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB This article begins with an interdisciplinary review of a hydrodynamic approach to understanding the origins and nature of macroscopic quantum phenomena in high-temperature superconductivity, superfluidity, turbulence and biological systems. Building on this review, we consider new theoretical insights into the origin and nature of pointer states and their role in the emergence of quantum systems. The approach includes a theory of quantum coherence underpinned by turbulence, generated by a field of pointer states, which take the form of recirculating, spin-1/2 vortices (toroids), interconnected via a cascade of spin-1 vortices. Decoherence occurs when the bosonic network connecting pointer states is disrupted, leading to their localisation. Building further on this work, we explore how quantum particles (in the form of different vortex structures) could emerge as the product of a causal dynamic process, within a turbulent (fractal) spacetime. The resulting particle structures offer new insights into intrinsic spin, the probabilistic nature of the wave function and how we might consider pointer states within the standard "point source" representation of a quantum particle, which intuitively requires a more complexed description.

TI Forced Atom Interferometers in Optical Harmonic Potentials
SO ATOMS
AB We present a study of Doppler-sensitive light-pulse atom interferometers operating within optical dipole potentials, where atomic trajectories are manipulated using momentum transfer from light pulses and optical forces from the trap. Efficient methods are introduced to minimize the inhomogeneous broadening of oscillation frequencies in atoms confined within a three-dimensional optical lattice trap. These techniques enable the preparation of various quantum states, including vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states, for atom interferometry. Additionally, we demonstrate a two-dimensional atom interferometer using a single optical dipole trap, where transverse motion is activated by offsetting the trap position. Our work provides insights into controlling the mechanical motion of neutral atoms in optical harmonic potentials and contributes to advancing applications in quantum sensing and quantum computing.

TI Robust genuine high-dimensional steering with many measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum systems of high dimensions are attracting a lot of attention because they feature interesting properties when it comes to observing entanglement or other forms of correlations. In particular, their improved resistance to noise is favorable for experiments in quantum communication or quantum cryptography. However, witnessing this high-dimensional nature remains challenging, especially when the assumptions on the parties involved are weak, typically when one of them is considered as a black box. In this context, the concept of genuine high-dimensional steering has been recently introduced and experimentally demonstrated [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 200404 (2021)]; it allows for a one-sided device-independent certification of the dimension of a bipartite shared state by only using two measurements. Here I overcome this limitation by developing, for more than two measurements, universal bounds on the incompatibility robustness, turned into meaningful dimension certificates. Interestingly, even though the resulting bounds are quite loose, they still often offer an increased resistance to noise and could then be advantageously employed in experiments.

TI Continuity of robustness measures in quantum resource theories
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Robustness measures are increasingly prominent resource quantifiers that have been introduced for quantum resource theories such as entanglement and coherence. Despite the generality of these measures, their usefulness is hindered by the fact that some of their mathematical properties remain unclear, especially when the set of resource-free states is non-convex. In this paper, we investigate continuity properties of different robustness functions. We show that their continuity depends on the shape of the set of free states. In particular, we demonstrate that in many cases, star-convexity is sufficient for Lipschitz-continuity of the robustness, and we provide specific examples of sets leading to non-continuous measures. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our results by defining a robustness of teleportability and of quantum discord.

TI Strong Correlation Between Superconductivity and Ferromagnetism in an

SO NANO LETTERS
AB The interplay among topology, superconductivity, and magnetism promises to bring a plethora of exotic and unintuitive behaviors in emergent quantum materials. The family of Fe-chalcogenide superconductors FeTexSe1-x are directly relevant in this context due to their intrinsic topological band structure, high-temperature superconductivity, and unconventional pairing symmetry. Despite enormous promise and expectation, the local magnetic properties of FeTexSe1-x remain largely unexplored, which prevents a comprehensive understanding of their underlying material properties. Exploiting nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, here we report nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging of magnetic flux generated by exfoliated FeTexSe1-x flakes, demonstrating strong correlation between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in FeTexSe1-x. The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in an established topological superconductor opens up new opportunities for exploring exotic spin and charge transport phenomena in quantum materials. The demonstrated coupling between NV centers and FeTexSe1-x may also find applications in developing hybrid architectures for next-generation, solid-state-based quantum information technologies.

Here we exploit low-disorder epitaxial, strained quantum wells in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers to comprehensively probe the noise properties of complex micrometre-scale devices, comprising quantum dots arranged in a two-dimensional array. We demonstrate an average low charge noise across different locations on the wafer, providing a benchmark for quantum confined holes. We then establish spin qubit control and extend our investigation from electrical to magnetic noise through spin echo measurements. Exploiting dynamical decoupling sequences, we quantify the power spectral density components arising from the hyperfine interaction with 73Ge spinful isotopes and identify coherence modulations associated with the interaction with the 29Si nuclear spin bath near the Ge quantum well, underscoring the need for full isotopic purification of the qubit host environment.

SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Results about entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonians of quantum many-body systems in field theory and statistical mechanics models, and recent applications in the context of quantum information and quantum simulation, are reviewed. In the first part of the review, what is known about entanglement Hamiltonians of ground states (vacua) in quantum field theory is summarized, based on the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem and its extension to conformal field theory. This is complemented with a more rigorous mathematical discussion of the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem, within the framework of Tomita-Takesaki theorem of modular groups. The second part of the review is devoted to lattice models. There, exactly soluble cases are first considered and then the discussion is extended to non-integrable models, whose entanglement Hamiltonian is often well captured by the lattice version of the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. In the last part of the review, recently developed applications in quantum information processing that rely upon the specific properties of entanglement Hamiltonians in many-body systems are summarized. These include protocols to measure entanglement spectra, and schemes to perform state tomography.

TI Elliptic curves in continuous-variable quantum systems
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Elliptic curves are planar curves which can be used to define an abelian group. The computation of this group's addition operation, as well as related operations such as the discrete logarithm, could be performed on quantum computing devices, potentially leading to better performance. Currently, however, thousands of logical qubits are required for elliptic curve group addition, putting this application out of reach for near-term quantum hardware. Here we give an algorithm for computing elliptic curve group addition (over the real numbers) using a single continuous-variable mode, based on weak measurements of a system with a cubic potential energy. This result could lead to improvements in the efficiency of elliptic curve operations using a quantum device.

TI An Analysis of Existing Hash-Based Post-Quantum Signature Schemes
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The rapid development of quantum computing poses challenges to the foundations of traditional cryptography. The threats are significant in terms of both asymmetric cryptography (which exposes schemes like RSA and ECC to efficient attacks) and symmetric cryptography, where key sizes must be increased to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we review the evolution of hash-based digital signatures, from early one-time signatures to modern stateless schemes, with an emphasis on their security properties, efficiency, and practical constraints. Moreover, we propose a simple comparative metric that reflects structural symmetry across key parameters such as key size, signature size, and computational cost, enabling a visual clustering of the schemes. We give particular attention to recent developments such as Verkle trees, which preserve symmetric design principles while improving scalability and proof compactness. The study highlights ongoing tradeoffs between stateful and stateless designs and argues for the continued relevance of symmetric cryptographic constructions in building secure, efficient post-quantum systems.

TI Characterizing coherent errors using matrix-element amplification
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Repeating a gate sequence multiple times amplifies systematic errors coherently, making it a useful tool for characterizing quantum gates. However, the precision of such an approach is limited by low-frequency noise, while its efficiency is hindered by time-consuming scans required to match up the phases of the off-diagonal matrix elements being amplified. Here, we overcome both challenges by interleaving the gate of interest with dynamical decoupling sequences in a protocol we call Matrix-Element Amplification using Dynamical Decoupling (MEADD). Using frequency-tunable superconducting qubits from a Google Sycamore quantum processor, we experimentally demonstrate that MEADD surpasses the accuracy and precision of existing characterization protocols for estimating systematic errors in single- and two-qubit gates. We use MEADD to estimate coherent parameters of CZ gates with 5 to 10 times the precision of existing methods and to characterize previously undetectable coherent crosstalk, reaching a precision below one milliradian.

TI Quantifying genuine tripartite entanglement by reshaping the state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Although genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), as one quantum resource, is indispensable in quantum information processing, most of the existing measures cannot detect GME faithfully. In this paper we present a GME measure, namely, the minimum pairwise concurrence (MPC), by introducing pairwise entanglement, which characterizes the entanglement between two single-qubit subsystems of a multipartite system without tracing out the remaining qubit. The pairwise entanglement can be obtained by combining the entanglement of the reduced subsystem and the three-tangle. Compared with existing measures, the MPC measure outperforms the previous ones in many aspects. Due to its fine properties, it thus is believed that the MPC could be a good candidate for achieving potential quantum tasks and also could facilitate the understanding of GME.

AB In this paper we demonstrate that the overheads (ancillae qubits/time/number of gates) involved with implementing quantum oracles for a generic key-recovery attack against block-ciphers using quantum search techniques can be reduced.
   In particular, if we require r >= 1 plaintext-ciphertext pairs to uniquely identify a user's key, then using Grover's quantum search algorithm for cryptanalysis of block-ciphers as in [2,3,9,13,18] would require a quantum circuit which requires effort (either Time x Space product or number of quantum gates) proportional to r. We demonstrate how we can reduce this by a fine-grained approach to quantum amplitude amplification [6,17] and design of the required quantum oracles.
   We furthermore demonstrate that this effort can be reduced to < r with respect to cryptanalysis of AES-128/192/256 and provide full quantum resource estimations for AES-128/192/256 with our methods, and code in the Q# quantum programming language that extends the work of [13].

TI Observation of Rydberg Blockade Due to the Charge-Dipole Interaction
   between an Atom and a Polar Molecule
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate Rydberg blockade due to the charge-dipole interaction between a single Rb atom and a single RbCs molecule confined in optical tweezers. The molecule is formed by magnetoassociation of a Rb + Cs atom pair and subsequently transferred to the rovibrational ground state with an efficiency of 91(1)%. Species-specific tweezers are used to control the separation between the atom and molecule. The charge-dipole interaction causes blockade of the transition to the Rb(52s) Rydberg state, when the atom -molecule separation is set to 310(40) nm. The observed excitation dynamics are in good agreement with simulations using calculated interaction potentials. Our results open up the prospect of a hybrid platform where quantum information is transferred between individually trapped molecules using Rydberg atoms.

TI Variational quantum semi-supervised classifier based on label
   propagation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Label propagation is an essential semi-supervised learning method based on graphs, which has a broad spectrum of applications in pattern recognition and data mining. This paper proposes a quantum semi-supervised classifier based on label propagation. Considering the difficulty of graph construction, we develop a variational quantum label propagation (VQLP) method. In this method, a locally parameterized quantum circuit is created to reduce the parameters required in the optimization. Furthermore, we design a quantum semi-supervised binary classifier based on hybrid Bell and Z bases measurement, which has a shallower circuit depth and is more suitable for implementation on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the performance of the quantum semi-supervised classifier on the Iris data set, and the simulation results show that the quantum semi-supervised classifier has higher classification accuracy than the swap test classifier. This work opens a new path to quantum machine learning based on graphs.

TI Clock Synchronization with Correlated Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Event synchronization is a ubiquitous task, with applications ranging from 5G technology to indus-trial automation and smart power grids. The emergence of quantum communication networks will further increase the demand for precise synchronization in the optical and electronic domains, which implies sig-nificant resource overhead, such as the requirement for ultrastable clocks or additional synchronization lasers. Here, we show how temporal correlations of photons may be harnessed for synchronization in quantum networks. We achieve stable synchronization jitter <68 ps with as few as 44 correlated detection events per 100-ms data package and demonstrate feasibility in realistic emulated high-loss link scenarios, including atmospheric turbulence. In contrast to previous work, this is accomplished without any exter-nal timing reference and only simple crystal oscillators. Our approach replaces the optical and electronic transmission of timing signals with classical communication and computer-aided postprocessing. It can be easily integrated into a wide range of quantum communication networks and could pave the way to future applications in entanglement-based secure time transmission.

TI Post-Quantum Linkable Hash-Based Ring Signature Scheme for Off-Chain
   Payments in IoT
SO SENSORS
AB Off-chain payments in the Internet of Things (IoT) enhance the efficiency and scalability of blockchain transactions. However, existing privacy mechanisms face challenges, such as the disclosure of payment channels and transaction traceability. Additionally, the rise of quantum computing threatens traditional public key cryptography, making the development of post-quantum secure methods for privacy protection essential. This paper proposes a post-quantum ring signature scheme based on hash functions that can be applied to off-chain payments, enhancing both anonymity and linkability. The scheme is designed to resist quantum attacks through the use of hash-based signatures and to prevent double spending via its linkable properties. Furthermore, the paper introduces an improved Hash Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) that incorporates a Signature of Knowledge (SOK) to conceal the payment path and strengthen privacy protection. Security analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system strikes a favorable balance between privacy, computational efficiency, and security. Notably, the efficiency benefits of basic signature verification are particularly evident, offering new insights into privacy protection for post-quantum secure blockchain.

TI Increasing memory lifetime of quantum low-density parity check codes
   with sliding-window noisy syndrome decoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) with single-shot decoding enables the reduction of errors after every single round of noisy stabilizer measurement, easing the time-overhead requirements for fault tolerance. Notably, several classes of quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are known which facilitate single-shot decoding, potentially giving them an additional overhead advantage. However, the perceived advantage of single-shot decoding is limited because it can significantly degrade the effective code distance. This degradation may be compensated for by using a much larger code size to achieve the desired target logical error rate, at the cost of increasing the amount of syndrome information to be processed, as well as increasing complexity of logical operations. Alternatively, in this paper we study sliding-window decoding, which corrects errors from previous syndrome measurement rounds while leaving the most recent errors for future correction. We observe that sliding-window decoding significantly improves the logical memory lifetime and hence the effective distance compared to single-shot decoding on hypergraph-product codes and lifted-product codes. Remarkably, we find that this improvement may not cost a larger decoding complexity. Thus, the sliding-window strategy can be more desirable for fast and accurate decoding for fault-tolerant quantum computing with qLDPC codes.

TI Microwave Photon Emission in Superconducting Circuits
SO INSTRUMENTS
AB Quantum computing requires a novel approach to store data as quantum states, opposite to classical bits. One of the most promising candidates is entangled photons. In this manuscript, we show the photon emission in the range of microwave frequencies of three different types of superconducting circuits, a SQUID, a JPA, and a JTWPA, often used as low-noise parametric amplifiers. These devices can be operated as sources of entangled photons. We report the experimental protocol used to produce and measure microwave radiation from these circuits, as well as data simulations. The collected spectra are obtained by performing single-tone measurements with a direct rf pump on the devices; the output spectra at low powers (below -100 dBm) are well interpreted by the dynamical Casimir model, while at high powers (above -100 dBm) the system is well described by the Autler-Townes fluorescence of a three-level atom.

TI Double sparse quantum state preparation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Initializing classical data in a quantum device is an essential step in many quantum algorithms. As a consequence of measurement and noisy operations, some algorithms need to reinitialize the prepared state several times during its execution. If the quantum state preparation is not efficient, the quantum state preparation cost can dominate the computational cost of an algorithm. In this work, we propose a quantum state preparation algorithm, called CVO-QRAM algorithm, whose computational cost depends on the number of nonzero probability amplitudes and the maximum number of bits with a value of 1 in one of the patterns to be stored. The proposed algorithm can be an alternative to create sparse states in future noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Magnetic Field-Resilient Quantum-Limited Parametric Amplifier
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Superconducting parametric amplifiers are crucial components in microwave quantum circuits for enabling quantum-limited signal readout. The best-performing such amplifiers are often based on Joseph-son junctions, which however are sensitive to magnetic fields. Therefore, they require magnetic shields and are not easily integratable with other quantum systems that operate within magnetic fields, such as spin -ensemble quantum memories. To tackle this challenge, we develop a kinetic inductance-based parametric amplifier featuring a NbN nanobridge instead of Josephson junctions, which provides the desired nonlin-earity for a strong parametric gain up to 42 dB. The added noise of this nanobridge kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier (hereby referred to as NKPA) is calibrated and found to be 0.59 +/- 0.03 quanta for phase-preserving amplification, approaching the quantum limit of 0.5 quanta. Most importantly, we show that such excellent noise performance is preserved in an in-plane magnetic field up to 427 mT, the max-imum field available in our experiment. This magnetic-field-resilient parametric amplifier presents an opportunity towards addressing single electron-spin resonance and more efficient search for axions as well as Majorana fermions.

TI Cooper-pair transistor as a minimal topological quantum circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The outlook of protected quantum computing spurred enormous progress in the search for topological materials, sustaining a continued race to find the most experimentally feasible platform. Here we show that one of the simplest quantum circuits, the Cooper-pair transistor, exhibits a nontrivial Chern number which has not yet been discussed, in spite of the exhaustive existing literature. Surprisingly, the resulting quantized current response is robust with respect to a large number of external perturbations, most notably low-frequency charge noise and quasiparticle poisoning. Moreover, the fact that the higher bands experience crossings with higher topological charges leads to all the bands having the same Chern number, such that there is no restriction to stay close to the ground state. Remaining small perturbations are investigated based on a generic master equation approach. Finally, we discuss a feasible protocol to measure the quantized current.

TI Scalable QKD Postprocessing System With Reconfigurable Hardware
   Accelerator
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Key distillation is an essential component of every quantum key distribution (QKD) system because it compensates for the inherent transmission errors of a quantum channel. However, the interoperability and throughput aspects of the postprocessing components are often neglected. In this article, we propose a high-throughput key distillation framework that supports multiple QKD protocols, implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed design adapts a MapReduce programming model to efficiently process large chunks of raw data across the limited computing resources of an FPGA. We present a novel hardware-efficient integrated postprocessing architecture that offers dynamic error correction, mutual authentication with a physically unclonable function, and an inbuilt high-speed encryption application that utilizes the key for secure communication. In addition, we have developed a semiautomated high-level synthesis framework that is compatible with any discrete variable QKD system, showing promising speedup. Overall, the experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy enhancement in scalability achieved through the utilization of a single FPGA platform.

TI Complete Analysis of Implementing Isogeny-Based Cryptography Using Huff
   Form of Elliptic Curves
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we present the analysis of Huff curves for implementing isogeny-based cryptography. In this regard, we first investigate the computational cost of the building blocks when compression functions are used for Huff curves. We present a new formula for recovering the coefficient of the curve, from a given point on a Huff curve, which is essential for implementing SIDH. We also apply the square-root Velu formula on Huff curves and further optimize Huff-CSIDH by exploiting Edwards curves for computing the coefficient of the image curve and present the Huff-Edwards hybrid model. From our implementation, the performance of Huff-SIDH and Montgomery-SIDH is almost the same, and the performance of Huff-CSIDH is 6% faster than Montgomery-CSIDH. The performance of Huff-Edwards CSIDH is almost the same as Montgomery-Edwards CSIDH. The result of our work shows that Huff curves can be quite practical for implementing isogeny-based cryptography but has some limitations.

TI Thermal Robustness of Entanglement in a Dissipative Two-Dimensional Spin
   System in an Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field
SO ENTROPY
AB Recently new novel magnetic phases were shown to exist in the asymptotic steady states of spin systems coupled to dissipative environments at zero temperature. Tuning the different system parameters led to quantum phase transitions among those states. We study, here, a finite two-dimensional Heisenberg triangular spin lattice coupled to a dissipative Markovian Lindblad environment at finite temperature. We show how applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field to the system at different degrees of anisotropy may significantly affect the spin states, and the entanglement properties and distribution among the spins in the asymptotic steady state of the system. In particular, applying an inhomogeneous field with an inward (growing) gradient toward the central spin is found to considerably enhance the nearest neighbor entanglement and its robustness against the thermal dissipative decay effect in the completely anisotropic (Ising) system, whereas the beyond nearest neighbor ones vanish entirely. The spins of the system in this case reach different steady states depending on their positions in the lattice. However, the inhomogeneity of the field shows no effect on the entanglement in the completely isotropic (XXX) system, which vanishes asymptotically under any system configuration and the spins relax to a separable (disentangled) steady state with all the spins reaching a common spin state. Interestingly, applying the same field to a partially anisotropic (XYZ) system does not just enhance the nearest neighbor entanglements and their thermal robustness but all the long-range ones as well, while the spins relax asymptotically to very distinguished spin states, which is a sign of a critical behavior taking place at this combination of system anisotropy and field inhomogeneity.

TI Quantum approximate optimization algorithm with adaptive bias fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) transforms a simple many-qubit wave function into one that encodes a solution to a difficult classical optimization problem. It does this by optimizing the schedule according to which two unitary operators are alternately applied to the qubits. In this paper, the QAOA is modified by updating the operators themselves to include local fields, using information from the measured wave function at the end of one iteration step to improve the operators at later steps. It is shown by numerical simulation on MaxCut problems that, for a fixed accuracy, this procedure decreases the runtime of QAOA very substantially. This improvement appears to increase with the problem size. Our method requires essentially the same number of quantum gates per optimization step as the standard QAOA, and no additional measurements. This modified algorithm enhances the prospects for quantum advantage for certain optimization problems.

TI Increasing Extractable Work in Small Qubit Landscapes
SO ENTROPY
AB An interesting class of physical systems, including those associated with life, demonstrates the ability to hold thermalization at bay and perpetuate states of high free-energy compared to a local environment. In this work we study quantum systems with no external sources or sinks for energy, heat, work, or entropy that allow for high free-energy subsystems to form and persist. We initialize systems of qubits in mixed, uncorrelated states and evolve them subject to a conservation law. We find that four qubits make up the minimal system for which these restricted dynamics and initial conditions allow an increase in extractable work for a subsystem. On landscapes of eight co-evolving qubits, interacting in randomly selected subsystems at each step, we demonstrate that restricted connectivity and an inhomogeneous distribution of initial temperatures both lead to landscapes with longer intervals of increasing extractable work for individual qubits. We demonstrate the role of correlations that develop on the landscape in enabling a positive change in extractable work.

TI Quantum Bit Retransmission Using Universal Quantum Copying Machine

AB Quantum internet, which is expected to be a combination of quantum and classical networks, promises to provide information-theoretic security for data exchange. Classical networks have well-established protocols for reliable end-to-end transmission that implicitly make use of duplicating classical bits. However, quantum bits (qubits) cannot be copied due to the no-cloning theorem. In this paper, we take advantage of the principle of creating imperfect clones using a Universal Quantum Copying Machine (UQCM) and propose the Quantum Automatic Repeat Request (QARQ) protocol, inspired by its classical equivalent. A simulation platform has been developed to study the feasibility of QARQ. Results show that our proposal is well suited for applications that are compatible with low fidelity requirements.

TI High-precision pulse calibration of tunable couplers for high-fidelity
   two-qubit gates in superconducting quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB For superconducting quantum processors, stable high-fidelity two-qubit operations depend on precise flux control of the tunable coupler. However, the pulse distortion poses a significant challenge to the control precision. Current calibration methods, which often rely on microwave crosstalk or additional readout resonators for coupler excitation and readout, tend to be cumbersome and inefficient, especially when couplers only have flux control. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate a pulse calibration scheme that exploits the strong coupling between qubits and couplers, eliminating the need for extra coupler readout and excitation. Our method directly measures the short-time and long-time step responses of the coupler flux pulse transient, enabling us to apply predistortion to subsequent signals using fast Fourier transformation and deconvolution. This approach not only simplifies the calibration process, but also significantly improves the precision and stability of the flux control. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through the implementation of diabatic controlled-Z (CZ) and iSWAP gates with fidelities of 99.61% f 0.04% and 99.82% f 0.02%, respectively, as well as a series of diabatic controlled-phase gates with high fidelities characterized by cross-entropy benchmarking. The consistency and robustness of our technique are further validated by the reduction in pulse distortion and phase error observed across multilayer CZ gates. These results underscore the potential of our calibration and predistortion method to enhance the performance of two-qubit gates in superconducting quantum processors.

TI The complexity of learning (pseudo)random dynamics of black holes and
   other chaotic systems
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB It has been recently proposed that the naive semiclassical prediction of non-unitary black hole evaporation can be understood in the fundamental description of the black hole as a consequence of ignorance of high-complexity information. Validity of this conjecture implies that any algorithm which is polynomially bounded in computational complexity cannot accurately reconstruct the black hole dynamics. In this work, we prove that such bounded quantum algorithms cannot accurately predict (pseudo)random unitary dynamics, even if they are given access to an arbitrary set of polynomially complex observables under this time evolution; this shows that "learning" a (pseudo)random unitary is computationally hard. We use the common simplification of modeling black holes and more generally chaotic systems via (pseudo)random dynamics. The quantum algorithms that we consider are completely general, and their attempted guess for the time evolution of black holes is likewise unconstrained: it need not be a linear operator, and may be as general as an arbitrary (e.g. decohering) quantum channel.

TI Universal compilation for quantum state tomography
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Universal compilation is a training process that compiles a trainable unitary into a target unitary. It has vast potential applications from depth-circuit compressing to device benchmarking and quantum error mitigation. Here we propose a universal compilation algorithm for quantum state tomography in low-depth quantum circuits. We apply the Fubini-Study distance as a trainable cost function and employ various gradient-based optimizations. We evaluate the performance of various trainable unitary topologies and the trainability of different optimizers for getting high efficiency and reveal the crucial role of the circuit depth in robust fidelity. The results are comparable with the shadow tomography method, a similar fashion in the field. Our work expresses the adequate capability of the universal compilation algorithm to maximize the efficiency in the quantum state tomography. Further, it promises applications in quantum metrology and sensing and is applicable in the near-term quantum computers for various quantum computing tasks.

TI Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure conference key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multipartite entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the conference key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending 1014 pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.

TI A Redactable Blockchain Scheme Supporting Quantum-Resistance and
   Trapdoor Updates
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Applying chameleon hash functions to redactable blockchains is still challenging work. Most redactable blockchain solutions using this technique have potential problems, such as too weak decentralization performance and trapdoors with exposure risks. In addition, quantum computing also threatens the security of blockchain systems. The above two issues imply that the development of redactable blockchains is still constrained, and that quantum-resistance will be requirements for blockchain applications. Therefore, we constructed a chameleon hash function over lattices while utilizing a hierarchical identity mechanism to manage trapdoors and assign edit permissions. This variant of the chameleon hash function can support trapdoor updates and quantum-resistant performance, namely a hierarchical identity-based chameleon hash with revocable subkey (HIBCH-RS). We demonstrated the safety performance of HIBCH-RS by defining its safety concepts of collision resistance. Our HIBCH-RS scheme provides a solution for implementing a redactable blockchain with identity encryption and post-quantum cryptography. Finally, this quantum-resistant redactable blockchain was implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform.

TI High-Purity Entanglement of Hot Propagating Modes Using Nonreciprocity
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Distributed quantum information processing and communication protocols demand the ability to gen-erate entanglement among propagating modes. However, thermal fluctuations can severely limit the fidelity and purity of propagating entangled states, especially for low-frequency modes relevant for radio-frequency (rf) signals. Here, we propose nonreciprocity as a resource to render continuous-variable entanglement of propagating modes robust against thermal fluctuations. By utilizing a cold-engineered reservoir, we break the symmetry of reciprocity in a standard two-mode squeezing interaction between a low-and a high-frequency mode and show that the rerouting of thermal fluctuations allows the generation of flying entangled states with high purity. Our approach requires only pairwise Gaussian interactions and is thus ideal for parametric circuit-QED implementations.

TI ENTANGLED COHERENT STATES IN TELEPORTATION?
SO EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In the present paper, we will review the methods to produce superposition of entangled coherent state using polarizing beam splitter and Kerr non linearity. These coherent states have many attractive features and can be used in various schemes. Entanglement, refers to the superposition of a multiparticle system and explains a new type of correlations between any two subsystems of the quantum system, which is not existing in the classical physics. The present paper deals with the use of these states in quantum teleportation, entanglement diversion and entanglement swapping schemes. Entanglement diversion and entanglement-swapping refers to a scheme which may entangle those particles which had never interacted before. In the swapping scheme, two pairs of entangled state are taken. One particle from each pair is subjected to a Bell-state-measurement. This would result in projection of the other two outgoing particles in an entangled pair. Quantum Teleportation of two mode and three modes states is also studied with perfect fidelity. Minimum assured fidelity which is defined as the minimum of the fidelity for any unknown quantum information of the states is also discussed. It is also shown how the success rate of teleportation of a superposition of odd and even coherent states can be increased from 50% to almost 100%. The scheme suggested by van Enk and Hirota was modified by Prakash, Chandra, Prakash and Shivani in 2007. We find that an almost teleportation, diversion and swapping is possible by simply separating vacuum state from the even state. The present paper also deals with study of effect of decoherence and noise on these states and the effect of noise on fidelity and minimum assured fidelity. It is also discussed that these schemes can also be applied to the process of entanglement diversion and entanglement swapping.

TI Highly Reliable and Secure System With Multi-Layer Parallel LDPC and
   Kyber for 5G Communications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The development of fifth-generation (5G) technology marks a significant milestone for digital communication systems, providing substantial improvements in data transmission speeds and enabling enhanced connectivity across a wider range of devices. However, this rapid increase in data volume also introduces new challenges related to transmission latency, reliability, and security. This paper introduces KyMLP-LDPC, a novel approach that integrates a multi-layer parallel LDPC (MLP-LDPC) algorithm with Kyber, a post-quantum cryptography scheme, to accelerate and enable reliable and secure transmission. MLP-LDPC partitions the LDPC parity check matrix into processing groups to streamline parallel decoding and minimize message collisions during transmission, thereby accelerating error correction operations. Kyber encrypts data preemptively to safeguard against potential attacks. The effectiveness of our proposed method is evaluated using both image data and signals transmitted through an additive white Gaussian noise communication channel. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of error correction capabilities and data security compared to existing approaches.

AB Combining the benefits of quantum computing and artificial neural networks, quantum reservoir computing shows potential for handling complex tasks due to its access to the Hilbert space in exponential dimensions. In this study, the quantum Fourier transform algorithm is implemented utilizing quantum reservoir computing, demonstrating its unique advantages. For the random interactions within the reservoirs, quantum reservoir computing avoids the cost of precise control of the physical system. The proposed model only requires to optimize a linear readout layer, thus significantly reducing the computational cost required for training. The accuracy of the implementation is numerically demonstrated and the model is integrated into quantum circuits to correctly execute the quantum phase estimation algorithm. Additionally, the impacts of different reservoir structures and dissipation intensities within the reservoir, and the results indicate the robustness of the model are discussed.

TI Peptide conformational sampling using the Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Protein folding has attracted considerable research effort in biochemistry in recent decades. In this work, we explore the potential of quantum computing to solve a simplified version of protein folding. More precisely, we numerically investigate the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in sampling low-energy conformations of short peptides. We start by benchmarking the algorithm on an even simpler problem: sampling self-avoiding walks. Motivated by promising results, we then apply the algorithm to a more complete version of protein folding, including a simplified physical potential. In this case, we find less promising results: deep quantum circuits are required to achieve accurate results, and the performance of QAOA can be matched by random sampling up to a small overhead. Overall, these results cast serious doubt on the ability of QAOA to address the protein folding problem in the near term, even in an extremely simplified setting.

TI Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a general-purpose, self-adaptive approach to construct a variational wave-function ansatz for highly accurate quantum dynamics simulations based on McLachlan's variational principle. The key idea is to dynamically expand the variational ansatz along the time-evolution path such that the "McLachlan distance", which is a measure of the simulation accuracy, remains below a set threshold. We apply this adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) approach to the integrable Lieb-SchultzMattis spin chain and the nonintegrable mixed-field Ising model, where it captures both finite-rate and sudden post-quench dynamics with high fidelity. The AVQDS quantum circuits that prepare the time-evolved state are much shallower than those obtained from first-order Trotterization and contain up to 2 orders of magnitude fewer CNOT gate operations. We envision that a wide range of dynamical simulations of quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum-computing devices will be made possible through the AVQDS framework.

TI Scalable Architecture for Dark Photon Searches: Superconducting-Qubit
   Proof of Principle
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The dark photon is a well-motivated dark matter candidate that appears in many extensions of the standard model. A fundamental mass-range-sensitivity dilemma is always haunting the dark photon search experiments: resonant haloscopes have excellent sensitivity but are narrowband, while nonresonant haloscopes are broadband but not as sensitive as the resonant ones. A scalable architecture integrating numerous resonant haloscopes would be a desirable solution to this dilemma. However, even the concept of a scalable search remains rarely explored due to the size limitation of conventional haloscopes imposed by the dark photon wavelength. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel architecture using superconducting qubits as subwavelength haloscope units. By virtue of the scalability of superconducting qubits, it is possible to integrate multiple qubits with different frequencies on a chip-scale device. Furthermore, the frequencies of the qubits can be tuned to extend the search mass range. Thus, our scalable architectures allow for sweepable high-sensitivity dark photon searches at multiple frequencies simultaneously. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we designed and fabricated a three-qubit chip and successfully demonstrated a scalable dark-photon search. Our Letter established constraints on dark photons in the mass range of 15.632-15.638, 15.838-15.845, and 16.463-16.468 mu eV, simultaneously, and the constraints are much more stringent than the cosmology constraints. In the future, our Letter can be scaled up to boost the scrutiny of new physics.

TI Transmon-assisted high-fidelity controlled-Z gates for integer fluxonium
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fluxoniums, as partially protected superconducting qubits, are promising to be employed in building high-performance large-scale quantum processor. The recently proposed "integer fluxonium" operates at zero external flux bias, with a frequency of approximately 3 GHz. Single-qubit gate fidelity has been demonstrated to exceed 99.9% [Mencia et al., PRX Quantum 5, 040318 (2024)], whereas two-qubit gate schemes and scalable architectures remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate a fluxoniumtransmon-fluxonium (FTF) coupling architecture using integer fluxoniums. We first confirm suppression of ZZ interaction in the FTF system and then propose two high-fidelity controlled-Z (CZ) gate schemes utilizing the coupler control: a flux-activated adiabatic gate scheme and a microwave-activated nonadiabatic gate scheme. Both schemes are capable of achieving low coherent error of the order of 1 x 10-6 within gate durations of several tens of nanoseconds. In addition, we discuss a hybrid circuit system in which an integer fluxonium is coupled to a conventional fluxonium through a transmon coupler. Our proposal provides insights for future implementations of large-scale quantum circuits based on integer fluxonium devices.

Rydberg blockade can be violated, i.e., simultaneous excitation of more than one Rydberg atom, by off-resonant laser excitation, causing an excitation antiblockade. Rydberg antiblockade gives rise to strongly correlated many-body dynamics and spin-orbit coupling and also finds quantum computation applications. Instead of commonly used van der Waals interactions, we investigate antiblockade dynamics of two Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole exchange interactions. We study typical situations in current Rydberg atom experiments, where different types of dipole-dipole interactions can be achieved by varying Rydberg state couplings. An effective Hamiltonian governing underlying antiblockade dynamics is derived. We illustrate that geometric gates can be realized with the Rydberg antiblockade which is robust against the decay of Rydberg states. Our study may stimulate new experimental and theoretical exploration of quantum optics and strongly interacting many-body dynamics with Rydberg antiblockade driven by dipole-dipole interactions.

TI Exploring entanglement and spectral split correlations in three-flavor
   collective neutrino oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In environments with prodigious numbers of neutrinos, such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, or the early Universe, neutrino-neutrino interactions are dynamically significant. They can dominate neutrino flavor evolution and force it to be nonlinear, causing collective neutrino oscillations. Such collective oscillations have been studied numerically, for systems with up to millions of neutrinos, using mean-field or one-particle effective approximations. However, such a system of interacting neutrinos is a quantum many-body system, wherein quantum correlations could play a significant role in the flavor evolution-thereby motivating the exploration of many-body treatments that follow the time evolution of these correlations. In many-body flavor evolution calculations with two neutrino flavors, the emergence of spectral splits in the neutrino energy distributions has been found to be correlated with the degree of quantum entanglement across the spectrum. In this work, for the first time, we investigate the emergence of spectral splits in the three-flavor many-body collective neutrino oscillations. We find that the emergence of spectral splits resembles the number and location found in the mean-field approximation but not in the width. Moreover, unlike in the two-flavor many-body calculations, we find that additional degrees of freedom make it more difficult to establish a correlation between the location of the spectral splits and the degree of quantum entanglement across the neutrino energy spectrum. The observation from the two-flavor case, that neutrinos nearest to the spectral split frequency exhibit the highest level of entanglement, is more difficult to ascertain in the three-flavor case because of the presence of multiple spectral splits across different pairwise combinations of flavor and/or mass states.

TI Exploring holography with boundary fractal-like structures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this paper, we study the holographic quantum error correcting code properties in different boundary fractal-like structures. We construct and explore different examples of the uberholographic bulk reconstruction corresponding to these structures in higher dimensions for Cantor-like sets, thermal states, and TT over bar -deformed conformal field theories. We show how the growth of the dimensionality of the system emphasizes the role of the Cantor set, due to the special bound naturally arising in this context.

TI Linear regression by quantum amplitude estimation and its extension to
   convex optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Linear regression is a basic and widely used methodology in data analysis. It is known that some quantum algorithms efficiently perform least-squares linear regression of an exponentially large dataset. However, if we obtain values of the regression coefficients as classical data, the complexity of the existing quantum algorithms can be larger than the classical method. This is because it depends strongly on the tolerance error E: the best one among the existing proposals is O(epsilon(-2)). In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for linear regression, which has a complexity of O(epsilon(-1)) and keeps a logarithmic dependence on the number of data points N-D. In this method, we overcome bottleneck parts in the calculation, which take the form of the sum over data points and therefore have a complexity proportional to N-D, using quantum amplitude estimation, and other parts classically. Additionally, we generalize our method to some class of convex optimization problems.

AB Quantum computing technologies are undergoing rapid development. The different qubit modalities being considered for quantum computing each have their strengths and weaknesses, making it challenging to compare their performance relative to each other and the state-of-the-art in classical high-performance computing. To better understand the utility of a given quantum processor and to assess when and how it will be able to advance the frontiers of computational science, researchers need a robust approach to quantum benchmarking. A variety of approaches have been proposed, many of which characterize the presence of noise in current quantum devices. These efforts include component-level performance metrics, such as randomized benchmarking and gate set tomography; high-level application-dependent metrics; and device-level metrics, such as the Quantum Volume. However, it remains unclear how low-level metrics, such as fidelities and decoherence times, and global device metrics, such as Quantum Volume, relate to the computational utility and practical limitations of quantum processors to solve useful problems. In this paper, we describe our Hamiltonian-oriented approach to quantum benchmarking called HamPerf. Where previous application-dependent approaches specify a suite of benchmarking circuits inspired by applications, we place the problem Hamiltonian at the center. Our strategy allows us to probe the computational performance of a quantum processor on standardized and relevant problem sets, agnostic of the algorithms and hardware used to solve them; it also provides fundamental insights into how device characteristics correlate with computational utility.

TI Study of the double kicked top: A classical and quantum perspective
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The double kicked top (DKT) is studied as an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. A transformation in the kick strength parameter space (k, k')-* (kr, k9) reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter kr drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas k9 leads to a weaker growth. Fixed points and their stability are analyzed both analytically and computationally by using the largest Lyapunov exponent and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Exact solutions are obtained for 2-to 4-qubit version of the DKT, including eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and entanglement dynamics. Criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics is obtained. Quantum correlations are investigated in both deep quantum and semiclassical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the longtime averages of the quantum correlations. The homoclinic point and its associated state are also investigated within the semiclassical regime. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.

TI Pairwise quantum criteria and teleportation in a spin square complex
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Thermal non-classical correlations quantified by concurrence entanglement, local quantum uncertainty, and quantum coherence in a four-qubit square chain are exactly examined. The influences of the Hamiltonian parameters on the mentioned pairwise quantum criteria and fidelity of teleportation are studied, and the most interesting findings are discussed in detail. It is found that the tuning anisotropy results in enhancing the thermal quantum correlations and coherence as well as average fidelity until achieving maximum values. We persuasively deduce that quantum coherence is a more efficient criterion than that of concurrence and local quantum uncertainty to detect the quantumness of a thermal state.

TI Off-axis holographic imaging with undetected light
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum imaging with undetected light (QIUL) leverages the quantum correlations of photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) to retrieve both amplitude and phase information of an object. This method enables illumination and detection at distinct wavelength ranges, utilizing advanced detection technology in the visible spectrum while probing the object at an exotic wavelength. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a QIUL technique incorporating Fourier off-axis holography within a hybrid-type induced-coherence nonlinear interferometer. Our approach reconstructs the amplitude and phase information of an object in a single shot using a wide-field configuration, presenting a viable alternative to multi-frame acquisition techniques such as phase-shifting holography.

TI Graph Generation for Quantum States Using Qiskit and Its Application for
   Quantum Neural Networks
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper describes a practical approach to the quantum theory using the simulation and processing technology available today. The proposed project allows us to create an exploration graph so that for an initial starting configuration of the qubits, all possible states are created given a set of gates selected by the user. For each node in the graph, we can obtain various types of information such as the applied gates from the initial state (the transition route), necessary cost, representation of the quantum circuit, as well as the amplitudes of each state. The project is designed not as an end goal, but rather as a processing platform that allows users to visualize and explore diverse solutions for different quantum problems in a much easier manner. We then describe some potential applications of this project in other research fields, illustrating the way in which the states from the graph can be used as nodes in a new interpretation of a quantum neural network; the steps of a hybrid processing chain are presented for the problem of finding one or more states that verify certain conditions. These concepts can also be used in academia, with their implementation being possible with the help of the Python programming language, the NumPy library, and Qiskit-the open-source quantum framework developed by IBM.

TI Quantum Monge-Kantorovich Problem and Transport Distance between Density
   Matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A quantum version of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem is analyzed. The transport cost is minimized over the set of all bipartite coupling states rho(AB) such that both of its reduced density matrices rho(A) and rho(B) of dimension N are fixed. We show that, selecting the quantum cost matrix to be proportional to the projector on the antisymmetric subspace, the minimal transport cost leads to a semidistance between rho(A) and rho(B), which is bounded from below by the rescaled Bures distance and from above by the root infidelity. In the single-qubit case, we provide a semianalytic expression for the optimal transport cost between any two states and prove that its square root satisfies the triangle inequality and yields an analog of the Wasserstein distance of the order of 2 on the set of density matrices. We introduce an associated measure of proximity of quantum states, called SWAP fidelity, and discuss its properties and applications in quantum machine learning.

AB The quantum speed limit and the Wigner function of open system models are studied. To this end, the phase covariant and a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath via position-dependent coupling are used. The dependence of the coupling on the position of the qubits allows for the study of the dynamics in the collective regime, which is conducive to speeding up the evolution. An interesting interplay is observed between non-Markovian behavior, quantumness, and the quantum speed limit. The presence of quantum correlations is seen to speed up the evolution.

The first technique describes how to use the outcome of a prior greedy classical algorithm to define an initial quantum state and mixing operation to adjust the quantum optimization algorithm to explore the possible answers around this initial greedy solution. The second technique is used to nudge the quantum exploration to avoid the local minima around the greedy solutions. To analyze the benefits of these two techniques we run the quantum algorithm on known hard instances of the Knapsack Problem using unit depth quantum circuits. The results show that the adjusted quantum optimization heuristics typically perform better than various classical heuristics.

TI Recovery for secret key in CTIDH-512 through Fault Injection Attack
SO COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB Isogeny-based cryptography is secure in a quantum computing environment and offers relatively small key sizes compared to other post-quantum cryptographic schemes. However, the CSIDH isogeny-based cryptography scheme is vulnerable to fault injection attacks, particularly the Disorientation Attack. This paper analyzes the Disorientation Attack on CSIDH and proposes an optimized method to recover the secret key for CTIDH, an extension of CSIDH. In CTIDH, the secret key is divided into multiple batches. The sign of each batch determines whether its isogeny operations proceed in a positive or negative direction. We explore the feasibility of adapting this attack to CTIDH to recover the secret keys. However, because of the unique isogeny operation in CTIDH, direct key recovery presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose an optimized Disorientation Attack for CTIDH, utilizing the differences in the number of points across batches. We also present the details and results of the implementation. Additionally, using the recovered secret keys from this optimized attack, we can enhance the existing Disorientation Attack to recover additional key values.

TI Exploiting degeneracy in belief propagation decoding of quantum codes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information needs to be protected by quantum error-correcting codes due to imperfect physical devices and operations. One would like to have an efficient and high-performance decoding procedure for the class of quantum stabilizer codes. A potential candidate is Gallager's sum-product algorithm, also known as Pearl's belief propagation (BP), but its performance suffers from the many short cycles inherent in a quantum stabilizer code, especially highly-degenerate codes. A general impression exists that BP is not effective for topological codes. In this paper, we propose a decoding algorithm for quantum codes based on quaternary BP with additional memory effects (called MBP). This MBP is like a recursive neural network with inhibitions between neurons (edges with negative weights), which enhance the perception capability of a network. Moreover, MBP exploits the degeneracy of a quantum code so that the most probable error or its degenerate errors can be found with high probability. The decoding performance is significantly improved over the conventional BP for various quantum codes, including quantum bicycle, hypergraph-product, surface and toric codes. For MBP on the surface and toric codes over depolarizing errors, we observe error thresholds of 16% and 17.5%, respectively.

TI Conversion of Arbitrary Three-Dimensional Polarization States to Regular
   States via Spin Cancellation
SO PHOTONICS
AB The present work is motivated by the necessity of handling and controlling three-dimensional polarization states, whose appropriate preparation has increasing interest in areas like nanotechnologies, quantum computing and near-field phenomena. By virtue of the so-called characteristic decomposition, any polarization state of light can be represented as an incoherent superposition of a pure state, a fully unpolarized state and a discriminating state. The discriminating component has nonzero spin in general, in which case the state is said to be nonregular. A simple procedure to transform an arbitrary nonregular state to a regular one through its incoherent composition with a pure state is described, resulting in a state that lacks a discriminating component. In addition, a method to suppress the spin vector of any given polarization state through its incoherent combination with a circularly polarized pure state is presented. Both approaches allow for the configuration of polarization states with simple features.

TI Quantum simulation of hadronic states with Rydberg-dressed atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The phenomenon of confinement is well known in high-energy physics and can also be realized for low-energy domain-wall excitations in one-dimensional quantum spin chains. A bound state consisting of two domain walls can behave like a meson, and recently, Vovrosh et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 040309 (2022)] demonstrated that a pair of mesons could dynamically form a metastable confinement-induced bound state (consisting of four domain walls) akin to a hadronic state. However, the protocol discussed by Vovrosh et al. involving the use of interactions with characteristically nonmonotonic distance dependence is not easy to come by in nature, thus posing a challenge for its experimental realization. In this regard, Rydberg atoms can provide the required platform for simulating confinement-related physics. We exploit the flexibility offered by interacting Rydberg-dressed atoms to engineering modified spin-spin interactions for the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. Our numerical simulations show how Rydberg-dressed interactions can give rise to a variety of effective potentials that are suitable for hadron formation, which opens the possibility of simulating confinement physics with Rydberg platforms as a viable alternative to current trapped-ion experiments.

TI Strong-coupling quantum logic of trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Essentially all known quantum gates rely on a weak-coupling approximation resulting in linear dynamics. With the explicit example of trapped ions, we show how high-fidelity quantum gates can be achieved outside such an approximation, and we derive readily implementable driving fields to realize gates with extremely high fidelities for ions well outside the Lamb-Dicke regime with motional temperatures achievable by only Doppler cooling.

TI A novel quantum algorithm for efficient attractor search in gene
   regulatory networks
SO PATTERNS
AB Describing gene interactions in cells is challenging due to their complexity and the limited microscopic detail available. Boolean networks offer a powerful, coarse-grained approach to modeling these dynamics using binary agents and their interactions. In this context, attractors-stable states of the system-are associated with biological phenotypes, making their identification biologically important. However, traditional computing struggles with the exponential growth of the state space in such models. Here, we present a novel quantum search algorithm for identifying attractors in synchronous Boolean networks, specifically designed for use on quantum computers. The algorithm iteratively suppresses known attractor basins, increasing the probability of detecting new ones. Unlike classical methods, it guarantees the discovery of a new attractor in each run. Early tests demonstrate strong resilience to noise on current NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) devices, marking a promising advance toward practical quantum-enhanced biological modeling.

TI Non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement and
   entanglement asymmetry: exact asymptotics in Rule 54
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of quantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss their non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet interacting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the more analytically tractable "charged moments", i.e. traces of powers of a suitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms of a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local algebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments, valid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the relevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially with the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.

TI Entanglement of a pair of quantum emitters via continuous fluorescence
   measurements: a tutorial
SO ADVANCES IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
AB We discuss recent developments in measurement protocols that generate quantum entanglement between two remote qubits, focusing on the theory of joint continuous detection of their spontaneous emission. We consider a device geometry similar to that used in well-known Bell state measurements, which we analyze using a conceptually transparent model of stochastic quantum trajectories; we use this to review photodetection, the most straightforward case, and then generalize to the diffusive trajectories from homodyne and heterodyne detection as well. Such quadrature measurement schemes are a realistic two-qubit extension of existing circuit QED experiments, which obtain quantum trajectories by homodyning or heterodyning a superconducting qubit's spontaneous emission, or an adaptation of existing optical measurement schemes to obtain jump trajectories from emitters. We mention key results, presented from within a single theoretical framework, and draw connections to concepts in the wider literature on entanglement generation by measurement (such as path information erasure and entanglement swapping). The photon which-path information acquisition, and therefore the two-qubit entanglement yield, is tunable under the homodyne detection scheme we discuss, at best generating equivalent average entanglement dynamics as in the comparable photodetection case. In addition to deriving this known equivalence, we extend past analyses in our characterization of the measurement dynamics: we include derivations of bounds on the fastest possible evolution toward a Bell state under joint homodyne measurement dynamics and characterize the maximal entanglement yield possible using inefficient (lossy) measurements.

TI Parallelizing process model integration for model predictive control
   through oracle design and analysis for a Grover's algorithm-inspired
   optimization strategy
SO DIGITAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB In model predictive control (MPC), a process dynamic model is utilized to make predictions of the value of the objective function and constraints throughout a prediction horizon. In one method of solving this problem, the time required to find the optimal values of the decision variables depends on the time required to perform the arithmetic operations involved in computing the model predictions. Methods for attempting to reduce the computation time of an MPC could then include developing approximate (reduced-order or data-driven) models for a system that take less time to solve, or to parallelize the computations using, for example, multiple cores or CPU's. However, an observation in all of these cases is that the values of the process states across the prediction horizon are not the values returned by the optimization problem; the manipulated input trajectory is the desired decision variable. An optimization strategy that cannot explicitly return the process states but can generate some representation of them that then leads to computation of the desired process input would thus be suitable for MPC. Quantum computers achieve their parallelism through creating values that cannot all be returned. They can then operate on this set of values to return a number that is meaningful with respect to that set of values that could not all be returned. Motivated by this, we wish to investigate an idea for utilizing quantum parallelism in developing a representation of an objective function that depends on the solution of a process dynamic model, but then only returning the control actions that minimize the objective function value dependent on those solutions. To do this, several steps are necessary. The first is to locate a quantum algorithm which has the desired characteristics for achieving the goals. In this work, we perform these steps using an amplitude amplification strategy based on Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer. The second is to analyze the algorithm with respect to its ability to translate across problems in the MPC domain, with respect to both its ability to handle nonlinear systems and to handle a variety of different structures of the set of all possible objective function values given the allowable values of the decision variables. We thus evaluate the benefits and limitations of the algorithm from this perspective. We do not wish to imply that this algorithm is more computationally-tractable for use with MPC than classical optimization techniques traditionally applied in an MPC context. Rather, we wish to understand the manner in which such an algorithm would be designed and when it is appropriate for MPC problems (in the sense of returning the correct answers to the optimization problem), as a step toward better understanding the interactions of the quantum properties of quantum algorithms with control goals. We also see this as forming an important first step in algorithm design/analysis, which can then translate to future works in comparing this technique computationally with classical "competitor"algorithms to guide further work in searching for relevant quantum algorithms for control applications.

TI High-Fidelity, Frequency-Flexible Two-Qubit Fluxonium Gates with a
   Transmon Coupler
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We propose and demonstrate an architecture for fluxonium-fluxonium two-qubit gates mediated by transmon couplers (FTF, for fluxonium-transmon-fluxonium). Relative to architectures that exclusively rely on a direct coupling between fluxonium qubits, FTF enables stronger couplings for gates using noncomputational states while simultaneously suppressing the static controlled-phase entangling rate (ZZ) down to kilohertz levels, all without requiring strict parameter matching. Here, we implement FTF with a flux-tunable transmon coupler and demonstrate a microwave-activated controlled-Z (CZ) gate whose operation frequency can be tuned over a 2-GHz range, adding frequency allocation freedom for FTFs in larger systems. Across this range, state-of-the-art CZ gate fidelities are observed over many bias points and reproduced across the two devices characterized in this work. After optimizing both the operation frequency and the gate duration, we achieve peak CZ fidelities in the 99.85%-99.9% range. Finally, we implement model-free reinforcement learning of the pulse parameters to boost the mean gate fidelity up to 99.922% + 0.009%, averaged over roughly an hour between scheduled training runs. Beyond the microwave-activated CZ gate we present here, FTF can be applied to a variety of other fluxonium gate schemes to improve gate fidelities and passively reduce unwanted ZZ interactions.

TI Deterministic Shaping of Quantum Light Statistics
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a theoretical method for the deterministic shaping of quantum light via photon number state selective interactions. Nonclassical states of light are an essential resource for high-precision optical techniques that rely on photon correlations and noise reshaping. Notable techniques include quantum enhanced interferometry, ghost imaging, and generating fault-tolerant codes for continuous variable optical quantum computing. We show that a class of nonlinear-optical resonators can transform many-photon wavefunctions to produce structured states of light with nonclassical noise statistics. The devices, based on parametric down conversion, utilize the Kerr effect to tune photon-number-dependent frequency matching, inducing photon-number-selective interactions. With a high-amplitude coherent pump, the number-selective interaction shapes the noise of a two-mode squeezed cavity state with minimal dephasing, illustrated with simulations. We specify the requisite material properties to build the device and highlight the remaining material degrees of freedom which offer flexible material design.

TI Exploiting Gaussian steering to probe non-Markovianity due to the
   interaction with a structured environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We put forward a measure based on Gaussian steering to quantify the non-Markovianity of continuous-variable (CV) Gaussian quantum channels. We employ the proposed measure to assess and compare the non-Markovianity of a quantum Brownian motion (QBM) channel, originating from the interaction with Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments with spectral densities described by a Lorentz-Drude cutoff, both at high and low temperatures, showing that sub-Ohmic, high-temperature environments lead to highly non-Markovian evolution, with cyclic backflows of Gaussian steerability from the environment to the system. Our results add to the understanding of the interplay between quantum correlations and non-Markovianity for CV systems, and could be implemented at the experimental level to quantify non-Markovianity in some physical scenarios.

TI A quantum algorithm for spin chemistry: a Bayesian exchange coupling
   parameter calculator with broken-symmetry wave functions
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The Heisenberg exchange coupling parameter J (H = -2JS(i) center dot S-j) characterises the isotropic magnetic interaction between unpaired electrons, and it is one of the most important spin Hamiltonian parameters of multi-spin open shell systems. The J value is related to the energy difference between high-spin and low-spin states, and thus computing the energies of individual spin states are necessary to obtain the J values from quantum chemical calculations. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm, B_ayesian ex_change coupling parameter calculator with b_roken-symmetry wave functions (BxB), which is capable of computing the J value directly, without calculating the energies of individual spin states. The BxB algorithm is composed of the quantum simulations of the time evolution of a broken-symmetry wave function under the Hamiltonian with an additional term jS(2), the wave function overlap estimation with the SWAP test, and Bayesian optimisation of the parameter j. Numerical quantum circuit simulations for H-2 under a covalent bond dissociation, C, O, Si, NH, OH+, CH2, NF, O-2, and triple bond dissociated N-2 molecule revealed that the BxB can compute the J value within 1 kcal mol(-1) of errors with less computational costs than conventional quantum phase estimation-based approaches.

TI Lazy Qubit Reordering for Accelerating Parallel State-Vector-based
   Quantum Circuit Simulation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB This article proposes two quantum operation scheduling methods for accelerating parallel state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed methods reduce all-to-all communication caused by qubit reordering, which can dominate the overhead of parallel simulation. Our out-of-order approach eliminates redundant reorderings by introducing intentional delays in reordering communications such that multiple reorderings can be aggregated into a single reordering. The delays are carefully introduced based on the principles of time-space tiling, or a cache optimization technique for classical computers, which we use to arrange the execution order of quantum operations. Moreover, we develop these methods tailored for two primary procedures in variational quantum eigensolver simulation: quantum state update (QSU) and expectation value computation (EVC). Our QSU simulation takes an advantage of the hierarchical interconnection of GPU systems to avoid slow inter-node communication. On the other hand, our EVC simulation reduces the number of reorderings by diagonalization of Pauli strings. Experimental validation on 32-GPU executions demonstrates acceleration in QSU and EVC-up to 54x and 1,657x, respectively-compared to an inorder-based method. We believe that our out-of-order approach is useful for accelerating large-scale quantum circuit simulations, including QSU and/or EVC that operate qubits in a regular manner.

TI Continuously Parametrized Quantum Simulation of Molecular
   Electron-Transfer Reactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A comprehensive description of molecular electron-transfer reactions is essential for our understanding of fundamental phenomena in bioenergetics and molecular electronics. However, experimental studies of molecular systems in condensed-phase environments face difficulties in independently controlling the parameters that govern the transfer mechanism with high precision. We show that, instead, trapped-ion experiments allow us to reproduce and continuously connect vastly different regimes of molecular charge transfer through precise tuning of, e.g., the phonon temperature, electron-phonon interaction, and electronic coupling. Such a setting does not only allow us to reproduce widely used transport models, such as Marcus theory. It also provides access to transfer regimes that are unattainable for molecular experiments, while controlling and measuring the relevant observables on the level of individual quanta. Our numerical simulations predict an unconventional quantum transfer regime, featuring a transition from quantum adiabatic to resonance-assisted transfer as a function of the donor-acceptor energy gap, which can be reached by increasing the electronic coupling at low temperatures. Trapped-ion-based quantum simulations thus promise to enhance our microscopic understanding of molecular electron-transfer processes and may help to reveal efficient design principles for synthetic devices.

   Imaged by Rabi Oscillation Mapping
SO NANO LETTERS
AB With rapid advances in qubit technologies, techniques for localizing, modulating, and measuring RF fields and their impact on qubit performance are of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that flux-channeling from a permalloy nanowire can be used to achieve localized spatial modulation of an RF field and that the modulated field can be mapped with high resolution by using the Rabi oscillations of an NV center. Rabi maps reveal similar to 100 mm wavelength microwaves concentrated in sub-300 nm regions with up to similar to 16x power enhancement. This modulation is robust over a 20 dBm power range and has no adverse impact on NV T 2 coherence time. Micromagnetic simulations confirm that the modulated field results from the nanowire's stray field through its constructive/destructive interference with the incident RF field. Our findings provide a new pathway for controlling qubits, amplifying RF signals, and mapping local fields in various on-chip RF technologies.

TI Realizing solution-phase room temperature quantum coherence in a
   tetrathiafulvalene-based diradicaloid complex
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Molecular electron spins are promising candidates as scalable and tunable qubits but often suffer from undesirable decomposition pathways. Furthermore, significant spin-lattice relaxation and nuclear spin-mediated decoherence limit their applications. While advances in the synthesis of new molecular electron spin qubit candidates have led to improved coherence lifetimes, one key question is whether coherence can be maintained under conditions relevant for employment as quantum sensors. Here, we report a luminescent tetrathiafulvalene-based molecular qubit candidate with diradicaloid character centered on a nuclear-spin-free bridging ligand. This unique air-and water-stable scaffold exhibits a long electron spin decoherence time of hundreds of nanoseconds at ambient temperatures and in nuclear-spin-rich protonated solvents. These results distinguish this system as a promising candidate for the development of novel room temperature, solution-phase quantum sensing technologies and suggest that molecular electron spin qubits can be ideal candidates for these applications.

TI Fricke Topological Qubits
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We recently proposed that topological quantum computing might be based on SL(2,C) representations of the fundamental group pi 1(S-3\K) for the complement of a link K in the three-sphere. The restriction to links whose associated SL(2,C) character variety V contains a Fricke surface kappa(d )= xyz-x(2)-y(2)-z(2)+d is desirable due to the connection of Fricke spaces to elementary topology. Taking K as the Hopf link L2a1, one of the three arithmetic two-bridge links (the Whitehead link 5(1)(2), the Berge link 6(2)(2) or the double-eight link 6(3)(2)) or the link 7(3)(2), the V for those links contains the reducible component kappa(4), the so-called Cayley cubic. In addition, the V for the latter two links contains the irreducible component kappa(3), or kappa(2), respectively. Taking rho to be a representation with character kappa(d) (d<4), with |x|,|y|,|z|<= 2, then rho(pi(1)) fixes a unique point in the hyperbolic space H-3 and is a conjugate to a SU(2) representation (a qubit). Even though details on the physical implementation remain open, more generally, we show that topological quantum computing may be developed from the point of view of three-bridge links, the topology of the four-punctured sphere and Painleve VI equation. The 0-surgery on the three circles of the Borromean rings L6a4 is taken as an example.

TI Integrable quantum many-body sensors for AC field sensing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum sensing is inevitably an elegant example of the supremacy of quantum technologies over their classical counterparts. One of the desired endeavors of quantum metrology is AC field sensing. Here, by means of analytical and numerical analysis, we show that integrable many-body systems can be exploited efficiently for detecting the amplitude of an AC field. Unlike the conventional strategies in using the ground states in critical many-body probes for parameter estimation, we only consider partial access to a subsystem. Due to the periodicity of the dynamics, any local block of the system saturates to a steady state which allows achieving sensing precision well beyond the classical limit, almost reaching the Heisenberg bound. We associate the enhanced quantum precision to closing of the Floquet gap, resembling the features of quantum sensing in the ground state of critical systems. We show that the proposed protocol can also be realized in near-term quantum simulators, e.g. ion-traps, with a limited number of qubits. We show that in such systems a simple block magnetization measurement and a Bayesian inference estimator can achieve very high precision AC field sensing.

TI Implementation of Shor's algorithm with a single photon in 32 dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Photonics has been a promising platform for implementing quantum technologies owing to its scalability and robustness. In this paper, we demonstrate the encoding of information in 32 time bins or dimensions of a single photon. A practical scheme for manipulating the single photon in high dimensions is experimentally realized to implement a compiled version of Shor's algorithm on a single photon. Our work demonstrates the powerful information-processing capacity of a high-dimensional quantum system for complex quantum information tasks.

TI Landau-Zener without a qubit: multiphoton sidebands interaction and
   signatures of dissipative quantum chaos
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Landau-Zener-St & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference occurs when qubit parameters are periodically modulated across avoided level crossings. We explore this phenomenon in nonlinear multilevel bosonic systems, where interference is influenced by multiple energy levels. We fabricate two superconducting resonators with flux-tunable Josephson junction arrays. The first device, exhibiting weak nonlinearity, behaves like a linear resonator under weak driving but shows LZSM interference akin to two-level systems. With stronger driving, nonlinear effects alter the interference pattern. We theoretically demonstrate that merging LZSM peaks can lead to dissipative quantum chaos. In the second device, where nonlinearity exceeds photon-loss rates, we observe additional LZSM peaks from Kerr multiphoton resonances. Under Floquet theory, these resonances represent synthetic modes of coupled nonlinear cavities, revealing effective coupling as modulation parameters vary. Our findings advance the understanding of LZSM physics and emphasize the control of nonlinear Floquet states and the emergence of chaos in engineered systems, with significant implications for novel applications in quantum dynamics and quantum control.

TI Incorporating high-accuracy, finite-volume shock stabilization methods
   into a quantum algorithm for nonlinear partial differential equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Conservation laws are of fundamental importance in science and engineering, and so are ubiquitous in applications. For continuum systems such as classical fluids and plasmas, they give rise to coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) whose solutions can develop discontinuities such as shocks. Finite-volume (FV) methods are an important tool for finding approximate solutions to such PDEs as they are based on an integral formulation of the conservation laws that can handle the presence of discontinuities. Weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) methods are a class of high-resolution methods that can (i) produce solutions of arbitrarily high-order accuracy in regions where the solution is smooth, while (ii) simultaneously quashing the development of nonphysical oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities that often cause numerical simulations to fail. In this paper we show how FV and WENO methods can be incorporated into a quantum algorithm for solving systems of nonlinear PDEs (QPDE) introduced by one of the authors. We numerically simulate application of the modified QPDE algorithm to three verification problems. The first has a smooth solution, while the other two are well-known one-dimensional Riemann problems whose exact solutions contain moving shocks, contact discontinuities, and rarefaction waves. For all three problems excellent agreement is found between the results of the QPDE simulations and the exact solutions.

TI Ensemble-based quantum token protocol benchmarked on IBM quantum
   processors
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum tokens envision to store unclonable quantum states in a physical device, with the goal of being used for personal authentication protocols, as required by banks. Still, the experimental realization of such devices faces many technical challenges, which can be partially mitigated using ensembles instead of single qubits. In this work, we thus propose an ensemble-based quantum token protocol, describing it through a simple yet general model based on a quantum mechanical observable. The protocol is benchmarked on five IBM quantum processors and a general hacker attack scenario is analyzed, in which the attacker attempts to read the bank token and forge a fake one, based on the information gained from this measurement. We experimentally demonstrate that the probability that the bank erroneously accepts a forged coin composed of multiple tokens can reach values below 10-22, while the probability that the bank accepts its own coin is above 0.999. The overall security of the protocol is therefore demonstrated within a hardware-agnostic framework, confirming the practical viability of the protocol in arbitrary quantum systems and thus paving the way for future applications with different ensembles of qubits, such as color center defects in solids.

TI Neural quantum kernels: Training quantum kernels with quantum neural
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum and classical machine learning have been naturally connected through kernel methods, which have also served as proof-of-concept for quantum advantage. Quantum embeddings encode classical data into quantum feature states, enabling the construction of embedding quantum kernels (EQKs) by measuring vector similarities and projected quantum kernels (PQKs) through projections of these states. However, in both approaches, the model is influenced by the choice of the embedding. In this work, we propose using the training of a quantum neural network (QNN) to construct neural quantum kernels, specifically neural EQKs and neural PQKs-problem-inspired kernel functions. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires the kernel matrix to be constructed only once, significantly reducing computational overhead. To achieve this, we introduce a scalable training method for an n-qubit data reuploading QNN. Furthermore, we demonstrate neural quantum kernels can alleviate exponential concentration and enhance generalization capabilities compared to problem-agnostic kernels, positioning them as a scalable and robust solution for quantum machine learning applications.

TI On the coupling of three-level quantum refrigerators in the weak
   coupling limit
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We propose a model of two identical autonomous quantum refrigerators that interact through their qubits coupled to cold thermal baths. We consider the same specific disposition for each refrigerator related to a three-level system coupled to different thermal baths and, in turn, to a qubit as the object to be cooled. By coupling the two systems, we show that under certain conditions on the model parameters, the devices can operate in the regime of an independent autonomous quantum refrigerator or be subject to an adjustment of the thermodynamic performances. We further investigate the correlations induced by the interaction between the two refrigerators, and illustrate their behavior with respect to their thermodynamic performances. We have found that adjusting the different interaction constants of the model can lead to an evolution of the quantum correlations of the two machines that is inversely related to the behavior of the thermodynamic quantities of both refrigerators. However, this is not necessarily the case when the temperatures of the model are considered as the reference parameters.

TI Asymptotically consistent measures of general quantum resources:
   Discord, non-Markovianity, and non-Gaussianity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum resource theories provide a unified framework to quantitatively analyze inherent quantum properties as resources for quantum information processing. So as to investigate the best way for quantifying resources, desirable axioms for resource quantification have been extensively studied through axiomatic approaches. However, a conventional way of resource quantification by resource measures with such desired axioms may contradict rates of asymptotic transformation between resourceful quantum states due to an approximation in the transformation. In this paper we establish an alternative axiom, asymptotic consistency of resource measures, and we investigate asymptotically consistent resource measures, which quantify resources without contradicting the rates of the asymptotic resource transformation. We prove that relative entropic measures are consistent with the rates for a broad class of resources, i.e., all convex finite-dimensional resources, e.g., entanglement, coherence, and magic, and even some nonconvex or infinite-dimensional resources such as quantum discord, non-Markovianity, and non-Gaussianity. These results show that consistent resource measures are widely applicable to the quantitative analysis of various inherent quantum-mechanical properties.

TI Exploring a quantum-information-relevant magnonic material: Ultralow
   damping at low temperature in the organic ferrimagnet
   V[TCNE]x
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Quantum information science and engineering require novel low-loss magnetic materials for magnon-based quantum-coherent operations. The search for low-loss magnetic materials, traditionally driven by applications in microwave electronics near room temperature, has gained additional constraints from the need to operate at cryogenic temperatures for many applications in quantum information science and technology. Whereas yttrium iron garnet (YIG) has been the material of choice for decades, the emergence of molecule-based materials with robust magnetism and ultra-low damping has opened new avenues for exploration. Specifically, thin films of vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE](x)) can be patterned into the multiple, connected structures needed for hybrid quantum elements and have shown room-temperature Gilbert damping (alpha = 4 x 10(-5)) that rivals the intrinsic (bulk) damping otherwise seen only in highly polished YIG spheres (far more challenging to integrate into arrays). Here, the authors present a comprehensive and systematic study of the low-temperature magnetization dynamics for V[TCNE](x) thin films, with implications for their application in quantum systems. These studies reveal a temperature-driven, strain-dependent magnetic anisotropy that compensates the thin-film shape anisotropy and the recovery of a magnetic resonance linewidth at 5 K that is comparable to room-temperature values (roughly 2 G at 9.4 GHz). The authors can account for these variations of the V[TCNE](x) linewidth within the context of scattering from very dilute paramagnetic impurities and anticipate additional linewidth narrowing as the temperature is further reduced.

InGaN/GaN quantum dots are promising candidates for the development of single-photon emitters but have typically exhibited emission with insufficient purity. Here, pulsed single-photon emission with high purity is measured from an InGaN quantum dot. A raw g((2))(0) value of 0.043 +/- 0.009 with no corrections whatsoever is achieved under quasi-resonant pulsed excitation. Such a low value is, in principle, sufficient for use in quantum key distribution systems. (c) 2021 Author(s).

TI Optimal resource allocation in practical quantum keydistribution optical
   networks br
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the application research of large-scale quantum communication network, one generally realizes resourceallocation by constructing virtual service network and mapping it to actual physical space. In this mappingprocess, some assumptions are often made to simplify the model. For example, the key resource in the physicaltopology is assumed to be a fixed value, that is, the actual physical conditions and the performance differencesof key supply caused by different protocols are ignored. This assumption may lead the network to fail to runappropriately in practical applications. In order to solve the above problems, from the perspective of linkmapping, this paper proposes an improved virtual service mapping model and virtual service mapping algorithmwith the quantum key distribution optical network as the underlying network, which makes it closer to theactual application scenario. On the one hand, by increasing the constraints of geographical location, the rangefrom virtual nodes to the mappable physical nodes is reasonably restricted. On the other hand, from theperspective of hardware cost and actual key generation rate, the cost performance evaluation index is proposedto allocate and manage resources. In addition, by combining three mainstream quantum key distributionprotocols (BB84, measurement-device-independent, and twin-field), we construct a universal virtual servicemapping model in the quantum key distribution optical network, and realize the recommendation of the optimalprotocol and the optimal allocation and management of resources

TI Two-dimensional control of a biphoton joint spectrum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Control over the joint spectral amplitude of a photon pair has proved highly desirable for many quantum applications, since it contains the spectral quantum correlations, and has crucial effects on the indistinguishability of photons, as well as promising emerging applications involving complex quantum functions and frequency encoding of qudits. Until today, this has been achieved by engineering a single degree of freedom, either by custom poling nonlinear crystal or by shaping the pump pulse. We present a combined approach where two degrees of freedom, the phase -matching function, and the pump spectrum, are controlled. This approach enables the two-dimensional control of the joint spectral amplitude, generating a variety of spectrally encoded quantum states - including frequency uncorrelated states, frequency -bin Bell states, and biphoton qudit states. In addition, the joint spectral amplitude is controlled by photon bunching and anti -bunching, reflecting the symmetry of the phase -matching function.

TI Quantifying Quantum Coherence in Polariton Condensates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We theoretically and experimentally investigate quantum features of an interacting light-matter system from a multidisciplinary perspective, combining approaches from semiconductor physics, quantum optics, and quantum-information science. To this end, we quantify the amount of quantum coherence that results from the quantum superposition of Fock states, constituting a measure of the resourcefulness of the produced state for modern quantum protocols. This notion of quantum coherence from quantum-information theory is distinct from other quantifiers of nonclassicality that have previously been applied to condensed-matter systems. As an archetypal example of a hybrid light-matter interface, we study a polariton condensate and implement a numerical model to predict its properties. Our simulation is confirmed by our proof-of-concept experiment in which we measure and analyze the phase-space distributions of the emitted light. Specifically, we drive a polariton microcavity across the condensation threshold and observe the transition from an incoherent thermal state to a coherent state in the emission, thus confirming the buildup of quantum coherence in the condensate itself.

TI Quantum Emitter Formation Dynamics and Probing of Radiation-Induced
   Atomic Disorder in Silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Near-infrared color centers in silicon are emerging candidates for on-chip integrated quantum emitters, optical-access quantum memories, and sensing. We access ensemble G-color-center formation dynamics and radiation-induced atomic disorder in silicon for a series of megaelectronvolt proton-flux conditions. The photoluminescence results reveal that the G centers are formed more efficiently by pulsed-proton irradiation than by continuous-wave proton irradiation. The enhanced transient excitations and dynamic annealing within nanoseconds allows optimization of the ratio of G-center formation to nonradiative defect accumulation. The G centers preserve narrow line widths of about 0.1 nm when they are generated by moderate pulsed-proton fluences, while the line width broadens significantly as the pulsed-proton fluence increases. This implies vacancy or interstitial clustering by overlapping collision cascades. The tracking of G-center properties for a series of irradiation conditions enables sensitive probing of atomic disorder, serving as a complementary analytical method for sensing damage accumulation. Aided by ab initio electronic structure calculations, we provide insight into the atomic disorder induced inhomogeneous broadening by introducing vacancies, silicon interstitials, and oriented strain fields in the vicinity of a G center. A vacancy leads to a tensile strain and can result in either a red shift or a blue shift of the G-center emission, depending on its position relative to the G center. Meanwhile, Si interstitials lead to compressive strain, which results in a monotonic red shift. High-flux and tunable ion pulses enable the exploration of the fundamental dynamics of radiation-induced defects as well as methods for the optimization of G-center formation and qubit synthesis for quantum information processing.

TI Photonic resource state generation from a minimal number of quantum
   emitters
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Multi-photon entangled graph states are a fundamental resource in quantum communication networks, distributed quantum computing, and sensing. These states can in principle be created deterministically from quantum emitters such as optically active quantum dots or defects, atomic systems, or superconducting qubits. However, finding efficient schemes to produce such states has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we present an algorithm that, given a desired multi-photon graph state, determines the minimum number of quantum emitters and precise operation sequences that can produce it. The algorithm itself and the resulting operation sequence both scale polynomially in the size of the photonic graph state, allowing one to obtain efficient schemes to generate graph states containing hundreds or thousands of photons.

TI Tight Bounds from Multiple-Observable Entropic Uncertainty Relations
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The additivity properties for both bipartite and multipartite systems are investigated by using entropic uncertainty relations (EUR) defined in terms of the joint Shannon entropy of probabilities of local measurement outcomes. In particular, state-independent and state-dependent entropic inequalities are introduced. Interestingly, the violation of these inequalities is strictly connected with the presence of quantum correlations. It is shown that the additivity of EUR holds only for EUR that involve two observables, while this is not the case for inequalities that consider more than two observables or the addition of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem. They are applied to bipartite systems and to several classes of states of a three-qubit system.
   Entropic uncertainty relations (EURs) are inequalities that express preparation uncertainty as sums of Shannon entropies of probability distributions of measurement outcomes. The additivity properties of EURs for joint Shannon entropies of probabilities of local measurement outcomes with bipartite and multipartite systems and investigate the relation between uncertainty and quantum correlations is studied. Hence, new criteria for separability are found. image

TI Towards minimal self-testing of qubit states and measurements in
   prepare-and-measure scenarios
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Self-testing is a promising approach to certifying quantum states or measurements. Originally, it relied solely on the outcome statistics of the measurements involved in a device-independent (DI) setup. Extra physical assumptions about the system make the setup semi-DI. In the latter approach, we consider a prepare-and-measure scenario in which the dimension of the mediating particle is assumed to be two. In a setup involving four (three) preparations and three (two) projective measurements in addition to the target, we exemplify how to self-test any four- (three-) outcome extremal positive operator-valued measure using a linear witness. One of our constructions also achieves self-testing of any number of states with the help of as many projective measurements as the dimensionality of the space spanned by the corresponding Bloch vectors. These constructions are conjectured to be minimal in terms of the number of preparations and measurements required. In addition, we implement one of our prepare-and-measure constructionson IBM and IonQ quantum processors and certify the existence of a complex qubit Hilbert space based on the data obtained from these experiments.

TI Multiparameter estimation for qubit states with collective measurements:
   a case study
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum estimation involving multiple parameters remains an important problem of both theoretical and practical interest. In this work, we study the problem of simultaneous estimation of two parameters that are respectively associate with the length and direction of the Bloch vector for identically prepared qubit states that is confined to a plane, where in order to obtain the optimal estimation precision for both parameters, collective measurements on multiple qubits are necessary. Upon treating N qubits as an ensemble of spin-1/2 systems, we show that simultaneous optimal estimation for both parameters can be attained asymptotically with a simple collective measurement strategy-first, we estimate the length parameter by measuring the populations in spaces corresponding to different total angular momentum values j, then we estimate the direction parameter by performing a spin projection onto an optimal basis. Furthermore, we show that when the state is nearly pure, for sufficiently but not arbitrarily large N, most information will be captured in the largest three j-subspaces. Then, we study how the total angular-momentum measurement can be realized by observing output signatures from a Bell multiport setup, either exactly for N = 2, 3, or approximately when the qubits are nearly pure for other N values. We also obtain numerical results that suggest that using a Bell multiport setup, one can distinguish between projection onto the j = N/2 and j = N/2 - 1 subspaces from their respective interference signatures at the output.

TI An Enhanced Quantum K-Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm Based on
   Polar Distance
SO ENTROPY
AB The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is one of the most extensively used classification algorithms, while its high time complexity limits its performance in the era of big data. The quantum K-nearest neighbor (QKNN) algorithm can handle the above problem with satisfactory efficiency; however, its accuracy is sacrificed when directly applying the traditional similarity measure based on Euclidean distance. Inspired by the Polar coordinate system and the quantum property, this work proposes a new similarity measure to replace the Euclidean distance, which is defined as Polar distance. Polar distance considers both angular and module length information, introducing a weight parameter adjusted to the specific application data. To validate the efficiency of Polar distance, we conducted various experiments using several typical datasets. For the conventional KNN algorithm, the accuracy performance is comparable when using Polar distance for similarity measurement, while for the QKNN algorithm, it significantly outperforms the Euclidean distance in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, the Polar distance shows scalability and robustness superior to the Euclidean distance, providing an opportunity for the large-scale application of QKNN in practice.

TI Majorisation-minimisation algorithm for optimal state discrimination in
   quantum communications
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Designing optimal measurement operators for quantum state discrimination (QSD) is an important problem in quantum communications and cryptography applications. Prior works have demonstrated that optimal quantum measurement operators can be obtained by solving a convex semidefinite program (SDP). However, solving the SDP can represent a high computational burden for many real-time quantum communication systems. To address this issue, a majorisation-minimisation (MM)-based algorithm, called Quantum Majorisation-Minimisation (QMM) is proposed for solving the QSD problem. In QMM, the authors reparametrise the original objective, then tightly upper-bound it at any given iterate, and obtain the next iterate as a closed-form solution to the upper-bound minimisation problem. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed QMM algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SDP algorithm in terms of speed, while maintaining comparable performance for solving QSD problems in quantum communication applications.

TI Simple accurate model of silicon donor arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Donors in silicon can now be positioned with an accuracy of about one lattice constant, making it possible to form donor arrays for quantum computation or quantum simulation applications. However, the multivalley character of the silicon conduction band combines with central cell corrections to the donor states to convert small atomic scale imperfections in donor placement into strong interdonor hybridization disorder. We present a simple model that is able to account for central cell corrections accurately, and use it to assess the impact of donor positional disorder on donor array properties in both itinerant and localized limits. Our results show that donor arrays in silicon simulate strongly disordered one-dimensional electrons.

TI High-intensity spatial-mode steerable frequency up-converter toward
   on-chip integration
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC SCIENCE
AB Integrated photonic devices are essential for on-chip optical communication, optical-electronic systems, and quantum information sciences. To develop a high-fidelity interface between photonics in various frequency domains without disturbing their quantum properties, nonlinear frequency conversion, typically steered with the quadratic (chi 2) process, should be considered. Furthermore, another degree of freedom in steering the spatial modes during the chi 2 process, with unprecedent mode intensity is proposed here by modulating the lithium niobate (LN) waveguide-based inter-mode quasi-phase-matching conditions with both temperature and wavelength parameters. Under high incident light intensities (25 and 27.8 dBm for the pump and the signal lights, respectively), mode conversion at the sum-frequency wavelength with sufficient high output power (-7-8 dBm) among the TM01, TM10, and TM00 modes is realized automatically with characterized broad temperature (Delta T >= 8 degrees C) and wavelength windows (Delta lambda >= 1 nm), avoiding the previous efforts in carefully preparing the signal or pump modes. The results prove that high-intensity spatial modes can be prepared at arbitrary transparent wavelength of the chi 2 media toward on-chip integration, which facilitates the development of chip-based communication and quantum information systems because spatial correlations can be applied to generate hyperentangled states and provide additional robustness in quantum error correction with the extended Hilbert space.

TI Quantum Variational Optimization of Ramsey Interferometry and Atomic
   Clocks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We discuss quantum variational optimization of Ramsey interferometry with ensembles of N entangled atoms, and its application to atomic clocks based on a Bayesian approach to phase estimation. We identify best input states and generalized measurements within a variational approximation for the corresponding entangling and decoding quantum circuits. These circuits are built from basic quantum operations available for the particular sensor platform, such as one-axis twisting, or finite range interactions. Optimization is defined relative to a cost function, which in the present study is the Bayesian mean squared error of the estimated phase for a given prior distribution; i.e., we optimize for a finite dynamic range of the interferometer. In analogous variational optimizations of optical atomic clocks, we use the Allan deviation for a given Ramsey interrogation time as the relevant cost function for the long-term instability. Remarkably, even low-depth quantum circuits yield excellent results that closely approach the fundamental quantum limits for optimal Ramsey interferometry and atomic clocks. The quantum metrological schemes identified here are readily applicable to atomic clocks based on optical lattices, tweezer arrays, or trapped ions. While in the present work variationally optimized circuits are found with classical simulations, optimization can also be performed "on" the (physical) quantum sensor, also in regimes not accessible to classical computations and in the presence of imperfections.

TI High-dimensional orbital angular momentum entanglement from an ultrathin
   nonlinear film
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Entanglement, as a crucial feature of quantum systems, is essential for various applications of quantum technologies. High-dimensional entanglement has the potential to encode arbitrary large amount of information and enhance robustness against eavesdropping and quantum cloning. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement can achieve the high-dimensional entanglement nearly for free stems due to its discrete and theoretically infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. A stringent limitation, however, is that the phase-matching condition limits the entanglement dimension because the coincidence rate decreases significantly for high-order modes. Here we demonstrate relatively flat high-dimensional OAM entanglement based on a spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) from an ultrathin nonlinear lithium niobite crystal. The difference of coincidences between the different-order OAM modes significantly decreases. To further enhance the nonlinear process, this microscale SPDC source will provide a promising and integrated method to generate optimal high-dimensional OAM entanglement.

TI Cryogenic packaging of nanophotonic devices with a low coupling loss

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Robust, low-loss photonic packaging of on-chip nanophotonic circuits is a key enabling technology for the deployment of integrated photonics in a variety of classical and quantum technologies including optical communications and quantum communications, sensing, and transduction. To date, no process has been established that enables permanent, broadband, and cryogenically compatible coupling with sub-dB losses from optical fibers to nanophotonic circuits. Here, we report a technique for reproducibly generating a permanently packaged interface between a tapered optical fiber and nanophotonic devices on diamond with a record-low coupling loss <1 dB per facet at near-infrared wavelengths (similar to 730 nm) that remains stable from 300 K to 30 mK. We further demonstrate the compatibility of this technique with etched lithium niobate on insulator waveguides. The technique lifts performance limitations imposed by scattering as light transfers between photonic devices and optical fibers, paving the way for scalable integration of photonic technologies at both room and cryogenic temperatures.

TI Tailoring solid-state single-photon sources with stimulated emissions
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Deterministic single-photon sources are a key building block for photonic quantum technologies. Stimulated emission now helps tailoring spontaneous emission from a ladder-type three-level system in a single epitaxial quantum dot for bright polarized sources with a high photon purity and indistinguishability.
   The coherent interaction of electromagnetic fields with solid-state two-level systems can yield deterministic quantum light sources for photonic quantum technologies. To date, the performance of semiconductor single-photon sources based on three-level systems is limited mainly due to a lack of high photon indistinguishability. Here we tailor the cavity-enhanced spontaneous emission from a ladder-type three-level system in a single epitaxial quantum dot through stimulated emission. After populating the biexciton (XX) of the quantum dot through two-photon resonant excitation, we use another laser pulse to selectively depopulate the XX state into an exciton (X) state with a predefined polarization. The stimulated XX-X emission modifies the X decay dynamics and improves the characteristics of a polarized single-photon source, such as a source brightness of 0.030(2), a single-photon purity of 0.998(1) and an indistinguishability of 0.926(4). Our method can be readily applied to existing quantum dot single-photon sources and expands the capabilities of three-level systems for advanced quantum photonic functionalities.

TI Creation of Boron Vacancies in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Exfoliated from
   Bulk Crystals for Quantum Sensing
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Boron vacancies (VB-) in hexagonal boron -nitride (hBN) have sparked great interest in recent years due to their optical and spin properties. Since hBN can be readily integrated into devices where it interfaces a huge variety of other 2D materials, boron vacancies may serve as a precise sensor which can be deployed at very close proximity to many important materials systems. Boron vacancy defects may be produced by a number of existing methods, the use of which may depend on the final application. Any method should reproducibly generate defects with controlled density and desired pattern. To date, however, detailed studies of such methods are missing. In this paper, we study various techniques for the preparation of hBN flakes from bulk crystals and relevant postprocessing treatments, namely, focused ion beam (FIB) implantation, for creation of VB(-)s as a function of flake thickness and defect concentrations. We find that flake thickness plays an important role when optimizing implantation parameters, while careful sample cleaning proved important to achieve consistent results.

Strong ranged interactions can be generated via Rydberg dressing, which opens up the path to exploring the physics of few interacting particles. Rather than the unit cells of a crystal, the sites of the optical lattice can now be interpreted as discretized space. This allows the study of completely new types of problems in a familiar architecture. We investigate the possibility of realizing problems akin to those found in quantum chemistry, although with a different scaling law in the interactions. Through numerical simulation, we show that simple pseudoatoms and pseudomolecules could be prepared with high fidelity in state-of-the-art experiments.

TI Generative model for learning quantum ensemble with optimal transport
   loss
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Generative modeling is an unsupervised machine learning framework, that exhibits strong performance in various machine learning tasks. Recently, we find several quantum versions of generative model, some of which are even proven to have quantum advantage. However, those methods are not directly applicable to construct a generative model for learning a set of quantum states, i.e., ensemble. In this paper, we propose a quantum generative model that can learn quantum ensemble, in an unsupervised machine learning framework. The key idea is to introduce a new loss function calculated based on optimal transport loss, which have been widely used in classical machine learning due to its good properties; e.g., no need to ensure the common support of two ensembles. We then give in-depth analysis on this measure, such as the scaling property of the approximation error. We also demonstrate the generative modeling with the application to quantum anomaly detection problem, that cannot be handled via existing methods. The proposed model paves the way for a wide application such as the health check of quantum devices and efficient initialization of quantum computation.

TI Quantum Spin Probe of Single Charge Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Electronic defects in semiconductors form the basis for emerging quantum technologies, but many defect centers are difficult to access at the single-particle level. A method for probing optically inactive spin defects would reveal semiconductor physics at the atomic scale and advance the study of new quantum systems. We exploit the intrinsic correlation between the charge and spin states of defect centers to measure the charge populations and dynamics of single substitutional nitrogen spin defects in diamond. By probing their steady-state spin population, read out at the single-defect level with a nearby nitrogen vacancy center, we directly measure the defect ionization-corroborated by first-principles calculations-an effect we do not have access to with traditional coherence-based quantum sensing.

TI Gravitational effects on quantum correlations in three-flavor neutrino

Meanwhile, in this case, the gravitational effects also make the distribution of entanglement tighter through investing the entanglement complete monogamy relation. Furthermore, we examine the gravitational effects on the violation of the Svetlichny inequality to study the nonlocality of the system. It is shown that when GM=6x108Km\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\textrm{GM}=6\times 10<^>8 \, \textrm{Km}$$\end{document} and GM=7x107Km\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\textrm{GM}=7\times 10<^>7 \, \textrm{Km}$$\end{document}, the gravitational effects make the Svetlichny parameters always greater than 4, implying that the genuine tripartite nonlocality of the system is always present. However, the gravitational effects also restrain the violation of the Svetlichny to make the regions of the absence of nonlocality increase. The gravitational effects on the monogamy property of nonlocality lies in the change of the effective bound of the maximum bipartite nonlocality of the neutrinos system. Therefore, our investigations may be helpful to understanding of quantumness of the neutrinos system in curved space-time.

TI Quantum generative adversarial learning in photonics
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), an intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, have attracted widespread attention due to their potential advantages over classical analogs. However, in the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, it is essential to investigate whether QGANs can perform learning tasks on near-term quantum devices usually affected by noise and even defects. In this Letter, using a programmable silicon quantum photonic chip, we experimentally demonstrate the QGAN model in photonics for the first time to our knowledge and investigate the effects of noise and defects on its performance. Our results show that QGANs can generate high-quality quantum data with a fidelity higher than 90%, even under conditions where up to half of the generator's phase shifters are damaged, or all of the generator and discriminator's phase shifters are subjected to phase noise up to 0.04 pi. Our work sheds light on the feasibility of implementing QGANs on the NISQ-era quantum hardware.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Compact superconducting vacuum-gap capacitors with low microwave loss
   and high mechanical coherence for scalable quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Vacuum-gap capacitors have recently attracted significant interest in superconducting circuit platforms due to their compact design and exceptionally low dielectric losses in the microwave regime. Their intrinsic ability to support mechanical vibrational modes makes them well suited for circuit optomechanics. However, precise control over the gap size and the realization of high-coherence mechanical modes remain longstanding challenges. Here, we present a detailed and scalable fabrication process for vacuum-gap capacitors that support ultrahigh-coherence mechanical motion, exhibit low microwave loss, and occupy a significantly smaller footprint compared to conventional planar geometries. By employing a planarized SiO2 sacrificial layer, we achieve vacuum gaps on the order of 150 nm. Using this platform, we have recently demonstrated ground-state cooling and motion squeezing of a mechanical oscillator with a quality factor of 40 million-a 100-fold improvement compared to prior works-as well as a single-photon optomechanical coupling rate of approximately 15 Hz [Youssefi et al., Nat. Phys. 19, 1697 (2023)]. Additional achievements include the realization of an optomechanical topological lattice with 24 sites [Youssefi et al., Nature 612, 666 (2022)] and the observation of quantum collective dynamics in a mechanical hexamer [Chegnizadeh et al., Science 386, 1383 (2024)]. Collectively, these results underscore the potential of vacuum-gap capacitors as a platform for coupling superconducting qubits to mechanical systems, enabling quantum storage, and probing gravitational effects in quantum mechanics.

TI Efficient detection of multidimensional single-photon time-bin
   superpositions
SO OPTICA
AB The ability to detect quantum superpositions lies at the heart of fundamental and applied aspects of quantum mechanics. The time-frequency degree of freedom of light enables encoding and transmitting quantum information in a multidimensional fashion compatible with fiber and integrated platforms. However, the ability to efficiently detect high-dimensional time-bin superpositions, a subset of encodings in the wider time-frequency paradigm, is not yet available. Here we show that multidimensional time-bin superpositions can be detected using a single time-resolved photon detector. Our approach uses off-the-shelf components and is based on the temporal Talbot effect-a time-frequency counterpart of the well-known near field diffraction effect. We provide experimental results and highlight the possible applications in quantum communication, quantum information processing, and time-frequency quantum state tomography.

AB State preparation is a necessary component of many quantum algorithms. In this work, we combine a method for efficiently representing smooth differentiable probability distributions using matrix product states with recently discovered techniques for initializing quantum states to approximate matrix product states. Using this, we generate quantum states encoding a class of normal probability distributions in a trapped ion quantum computer for up to 20 qubits. We provide an in depth analysis of the different sources of error which contribute to the overall fidelity of this state preparation procedure. Our work provides a study in quantum hardware for scalable distribution loading, which is the basis of a wide range of algorithms that provide quantum advantage.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The significance of the ocean in scientific research and military applications is growing, with submarines being pivotal for exploration and naval operations. However, the challenge of wireless communication with submerged submarines due to the strong absorption and scattering of electromagnetic waves in seawater limits their utility. This paper addresses the need for submarine communication methods characterized by speed, stability, cost-effectiveness, and long-range capabilities. It provides a comprehensive overview of current and potential future submarine communication techniques, including electromagnetic, acoustic, and optical methods, analyzing their performance in various channel complexities and discussing their advantages and drawbacks. Additionally, emerging technologies such as magnetic, translational acoustic-RF (TARF), photo/thermo-acoustic (PA/TA), neutrino, and quantum communication are explored, showing promise for the future of submarine communication systems. The upcoming generation of communication technology may establish a three-dimensional communication network connecting land-based stations, buoys, drones, satellites, and submarines to enhance the efficiency and reach of underwater communication.

TI A quantum genetic algorithm for a parallel machine scheduling problem
SO JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION
AB Scheduling problems are a common challenge across various industries. This paper addresses a specific problem arising in printed circuit board (PCB) assembly: the parallel machines scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) designed to solve this problem on an error-free quantum computer. The development focuses on three key aspects: efficient adaptability of the quantum circuit to different problem instances, feasibility of the measured circuit outputs, and efficient utilization of qubits. To compare the quantum algorithm with its purely classical counterpart, we introduce a novel key performance indicator to quantify a potential quantum speedup. Furthermore, we evaluate the convergence behavior of the solver across various problem instances. Our results demonstrate that the QGA exhibits strong convergence behavior, resulting in near-optimal solutions. Additionally, we identify a potential quantum advantage for solving this practical problem. The advantage increases as the population size grows.

TI Distributed Bragg reflector based ASE noise removal pump wavelength
   filters for futuristic chip-scale quantum photonic circuits
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB This article reports a novel design of a compact tunable resonance filter with a highly extinguished and ultra-broad out-of-band rejection for on-chip amplified spontaneous noise suppression from pump lasers highly demanding for generating pure/entangled photon pairs via chi(3) process in a CMOS compatible silicon photonics technology platform. The proposed device is designed with two identically apodized distributed grating structures for guided Fabry-Perot resonant transmissions in a silicon-on-insulator rib waveguide structure. The device design parameters are optimized by theoretical simulation for a low insertion loss singly-resonant transmission peak at a desired wavelength. We observed that a device length of as low as 35 mu m exhibits a rejection band as large as 60 nm with an extinction of 40 dB with respect to the resonant wavelength peak at gyr 1550 nm (FWHM 80 pm, IL 2 dB). The experimental results have been shown to be closely matching to our theoretical simulation and modeling results in terms of its stop bandwidth and resonance wavelength for noise suppressed pump laser wavelength filtering. As expected from the theoretical prediction, the trend pertaining to the trade-off between passive insertion loss and Q-value of the resonances has been observed depending on the device parameters. The thermo-optic tuning characteristics of resonant wavelengths have been obtained by integrating microheaters. The resonance peak could be tuned at a rate of 96 pm per mW of consumed thermal power. Noise associated with an amplified pump wavelength (gyP 1550 nm) has been shown to be suppressed ( 40-dB), up to the detector noise floor.

TI Topology detection in cavity QED
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We explore the physics of topological lattice models immersed in c-QED architectures for arbitrary coupling strength with the photon field. We propose the use of the cavity transmission as a topological marker and study its behaviour. For this, we develop an approach combining the input-output formalism with a Mean-Field plus fluctuations description of the setup. We illustrate our results with the specific case of a fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain coupled to a single-mode cavity. Our findings confirm that the cavity can indeed act as a quantum sensor for topological phases, where the initial state preparation plays a crucial role. Additionally, we discuss the persistence of topological features when the coupling strength increases, in terms of an effective Hamiltonian, and calculate the entanglement entropy. Our approach can be applied to other fermionic systems, opening a route to the characterization of their topological properties in terms of experimental observables.

TI Compositional Quantum Control Flow with Efficient Compilation in Qunity
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Most existing quantum programming languages are based on the quantum circuit model of computation, as higher-level abstractions are particularly challenging to implement-especially ones relating to quantum control flow. The Qunity language, proposed by Voichick et al., offered such an abstraction in the form of a quantum control construct, with great care taken to ensure that the resulting language is still realizable. However, Qunity lacked a working implementation, and the originally proposed compilation procedure was very inefficient, with even simple quantum algorithms compiling to unreasonably large circuits. In this work, we focus on the efficient compilation of high-level quantum control flow constructs, using Qunity as our starting point. We introduce a wider range of abstractions on top of Qunity's core language that offer compelling trade-offs compared to its existing control construct. We create a complete implementation of a Qunity compiler, which converts high-level Qunity code into the quantum assembly language OpenQASM 3. We develop optimization techniques for multiple stages of the Qunity compilation procedure, including both low-level circuit optimizations as well as methods that consider the high-level structure of a Qunity program, greatly reducing the number of qubits and gates used by the compiler.

TI Modeling and Experimental Validation of the Intrinsic SNR in Spin Qubit
   Gate-Based Readout and Its Impacts on Readout Electronics
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In semiconductor spin quantum bits (qubits), the radio-frequency (RF) gate-based readout is a promising solution for future large-scale integration, as it allows for a fast, frequency-multiplexed readout architecture, enabling multiple qubits to be read out simultaneously. This article introduces a theoretical framework to evaluate the effect of various parameters, such as the readout probe power, readout chain's noise performance, and integration time on the intrinsic readout signal-to-noise ratio, and thus readout fidelity of RF gate-based readout systems. By analyzing the underlying physics of spin qubits during readout, this work proposes a qubit readout model that takes into account the qubit's quantum mechanical properties, providing a way to evaluate the tradeoffs among the aforementioned parameters. The validity of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing the simulation and experimental results. The proposed analytical approach, the developed model, and the experimental results enable designers to optimize the entire readout chain effectively, thus leading to a faster, lower power readout system with integrated cryogenic electronics.

TI New Label-Free DNA Nanosensor Based on Top-Gated
   Metal-Ferroelectric-Metal Graphene Nanoribbon on Insulator Field-Effect
   Transistor: A Quantum Simulation Study
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this paper, a new label-free DNA nanosensor based on a top-gated (TG) metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) graphene nanoribbon field-effect transistor (TG-MFM GNRFET) is proposed through a simulation approach. The DNA sensing principle is founded on the dielectric modulation concept. The computational method employed to evaluate the proposed nanobiosensor relies on the coupled solutions of a rigorous quantum simulation with the Landau-Khalatnikov equation, considering ballistic transport conditions. The investigation analyzes the effects of DNA molecules on nanodevice behavior, encompassing potential distribution, ferroelectric-induced gate voltage amplification, transfer characteristics, subthreshold swing, and current ratio. It has been observed that the feature of ferroelectric-induced gate voltage amplification using the integrated MFM structure can significantly enhance the biosensor's sensitivity to DNA molecules, whether in terms of threshold voltage shift or drain current variation. Additionally, we propose the current ratio as a sensing metric due to its ability to consider all DNA-induced modulations of electrical parameters, specifically the increase in on-state current and the decrease in off-state current and subthreshold swing. The obtained results indicate that the proposed negative-capacitance GNRFET-based DNA nanosensor could be considered an intriguing option for advanced point-of-care testing.

TI Countermeasure for Negative Impact of a Practical Source in
   Continuous-Variable Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) can fundamentally defend all attacks on the measurement devices. Consequently, higher requirements are put forward for the source of a CV-MDI QKD system. However, the imperfections of the actual source brings practical security risks to the CV-MDI QKD system. Therefore, the characteristics of the realistic source must be controlled in real time to guarantee the practical security of the CV-MDI QKD system. Here we propose a countermeasure for negative impact introduced by the actual source in the CV-MDI QKD system based on the one-time-calibration method, not only eliminating the loophole induced from the relative intensity noise (RIN), which is part of the source noise, but also modeling the source noise thus improves the performance. In particular, three cases in terms of whether the preparation noise of the practical sources are defined or not, where only one of the users or both of the two users operate monitoring on their respective source outputs, are investigated. The simulation results show that the estimated secret key rate without our proposed scheme is about 10.7 times higher than the realistic rate at 18 km transmission distance when the variance of RIN is only 0.4. What is worse, the difference becomes greater and greater with the increase of the variance of RIN. Thus, our proposed scheme makes sense in further completing the practical security of the CV-MDI QKD system. In other words, our work enables the CV-MDI QKD system not only to resist all attacks against detectors, but also to close the vulnerability caused by the actual source, thus making the scheme closer to practical security.

TI Construction strategy of quantum air communication network of imitation
   goose swarm array
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum satellite communication is a research hotspot in the field of quantum communication, which has the characteristics of wide coverage, high communication efficiency and strong security. The construction strategy of the quantum communication network is an essential part of quantum communication. However, the construction strategy of quantum air communication network has not been studied yet so far. In this paper, according to the characteristics of flying goose array and principle of bionics, a simulated wild goose group Lambda quantum air communication network topology is proposed, which can be divided into single-head node Lambda type and multi-head node Lambda type. Based on Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state particles, a certifiable QSDC inter-network communication system and a GHZ-EPR quantum teleportation communication system are established. The bit error rate, energy consumption, throughput, and other parameters are studied. After theoretical analysis and experimental measurement, for the single-head node A network structure in the environment where the average power spectral density of noise is 2 dB/m, when the communication distance between the head node and the child node is less than 400 m, the bit error rate is less than 0.094; if the communication distance increases from 400 m to 1000 m, the bit error rate increases rapidly, reaching 0.585; when the number of child nodes on one side increases from 2 to 7, the throughput decreases from 110.6 kb/s to 46.45 kb/s. For example, when the total number of nodes is 21, the single-head node Lambda network structure saves 32.6% energy but reduces the throughput to 23.9 kb/s. By comparison, the multi-head node Lambda network structure with 21 nodes saves 29.3% energy and achieves throughput of 163.4 kb/s. The above studies show that the quantum air network with the structure of imitation goose group array has good network scalability, excellent information security and flexible network structure.

TI Quantum Liang Information Flow as Causation Quantifier
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Liang information flow is widely used in classical systems and network theory for causality quantification and has been applied widely, for example, to finance, neuroscience, and climate studies. The key part of the theory is to freeze a node of a network to ascertain its causal influence on other nodes. Such a theory is yet to be applied to quantum network dynamics. Here, we generalize the Liang information flow to the quantum domain with respect to von Neumann entropy and exemplify its usage by applying it to a variety of small quantum networks.

TI A Feasible Quantum Sealed-Bid Auction Scheme Without an Auctioneer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we first define a primitive problem of secure multiparty computations, i.e., secure multiparty disjunction (SMD), and present a novel quantum protocol for SMD that can ensure information-theoretical security, i.e., unconditional security. Furthermore, based on the quantum SMD protocol, we design a quantum sealed-bid auction (QSA) scheme without an auctioneer. In the proposed QSA scheme, all bidders can jointly find the winning bidder without the help of an auctioneer while it can perfectly protect the privacy of nonwinning bidders. The proposed quantum SMD protocol and quantum QSA scheme take Bell states as quantum resources and only perform single-particle Pauli operators and two-particle Bell measurements. Finally, we simulate the related quantum protocols in Qiskit and verify the correctness and the feasibility of the proposed protocols.

TI Simulating the Interplay of Particle Conservation and Long-Range
   Coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Lasers and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) exhibit macroscopic quantum coherence in seemingly unrelated ways. Lasers possess a well-defined global phase while the number of photons fluctuates. In BECs of atoms, instead, the number of particles is conserved and the global phase is undefined. Here, we use gate-based quantum circuits to create a unified framework that connects lasers and BEC states. Our approach relies on a scalable circuit that measures the total number of particles without destroying long-range coherence. We introduce two complementary probes of global and relative phase coherence, study how they are affected by measurements of the particle number, and implement them on a superconducting quantum computer by Rigetti. We find that particle conservation enhances long-range phase coherence, highlighting a mechanism used by superfluids and superconductors to gain phase stiffness.

TI Coherent one-way quantum conference key agreement based on twin field
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum conference key agreement (CKA) enables key sharing among multiple trusted users with information-theoretic security. Currently, the key rates of most quantum CKA protocols suffer from the limit of the total efficiency among quantum channels. Inspired by the coherent one-way and twin-field quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, we propose a quantum CKA protocol of three users. Exploiting coherent states with intensity 0 and mu to encode logic bits, our protocol can break the limit. Additionally, the requirements of phase randomization and multiple intensity modulation are removed in our protocol, making its experimental demonstration simple.

TI Four-dimensional orbital angular momentum Bell-state measurement
   assisted by the auxiliary polarization and path degrees of freedom
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by twisted photons provides a promising playground for high-dimensional quantum information processing. While Bell-state measurement is the cornerstone for various quantum information applications, the deterministic discrimination of the complete high-dimensional Bell states with linear optics remains relatively unexplored in the OAM state space. Here, we demonstrate a theoretical scheme for the complete four-dimensional OAM Bell-state measurement by using the single-photon hyperentangled state analyzer, in which the auxiliary two-dimensional polarization entanglement and two-dimensional path entanglement are utilized. Our scheme offers an alternative route toward enhancing the channel capacity in quantum communication and increasing the robustness against deleterious noise in practical experiments with twisted photons.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum optimization with linear Ising penalty functions for customer
   data science
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Constrained combinatorial optimization problems, which are ubiquitous in industry, can be solved by quantum algorithms such as quantum annealing (QA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In these quantum algorithms, constraints are typically implemented with quadratic penalty functions. This penalty method can introduce large energy scales and make interaction graphs much more dense. These effects can result in worse performance of quantum optimization, particularly on near-term devices that have sparse hardware graphs and other physical limitations. In this work, we consider linear Ising penalty functions, which are applied with local fields in the Ising model, as an alternative method for implementing constraints that makes more efficient use of physical resources. We study the behavior of the penalty method in the context of quantum optimization for customer data science problems. Our theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of QA and the QAOA indicate that this penalty method can lead to better performance in quantum optimization than the quadratic method. However, the linear Ising penalty method is not suitable for all problems as it cannot always exactly implement the desired constraint. In cases where the linear method is not successful in implementing all constraints, we propose that schemes involving both quadratic and linear Ising penalties can be effective.

TI Generating highly entangled states via discrete-time quantum walks with
   Parrondo sequences
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum entanglement has multiple applications in quantum information processing. Developing methods to generate highly entangled states independent of initial con-ditions is an essential task. Herein we aim to generate highly entangled states via discrete-time quantum walks. We propose deterministic Parrondo sequences that gen-erate states that are generally much more entangled than states produced by sequences using only one of the two coins. We show that some Parrondo sequences generate highly entangled states, which are independent of the phase of the initial state used and further lead to maximally entangled states in some cases. We study Parrondo sequences for a small number of time steps and the asymptotic limit of a large number of time steps.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Operational connection between predictability and entanglement in
   entanglement swapping from partially entangled pure states
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Complementarity and entanglement are fundamental features of Quantum Mechanics that were recently related in triality equalities that involve quantum coherence, the wave aspect of a quanton, and quantum predictability and quantum entanglement, the particle aspect of a quanton. In this article, we give an operational connection between predictability and entanglement in entanglement swapping from initially partially entangled states. For this, we show that the predictability of the pre-measurement one-qubit density matrix is directly related to the probability of the partially entangled component of the post-measurement state. Going even further, we analyze the entanglement swapping for partially entangled states in the light of complementarity relations and show that, in the cases where the entanglement increases after a Bell-basis measurement, the predictability is consumed when compared to the initially prepared state.

AB Quantum computing enabled cryptanalytic techniques are able to concretely reduce the security margin of existing cryptographic primitives. While this reduction is only polynomial for symmetric cryptosystems, it still provides a reduction in their security margin.
   In this work, we propose a detailed quantum circuit designed to cryptanalyze both the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cryptosystem, and its successor Triple-DES (3DES), currently standardized in ISO/IEC 18033-3, and still widely employed in satellite data and bank card encryption. To do so, we introduce the first quantum circuit implementation of the 8 substitution tables (a.k.a. S-boxes), applying a bitslicing strategy, which is currently the most efficient classical combinatorial circuit design in terms of number of two inputs Boolean gates. Secondly, we present the complete quantum circuits required to attack both DES and 3DES leveraging Grover's algorithm. We provide finite regime, closed form equations, delineating the circuits complexities in terms of the number of qubits, gates, depth and number of qubits multiplied by depth. The complexity analysis is based on two distinct gate sets: a NOT-CNOT-Toffoli (NCT) extended with the Hadamard gate; and the fault-tolerant Clifford+T. Finally, akin to the classical attack to the 3DES, we introduce a meet-in-the-middle strategy relying on an exponential amount of Quantum Random Access Memory. Our findings show that the 3DES with keying option 2, the most widely employed variant of 3DES, can be attacked with a circuit depth of approximately 2(67) and less than a thousand qubits. This is close to the 2(64) value suggested by NIST for the depth achievable sequentially by a single quantum computer in a decade. Our technique can be further sped up parallelizing the approach onto multiple devices, pointing to the practicality of cryptanalyzing 3DES in such a scenario.

TI Electrically Switchable Entanglement Channel in van der Waals Magnets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Two-dimensional layered van der Waals (vdW) magnets demonstrate their potential to allow the study of both fundamental and applied physics due to their remarkable electronic properties. However, the connection of vdW magnets to spintronics and quantum information science is not clear. In particular, it remains elusive whether there are interesting magnetic phenomena belonging only to vdW magnets but absent in widely studied crystalline magnets. Here, we consider the quantum correlations of magnons in a layered vdW magnet and identify an entanglement channel of magnons across the magnetic layers, which can be effectively tuned and even deterministically switched on and off by both magnetic and electric means. This is a unique feature of vdW magnets, in which the underlying physics is well understood in terms of the competing roles of exchange and anisotropy fields that contribute to magnon excitation. Furthermore, we show that such a tunable entanglement channel can mediate the electrically controllable entanglement of two distant qubits, which also provides a protocol to indirectly measure the entanglement of magnons. Our findings provide an avenue to electrically manipulate qubits and further open up opportunities to utilize vdW magnets for quantum information science.

TI Indefinite Causal Order for Quantum Phase Estimation with Pauli Noise
SO FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS
AB This paper further explores the recent scheme of switched quantum channels with indefinite causal order applied to the reference metrological task of quantum phase estimation in the presence of noise. We especially extend the explorations, previously reported with depolarizing noise and thermal noise, to the class of Pauli noises, important to the qubit and not previously addressed. Nonstandard capabilities, not accessible with standard quantum phase estimation, are exhibited and analyzed, with significant properties that are specific to the Pauli noises, while other properties are found in common with the depolarizing noise or the thermal noise. The results show that the presence and the type of quantum noise are both crucial to the determination of the nonstandard capabilities from the switched channel with indefinite causal order, with a constructive action of noise reminiscent of stochastic resonance phenomena. The study contributes to a more comprehensive and systematic characterization of the roles and specificities of quantum noise in the operation of the novel devices of switched quantum channels with indefinite causal order.

TI Catalytic Transformations of Pure Entangled States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement of pure states is usually quantified via the entanglement entropy, the von Neumann entropy of the reduced state. Entanglement entropy is closely related to entanglement distillation, a process for converting quantum states into singlets, which can then be used for various quantum technological tasks. The relation between entanglement entropy and entanglement distillation has been known only for the asymptotic setting, and the meaning of entanglement entropy in the single-copy regime has so far remained open. Here we close this gap by considering entanglement catalysis. We prove that entanglement entropy completely characterizes state transformations in the presence of entangled catalysts. Our results imply that entanglement entropy quantifies the amount of entanglement available in a bipartite pure state to be used for quantum information processing, giving asymptotic results an operational meaning also in the single-copy setup.

TI Unextendible and uncompletable product bases in every bipartition
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Unextendible product basis is an important object in quantum information theory and features a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from quantum nonlocality to quantum cryptography. A generalized concept called uncompletable product basis also attracts much attention. In this paper, we find some unextendible product bases that are uncompletable product bases in every bipartition, which answers a 19 year-old open question proposed by DiVincenzo et al (2003 Commun. Math. Phys. 238 379-410). As a consequence, we connect such unextendible product bases to local hiding of information, positive-partial-transpose entangled states and genuinely entangled states. Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of an unextendible product basis that is still unextendible in every bipartition, and the existence of such a UPB is another open question proposed by Demianowic et al (2018 Phys. Rev. A 98 012313). Our results advance the understanding of the geometry of unextendible product bases.

TI Enhancing Grover's search algorithm: a modified approach to increase the
   probability of good states
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB This article introduces an enhancement to the Grover search algorithm to speed up computing the probability of finding good states. It suggests incorporating a rotation phase angle determined mathematically from the derivative of the model during the initial iteration. At each iteration, a new phase angle is computed and used in a rotation gate around y+z\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$y+z$$\end{document} axis in the diffusion operator. The computed phase angles are optimized through an adaptive adjustment based on the estimated increasing ratio of the consecutive amplitudes. The findings indicate an average decrease of 28% in the required number of iterations resulting in a faster overall process and fewer number of quantum gates. For large search space, this improvement rises to 29.58%. Given the computational capabilities of the computer utilized for the simulation, the approach is applied to instances with up to 12 qubits or 4096 possible combination of search entries.

TI Accuracy Guarantees and Quantum Advantage in Analog Open Quantum
   Simulation with and without Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Many-body open quantum systems, described by Lindbladian master equations, are a rich class of physical models that display complex equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium phenomena which remain to be understood. In this paper, we theoretically analyze noisy analog quantum simulation of geometrically local open quantum systems and provide evidence that this problem both is hard to simulate on classical computers and could be approximately solved on near-term quantum devices. First, given a noiseless quantum simulator, we show that the dynamics of local observables and the fixed-point expectation values of rapidly mixing local observables in geometrically local Lindbladians can be obtained to a precision of epsilon in time that is poly(epsilon-1) and uniform in system size. Furthermore, we establish that the quantum simulator would provide a superpolynomial advantage, in run-time scaling with respect to the target precision and either the evolution time (when simulating dynamics) or the Lindbladian's decay rate (when simulating fixed points), over any classical algorithm for these problems, assuming BQP # BPP. We then consider the presence of noise in the quantum simulator in the form of additional geometrically local Lindbladian terms. We show that the simulation tasks considered in this paper are stable to errors; i.e., they can be solved to a noise-limited, but system-size independent, precision. Finally, we establish that, assuming BQP # BPP, there are stable geometrically local Lindbladian simulation problems such that, as the noise rate on the simulator is reduced, classical algorithms must take time superpolynomially longer in the inverse noise rate to attain the same precision as the analog quantum simulator.

TI Efficient Measurement of Orbital Angular Momentum Entanglement Using
   Convolutional Neural Network
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB High-dimensional (HD) entanglement of photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) offers significant potential for enhancing channel capacity and improving noise resistance in quantum information processing. However, the challenge of achieving simple and rapid measurement has limited its practical applications. In this work, a quantum state tomography (QST) framework is demonstrated that utilizes convolutional neural networks to rapidly reconstruct the density matrix of OAM entanglement from only two coincidence measurements. The experimental results for a 5D OAM entangled state yield a fidelity of 0.973 +/- 0.005. This method is also applicable to mixed OAM entangled states and scenarios with incomplete tomographic measurements. These findings represent a significant step toward implementing high-speed QST for applications involving HD spatial mode quantum state, whether in free space or integrated systems.

TI Advances in Atomtronics
SO ENTROPY
AB Atomtronics is a relatively new subfield of atomic physics that aims to realize the device behavior of electronic components in ultracold atom-optical systems. The fact that these systems are coherent makes them particularly interesting since, in addition to current, one can impart quantum states onto the current carriers themselves or perhaps perform quantum computational operations on them. After reviewing the fundamental ideas of this subfield, we report on the theoretical and experimental progress made towards developing externally-driven and closed loop devices. The functionality and potential applications for these atom analogs to electronic and spintronic systems is also discussed.

TI Not All Computational Methods Are Effective Methods
SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB An effective method is a computational method that might, in principle, be executed by a human. In this paper, I argue that there are methods for computing that are not effective methods. The examples I consider are taken primarily from quantum computing, but these are only meant to be illustrative of a much wider class. Quantum inference and quantum parallelism involve steps that might be implemented in multiple physical systems, but cannot be implemented, or at least not at will, by an idealised human. Recognising that not all computational methods are effective methods is important for at least two reasons. First, it is needed to correctly state the results of Turing and other founders of computation theory. Turing is sometimes said to have offered a replacement for the informal notion of an effective method with the formal notion of a Turing machine. I argue that such a view only holds under limited circumstances. Second, not distinguishing between computational methods and effective methods can lead to mistakes when quantifying over the class of all possible computational methods. Such quantification is common in philosophy of mind in the context of thought experiments that explore the limits of computational functionalism. I argue that these 'homuncular' thought experiments should not be treated as valid.

AB This paper studies the round complexity of computing the weighted diameter and radius of a graph in the quantum CONGEST model. We present a quantum algorithm that (1+o(1))-approximates the diameter and radius with round complexity (O) over tilde (min{n(9/10) D-3/10, n}), where D denotes the unweighted diameter. This exhibits the advantages of quantum communication over classical communication since computing a (3/2 - epsilon)-approximation of the diameter and radius in a classical CONGEST network takes (Omega) over tilde (n) rounds, even if D is constant [2]. We also prove a lower bound of (Omega) over tilde (n(2/3)) for (3/2 - epsilon)-approximating the weighted diameter/radius in quantum CONGEST networks, even if D = Theta(log n). Thus, in quantum CONGEST networks, computing weighted diameter and weighted radius of graphs with small D is strictly harder than unweighted ones due to Le Gall and Magniez's (Omega) over tilde(root nD)-round algorithm for unweighted diameter/radius [12].

TI Fractional Charge States in the Magneto-Photoluminescence Spectra of
   Single-Electron InP/GaInP2 Quantum Dots
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB We used photoluminescence spectra of single electron quasi-two-dimensional InP/GaInP2 islands having Wigner-Seitz radius similar to 4 to measure the magnetic-field dispersion of the lowest s, p, and d single-particle states in the range 0-10 T. The measured dispersion revealed up to a nine-fold reduction of the cyclotron frequency, indicating the formation of nano-superconducting anyon or magneto-electron (e(m)) states, in which the corresponding number of magnetic-flux-quanta vortexes and fractional charge were self-generated. We observed a linear increase in the number of vortexes versus the island size, which corresponded to a critical vortex radius equal to the Bohr radius and closed-packed topological vortex arrangements. Our observation explains the microscopic mechanism of vortex attachment in composite fermion theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect, allows its description in terms of self-localization of e m s and represents progress towards the goal of engineering anyon properties for fault-tolerant topological quantum gates.

TI Experimental Guesswork with Quantum Side Information Using Twisted Light
SO SENSORS
AB Guesswork is an information-theoretic quantity which can be seen as an alternate security criterion to entropy. Recent work has established the theoretical framework for guesswork in the presence of quantum side information, which we extend both theoretically and experimentally. We consider guesswork when the side information consists of the BB84 states and their higher-dimensional generalizations. With this side information, we compute the guesswork for two different scenarios for each dimension. We then performed a proof-of-principle experiment using Laguerre-Gauss modes to experimentally compute the guesswork for higher-dimensional generalizations of the BB84 states. We find that our experimental results agree closely with our theoretical predictions. This work shows that guesswork can be a viable security criterion in cryptographic tasks and is experimentally accessible in a number of optical setups.

TI Three-Basis Loop-Back QKD: A Passive Architecture for Secure and
   Scalable Quantum Mobile Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB The Loop-Back Quantum Key Distribution (LB-QKD) protocol establishes a bidirectional architecture in which a single photon travels forth and back through the same optical channel. Unlike conventional one-way schemes such as BB84, Alice performs both state preparation and measurement, while Bob acts as a passive polarization modulator and reflector. This design eliminates detectors at Bob's side, minimizes synchronization requirements, and enables compact, low-power implementations suitable for quantum-mobile and IoT platforms. An extended three-basis configuration {X,Y,Z} is introduced, preserving the simplicity of the two-basis scheme while improving noise tolerance through enhanced orthogonality-based filtering. Analytical modeling shows that the effective protocol error decreases from Eprotocol(2)=e/2 to Eprotocol(3)=e/3, achieving a 33% improvement in noise resilience. Despite its slightly lower sifting efficiency (eta=1/6), the total information gain reaches G=0.26 bits per pulse, maintaining post-sifting throughput comparable to BB84. The protocol doubles the tolerable QBER of conventional QKD, sustaining secure operation up to 22% for two bases and approximately 47.58% for three bases. Its passive, self-verifying architecture enhances resistance to man-in-the-middle, photon-number-splitting, and side-channel attacks, providing a scalable and energy-efficient framework for secure key distribution and authentication in next-generation mobile and distributed quantum networks.

TI Shadow estimation of gate-set properties from random sequences
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB With quantum computing devices increasing in scale and complexity, there is a growing need for tools that obtain precise diagnostic information about quantum operations. However, current quantum devices are only capable of short unstructured gate sequences followed by native measurements. We accept this limitation and turn it into a new paradigm for characterizing quantum gate-sets. A single experiment-random sequence estimation-solves a wealth of estimation problems, with all complexity moved to classical post-processing. We derive robust channel variants of shadow estimation with close-to-optimal performance guarantees and use these as a primitive for partial, compressive and full process tomography as well as the learning of Pauli noise. We discuss applications to the quantum gate engineering cycle, and propose novel methods for the optimization of quantum gates and diagnosing cross-talk.
   In order to be practical, schemes for characterizing quantum operations should require the simplest possible gate sequences and measurements. Here, the authors show how random gate sequences and native measurements (followed by classical post-processing) are sufficient for estimating several gate set properties.

TI Scalable temporal multiplexing of telecom photons via thin-film lithium
   niobate photonics
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Efficient single-photon generation remains a big challenge in quantum photonics. A promising approach to overcome this challenge is to employ active multiplexing-repeating a nondeterministic photon pair generation process across orthogonal degrees of freedom and exploiting heralding to actively route the heralded photon to the desired single output mode via feedforward. The main barriers of multiplexing schemes, however, are minimizing resource requirements to allow scalability and the lack of availability of high-speed, low-loss switches. Here, we present an on-chip temporal multiplexing scheme utilizing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics to effectively address these challenges. Our time-multiplexed source, operating at a rate of 62.2 MHz, enhances single-photon probability by a factor of 3.37 +/- 0.05 without introducing additional multi-photon noise. This demonstration highlights the feasibility and potential of TFLN photonics for large-scale complex quantum information technologies.

AB The efficient resolution of optimization problems is one of the key issues in today's industry. This task relies mainly on classical algorithms that present scalability problems and processing limitations. Quantum computing has emerged to challenge these types of problems. In this paper, we focus on the Metropolis-Hastings quantum algorithm, which is based on quantum walks. We use this algorithm to build a quantum software tool called Quantum Metropolis Solver (QMS). We validate QMS with the N-Queen problem to show a potential quantum advantage in an example that can be easily extrapolated to an Artificial Intelligence domain. We carry out different simulations to validate the performance of QMS and its configuration.

AB This paper proposes a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve a fundamental power system problem called unit commitment (UC). The UC problem is decomposed into a quadratic subproblem, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) subproblem, and an unconstrained quadratic subproblem. A classical optimization solver solves the first and third subproblems, while the QUBO subproblem is solved by a quantum algorithm called quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The three subproblems are then coordinated iteratively using a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Using Qiskit on the IBM Q system as the simulation environment, simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm to solve the UC problem.

TI Entanglement-Based Feature Extraction by Tensor Network Machine Learning
SO FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
AB It is a hot topic how entanglement, a quantity from quantum information theory, can assist machine learning. In this work, we implement numerical experiments to classify patterns/images by representing the classifiers as matrix product states (MPS). We show how entanglement can interpret machine learning by characterizing the importance of data and propose a feature extraction algorithm. We show on the MNIST dataset that when reducing the number of the retained pixels to 1/10 of the original number, the decrease of the ten-class testing accuracy is only O (10(-3)), which significantly improves the efficiency of the MPS machine learning. Our work improves machine learning's interpretability and efficiency under the MPS representation by using the properties of MPS representing entanglement.

TI Full-dimensional Schrodinger wavefunction calculations using tensors and
   quantum computers: the Cartesian component-separated approach
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Traditional methods in quantum chemistry rely on Hartree-Fock-based Slater-determinant (SD) representations, whose underlying zeroth-order picture assumes separability by particle. Here, we explore a radically different approach, based on separability by Cartesian component, rather than by particle [J. Jerke and B. Poirier, J. Chem. Phys., 2018, 148, 104101]. The approach appears to be very well suited for 3D grid-based methods in quantum chemistry, and thereby also for so-called "first-quantized" quantum computing. We first present an overview of the approach as implemented on classical computers, including numerical results that justify performance claims. In particular, we perform numerical calculations with four explicit electrons that are equivalent to full-CI matrix diagonalization with nearly 10(15) SDs. We then present an implementation for quantum computers for which the number of quantum gates (and to a lesser extent, the number of qubits) can be dramatically reduced, in comparison with other quantum circuitry that has been envisioned for implementing first-quantized "quantum computational chemistry" (QCC).

TI Floquet-engineered fast SNAP gates in weakly coupled circuit-QED systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting cavities with high quality factors, coupled to a fixed-frequency transmon, provide a state-of-the-art platform for quantum information storage and manipulation. The commonly used selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gate faces significant challenges in ultrahigh-coherence cavities, where the weak dispersive shifts necessary for preserving high coherence typically result in prolonged gate times. Here, we propose a protocol to achieve high-fidelity SNAP gates that are orders of magnitude faster than the standard implementation, surpassing the speed limit set by the bare dispersive shift. We achieve this enhancement by dynamically amplifying the dispersive coupling via sideband interactions, followed by quantum optimal control on the Floquet-engineered system. We also present a unified perturbation theory that explains both the gate acceleration and the associated benign drive-induced decoherence, corroborated by Floquet-Markov simulations. These results pave the way for the experimental realization of high-fidelity, selective control of weakly coupled, high-coherence cavities, and expanding the scope of optimal control techniques to a broader class of Floquet quantum systems.

TI Quantum error thresholds for gauge-redundant digitizations of lattice
   field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In the quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, gauge symmetry can be either fixed or encoded as a redundancy of the Hilbert space. While gauge-fixing reduces the number of qubits, keeping the gauge redundancy can provide code space to mitigate and correct quantum errors by checking and restoring Gauss's law. In this work, we consider the correctable errors for generic finite gauge groups and design the quantum circuits to detect and correct them. We calculate the error thresholds below which the gaugeredundant digitization with Gauss's law error correction has better fidelity than the gauge-fixed digitization involving only gauge-invariant states. Our results provide guidance for fault-tolerant quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.

TI Exact Thermalization Dynamics in the "Rule 54" Quantum Cellular
   Automaton
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the quantum cellular automaton known as "Rule 54." For a class of low-entangled initial states, we provide an analytic description of the effect of the global evolution on finite subsystems in terms of simple quantum channels, which gives access to the full thermalization dynamics at the microscopic level. As an example, we provide analytic formulas for the evolution of local observables and Renyi entropies. We show that, in contrast to other known examples of exactly solvable quantum circuits, Rule 54 does not behave as a simple Markovian bath on its own parts, and displays typical nonequilibrium features of interacting integrable many-body quantum systems such as finite relaxation rate and interaction-induced dressing effects. Our study provides a rare example where the full thermalization dynamics can be solved exactly at the microscopic level.

TI Convergence of digitized-counterdiabatic QAOA: circuit depth versus free
   parameters
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recently, digitized-counterdiabatic (CD) quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has been proposed to make QAOA converge to the solution of an optimization problem in fewer steps, inspired by Trotterized CD driving in continuous-time quantum annealing. In this paper, we critically revisit this approach by focusing on the paradigmatic weighted and unweighted one-dimensional MaxCut problem. We study two variants of QAOA with first and second-order CD corrections. Our results show that, indeed, higher order CD corrections allow for a quicker convergence to the exact solution of the problem at hand by increasing the complexity of the variational cost function. Remarkably, however, the total number of free parameters needed to achieve this result is independent of the particular QAOA variant analyzed for the problems considered.

TI An ultra-stable 1.5 T permanent magnet assembly for qubit experiments at
   cryogenic temperatures
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Magnetic fields are a standard tool in the toolbox of every physicist and are required for the characterization of materials, as well as the polarization of spins in nuclear magnetic resonance or electron paramagnetic resonance experiments. Quite often, a static magnetic field of sufficiently large, but fixed, magnitude is suitable for these tasks. Here, we present a permanent magnet assembly that can achieve magnetic field strengths of up to 1.5 T over an air gap length of 7 mm. The assembly is based on a Halbach array of neodymium magnets, with the inclusion of the soft magnetic material Supermendur to boost the magnetic field strength inside the air gap. We present the design, simulation, and characterization of the permanent magnet assembly, measuring an outstanding magnetic field stability with a drift rate of |D| < 2.8 ppb/h. Our measurements demonstrate that this assembly can be used for spin qubit experiments inside a dilution refrigerator, successfully replacing the more expensive and bulky superconducting solenoids.

TI Decoherence-free subspace and entanglement sudden death of multi-photon
   polarization states in fiber channels
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The construction of quantum networks requires long-distance teleportation of multi-qubit entangled states. Here, we investigate the entanglement dynamics of GHZ and W states in fiber channels. In a fiber channel, the two most important phenomena that affect polarization entanglement are polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and polarization-dependent loss (PDL). We theoretically characterize how PMD and PDL vectors affect three-qubit states. In particular, upon quantifying the entanglement at the output states using concurrence and entanglement witnesses, we reveal the occurrence of entanglement sudden death and the appearance of decoherence-free subspaces in tripartite systems. Finally, we explore the evolution of GHZ and W state with an arbitrary number of photons in a fiber network and discuss the decoherence mechanism of the 4-party cluster state.

TI Localized Nanoscale Formation of Vanadyl Porphyrin 2D MOF Nanosheets and
   Their Optimal Coupling to Lumped Element Superconducting Resonators
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB A strategy toward the realization of a quantum spin processor involves the coupling of spin qubits and qudits to photons within superconducting resonators. To enable the realization of such hybrid architecture, here we first explore the design of a chip with multiple lumped-element LC superconducting resonators optimized for their coupling to distinct transitions of a vanadyl porphyrin electronuclear qudit. The controlled integration of the vanadyl qudit onto the superconducting device, both in terms of number and orientation, is then attained using the in situ formation of nanosheets of a 2D framework built on the vanadyl qudit as a node. Low-temperature transmission experiments demonstrate the coupling of photons in resonators with different frequencies to the targeted electronuclear transitions of the vanadyl qudit, also confirming the control over the vanadyl qudit node orientation. The derived collective spin-photon couplings in the 0.3-1.6 MHz range then allow to estimate enhanced, optimal, single spin photon couplings up to 4 Hz.

TI Data Obfuscation for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Using Quantum

Originating from quantum machine learning frameworks, the method injects controlled noise into these generators, deliberately breaking symmetry and obscuring the source data while retaining predictive utility. Experiments on open medical datasets show that classifiers trained on obfuscated features match or slightly exceed the baseline accuracy obtained on raw data. This work demonstrates how Lie-group theory can advance privacy in sensitive domains by providing simultaneous data obfuscation and augmentation.

TI Future Paths in Cryogenic Single-Molecule Fluorescence Spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB In the last three decades, cryogenic single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy has provided average-free understanding of the photophysics and of fundamental interactions at molecular scales. Furthermore, they propose original pathways and applications in the treatment and storage of quantum information. The ultranarrow lifetime-limited zero-phonon line acts as an excellent sensor to local perturbations caused either by intrinsic dynamical degrees of freedom, or by external perturbations, such as those caused by electric fields, elastic and acoustic deformations, or light-induced dynamics. Single aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, being sensitive to nanoscale probing at nanometer scales, are potential miniaturized platforms for integrated quantum photonics. In this Perspective, we look back at some of the past advances in cryogenic optical microscopy and propose some perspectives for future development.

TI Topological protection of highly entangled non-Gaussian two-photon
   states
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We study theoretically the evolution of entangled non-Gaussian two-photon states in disordered topological lattices. Specifically, we consider spatially entangled two-photon states, modulated by Laguerre polynomials up to the 3rd order, which feature ring-shaped spatial and spectral correlation patterns. Such states are discrete analogs of photon-subtracted squeezed states, which are ubiquitous in optical quantum information processing or sensing applications. We find that, in general, a higher degree of entanglement coincides with a loss of topological protection against disorder, this is in line with previous results for Gaussian two-photon states. However, we identify a particular regime in the parameter space of the considered non-Gaussian states, where the situation is reversed and an increase of entanglement can be beneficial for the transport of two-photon quantum states through disordered regions.

TI Error rates and resource overheads of repetition cat qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We estimate and analyze the error rates and the resource overheads of the repetition cat qubit approach to universal and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation exhibit an extremely biased noise where the bit-flip error rate is exponentially suppressed with the mean number of photons. In a recent work we suggested that the remaining phase-flip error channel could be suppressed using a one-dimensional repetition code. Indeed, using only bias-preserving gates on the cat qubits, it is possible to build a universal set of fault-tolerant logical gates at the level of the repetition cat qubit. In this paper we perform Monte Carlo simulations of all the circuits implementing the protected logical gates, using a circuit-level error model. Furthermore, we analyze two different approaches to implement a fault-tolerant Toffoli gate on repetition cat qubits. These numerical simulations indicate that very low logical error rates could be achieved with a reasonable resource overhead, and with parameters that are within the reach of near-term circuit QED experiments.

TI Single-state semiquantum private comparison based on Bell states

AB In this paper, a novel semiquantum private comparison (SQPC) protocol based on single kind of Bell states is proposed, which allows two classical parties to judge the equality of their private inputs securely and correctly under the help of a semi-honest third party (TP) who possesses complete quantum capabilities. TP is allowed to misbehave on her own but cannot conspire with anyone else. Our protocol needs none of unitary operations, quantum entanglement swapping or the reordering operations. Moreover, our protocol only needs to prepare single kind of Bell states as initial quantum resource. Detailed security analysis turns out that our protocol is secure against various outside and participant attacks. Compared with most of the existing SQPC protocols based on Bell states, our protocol is more feasible in practice.

TI Quantum-classical algorithms for skewed linear systems with an optimized
   Hadamard test
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The solving of linear systems provides a rich area to investigate the use of nearer-term, noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computers. In this work, we discuss hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for heavily skewed linear systems for overdetermined and underdetermined cases. Our input model is such that the columns or rows of the matrix defining the linear system are given via quantum circuits of polylogarithmic depth and the number of circuits is much smaller than their Hilbert space dimension. Our algorithms have polylogarithmic dependence on the dimension and polynomial dependence in other natural quantities. In addition, we present an algorithm for the special case of a factorized linear system with run time polylogarithmic in the respective dimensions. At the core of these algorithms is the Hadamard test and in the second part of this paper, we consider the optimization of the circuit depth of this test. Given an n-qubit and d-depth quantum circuit C, we can approximate < 0 vertical bar C vertical bar 0 > using (n + s) qubits and O(log(2) s + d log(2) (n/s) + d)-depth quantum circuits, where s <= n. In comparison, the standard implementation requires n + 1 qubits and O(dn) depth. Lattice geometries underlie recent quantum supremacy experiments with superconducting devices. We also optimize the Hadamard test for an (l(1) x l(2)) lattice with l(1) x l(2) = n and can approximate < 0 vertical bar C vertical bar 0 > with (n + 1) qubits and O(d(l(1) + l(2)))-depth circuits. In comparison, the standard depth is O(dn(2)) in this setting. Both of our optimization methods are asymptotically tight in the case of one-depth quantum circuits C.

TI Collective multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering via cascaded
   four-wave mixing of rubidium atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Collective multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a type of quantum correlation shared among n parties, where the EPR paradox of one party can be realized only by performing local measurements on all the remaining n - 1 parties. Here, we propose an efficient method to produce collective multipartite EPR steering via symmetrically and asymmetrically cascading parametric amplification processes, i.e., four-wave mixing (FWM) of rubidium atoms. The simplified collective-steering criterion is introduced using the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy relation. Moreover, by actively adjusting the parametric gains, the collective EPR steerability is optimized in our schemes. We find that the scale of collective steering can be extended by cascading more FWMs; in particular, introducing optical loss is useful for generating collective steering with more parties only in the asymmetry structure. Our results pave the way for the construction of quantum networks and provide a promising candidate for one-sided device-independent quantum cryptography among multiple users.

TI Insights from educators on building a more cohesive quantum information
   science and engineering education ecosystem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB As the need for a quantum-ready workforce grows, educators in quantum information science and engineering (QISE) face the challenge of aligning their programs and courses with industry needs. Through a series of interviews with program directors and faculty across 15 different institutions, we identified the considerations that educators are currently addressing as they develop their various courses and programs. Grounded in a curriculum framework, we conducted a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, which revealed shared challenges and opportunities about program goals, curriculum development, collaboration, program data collection and evaluation, and connections across stakeholders in the quantum ecosystem that educators should consider when developing their QISE efforts. Our findings highlight five overarching themes: (1) the strategic ways educators navigate institutional structures to support QISE initiatives, (2) the ongoing challenge of aligning QISE curricula with industry and institutional needs, (3) the importance of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across departments and institutions in QISE, (4) the need for robust data collection and evaluation to inform QISE course and program development, and (5) the importance of strengthening industry-academia connections to prepare students for the quantum workforce. The details and interconnections in our findings illustrate the value of applying a structured approach to QISE course and program development with the goal of creating a more cohesive QISE education ecosystem.

TI All-microwave Lamb shift engineering for a fixed frequency multi-level
   superconducting qubit
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB It is known that the electromagnetic vacuum is responsible for the Lamb shift, which is a crucial phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics (QED). In circuit QED, the readout or bus resonators that are dispersively coupled can result in a significant Lamb shift of the qubit. However, previous approaches or proposals for controlling the Lamb shift in circuit QED demand overheads in circuit designs or non-perturbative renormalization of the system's eigenbases, which can impose formidable limitations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate an all-microwave method for controlling the Lamb shift of fixed-frequency transmons. We employ the drive-induced longitudinal coupling between the transmon and resonator. By simply using an off-resonant monochromatic drive near the resonator frequency, we can control the net Lamb shift up to +/- 30 MHz and engineer it to zero with the drive-induced longitudinal coupling without facing the aforementioned challenges. Our work establishes an efficient way of engineering the fundamental effects of the electromagnetic vacuum and provides greater flexibility in non-parametric frequency controls of multilevel systems.
   Engineering the Lamb shifts of superconducting qubits opens new opportunities in resonant frequency tunings and other applications. Here, the authors devise and demonstrate an all-microwave approach that can be utilized with fixed-frequency superconducting qubits.

TI Erasure Qubits: Overcoming the T1 Limit in Superconducting Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The amplitude-damping time T1 has long stood as the major factor limiting quantum fidelity in superconducting circuits, prompting concerted efforts in the material science and design of qubits aimed at increasing T1. In contrast, the dephasing time T phi can usually be extended above T1 (via, e.g., dynamical decoupling) to the point where it does not limit fidelity. In this article, we propose a scheme for overcoming the conventional T1 limit on fidelity by designing qubits in a way that amplitude-damping errors can be detected and converted into erasure errors. Compared to standard qubit implementations, our scheme improves the performance of fault-tolerant protocols, as numerically demonstrated by the circuit-noise simulations of the surface code. We describe two simple qubit implementations with superconducting circuits and discuss procedures for detecting amplitude-damping errors, performing entangling gates, and extending T phi. Our results suggest that engineering efforts should focus on improving T phi and the quality of quantum coherent control, as they effectively become the limiting factor on the performance of faulttolerant protocols.

TI Fiber-Integrated Diamond Quantum Sensor for High-Voltage Current
   Measurements
SO ADVANCED SENSOR RESEARCH
AB In power network systems, there is an urgent demand for highly accurate and miniaturized sensors, owing to their high safety level and limited installation space. Current sensors in high-voltage grids are required to accommodate harsh environments and provide accurate measurements of several kiloamperes. Thus, this study proposed an integrated quantum diamond sensor to facilitate high-accuracy, large-dynamic-range current measurements. The design incorporated optical fiber and directional microwave (MW) antennas to drive the diamond sensor, which significantly reduced the size and power consumption on the high-voltage side. Remote-control and demodulation systems are installed more than 10 m away from the low-voltage side. The proposed approach achieved zero power consumption on the high-voltage side and ensured efficient signal transmission. A passive diamond probe manufactured using microfabrication processes facilitated miniaturization and practical deployment. Through parameter optimization, a magnetic detection sensitivity of 4.86 nT<middle dot>Hz-1/2 is achieved at a safe distance of 11 m, which can be further optimized to 0.77 nT<middle dot>Hz-1/2 with enhanced MW power. This sensor achieved a current measurement error of +/- 0.4% in the 1000 A measurement range. Thus, this study provides a new solution for the application of diamond quantum sensors in power systems.
   Diamond quantum sensors are gaining momentum owing to the demand for industrial measurements. To facilitate the measurement of current in a high-voltage power grid, a diamond sensor design combining optical fibers and directional antennas is proposed. This provides a robust and scalable design and solution to the challenges encountered by diamond quantum sensors in power systems. image

TI No contextual advantage in nonparadoxical scenarios of the two-state
   vector formalism
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The two-state vector formalism (TSVF) proposed by Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz [A. Aharonov, P. G. Bergmann, and J. L. Lebowitz, Phys. Rev. 134, B1410 (1964)] allows a counterfactual assignment of probabilities of outcomes of contemplated (but unperformed) measurements on quantum systems. The probabilities assigned by the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule and the associated weak values have been used to provide insights into quantum situations and to unearth underlying quantum contextuality. We apply the principle of exclusivity on ABL probabilities which are assigned to mutually orthogonal projectors to define paradoxical and nonparadoxical scenarios. Given a pre-and a postselected pair of states, we consider the nonparadoxical sector with a view to explore the demonstration of quantum contextuality. For the Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky scenario, we numerically show that the ABL probabilities of the TSVF in the nonparadoxical sector do not offer any contextual advantage. Our approach can be easily generalized to other contextual scenarios as well. We thus argue that several previous proofs of the emergence of contextuality in pre-and postselected scenarios are only possible if the principle of exclusivity is violated and are therefore classified as paradoxical.

TI Secure quantum secret sharing without signal disturbance monitoring
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is an essential primitive for the future quantum internet, which promises secure multiparty communication. However, developing a large-scale QSS network is a huge challenge due to the channel loss and the requirement of multiphoton interference or high-fidelity multipartite entanglement distribution. Here, we propose a three-user QSS protocol without monitoring signal disturbance, which is capable of ensuring the unconditional security. The final key rate of our protocol can be demonstrated to break the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bound of quantum channel and its simulated transmission distance can approach over 600 km using current techniques. Our results pave the way to realizing high-rate and large-scale QSS networks. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Magnon-magnon entanglement and its quantification via a microwave cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum magnonics is an emerging research field, with great potential for applications in magnon based hybrid systems and quantum information processing. Quantum correlation, such as entanglement, is a central resource in many quantum information protocols that naturally comes about in any study toward quantum technologies. This applies also to quantum magnonics. Here, we investigate antiferromagnetic coupling of two ferromagnetic sublattices that can have two different magnon modes. We show how this may lead to experimentally measurable bipartite continuous-variable magnon-magnon entanglement. The entanglement can be fully characterized via a single squeezing parameter or, equivalently, entanglement parameter. The clear relation between the entanglement parameter and the Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) function of the ground state opens up for experimental quantification magnon-magnon continuous-variable entanglement and EPR nonlocality. We propose a practical experimental realization to measure the EPR function of the ground state, in a setting that relies on magnon-photon interaction in a microwave cavity.

TI Asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum digital signatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum digital signatures (QDSs), which distribute and measure quantum states by key generation protocols and then sign messages via classical data processing, are a key area of interest in quantum cryptography. However, the practical implementation of a QDS network has many challenges, including complex interference technical requirements, linear channel loss of quantum state transmission, and potential side-channel attacks on detectors. Here, we propose an asynchronous measurement-device-independent (MDI) QDS protocol with asynchronous two-photon interference strategy and one-time universal hashing method. The two-photon interference approach protects our protocol against all detector side-channel attacks and relaxes the difficulty of experiment implementation, while the asynchronous strategy effectively reduces the equivalent channel loss to its square root. Compared to previous MDI-QDS schemes, our protocol shows several orders of magnitude performance improvements and doubling of transmission distance when processing multibit messages. Our findings present an efficient and practical MDI-QDS scheme, paving the way for large-scale data processing with nonrepudiation in quantum networks.

TI Ansatz-Free Hamiltonian Learning with Heisenberg-Limited Scaling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Learning the unknown interactions that govern a quantum system is crucial for quantum information processing, device benchmarking, and quantum sensing. The problem, known as Hamiltonian learning, is well understood under the assumption that interactions are local, but this assumption may not hold for arbitrary Hamiltonians. Previous methods all require high-order inverse polynomial dependency with precision, unable to surpass the standard quantum limit and reach the gold-standard Heisenberg-limited scaling. Whether Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning is possible without prior assumptions about the interaction structures, a challenge we term ansatz-free Hamiltonian learning, remains an open question. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm to learn arbitrary sparse Hamiltonians without any structure constraints using only black-box queries of the system's real-time evolution and minimal digital controls to attain Heisenberg-limited scaling in estimation error. Our method is also resilient to state-preparationand-measurement errors, enhancing its practical feasibility. We numerically demonstrate our ansatz-free protocol for learning physical Hamiltonians and validating analog quantum simulations, benchmarking our performance against the state-of-the-art Heisenberg-limited learning approach. Moreover, we establish a fundamental trade-off between total evolution time and quantum control on learning arbitrary interactions, revealing the intrinsic interplay between controllability and total evolution-time complexity for any learning algorithm. These results pave the way for further exploration into Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning in complex quantum systems under minimal assumptions, potentially enabling new benchmarking and verification protocols.

AB String matching stands as a cornerstone problem in computer science, finding extensive application in many fields, such as data mining, text retrieval, and bioinformatics, just to cite a few. Its essence lies in identifying all occurrences of a specified pattern, typically denoted by length m, within a text of length n. Despite its seemingly straightforward formulation, the problem has sparked a plethora of solutions, stemming from diverse computational paradigms and approaches. Classical solutions exhibit a worst-case time complexity of Theta(n), contrasting with the capability of quantum computation to achieve a (O) over tilde (root n) complexity using Grover search, thereby realizing a quadratic speed-up compared to classical methods. This article presents a first practical implementation of a quantum circuit tailored to address string matching, particularly focusing on binary strings. The exposition delves into the technical intricacies of the implementation, which leverages the Qiskit open-source toolkit developed by IBM. By elucidating various algorithmic nuances overlooked in prior theoretical formulations, our solution serves as a conduit between the realms of text processing and quantum computing, fostering cross-disciplinary dialogue and innovation. While current real-world hardware lacks the capability to execute the proposed circuit, particularly when dealing with lengthy texts, this study presents experimental results from a simulation of the circuit on classical hardware, serving to validate the efficacy of the proposed implementation.

SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work, we study the coupling between a superconducting device as a dc SQUID, simulated from an artificial atom with two degrees of freedom, and a single-mode radiation field for the information transference process. We demonstrate that the population transfer among the energy levels of the artificial atom yields entanglement dynamics, which leads to the generation of a pair of photons. Moreover, we show the quantum information transference between the internal modes of the superconducting device, initially in a maximally entangled state, and the radiation field. The artificial atom absorbs the photon, and the radiation field modes become entangled as quantum coherence is transmitted from the superconducting device to the photons. These results strengthen the applicability of superconducting devices for the transference of quantum information, contributing to promising applications in emerging quantum technologies.

TI Wigner state and process tomography on near-term quantum devices
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We present an experimental scanning-based tomography approach for near-term quantum devices. The underlying method has previously been introduced in an ensemble-based NMR setting. Here we provide a tutorial-style explanation along with suitable software tools to guide experimentalists in its adaptation to near-term pure-state quantum devices. The approach is based on a Wigner-type representation of quantum states and operators. These representations provide a rich visualization of quantum operators using shapes assembled from a linear combination of spherical harmonics. These shapes (called droplets in the following) can be experimentally tomographed by measuring the expectation values of rotated axial tensor operators. We present an experimental framework for implementing the scanning-based tomography technique for circuit-based quantum computers and showcase results from IBM quantum experience. We also present a method for estimating the density and process matrices from experimentally tomographed Wigner functions (droplets). This tomography approach can be directly implemented using the Python-based software package DROPStomo.

TI Circuit quantum electrodynamics
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Quantum-mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson-junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980s. In recent decades, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to gate-based digital quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED provides a framework for the study of hybrid quantum systems, such as quantum dots, magnons, Rydberg atoms, surface acoustic waves, and mechanical systems interacting with microwave photons. Here the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focusing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system are reviewed. Also discussed is coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics are discussed. Circuit QED realizes a broad set of concepts that open up new possibilities for the study of quantum physics at the macro scale with superconducting circuits and applications to quantum information science in the widest sense.

TI Determination of the Permittivity of Transmission Lines at Milli-Kelvin
   Temperatures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Many quantum technologies rely heavily on propagation of RF and microwave signals through devices at cryogenic temperatures, and detailed understanding of materials and signal propagation is therefore key to improving the performance of quantum circuits. The properties of dielectric substrate materials used for transmission lines (TLs) such as their permittivity need to be precisely determined to design high performance quantum integrated circuits. In this paper, we discuss a measurement technique for determining the effective permittivity of a TL at mK temperatures. The technique utilizes S-parameter measurements of multiple TLs to reliably extract the effective permittivity of the TL implemented in a substrate material. The technique is demonstrated using measured S-parameters of grounded co-planar waveguide (GCPW) at 296 K and 15 mK. The effective permittivity of the TL at 296 K and 15 mK are determined from measurements and compared. We observed the effective permittivity determinations at 15 mK to be approximately frequency independent and calculated the relative permittivity of Rogers RO4350B material at 15 mK to be 3.64. There is no significant deviation from this relative permittivity value with respect to manufacturer data and from measured data at 296 K.

TI Any-To-Any Connected Cavity-Mediated Architecture for Quantum Computing
   with Trapped Ions or Rydberg Arrays
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a hardware architecture and protocol for connecting many local quantum processors contained within an optical cavity. The scheme is compatible with trapped ions or Rydberg arrays, and realizes teleported gates between any two qubits by distributing entanglement via single-photon transfers through a cavity. Heralding enables high-fidelity entanglement even for a cavity of moderate quality. For processors composed of trapped ions in a linear chain, a single cavity with realistic parameters successfully transfers photons every few mu s, increasing the interchain entanglement rate over 2 orders of magnitude beyond current methods and eliminating a major bottleneck for scaling trapped-ion systems. For one realistic scenario, we outline how to achieve the any-to-any entanglement of 20 ion chains containing a total of 500 qubits in 200 mu s, with both fidelities and rates limited only by local operations and ion readout. For processors composed of Rydberg atoms, our method fully connects a large array of thousands of neutral atoms. The connectivity afforded by our architecture is extendable to tens of thousands of qubits using multiple overlapping cavities, expanding capabilities for noisy intermediate-scale quantum era algorithms and Hamiltonian simulations, as well as enabling more robust high-dimensional error-correcting schemes.

TI Perturbation theory with quantum signal processing
SO QUANTUM
AB Perturbation theory is an important technique for reducing computational cost and providing physical insights in simulating quantum systems with classical computers. Here, we provide a quantum algorithm to obtain perturbative ener-gies on quantum computers. The benefit of us-ing quantum computers is that we can start the perturbation from a Hamiltonian that is classi-cally hard to solve. The proposed algorithm uses quantum signal processing (QSP) to achieve this goal. Along with the perturbation theory, we construct a technique for ground state prepara-tion with detailed computational cost analysis, which can be of independent interest. We also estimate a rough computational cost of the algo-rithm for simple chemical systems such as water clusters and polyacene molecules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of such estimates for practical applications of QSP. Unfortunately, we find that the proposed algorithm, at least in its current form, does not exhibit practical num-b ers despite of the efficiency of QSP compared to conventional quantum algorithms. However, perturbation theory itself is an attractive di-rection to explore because of its physical inter-pretability; it provides us insights about what interaction gives an important contribution to the properties of systems. This is in sharp con -trast to the conventional approaches based on the quantum phase estimation algorithm, where we can only obtain values of energy. From this aspect, this work is a first step towards "ex-plainable" quantum simulation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. =`

TI Anonymous and private parameter estimation in networks of quantum
   sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Anonymity and privacy are two key properties of modern communication networks. In quantum networks, distributed quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful use case, with applications to clock synchronization, detecting gravitational effects, and more. In this work, we develop a new protocol that, for the first time, combines the different cryptographic properties of anonymity and privacy for the task of distributed parameter estimation. That is, we present a protocol that allows a selected subset of network participants to anonymously collaborate in estimating the average of their private parameters. Crucially, this is achieved without disclosing either the individual parameter values or the identities of the participants, neither to each other nor to the broader network.

TI Fiber loop quantum buffer for photonic qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report a fiber loop quantum buffer based on a low-loss 2 x 2 switch and a unit delay made of a fiber delay line. We characterize the device by using a two-photon polarization entangled state in which one photon of the entangled photon pair is stored and retrieved at a repetition rate up to 78 kHz. The device, which enables integer multiples of a unit delay, can store the qubit state in a unit of fiber delay line up to 5.4 km and the number of loop round-trips up to 3. Furthermore, we configure the device with other active elements to realize integer multiplier and divider of a unit delay of a qubit. The quantum state tomography is performed on the retrieved photon and its entangled photon. We obtain a state fidelity > 94 % with a maximum storage time of 52 s with an insertion loss of 5.56 dB. To further characterize the storing and retrieving processes of the device, we perform entanglement-assisted quantum process tomography on the buffered qubit state. The process fidelity of the device is > 0.98. Our result implies that the device preserves the superposition and entanglement of a qubit state from a two-photon polarization-entangled state. This is a significant step towards facilitating applications in optical asynchronous transfer mode based quantum networks.

TI Molecular excited state calculations with adaptive wavefunctions on a
   quantum eigensolver emulation: reducing circuit depth and separating
   spin states
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Ab initio electronic excited state calculations are necessary for the quantitative study of photochemical reactions, but their accurate computation on classical computers is plagued by prohibitive resource scaling. The Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) is an extension of the quantum-classical Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for calculating electronic excited state energies, and has the potential to address some of these scaling challenges using quantum computers. However, quantum computers available in the near term can only support a limited number of quantum circuit operations, so reducing the quantum computational cost in VQD methods is critical to their realisation. In this work, we investigate the use of adaptive quantum circuit growth (ADAPT-VQE) in excited state VQD calculations, a strategy that has been successful previously in reducing the resources required for ground state energy VQE calculations. We also invoke spin restrictions to separate the recovery of eigenstates with different spin symmetry to reduce the number of calculations and accumulation of errors in computing excited states. We created a quantum eigensolver emulation package - Quantum Eigensolver Building on Achievements of Both quantum computing and quantum chemistry (QEBAB) - for testing the proposed adaptive procedure against two existing VQD methods that use fixed-length quantum circuits: UCCGSD-VQD and k-UpCCGSD-VQD. For a lithium hydride test case we found that the spin-restricted adaptive growth variant of VQD uses the most compact circuits out of the tested methods by far, consistently recovers adequate electron correlation energy for different nuclear geometries and eigenstates while isolating the singlet and triplet manifold. This work is a further step towards developing techniques which improve the efficiency of hybrid quantum algorithms for excited state quantum chemistry, opening up the possibility of exploiting real quantum computers for electronic excited state calculations sooner than previously anticipated.

AB The rapid single-flux-quantum (RSFQ) superconducting technology is highly promising due to its ultra-high-speed computation with ultra-low-power consumption, making it an ideal solution for the post-Moore era. In superconducting technology, information is encoded and processed based on pulses that resemble the neuronal pulses present in biological neural systems. This has led to a growing research focus on implementing neuromorphic processing using superconducting technology. However, current research on superconducting neuromorphic processing does not fully leverage the advantages of superconducting circuits due to incomplete neuromorphic design and approach. Although they have demonstrated the benefits of using superconducting technology for neuromorphic hardware, their designs are mostly incomplete, with only a few components validated, or based solely on simulation. This paper presents SUSHI (Superconducting neUromorphic proceSsing cHIp) to fully leverage the potential of superconducting neuromorphic processing. Based on three guiding principles and our architectural and methodological designs, we address existing challenges and enables the design of verifiable and fabricable superconducting neuromorphic chips. We fabricate and verify a chip of SUSHI using superconducting circuit technology. Successfully obtaining the correct inference results of a complete neural network on the chip, this is the first instance of neural networks being completely executed on a superconducting chip to the best of our knowledge. Our evaluation shows that using approximately 10(5) Josephson junctions, SUSHI achieves a peak neuromorphic processing performance of 1,355 giga-synaptic operations per second (GSOPS) and a power efficiency of 32,366 GSOPS perWatt (GSOPS/W). This power efficiency outperforms the state-of-the-art neuromorphic chips TrueNorth and Tianjic by 81 and 50 times, respectively.

TI Typical bipartite steerability and generalized local quantum
   measurements
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Recently proposed correlation-matrix-based sufficient conditions for bipartite steerability from Alice to Bob for arbitrary measurements are applied to local informationally complete positive operator valued measures (POVMs) of the (N,M)-type. These POVMs include a large class of local generalized measurements of current interest [Siudzinska K 2022 Phys. Rev. A 105 042209]. It is shown that the trace norm of correlation matrices with local (N,M)-POVMs is proportional to that of local orthonormal hermitian operator bases (LOOs). This implies that all types of informationally complete (N,M)-POVMs are equally powerful in detecting bipartite steerability from Alice to Bob and, in addition, they are as powerful as LOOs. In order to explore the typicality of steering numerical calculations of lower bounds on Euclidean volume ratios between steerable bipartite quantum states from Alice to Bob and all quantum states are determined with the help of a hit-and-run Monte-Carlo algorithm. These results demonstrate that with the single exception of two qubits this correlation-matrix-based sufficient condition significantly underestimates these volume ratios. These results are also compared to a recently proposed method that determines bipartite steerability from Alice's qubit to Bob's arbitrary dimensional quantum system by bipartite entanglement detection. It is demonstrated that in general this method is significantly more effective in detecting typical steerability provided non local entanglement detection methods are used which transcend local measurements.

TI Visualizing multiqubit correlations using the Wigner function
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Quantum engineering now allows to design and construct multi-qubit states in a range of physical systems. These states are typically quite complex in nature, with disparate, but relevant properties that include both single and multi-qubit coherences and even entanglement. All these properties can be assessed by reconstructing the density matrix of those states-but the large parameter space can mean physical insight of the nature of those states and their coherence can be hard to achieve. Here, we explore how the Wigner function of a multipartite system and its visualization provides rich information on the nature of the state, not only at illustrative level but also at the quantitative level. We test our tools in a photonic architecture making use of the multiple degrees of freedom of two photons.

TI Characterization of entanglement on superconducting quantum computers of
   up to 414 qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB As quantum technology advances and the size of quantum computers grow, it becomes increasingly important to understand the extent of quality in the devices. As large-scale entanglement is a quantum resource crucial for achieving quantum advantage, the challenge in its generation makes it a valuable benchmark for measuring the performance of universal quantum devices. In this paper, we study entanglement in Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and graph states prepared on the range of IBM Quantum devices. We generate GHZ states and investigate their coherence times with respect to state size and dynamical decoupling techniques. A GHZ fidelity of 0.519 +/- 0.014 is measured on a 32-qubit GHZ state, certifying its genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). We show a substantial improvement in GHZ decoherence rates for a seven-qubit GHZ state after implementing dynamical decoupling, and observe a linear trend in the decoherence rate of alpha = (7.13N + 5.54) x 10-3 mu s-1 for up to N = 15 qubits, confirming the absence of superdecoherence. Additionally, we prepare and characterize fully bipartite entangled native-graph states on 22 superconducting quantum devices with qubit counts as high as 414 qubits, all active qubits of the 433-qubit IBM Osprey device. Analysis of the decay of two-qubit entanglement within the prepared states shows suppression of coherent noise signals with the implementation of dynamical decoupling techniques. Additionally, we observe that the entanglement in some qubit pairs oscillates over time, which is likely caused by residual ZZ-interactions. Characterizing entanglement in native-graph states, along with detecting entanglement oscillations, can be an effective approach to low-level device benchmarking that encapsulates two-qubit error rates along with additional sources of noise, with possible applications to quantum circuit compilation. We develop several tools to automate the preparation and entanglement characterization of GHZ and graph states. In particular, a method to characterize graph state bipartite entanglement using just 36 circuits, constant with respect to the number of qubits.

TI Prepare-and-Measure Scenarios with Photon-Number Constraints
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study correlations in the prepare-and-measure scenario when quantum communication is constrained by photon-number statistics. Such constraints are natural and practical control parameters for semi-device-independent certification in optical platforms. To analyse these scenarios, we show how semidefinite programming relaxations for noncommutative polynomial optimization can be used to bound the set of quantum correlations under restrictions on the photon-number distribution. The practicality of this method is demonstrated by computing optimal performance bounds on several well-known communication tasks. We then apply the method to the certification of semi-device-inpependent random number generation protocols and show how to bound the conditional Shannon entropy. We showcase this versatile tool by improving randomness extraction in established protocols based on coherent states and homodyne measurements.

TI Co-designing Spectral Transformation Oracles with Hybrid
   Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: From Algorithms to Compilation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete-or continuous-variable (qubit or qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time-evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous-variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.

AB We propose a new approach to generate quantum-correlated pulse pairs using fission of chirped Manakov solitons. Quantum correlations are studied using linearized quantum fluctuation theory. The fission of chirped solitons produces both intra-pulse and inter-pulse high-level correlations. We found that the collision of vector solitons induces nonzero correlations in orthogonal polarization components of the pulse field. The fission of solitons and subsequent collision of the resulting pulses allow a pulse train with complex correlation pattern to be produced. The generation of pulses with correlated quantum fluctuations offers the possibility of engineering new entangled sources for continuous-variable quantum communication and computation.

TI Environmental radiation impact on lifetimes and quasiparticle tunneling
   rates of fixed-frequency transmon qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum computing relies on the operation of qubits in an environment as free of noise as possible. Assessing the quality of this environment is a key aspect of ensuring high-fidelity implementations based on superconducting qubits. Relaxation, decoherence, dephasing, and quasiparticle tunneling rates have been measured for various shielding configurations used in the measurement environment for state-of-the-art transmon qubits. An ensemble of approximately 120 control devices was used for this study, with five different capacitor pad designs. The shielding elements varied in the configuration included an indium gasket at the qubit can's lid, Cryoperm magnetic shielding, the mixing chamber shield of the dilution refrigerator, the inclusion of a vacuum pump-out port, and capping unused subminiature version A connectors at the top of the measurement can's lid. It was found that the qubit lifetimes T-1, T-2, and T-phi are robust to the all of configuration changes tried until the mixing chamber shield was removed, significantly increasing blackbody radiation levels in the qubit measurement space, where in that limit it was found that tapering the qubit pads reduced the amount of loss. In contrast, the quasiparticle tunneling rates were found to be extremely sensitive to all configuration changes tested. Consistent with earlier reports [McEwen et al., arXiv:2104.05219 (2021); Cardani et al., Nat. Commun. 12, 2733 (2021); Wilen et al., Nature 594, 369-373 (2021); Riste et al. Nat. Commun. 4, 1913 (2013)], the findings from this study indicate that non-equilibrium quasiparticles do not currently limit the lifetimes of well-shielded transmon qubits.

TI Quantum Simulation of the First-Quantized Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We provide an explicit recursive divide-and-conquer approach for simulating quantum dynamics and derive a discrete first-quantized nonrelativistic QED Hamiltonian based on the many-particle Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. We apply this recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm to this Hamiltonian and compare it to a concrete simulation algorithm that uses qubitization. Our divide-and-conquer algorithm, using lowestorder Trotterization, scales for fixed grid spacing as (O) over tilde(Lambda N-2 eta(2)t(2)/epsilon) for grid size N, eta particles, simulation time t, field cutoff A, and error E. Our qubitization algorithm scales as (O) over tilde (N(eta + N)(eta + Lambda(2))t log(1/epsilon)). This shows that even a naive partitioning and low-order splitting formula can yield, through our divide-and-conquer formalism, superior scaling to qubitization for large A. We compare the relative costs of these two algorithms on systems that are relevant for applications such as the spontaneous emission of photons and the photoionization of electrons. We observe that for different parameter regimes, one method can be favored over the other. Finally, we give new algorithmic and circuit-level techniques for gate optimization, including a new way of implementing a group of multicontrolled-X gates that can be used for better analysis of circuit cost.

Traditional methods for developing nanophotonic devices are often constrained by the high dimensionality of design spaces and computational inefficiencies. This review highlights how AI-driven techniques provide transformative solutions by enabling the efficient exploration of vast design spaces, optimizing intricate parameter systems, and predicting the performance of advanced nanophotonic materials and devices with high accuracy.

TI Quantum latent diffusion models
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The introduction of quantum concepts is increasingly making its way into generative machine learning models. However, while there are various implementations of quantum generative adversarial networks, the integration of quantum elements into diffusion models remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose a potential version of a quantum diffusion model that leverages the established idea of classical latent diffusion models. This involves using a traditional autoencoder to reduce images, followed by operations with variational circuits in the latent space. To effectively assess the benefits brought by quantum computing, the images generated by the quantum latent diffusion model have been compared to those generated by a classical model with a similar number of parameters, evaluated in terms of quantitative metrics. The results demonstrate an advantage in using a quantum version, as evidenced by obtaining better metrics for the images generated by the quantum version compared to those obtained by the classical version. Furthermore, quantum models continue to outperform even when considering small percentages of the dataset for training, demonstrating the quantum's ability to extract features more effectively even in a few shot learning scenario.

TI Demonstration of universal control between non-interacting qubits using
   the Quantum Zeno effect
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Zeno effect occurs in quantum systems when a very strong measurement is applied, which can alter the dynamics in non-trivial ways. Despite being dissipative, the dynamics stay coherent within any degenerate subspaces of the measurement. Here we show that such a measurement can turn a single-qubit operation into a two- or multi-qubit entangling gate, even in a non-interacting system. We demonstrate this gate between two effectively non-interacting transmon qubits. Our Zeno gate works by imparting a geometric phase on the system, conditioned on it lying within a particular non-local subspace. These results show how universality can be generated not only by coherent interactions as is typically employed in quantum information platforms, but also by Zeno measurements.

TI Relativistic Landau quantization in non-uniform magnetic field and its
   applications to white dwarfs and quantum information
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We investigate the two-dimensional motion of relativistic cold electrons in the presence of 'strictly' spatially varying magnetic fields satisfying, however, no magnetic monopole condition. We find that the degeneracy of Landau levels, which arises in the case of the constant magnetic field, lifts out when the field is variable and the energy levels of spin-up and spin-down electrons align in an interesting way depending on the nature of change of field. Also, the varying magnetic field splits Landau levels of electrons with zero angular momentum from positive angular momentum, unlike the constant field which only can split the levels between positive and negative angular momenta. Exploring Landau quantization in non-uniform magnetic fields is a unique venture on its own and has interdisciplinary implications in the fields ranging from condensed matter to astrophysics to quantum information. As examples, we show magnetized white dwarfs, with varying magnetic fields, involved simultaneously with Lorentz force and Landau quantization affecting the underlying degenerate electron gas, exhibiting a significant violation of the Chandrasekhar mass-limit; and an increase in quantum speed of electrons in the presence of a spatially growing magnetic field.

TI Hidden Inverses: Coherent Error Cancellation at the Circuit Level
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Coherent gate errors are a concern in many proposed quantum-computing architectures. Here, we show that certain coherent errors can be reduced by a local optimization that chooses between two forms of the same Hermitian and unitary quantum gate. We refer to this method as hidden inverses, and it relies on constructing the same gate from either one sequence of physical operations or the inverted sequence of inverted operations. We use parity-controlled Z rotations as our model circuit and numerically show the utility of hidden inverses as a function of circuit width n. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness for n = 2 and n = 4 qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer. We numerically compare the method to other gate-level compilations for reducing coherent errors.

TI Problem Relaxation Methods for Quantum Minimum Fill-in Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Current quantum annealing and quantum-inspired annealing devices have many usage limitations and are difficult to apply to real-scale problems. In particular, a major hardware limitation is the limited number of available variables (qubits). This paper proposes a problem relaxation method for the Quantum Minimum Fill-in (QMF) algorithm. QMF finds the ordering of matrix rows and columns that minimizes the incidence of fill-ins that occur when a direct solver is used to solve linear equations with sparse matrices. In general, the first few steps in the forward elimination of sparse matrices add the most fill-ins. Therefore, QMF was relaxed to order the rows and columns in only the first few steps. The results obtained using the Fixstars Amplify Annealing Engine, a quantum-inspired annealing device, show that the problem relaxation can be computed with 20 % - 60 % of the qubits for the original problem and that relaxation can be applied to larger problems. Furthermore, it is found that more solutions that satisfy the constraints can be obtained with problem relaxation and that the number of fill-ins is reduced. These results confirm that the proposed problem relaxation is effective for QMF.

TI Negational symmetry of quantum neural networks for binary pattern
   classification
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
AB Although quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown promising results in solving simple machine learning tasks recently, the behavior of QNNs in binary pattern classification is still underexplored. In this work, we find that QNNs have an Achilles' heel in binary pattern classification. To illustrate this point, we provide a theoretical insight into the properties of QNNs by presenting and analyzing a new form of symmetry embedded in a family of QNNs with full entanglement, which we term negational sym-metry. Due to negational symmetry, QNNs can not differentiate between a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart. We empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary pattern clas-sification tasks using Google's quantum computing framework. Both theoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a fundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our findings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in practical quantum applications. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As research on quantum computers and quantum information transmission deepens, the multi-particle and multi-mode quantum information transmission has been attracting increasing attention. For scenarios where multi-parties transmit sequentially increasing qubits, we put forward a novel (N + 1)-party cyclic remote state preparation (RSP) protocol among an arbitrary number of players and a controller. Specifically, we employ a four-party scheme in the case of a cyclic asymmetric remote state preparation scheme and demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme on the IBM Quantum Experience platform. Furthermore, we present a general quantum channel expression under different circulation directions based on the n-party. In addition, considering the impact of the actual environment in the scheme, we discuss the feasibility of the scheme affected by different noises.

TI Variational quantum simulation of the critical Ising model with symmetry
   averaging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Here we investigate the use of deep multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) circuits as a variational ansatz. We use the exactly solvable one-dimensional critical transverse-field Ising model as a test bed. Numerically exact simulation of the quantum circuit ansatz can in this case be carried out to hundreds of qubits by exploiting efficient classical algorithms for simulating matchgate circuits. We find that, for this system, the DMERA strongly outperforms a standard quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)-style ansatz, and that a major source of systematic error in correlation functions approximated using the DMERA is the breaking of the translational and Kramers-Wannier symmetries of the transverse-field Ising model. We are able to reduce this error by up to four orders of magnitude by symmetry averaging, without incurring additional cost in qubits or circuit depth. We propose that this technique for mitigating systematic error could be applied to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) simulations of physical systems with other symmetries.

TI Universal adversarial perturbations for multiple classification tasks
   with quantum classifiers
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that studies the vulnerability of quantum learning systems against adversarial perturbations and develops possible defense strategies. Quantum universal adversarial perturbations are small perturbations, which can make different input samples into adversarial examples that may deceive a given quantum classifier. This is a field that was rarely looked into but worthwhile investigating because universal perturbations might simplify malicious attacks to a large extent, causing unexpected devastation to quantum machine learning models. In this paper, we take a step forward and explore the quantum universal perturbations in the context of heterogeneous classification tasks. In particular, we find that quantum classifiers that achieve almost state-of-the-art accuracy on two different classification tasks can be both conclusively deceived by one carefully-crafted universal perturbation. This result is explicitly demonstrated with well-designed quantum continual learning models with elastic weight consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting, as well as real-life heterogeneous datasets from hand-written digits and medical MRI images. Our results provide a simple and efficient way to generate universal perturbations on heterogeneous classification tasks and thus would provide valuable guidance for future quantum learning technologies.

TI Quantum amplitude damping for solving homogeneous linear differential
   equations: A noninterferometric algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In contexts where relevant problems can easily attain configuration spaces of enormous sizes, solving linear differential equations (LDEs) can become a hard achievement for classical computers; on the other hand, the rise of quantum hardware can conceptually enable such high-dimensional problems to be solved with a foreseeable number of qubits, while also yielding quantum advantage in terms of time complexity. Nevertheless, to bridge towards experimental realizations with several qubits and harvest such potential in a short-term basis, one must dispose of efficient quantum algorithms that are compatible with near-term projections of state-of-the-art hardware, in terms of both techniques and limitations. As the conception of such algorithms is no trivial task, insights on new heuristics are welcomed. This work proposes an approach by using the quantum amplitude damping operation as a resource to construct an efficient quantum algorithm for solving homogeneous LDEs. As the intended implementation involves performing amplitude damping exclusively via a simple equivalent quantum circuit, our algorithm shall be given by a gate-level quantum circuit (predominantly composed of elementary two-qubit gates) and is particularly nonrestrictive in terms of connectivity within and between some of its main quantum registers. We show that such an open quantum-system-inspired circuitry allows for constructing the real exponential terms in the solution in a noninterferometric way; we also provide a guideline for guaranteeing a lower bound on the probability of success for each realization, by exploring the decay properties of the underlying quantum operation.

TI Exact Evaluation of Hexagonal Spin-Networks for Topological Quantum
   Neural Networks
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB The physical scalar product between spin-networks has been shown to be a fundamental tool in the theory of topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs). These are a class of quantum neural networks supported on graphs and related to topological quantum field theory (TQFT), which have been previously introduced by the authors, recovering deep neural networks (DNNs) as their semiclassical limit. However, the effective evaluation of the scalar product remains an obstacle for the applicability of the theory. Inspired by decimation techniques for the computation of the partition function in statistical mechanics, an analytical technique is introduced for the exact evaluation of hexagonal spin-networks of arbitrary size, and describe the corresponding algorithm for the evaluation of the physical scalar product defined by Noui and Perez. The transition amplitudes on certain classes of spin-networks with both classical and quantum recoupling are investigated, obtaining a "continuous" spectrum of the transitions for the former and a discrete one for the latter. The theoretical and computational framework is expected to impact applications in string/tensor-networks for solid state physics, lattice gauge theories, and quantum gravity approaches.

TI QCPINN: quantum-classical physics-informed neural networks for solving
   PDEs
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws within neural architectures. However, these classical approaches often require a large number of parameters to achieve reasonable accuracy, particularly for complex PDEs. In this paper, we present a quantum-classical PINNs (QCPINNs) that combines quantum and classical components, allowing us to solve PDEs with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and convergence to classical PINNs. We systematically evaluated two quantum circuit architectures across various configurations on five benchmark PDEs to identify optimal QCPINN designs. Our results demonstrate that the QCPINN achieves stable convergence and comparable accuracy, while using only 10%-30% of the trainable parameters required by classical PINNs. This approach also results in a significant reduction in the relative L2 error for Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and Convection-diffusion equations, with reduction ranging from 4% to 64% across various fields. These findings demonstrate the potential of parameter efficiency and solution accuracy in physics-informed machine learning, allowing for a substantial decrease in model complexity without compromising solution quality.

TI Optical line broadening mechanisms in rare-earth doped oxide
   nanocrystals
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB Rare-earth ions in nanocrystals are promising solid-state platforms for quantum light-matter interfaces, combining millisecond-long nuclear spin ������2 with kHz-range optical homogeneous linewidths. Coupled to optical micro-cavities these materials can enable scalable quantum processors, nanoscale quantum memories and single photon sources. Here, we report on optical dephasing in Eu3+:Y2O3 nanocrystals of 100 nm diameter through photon echo and spectral hole burning techniques as a function of temperature and magnetic field. We identify two-level systems (TLS) and electric noise as major line broadening mechanisms below 2 K and demonstrate that material-processing strategies such as high-power oxygen plasma can partially counteract these effects. Through modeling we show that these results are compatible with a reduction in the number of oxygen vacancy pairs in the nanocrystals by the oxygen plasma processing. These pairs, even at very low concentrations (hundreds of ppb), appear detrimental to optical coherence due to their ability to generate fluctuating electric fields.

TI Anomalous heat transfer in nonequilibrium quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Anomalous heat transfer (AHT), a process by which heat spontaneously flows from a cold system into a hot one, superficially contradicts the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Here we provide a full classification of mechanisms of AHT in nonequilibrium quantum systems from a quantum-information perspective. For initial states in local equilibrium, we find that AHT can arise from three resources: initial correlation, intrasystem interaction, and intrasystem temperature inhomogeneity. In particular, for qubit systems, we prove that initial quantum coherence is necessary for AHT if the intersystem interactions are limited to the two-body type. We explicitly show AHT dominated by each of the mechanisms in a three-qubit system. Our classification scheme may offer a guideline for developing high-efficiency quantum autonomous thermal machines.

TI Introducing HeliEns: A Novel Hybrid Ensemble Learning Algorithm for
   Early Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori Infection
SO COMPUTERS
AB The Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. infection) infects the human stomach and is a major cause of gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. With over 50% of the global population affected, early and accurate diagnosis of H. infection infection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention of severe complications. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as endoscopy with biopsy, serology, urea breath tests, and stool antigen tests, are often invasive, costly, and can lack precision. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and quantum machine learning (QML) offer promising non-invasive alternatives capable of analyzing complex datasets to identify patterns not easily discernible by human analysis. This research aims to develop and evaluate HeliEns, a novel quantum hybrid ensemble learning algorithm designed for the early and accurate diagnosis of H. infection infection. HeliEns combines the strengths of multiple quantum machine learning models, specifically Quantum K-Nearest Neighbors (QKNN), Quantum Naive Bayes (QNB), and Quantum Logistic Regression (QLR), to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability. The development of HeliEns involved rigorous data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, encoding of categorical variables, and feature scaling, to ensure the dataset's suitability for quantum machine learning algorithms. Individual models (QKNN, QNB, and QLR) were trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ensemble model was then constructed by integrating these quantum models using a hybrid approach that leverages their diverse strengths. The HeliEns model demonstrated superior performance compared to individual models, achieving an accuracy of 94%, precision of 97%, recall of 92%, and an F1-score of 94% in detecting H. infection infection. The quantum ensemble approach effectively mitigated the limitations of individual models, providing a robust and reliable diagnostic tool. HeliEns significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and reliability for early H. infection detection. The integration of multiple quantum ML algorithms within the HeliEns framework enhanced overall model performance. The non-invasive nature of the HeliEns model offers a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to traditional diagnostic methods. This research underscores the transformative potential of quantum machine learning in healthcare, particularly in enhancing diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes. HeliEns represents a significant advancement in the early diagnosis of H. infection infection, leveraging quantum machine learning to provide a non-invasive, accurate, and reliable diagnostic tool. This research highlights the importance of QML-driven solutions in healthcare and sets the stage for future research to further refine and validate the HeliEns model in real-world clinical settings.

TI Quantum process inference for a single-qubit Maxwell demon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB While quantum measurement theories are built around density matrices and observables, the laws of thermodynamics are based on processes such as the ones used in heat engines and refrigerators. The study of quantum thermodynamics fuses these two distinct paradigms. In this article, we highlight the usage of quantum process matrices as a unified language for describing thermodynamic processes in the quantum regime. We experimentally demonstrate this in the context of a quantum Maxwell demon, where two major quantities are commonly investigated: the average work extraction < W > and the efficacy gamma, which measures how efficiently the feedback operation uses the obtained information. Using the tool of quantum process matrices, we develop optimal feedback protocols for these two quantities and experimentally investigate them in a superconducting circuit QED setup.

TI Integrated thermo-optic phase shifters for laser-written photonic
   circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonics offers compact and stable manipulation of optical signals in miniaturized chips, with the possibility of changing dynamically their functionality by means of integrated phase shifters. Cryogenic operation of these devices is becoming essential for advancing photonic quantum technologies, accommodating components like quantum light sources, single photon detectors and quantum memories operating at liquid helium temperatures. In this work, we report on a programmable glass photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabricated through femtosecond laser waveguide writing (FLW) and controlled by thermo-optic phase shifters both in a room-temperature and in a cryogenic setting. By taking advantage of a femtosecond laser microstructuring process, we achieved reliable PIC operation with minimal power consumption and confined temperature gradients in both conditions. This advancement marks the first cryogenically-compatible programmable FLW PIC, paving the way for fully integrated quantum architectures realized on a laser-written photonic chip.

TI Quantum Hamiltonian algorithms for maximum independent sets
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on the emergent non-Abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; the other based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent in the sense that one is the other's interaction picture. Despite their mathematical equivalence, our numerical simulations show significant differences between them in performance, which is explained analytically. Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, can be viewed as quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets governed by the non-Abelian gauge matrix.
   An adiabatic quantum algorithm is shown capable of significantly outperforming earlier heuristic approach for solving the maximum independent set problem using 2D Rydberg atom array.

TI Quantum adaptive search: a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for global
   optimization of multivariate functions
SO FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
AB Introduction We present Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for global optimization of multivariate functions. The method employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function.Methods A quantum state encodes information about solution quality through a complex-amplitude mapping, enabling identification of promising regions and progressive tightening of the search bounds; a classical optimizer then performs local refinement. The analysis shows contraction of the search space toward global optima with controlled computational complexity.Results In simulation on standard benchmarks (Rastrigin, Styblinski-Tang, Rosenbrock), QAGS attains solutions at or near the true minima with very small absolute errors. Against an Adaptive Grid Search on the Sphere function, QAGS achieves comparable accuracy and shows increasing efficiency with dimensionality.Discussion These results indicate that amplitude-encoded region selection combined with classical refinement effectively contracts the search space and can reduce time and space requirements, especially at higher dimensions, while practical hardware implementations of amplitude encoding remain challenging.

AB Chiplet architecture is an emerging architecture for quantum computing that could significantly increase qubit resources with its great scalability and modularity. However, as the computing scale increases, communication between qubits would become a more severe bottleneck due to the long routing distances. In this paper, we propose a multi-entry communication highway (MECH) mechanism to trade ancillary qubits for program concurrency, and build a compilation framework to efficiently manage and utilize the highway resources. Our evaluation shows that this framework significantly outperforms the baseline approach in both the circuit depth and the number of operations on typical quantum benchmarks. This implies a more efficient and less errorprone compilation of quantum programs.

TI Unified architecture for quantum lookup tables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum access to arbitrary classical data encoded in unitary black-box oracles underlies interesting dataintensive quantum algorithms, such as machine learning or electronic structure simulation. The feasibility of these applications depends crucially on gate-efficient implementations of these oracles, which are commonly some reversible versions of the boolean circuit for a classical lookup table. We present a general parametrized architecture for quantum circuits implementing a lookup table that encompasses all prior work in realizing a continuum of optimal trade-offs between qubits, non-Clifford gates, and error resilience, up to logarithmic factors. Our architecture assumes only local 2D connectivity, yet recovers results, with the appropriate parameters, polylogarithmic error scaling. We also identify regimes, such as simultaneous sublinear scaling, in all parameters. These results enable tailoring implementations of the commonly used lookup table primitive to any given quantum device with constrained resources.

The novelty of the present work, which is motivated by a recently developed quantumlike model of color perception, consists of stressing the link between the algebraic structures appearing in this model and a certain subalgebra of the split-quaternions. We show the potential of this approach for color image processing applications by proposing a CAT implemented via an appropriate use of the split-quaternion multiplication. Moreover, quantitative comparisons with the widely used state-of-the art von Kries CAT are provided.

TI Extracting Unknown Parameters of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells
   Using Quantum Encoded Pathfinder Algorithm

AB Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is one of the most widely used fuel cell types. Accurate modeling of PEMFC can better facilitate the research of PEMFC and guide designers to design FC products that meet people's needs. The modeling problem of PEMFC can be transformed into a parametric optimization problem. In order to improve the exploration capability of the pathfinder algorithm, the concept of quantum computing is introduced and a new quantum coded pathfinder optimization algorithm (QPFA) is proposed. QPFA was applied to the extraction of parameters of NedStackPS6, BCS500W and 250W FC, and these models of PEMFC have been applied for commercial use. The experimental results were compared with seven recently proposed metaheuristics and recently published literature, showing the accuracy and high precision of QPFA in extracting PEMFC parameters.

TI Two-Stage, Low Noise Quantum Frequency Conversion of Single Photons from
   Silicon-Vacancy Centers in Diamond to the Telecom C-Band
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The silicon-vacancy center in diamond holds great promise as a qubit for quantum communication networks. However, since the optical transitions are located within the visible red spectral region, quantum frequency conversion to low-loss telecommunication wavelengths becomes a necessity for its use in long-range, fiber-linked networks. This work presents a highly efficient, low-noise quantum frequency conversion device for photons emitted by a silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond to the telecom C-band. By using a two-stage difference-frequency mixing scheme, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) noise is circumvented and Raman noise is minimized, resulting in a very low noise rate of 10.4 +/- 0.7 photons per second as well as an overall device efficiency of 35.6%. By converting single photons from SiV centers, it demonstrates the preservation of photon statistics upon conversion.

TI Achieving Fault Tolerance on Capped Color Codes with Few Ancillas
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Attaining fault tolerance while maintaining low overhead is one of the main challenges in a practical implementation of quantum circuits. One major technique that can overcome this problem is the flag technique, in which high-weight errors arising from a few faults can be detected by a few ancillas and distinguished using subsequent syndrome measurements. The technique can be further improved using the fact that, for some families of codes, errors of any weight are logically equivalent if they have the same syndrome and weight parity, as shown in our previous work [Tansuwannont and Leung, Phys. Rev. A 104, 042410 (2021)]. In this work, we develop a notion of distinguishable fault set that captures both concepts of flags and weight parities, and extend the use of weight parities in error correction to families of capped and recursive capped color codes. We also develop fault-tolerant protocols for error correction, measurement, state preparation, and logical T-gate implementation via code switching, which are sufficient for performing fault-tolerant Clifford computation on a capped color code, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation on a recursive capped color code. Our protocols for a capped or a recursive capped color code of any distance require only two ancillas, assuming that the ancillas can be reused. The concept of distinguishable fault set also leads to a generalization of the definitions of fault-tolerant gadgets proposed by Aliferis, Gottesman, and Preskill.

TI Check-probe spectroscopy of lifetime-limited emitters in bulk-grown
   silicon carbide
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Solid-state single-photon emitters provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum technologies such as optically connected quantum networks. A key challenge is to ensure the optical coherence and spectral stability of the emitters. Here, we introduce a high-bandwidth 'check-probe' scheme to quantitatively measure (laser-induced) spectral diffusion and ionisation rates, as well as homogeneous linewidths. We demonstrate these methods on single V2 centres in commercially available bulk-grown 4H-silicon carbide. Despite observing significant spectral diffusion under laser illumination (greater than or similar to GHz s(-1)), the optical transitions are narrow (similar to 35 MHz), and remain stable in the dark (greater than or similar to 1 s). Through Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferometry, we determine the optical coherence to be near-lifetime limited (T-2 = 16.4(4) ns), hinting at the potential for using bulk-grown materials for developing quantum technologies. These results advance our understanding of spectral diffusion of quantum emitters in semiconductor materials, and may have applications for studying charge dynamics across other platforms.

TI Quantum Simulation of Open Quantum Systems Using a Unitary Decomposition
   of Operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Electron transport in realistic physical and chemical systems often involves the nontrivial exchange of energy with a large environment, requiring the definition and treatment of open quantum systems. Because the time evolution of an open quantum system employs a nonunitary operator, the simulation of open quantum systems presents a challenge for universal quantum computers constructed from only unitary operators or gates. Here, we present a general algorithm for implementing the action of any nonunitary operator on an arbitrary state on a quantum device. We show that any quantum operator can be exactly decomposed as a linear combination of at most four unitary operators. We demonstrate this method on a two-level system in both zero and finite temperature amplitude damping channels. The results are in agreement with classical calculations, showing promise in simulating nonunitary operations on intermediate-term and future quantum devices.

TI Werner states from diagrams
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We present two results on multiqubit Werner states, defined to be those states that are invariant under the collective action of any given single-qubit unitary that acts simultaneously on all the qubits. Motivated by the desire to characterize entanglement properties of Werner states, we construct a basis for the real linear vector space of Werner invariant Hermitian operators on the Hilbert space of pure states; it follows that any mixed Werner state can be written as a mixture of these basis operators with unique coefficients. Continuing a study of 'polygon diagram' Werner states constructed in earlier work, with a goal to connect diagrams to entanglement properties, we consider a family of multiqubit states that generalize the singlet, and show that their 2-qubit reduced density matrices are separable.

TI Fast quantum circuit cutting with randomized measurements
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose a method to extend the size of a quantum computation beyond the number of physical qubits available on a single device. This is accomplished by randomly inserting measure-and-prepare channels to express the output state of a large circuit as a separable state across distinct devices. Our method employs randomized measurements, resulting in a sample overhead that is Oe(4k/s2), where s is the accuracy of the computation and k the number of parallel wires that are ???cut" to obtain smaller sub-circuits. We also show an information-theoretic lower bound of Q(2k/s2) for any comparable pro-cedure. We use our techniques to show that circuits in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with p entangling layers can be simulated by cir-cuits on a fraction of the original number of qubits with an overhead that is roughly 2O(ptc), where k is the size of a known balanced vertex separator of the graph which encodes the optimization problem. We obtain numerical evidence of practical speedups using our method applied to the QAOA, compared to prior work. Finally, we investigate the practical feasibility of applying the circuit cutting procedure to large-scale QAOA problems on clustered graphs by using a 30-qubit simulator to evaluate the variational energy of a 129- qubit problem as well as carry out a 62- qubit optimization.

TI An optimized hybrid encryption framework for smart home healthcare:
   Ensuring data confidentiality and security
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB This study proposes an optimized hybrid encryption framework combining ECC-256r1 with AES128 in EAX mode, tailored for smart home healthcare environments, and conducts a comprehensive investigation to validate its performance. Our framework addresses current limitations in securing sensitive health data and demonstrates resilience against emerging quantum computing threats. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, we show that the proposed configuration outperforms existing solutions by delivering unmatched security, processing speed, and energy efficiency. It employs a robust yet streamlined approach, meticulously designed to ensure simplicity and practicality, facilitating seamless integration into existing systems without imposing undue complexity. Our investigation affirms the framework's capability to resist common cybersecurity threats like MITM, replay, and Sybil attacks while proactively considering quantum resilience. The proposed method excels in processing speed (0.006 seconds for client and server) and energy efficiency (3.65W client, 95.4W server), offering a quantum-resistant security level comparable to AES-128. This represents a security-efficiency ratio of 21.33 bits per millisecond, a 25.6% improvement in client-side processing speed, and up to 44% reduction in server-side energy consumption compared to conventional RSA-2048 methods. These improvements enable real-time encryption of continuous health data streams in IoT environments, making it ideal for IoT devices where AES-128 ' s smaller footprint is advantageous. By prioritizing high-grade encryption alongside ease of use and implementation, the proposed framework presents a future-proof solution that anticipates the trajectory of cryptographic standards amid advancing quantum computing technologies, signifying a pivotal advancement in safeguarding IoT-driven healthcare data.

TI Microscopic Study on Superexchange Dynamics of Composite Spin-1 Bosons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report on an experimental simulation of the spin-1 Heisenberg model with composite bosons in a one-dimensional chain based on the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Exploiting our site- and spin- resolved quantum gas microscope, we observed faster superexchange dynamics of the spin-1 system compared to its spin-1=2 = 2 counterpart, which is attributed to the enhancement effect of multi-bosons. We further probed the nonequilibrium spin dynamics driven by the superexchange and single-ion anisotropy terms, unveiling the linear expansion of the spin-spin correlations, which is limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. Based on the superexchange process, we prepared and verified the entangled qutrits pairs with these composite spin-1 bosons, potentially being applied in qutrit-based quantum information processing.

TI Indistinguishable sub-nanosecond pulse generator
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB The indistinguishable laser pulse is predominant in the realization of qubits in decoy state -based quantum cryptography. Such cryptography in an automotive framework needs to be compact and inexpensive. However, their implementation is cumbrous and uneconomical. Significant effort has been put into reducing the form factor of quantum cryptography implementation. We report a compact, low-cost, indistinguishable, sub -nanosecond pulse generator with adjusted delay and amplitude using a Fabry-Perot laser diode. The approach was derived based on algebraic topology formulation of the electrical network, and the implementation involves timedependent perturbation of a constant current node to generate tunable, sub -nanosecond excitation with a constant pre -bias. The simulation model of the laser diode accounted for effects of spontaneous emission and relaxation oscillation. The shortest excitation pulse thus generated was measured to have FWHM of 496 ps. Further, the indistinguishability of two laser pulses is statistically evaluated.

TI Adiabatic based Algorithm for SAT: A comprehensive algorithmic
   description
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB This paper concerns quantum heuristics that are able to extend the domain of quantum computing defining a promising way in the large number of well-known classical algorithms. Quantum approximate heuristics take advantage of alternation between one Hamiltonian defining the problem to solve and one mixing Hamiltonian. The adiabatic theorem initially defines in quantum physic allow to compute a solution for the Schrodinger equation, but the foundation of this methods requires strong skill in physics and mathematics. Our main objectives in this paper are at first to provide an algorithm-based presentation (as close as possible of the classical computer science community in operational research practice) of the adiabatic optimization and secondly to give a comprehensive resolution of the well-known SAT problem. This presentation gives opportunities to provide a concise but explicit analysis of the adiabatic capability to define a new efficient operational research trend. Our experiments encompass numerical evaluations on both simulator and on real quantum computer provided by IBM. Numerical evaluations using the QLM library meet the Qiskit evaluations. This contribution is at the crossroad of physic and computer science in the sense it proves the capabilities of quantum concepts to define a new and promising research trends in optimization.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Compare the pair: Rotated versus unrotated surface codes at equal
   logical error rates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Practical quantum computers will require resource-efficient error-correcting codes. The rotated surface code uses approximately half the number of qubits as the unrotated surface code to create a logical qubit with the same error-correcting distance. However, instead of distance, a more useful qubit-saving metric would be based on logical error rates. In this work we find the well-below-threshold scaling of logical to physical error rates under circuit-level noise for both codes at high odd and even distances and then compare the number of qubits used by each code to achieve equal logical error rates. We perform Monte Carlo sampling of memory experiment circuits with all valid CNOT orders using the stabilizer simulator Stim and the uncorrelated minimum-weight perfect matching decoder PyMatching 2. We find that the rotated code uses about 74% the number of qubits used by the unrotated code to achieve a logical error rate of pL = 10-12 at the operational physical error rate of p = 10-3. The ratio remains approximate to 75% for p values within a factor of two of p = 10-3 for all useful pL. Our work finds the low-pL scaling of the surface code and clarifies the qubit savings provided by the rotated surface code, providing numerical justification for its use in future implementations of the surface code.

TI A Novel Quantum Neural Network Approach to Combating Fake Reviews
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORKED AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB As e-commerce has grown gradually online item assessments have emerged as a key source of consumer data. That stated, there are problems with the consistency and fictitiousness of the evaluations because there are numerous fake or fraudulent ones. These misleading assessments are generated during the investigation in an attempt to mislead customers about the nature of a real advantage, compromising their ability to make a predetermined decision and damaging the reputations of businesses. A cutting-edge interrogation department revealed that quantum machine learning (QML) could manage a huge amount of machine-trained data and could convey almost emotional choices in the context of inaccurate checks. It is truly beneficial in obtaining reviews for things that are incorrect. Opinion, generating trends, interpersonal relationships, and assessing fatigue is merely a few of the attributes. Tests conducted utilizing the Amazon fraudulent review. The dataset demonstrates that QML tactics outperform conventional knowledge acquisition procedures in errands, including the place of fraudulent reviews. The delicacy and tolerance of incorrect review distinguishing evidence can be significantly advanced, although QML is still in its early stages of development. Both our proposed model and model pass rigorous conventional machine learning algorithms testing with a remarkable level of accuracy. An article introduces a unique approach to fraudulent review detection and brings in the QNN algorithm as a solution. A deep learning model, such as this one, has an 86% accuracy rate in quantum computer implementation, which is an impressive level of innovation, especially if it comes with successful results. Involvement in these cutting-edge technologies promises significant benefits in battling the problem of false identities on the Web. In our case, the experimental results demonstrate that our QNN algorithm, which can accurately identify fake reviews, will become a key weapon for suppressing various forms of fraudulence on emerging digital technology platforms.

TI Efficient and all-carbon electrical readout of a NV-based quantum sensor
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The spin readout of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can be realized by a photoconductive detection that is a complementary method to the optical detection of the NV electron spin magnetic resonance. Here, we implement the photoconductive detection through graphitic planar electrodes that collect the photocurrent. Graphitic electrodes are patterned using a xenon focused-ion beam on an optical-grade quality diamond crystal containing a nitrogen concentration of similar to 1 ppm and a NV concentration of a few parts per billion. Resistance and current-voltage characteristics of the NV-doped diamond junction are investigated tuning the 532 nm pump beam intensity. The junction has an ohmic behavior and, under a strong bias field, we observe velocity saturation of the optically induced carriers in the diamond junction. We perform the photoconductive detection in the continuous-wave regime of the magnetic resonance of the NV centers ensemble for a magnetic field applied along the < 100 > and the < 111 > directions with a magnitude above 100 mT. This technique enables the realization of all-carbon diamond quantum sensors integrating graphitic microstructures for the electrical readout. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as EC\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$E_C$$\end{document}, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of quantum energy teleportation, allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of EC\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$E_C$$\end{document}. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through local operations and classical communication. Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step toward revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.

TI Electron spin coherence on a solid neon surface
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A single electron floating on the surface of a condensed noble-gas liquid or solid can act as a spin qubit with ultralong coherence time, thanks to the extraordinary purity of such systems. Previous studies suggest that the electron spin coherence time on a superfluid helium (He) surface can exceed 100 s. In this paper, we present theoretical studies of the electron spin coherence on a solid neon (Ne) surface, motivated by our recent experimental realization of single-electron charge qubit on solid Ne. The major spin decoherence mechanisms investigated include the fluctuating Ne diamagnetic susceptibility due to thermal phonons, the fluctuating thermal current in normal metal electrodes, and the quasi-statically fluctuating nuclear spins of the Ne-21 ensemble. We find that at a typical experimental temperature about 10 mK in a fully superconducting device, the electron spin decoherence is dominated by the third mechanism via electron-nuclear spin-spin interaction. For natural Ne with 2700 ppm abundance of Ne-21, the estimated inhomogeneous dephasing time T-2* is around 0.16 ms, already better than most semiconductor quantum-dot spin qubits. For commercially available, isotopically purified Ne with 1 ppm of Ne-21, T-2* can be 0.43 s. Under the application of Hahn echoes, the coherence time T-2 can be improved to 30 ms for natural Ne and 81 s for purified Ne. Therefore, the single-electron spin qubits on solid Ne can serve as promising new spin qubits.

TI Engineering fast high-fidelity quantum operations with constrained

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Understanding how to tailor quantum dynamics to achieve the desired evolution is a crucial problem in almost all quantum technologies. Oftentimes an otherwise ideal quantum dynamics is corrupted by unavoidable interactions, and finding ways to mitigate the unwanted effects of such interactions on the dynamics is a very active field of research. Here, we present a very general method for designing high-efficiency control sequences that are fully compatible with experimental constraints on available interactions and their tunability. Our approach relies on the Magnus expansion to find order by order the necessary corrections that result in a high-fidelity operation. In the end finding, the control fields are reduced to solve a set of linear equations. We illustrate our method by applying it to a number of physically relevant problems: the strong-driving limit of a two-level system, fast squeezing in a parametrically driven cavity, the leakage problem in transmon qubit gates, and the acceleration of SNAP gates in a qubit-cavity system.

TI Implementing Nitrogen Vacancy Center Quantum Sensor Technology for
   Magnetic Flux Leakage Testing
SO SENSORS
AB Ensuring the structural integrity of prestressed (PS) concrete is essential for the safety and longevity of infrastructure. Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) testing is a widely used non-destructive testing (NDT) method for detecting fractures in prestressing steel. This study explores the application of quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in artificial diamonds for MFL testing and presents a novel method for processing continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) data into vectorized magnetic field measurements. These sensors offer high sensitivity, low hysteresis, and multi-directional magnetic field detection, making them a promising alternative for advanced NDT applications. A data processing framework was developed to transform CW-ODMR measurements into vectorized magnetic flux density values in the x, y, and z directions. This process enables the conversion of crystallographic sensor orientations into calibrated field directions, ensuring precise magnetic field reconstruction. The method was validated through 121 fracture measurements and 19 open-bar-end measurements, demonstrating its effectiveness in extracting high-resolution vectorized magnetic field data. A subsequent statistical evaluation quantified the influence of sensor displacement, magnetization direction, magnetization distance, and measurement distance. These findings establish a foundation for integrating quantum sensors into MFL-based NDT, with potential applications extending beyond building inspections to a wide range of advanced sensing technologies in scientific and industrial fields.

TI Topological phases driven by orbital entanglement in Transition Metal
   Oxide Perovskite interfaces
SO COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE
AB The deceptively simple crystallographic structure of early transition metal oxide perovskites belies the complexity and variety of electronic, magnetic and structural phases that they display. Structural defects, rotations, tilts, deformations of the oxygen-transition metal element octahedra help explain many of these phenomena. Another key player is the orbital degree of freedom of the d-ion. It may lead to a quantum entanglement of the materials electronic wavefunctions which promotes topological states in low dimensional geometries. In this report we present a study of select topological properties at surfaces or heterostructure interfaces of a subset of these perovskites when the orientation of the structure is along the (001) or (111) direction. In contrast to the extensively studied classes of topological insulators, topology in these systems is a characteristic property of the conducting regime, thus endowing the compounds with potential spintronic and quantum computing functionalities. We conclude this communication with a personal tribute to Gerard Toulouse (in French).

TI Strong spin-orbit interaction and g-factor renormalization of
   hole spins in Ge/Si nanowire quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The spin-orbit interaction lies at the heart of quantum computation with spin qubits, research on topologically nontrivial states, and various applications in spintronics. Hole spins in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires experience a spin-orbit interaction that has been predicted to be both strong and electrically tunable, making them a particularly promising platform for research in these fields. We experimentally determine the strength of spin-orbit interaction of hole spins confined to a double quantum dot in a Ge/Si nanowire by measuring spin-mixing transitions inside a regime of spin-blockaded transport. We find a remarkably short spin-orbit length of similar to 65 nm, comparable to the quantum dot length and the interdot distance. We additionally observe a large orbital effect of the applied magnetic field on the hole states, resulting in a large magnetic field dependence of the spin-mixing transition energies. Strikingly, together with these orbital effects, the strong spin-orbit interaction causes a significant enhancement of the g factor with magnetic field. The large spin-orbit interaction strength demonstrated is consistent with the predicted direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction in this material system and is expected to enable ultrafast Rabi oscillations of spin qubits and efficient qubit-qubit interactions, as well as provide a platform suitable for studying Majorana zero modes.

TI Projective Measurement-Based Quantum Phase Difference Estimation
   Algorithm for the Direct Computation of Eigenenergy Differences on a
   Quantum Computer
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum computers are capable of calculating the energy difference of two electronic states using the quantum phase difference estimation (QPDE) algorithm. The Bayesian inference-based implementations for the QPDE have been reported so far, but in this approach, the quality of the calculated energy difference depends on the input wave functions being used. Here, we report the inverse quantum Fourier transformation-based QPDE with N a of ancillary qubits, which allows us to compute the difference of eigenenergies based on the single-shot projective measurement. As proof-of-concept demonstrations, we report numerical experiments for the singlet-triplet energy difference of the hydrogen molecule and the vertical excitation energies of halogen-substituted methylenes (CHF, CHCl, CF2, CFCl, and CCl2) and formaldehyde (HCHO).

TI Quantum generative classification with mixed states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Classification can be performed using either a discriminative or a generative learning approach. Discriminative learning consists of constructing the conditional probability of the outputs given the inputs, while generative learning consists of constructing the joint probability density of the inputs and outputs. Although most classical and quantum methods are discriminative, there are some advantages of the generative learning approach. For instance, it can be applied to unsupervised learning, statistical inference, uncertainty estimation, and synthetic data generation. In this article, we present a quantum generative multiclass classification strategy, called quantum generative classification (QGC). This model uses a variational quantum algorithm to estimate the joint probability density function of features and labels of a data set by means of a mixed quantum state. We also introduce a quantum map called quantum-enhanced Fourier features, which leverages quantum superposition to prepare high-dimensional data samples in quantum hardware using a small number of qubits. We show that the QGC algorithm can be viewed as a Gaussian mixture that reproduces a kernel Hilbert space of the training data. In addition, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network that shows that it is possible to perform generative classification on high-dimensional data sets. The method was tested on various low- and high-dimensional data sets including the 10-class MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data sets, illustrating that the generative classification strategy is competitive against other previous quantum models.

TI Persistent Non-Gaussian Correlations in Out-of-Equilibrium Rydberg Atom
   Arrays
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Gaussian correlations emerge in a large class of many-body quantum systems quenched out of equilibrium, as demonstrated in recent experiments on coupled one-dimensional superfluids [Schweigler et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 559 (2021)]. Here we present a mechanism by which an initial state of a Rydberg atom array can retain persistent non-Gaussian correlations following a global quench. This mechanism is based on an effective kinetic blockade rooted in the ground state symmetry of the system, which prevents thermalizing dynamics under the quench Hamiltonian. We propose how to observe this effect with Rydberg atom experiments and we demonstrate its resilience regarding several types of experimental error. These long-lived non-Gaussian states may have practical applications as quantum memories or stable resources for quantum information protocols due to the protected non-Gaussianity away from equilibrium.

TI Measurement-based quantum heat engine in a multilevel system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We compare quantum Otto engines based on two different cycle models: a two-bath model, with a standard heat source and sink, and a measurement-based protocol, where the role of heat source is played by a quantum measurement. We furthermore study these cycles using two different "working substances": a single qutrit (spin1 particle) or a pair of qubits (spin-1/2 particles) interacting via the XXZ Heisenberg interaction. Although both cycle models have the same efficiency when applied on a single-qubit working substance, we find that both can reach higher efficiencies using these more complex working substances by exploiting the existence of "idle" levels, i.e., levels that do not shift while the spins are subjected to a variable magnetic field. Furthermore, with an appropriate choice of measurement, the measurement-based protocol becomes more efficient than the two-bath model.

TI On Entanglement Assisted Classical Optical Communications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Entanglement assisted communication is advocated by numerous authors as an alternative to classical communication offering significant improvement in channel capacity, in particular in noisy regime. In all those papers it is always assumed that entanglement can be distributed without any imperfections, except for attenuation. We demonstrate that under imperfect pre-shared entanglement distribution, assuming that entanglement distribution channel is modeled as a noisy and lossy Bosonic channel, the entanglement assisted communication can be inferior compared to the classical communication, depending on the parameters of the distribution channel. We identify the conditions under which entanglement assistance can still provide an advantage over the classical case. In particular, when both communication and entanglement distribution channels are not used for entanglement assisted communication but rather for classical transmission instead then the classical capacity is always higher than the entanglement assisted capacity. We also study the entanglement assisted communication under the strong atmospheric turbulence effects.

TI Towards determining the presence of barren plateaus in some chemically
   inspired variational quantum algorithms
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In quantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for molecular simulations on near-term quantum computers. However, VQEs using hardware-efficient circuits face scaling challenges due to the barren plateau problem. This raises the question of whether chemically inspired circuits from unitary coupled cluster (UCC) methods can avoid this issue. Here we provide theoretical evidence indicating they may not. By examining alternated dUCC ans & auml;tzes and relaxed Trotterized UCC ans & auml;tzes, we find that in the infinite depth limit, a separation occurs between particle-hole one- and two-body unitary operators. While one-body terms yield a polynomially concentrated energy landscape, adding two-body terms leads to exponential concentration. Numerical simulations support these findings, suggesting that popular 1-step Trotterized unitary coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ans & auml;tze may not scale. Our results emphasize the link between trainability and circuit expressiveness, raising doubts about VQEs' ability to surpass classical methods.

TI Towards a scalable discrete quantum generative adversarial neural
   network
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been studied in the context of quantum machine learning for several years, but there has not been yet a proposal for a fully QGAN with both, a quantum generator and discriminator. We introduce a fully QGAN intended for use with binary data. The architecture incorporates several features found in other classical and quantum machine learning models, which up to this point had not been used in conjunction. In particular, we incorporate classical noise reuploading in the generator, auxiliary qubits in the discriminator to enhance expressivity, and a direct connection between the generator and discriminator circuits, obviating the need to access the generator's probability distribution. We show that, as separate components, the generator and discriminator perform as desired. We empirically demonstrate the expressive power of our model on both synthetic data as well as low energy states of an Ising model. Our demonstrations suggest that the model is not only capable of reproducing discrete training data, but also of potentially generalizing from it.

TI Fault-Tolerant Logical Gates in Holographic Stabilizer Codes Are
   Severely Restricted
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We evaluate the usefulness of holographic stabilizer codes for fault-tolerant quantum computing by studying their allowed sets of fault-tolerantly implementable gates. We treat them as subsystem codes and show that the set of transversally implementable logical operations is contained in the Clifford group for sufficiently localized logical subsystems. As well as proving this concretely for several specific codes, we argue that this restriction naturally arises in any stabilizer subsystem code that comes close to capturing certain properties of holography. We extend these results to approximate encodings, locality-preserving gates, and certain codes whose logical algebras have nontrivial centers, and discuss cases where restrictions can be made to other levels of the Clifford hierarchy. A few auxiliary results may also be of interest, including a general definition of an entanglement wedge map for any subsystem code, and a thorough classification of different correctability properties for regions in a subsystem code.

TI Four-intensity measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
   protocol with modified coherent state sources
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme of double-scanning 4-intensity MDI-QKD protocol with the modified coherent state (MCS) sources. The MCS sources can be characterized by two positive parameters, xi and c. In all prior works, c was set to be the same for all sources. We show that the source parameter c can be different for the sources in the X basis and those in the Z basis. Numerical results show that removing such a constraint can greatly improve the key rates of the protocol with MCS sources. In the typical experiment conditions, comparing with the key rates of WCS sources, the key rates of MCS sources can be improved by several orders of magnitude, and the secure distance is improved by about 40 km. Our results show that MCS sources have the potential to improve the practicality of the MDI-QKD protocol.

TI Resource-efficient adaptive Bayesian tracking of magnetic fields with a
   quantum sensor
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Single-spin quantum sensors, for example based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, provide nanoscale mapping of magnetic fields. In applications where the magnetic field may be changing rapidly, total sensing time is crucial and must be minimised. Bayesian estimation and adaptive experiment optimisation can speed up the sensing process by reducing the number of measurements required. These protocols consist of computing and updating the probability distribution of the magnetic field based on measurement outcomes and of determining optimized acquisition settings for the next measurement. However, the computational steps feeding into the measurement settings of the next iteration must be performed quickly enough to allow real-time updates. This article addresses the issue of computational speed by implementing an approximate Bayesian estimation technique, where probability distributions are approximated by a finite sum of Gaussian functions. Given that only three parameters are required to fully describe a Gaussian density, we find that in many cases, the magnetic field probability distribution can be described by fewer than ten parameters, achieving a reduction in computation time by factor 10 compared to existing approaches. For T-2* = 1 mu s, only a small decrease in computation time is achieved. However, in these regimes, the proposed Gaussian protocol outperforms the existing one in tracking accuracy.

TI Classical Artificial Neural Network Training Using Quantum Walks as a
   Search Procedure
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB This article proposes a computational procedure that applies a quantum algorithm to train classical artificial neural networks. The goal of the procedure is to apply quantum walk as a search algorithm in a complete graph to find all synaptic weights of a classical artificial neural network. Each vertex of this complete graph represents a possible synaptic weight set in the w-dimensional search space, where w is the number of weights of the neural network. To know the number of iterations required a priorito obtain the solutions is one of the main advantages of the procedure. Another advantage is that the proposed method does not stagnate in local minimums. Thus, it is possible to use the quantum walk search procedure as an alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The proposed method was employed fora XOR problem to prove the proposed concept. To solve this problem, the proposed method trained a classical artificial neural network with nine weights. However, the procedure can find solutions for any number of dimensions. The results achieved demonstrate the viability of the proposal, contributing to machine learning and quantum computing researches.

TI Universal quantum frequency comb measurements by spectral mode-matching
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB The frequency comb of a multimode interferometer offers exceptional scalability potential for field-encoded quantum information. However, the staple field detection method, homodyne detection, cannot access quantum information in the whole comb because some spectral quadratures [and their asymmetries with respect to the local oscillator (LO)] are out of reach. We present here the first general approach to making optimal measurements of a multimode quantum optical source-something that is required for photonic quantum computing and is not possible when using homodyne detection with a pulse-shaped LO. This approach uses universal spectral mode-matching, which can be understood as interferometry with a memory effect. We derive a complete formalism and propose an implementation by microcavity arrays. Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

TI Generalized Quantum Signal Processing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) currently stand as the most efficient techniques for implementing functions of block-encoded matrices, a central task that lies at the heart of most prominent quantum algorithms. However, current QSP approaches face several challenges, such as the restrictions imposed on the family of achievable polynomials and the difficulty of calculating the required phase angles for specific transformations. In this paper, we present a generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP) approach, employing general SU(2) rotations as our signal-processing operators, rather than relying solely on rotations in a single basis. Our approach lifts all practical restrictions on the family of achievable transformations, with the sole remaining condition being that |P| <= 1, a restriction necessary due to the unitary nature of quantum computation. Furthermore, GQSP provides a straightforward recursive formula for determining the rotation angles needed to construct the polynomials in cases where P and Q are known. In cases where only P is known, we provide an efficient optimization algorithm capable of identifying in under a minute of GPU time, a corresponding Q for polynomials of degree on the order of 10(7). We further illustrate GQSP simplifies QSP-based strategies for Hamiltonian simulation, offer an optimal solution to the epsilon-approximate fractional query problem that requires O((1/delta) + log(1/epsilon)) queries to perform where O(1/delta) is a proved lower bound, and introduces novel approaches for implementing bosonic operators. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for the implementation of normal matrices, demonstrating its applicability through synthesis of diagonal matrices, as well as the development of a new algorithm for convolution through synthesis of circulant matrices using only O(d log N + log(2) N) 1 and 2-qubit gates for a filter of lengths d.

TI Tomographic entanglement indicators in frequency combs and Talbot

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Recent theoretical investigations on tomographic entanglement indicators have showcased the advantages of the tomographic approach in the context of continuous-variable (CV), spin and hybrid quantum systems. Direct estimation of entanglement using experimental data from the IBM quantum computing platform and NMR experiments has also been carried out in earlier work. A similar investigation in the context of CV systems is necessary to assess fully the utility of the tomographic approach. In this paper, we highlight the advantages of this approach in the context of experiments reported in the literature on two CV systems, namely, entangled Talbot carpets and entangled biphoton frequency combs. We use the tomographic entanglement indicator to estimate the degree of entanglement between a pair of Talbot carpets, and demonstrate that this provides a simpler and more direct procedure as compared to the one suggested in the experiment. We also establish that the tomograms corresponding to two biphoton frequency combs carry clear entanglement signatures that distinguish between the two states.

TI Role of Junctionless Mode in Improving the Photosensitivity of Sub-10 nm
   Carbon Nanotube/Nanoribbon Field-Effect Phototransistors: Quantum
   Simulation, Performance Assessment, and Comparison
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this article, ultrascaled junctionless (JL) field-effect phototransistors based on carbon nanotube/nanoribbons with sub-10 nm photogate lengths were computationally assessed using a rigorous quantum simulation. This latter self-consistently solves the Poisson equation with the mode space (MS) non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism in the ballistic limit. The adopted photosensing principle is based on the light-induced photovoltage, which alters the electrostatics of the carbon-based junctionless nano-phototransistors. The investigations included the photovoltage behavior, the I-V characteristics, the potential profile, the energy-position-resolved electron density, and the photosensitivity. In addition, the subthreshold swing-photosensitivity dependence as a function of change in carbon nanotube (graphene nanoribbon) diameter (width) was thoroughly analyzed while considering the electronic proprieties and the quantum physics in carbon nanotube/nanoribbon-based channels. As a result, the junctionless paradigm substantially boosted the photosensitivity and improved the scaling capability of both carbon phototransistors. Moreover, from the point of view of comparison, it was found that the junctionless graphene nanoribbon field-effect phototransistors exhibited higher photosensitivity and better scaling capability than the junctionless carbon nanotube field-effect phototransistors. The obtained results are promising for modern nano-optoelectronic devices, which are in dire need of high-performance ultra-miniature phototransistors.

TI Biomarker discovery with quantum neural networks: a case-study in
   CTLA4-activation pathways
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background Biomarker discovery is a challenging task due to the massive search space. Quantum computing and quantum Artificial Intelligence (quantum AI) can be used to address the computational problem of biomarker discovery from genetic data. Method We propose a Quantum Neural Networks architecture to discover genetic biomarkers for input activation pathways. The Maximum Relevance-Minimum Redundancy criteria score biomarker candidate sets. Our proposed model is economical since the neural solution can be delivered on constrained hardware. Results We demonstrate the proof of concept on four activation pathways associated with CTLA4, including (1) CTLA4-activation stand-alone, (2) CTLA4-CD8A-CD8B co-activation, (3) CTLA4-CD2 co-activation, and (4) CTLA4-CD2-CD48-CD53-CD58-CD84 co-activation. Conclusion The model indicates new genetic biomarkers associated with the mutational activation of CLTA4-associated pathways, including 20 genes: CLIC4, CPE, ETS2, FAM107A, GPR116, HYOU1, LCN2, MACF1, MT1G, NAPA, NDUFS5, PAK1, PFN1, PGAP3, PPM1G, PSMD8, RNF213, SLC25A3, UBA1, and WLS. We open source the implementation at: https://github.com/namnguyen0510/Biomarker-Discovery-with-Quantum-Neural-Networks.

TI Closed-loop electron-beam-induced spectroscopy and nanofabrication
   around individual quantum emitters
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Color centers in diamond play a central role in the development of quantum photonic technologies, and their importance is only expected to grow in the near future. For many quantum applications, high collection efficiency from individual emitters is required, but the refractive index mismatch between diamond and air limits the optimal collection efficiency with conventional diamond device geometries. While different out-coupling methods with near-unity efficiency exist, many have yet to be realized due to current limitations in nanofabrication methods, especially for mechanically hard materials like diamond. Here, we leverage electron-beam-induced etching to modify Sn-implanted diamond quantum microchiplets containing integrated waveguides with a width and thickness of 280 nm and 200 nm, respectively. This approach allows for simultaneous high-resolution imaging and modification of the host matrix with an open geometry and direct writing. When coupled with the cathodoluminescence signal generated from the electron-emitter interactions, we can monitor the enhancement of the quantum emitters in real-time with nanoscale spatial resolution. The operando cathodoluminescence measurement and fabrication around single photon emitters demonstrated here provide a new foundation for the potential control of emitter-cavity interactions in integrated quantum photonics.

TI Picosecond-resolution single-photon time lens for temporal mode quantum
   processing
SO OPTICA
AB Techniques to control the spectro-temporal properties of quantum states of light at ultrafast time scales are crucial for numerous applications in quantum information science. In this work, we report an all-optical time lens for quantum signals based on Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing with picosecond resolution. Our system achieves a temporal magnification factor of 158 with single-photon level inputs, which is sufficient to overcome the intrinsic timing jitter of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. We demonstrate discrimination of two terahertz-bandwidth, single-photon-level pulses with 2.1 ps resolution (electronic jitter corrected resolution of 1.25 ps). We draw on elegant tools from Fourier optics to further show that the time-lens framework can be extended to perform complex unitary spectro-temporal transformations by imparting optimized temporal and spectral phase profiles to the input waveforms. Using numerical optimization techniques, we show that a four-stage transformation can realize an efficient temporal mode sorter that demultiplexes 10 Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes. Our time-lens-based framework represents a new toolkit for arbitrary spectro-temporal processing of single photons, with applications in temporal mode quantum processing, high-dimensional quantum key distribution, temporal mode matching for quantum networks, and quantum-enhanced sensing with time-frequency entangled states.

TI Model-Free Deep Recurrent Q-Network Reinforcement Learning for Quantum
   Circuit Architectures Design
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) technology leads to new insights into the manipulation of quantum systems in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Classical agent-based artificial intelligence algorithms provide a framework for the design or control of quantum systems. Traditional reinforcement learning methods are designed for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and, hence, have difficulty in dealing with partially observable or quantum observable decision processes. Due to the difficulty of building or inferring a model of a specified quantum system, a model-free-based control approach is more practical and feasible than its counterpart of a model-based approach. In this work, we apply a model-free deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) reinforcement learning method for qubit-based quantum circuit architecture design problems. This paper is the first attempt to solve the quantum circuit design problem from the recurrent reinforcement learning algorithm, while using discrete policy. Simulation results suggest that our long short-term memory (LSTM)-based DRQN method is able to learn quantum circuits for entangled Bell-Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (Bell-GHZ) states. However, since we also observe unstable learning curves in experiments, suggesting that the DRQN could be a promising method for AI-based quantum circuit design application, more investigation on the stability issue would be required.

TI Sensitivity of electromagnetically induced transparency to
   light-mediated interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Here we present a microscopic model that describes the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon in the multiple-scattering regime. We consider an ensemble of cold three-level atoms, in a A configuration, scattering a probe and a control field to the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field. By first considering a scalar description of the scattering, we show that the light-mediated long-range interactions that emerge between the dipoles narrow the EIT transparency window for increasing densities and sample sizes. For a vectorial description, we demonstrate that near-field interacting terms can critically affect the atomic population transfer in the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). This result points out that standard STIRAP-based quantum memories in cold-atomic ensembles would not reach high enough efficiencies for quantum information processing applications even in dilute regimes.

TI Quantum random access memory via quantum walk
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A novel concept of quantum random access memory (qRAM) employing a quantum walk is provided. Our qRAM relies on a bucket brigade scheme to access the memory cells. Introducing a bucket with chirality left and right as a quantum walker, and considering its quantum motion on a full binary tree, we can efficiently deliver the bucket to the designated memory cells, and fill the bucket with the desired information in the form of quantum superposition states. Our procedure has several advantages. First, we do not need to place any quantum devices at the nodes of the binary tree, and hence in our qRAM architecture, the cost to maintain the coherence can be significantly reduced. Second, our scheme is fully parallelized. Consequently, only O(n) steps are required to access and retrieve O(2(n) ) data in the form of quantum superposition states. Finally, the simplicity of our procedure may allow the design of qRAM with simpler structures.

We find that the bistability can be tuned by the QD-cavity mode coupling. We further show that the normalized power transmission displays anomalous dispersion indicating that the system can be used to generate slow light.

TI Solving industrial fault diagnosis problems with quantum computers
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this article, we investigate in how far quantum computers can be leveraged to solve NP-complete fault diagnosis problems within the area of industrial cyber-physical systems. Therefore, two approaches are proposed which exploit quantum computing to solve diagnosis problems: The first method employs Grover's algorithm, and the second is based on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. To show the industrial application, we present an integrated approach to learn the diagnosis model from process data, check whether the model is suitable, and use it for diagnosis. The result is a method for quantum industrial fault diagnosis. For this approach, the diagnostic capabilities and the runtime have been evaluated on an IBM Falcon processor using three publicly available benchmarks from the process industry. Further, the scaling between quantum computers and classical PCs has been analyzed.

TI Experimental realization of Schumacher's information geometric Bell
   inequality
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Quantum mechanics can produce correlations that are stronger than classically allowed. This stronger-than-classical correlation is the "fuel" for quantum computing. In 1991 Schumacher forwarded a beautiful geometric approach, analogous to the well-known result of Bell, to capture non-classicality of this correlation for a singlet state. He used a well-established information distance defined on an ensemble of identically-prepared states. He calculated that for certain detector settings used to measure the entangled state, the resulting geometry violated a triangle inequality - a violation that is not possible classically. This provided a novel information-based geometric Bell inequality in terms of a "covariance distance." Here we experimentally reproduce his construction and demonstrate a definitive violation for a Bell state of two photons based on the usual spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a paired BBO crystal. The state we produced had a visibility of V-ad = 0.970. We discuss generalizations to higher dimensional multipartite quantum states. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Observing Quantum Measurement Collapse as a Learnability Phase
   Transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB During a quantum measurement, superpositions of states with different observable properties probabilistically collapse into one with a sharp value of the measured observable. In macroscopic quantum systems, this collapse arises via a continuous measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) at a critical value of the strength of interaction with the measurement apparatus. MIPTs lie outside established paradigms for equilibrium or nonequilibrium critical phenomena and delineate distinct, stable dynamical and computational phases of matter. Quantum computers enable programmable simulation of the interaction of a measurement apparatus with a dynamical quantum system, to explore MIPT phenomena over a range of system sizes while retaining quantum coherence. Yet, existing experimental protocols rely on fundamentally nonscalable postselection techniques or direct classical simulation of quantum circuits. Here, we report the scalable observation of finite-size scaling evidence for an observable-sharpening MIPT in monitored quantum circuits in a chain of 171Yb & thorn; ions in Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor. By leveraging an equivalent description as a statistical physics problem, we implement scalable classical algorithms to infer the value of the measured observable from a single experimental shot. This technique enables a truly scalable protocol to observe observable-sharpening MIPTs in generic classes of circuits that cannot be directly classically simulated and also provides enhanced means to detect and suppress errors in the quantum simulation.

TI Entanglement performance of light through the composite free space
   channel
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Entanglement transmission is utilized widely in quantum communication. In this paper we establish a model, which characterizes the performance of entanglement state passing through the composite free space channel. This free space channel is compounded with atmosphere, sea surface and underwater channel. Based on the model, the entanglement photon pairs transmitted through composite channel are simulated. Simulation results show that the beam wandering, the incident angle of the beam on the sea surface, the concentration of chlorophyll in the seawater and other factors will lead to the degradation of the entanglement and these factors have a nonlinear relationship with transmittance. Moreover, the increase of the chlorophyll concentration is found to be a relatively heavy impact on the entanglement. In addition, expanding the aperture size of the receiving telescope will improve entanglement. The research of this paper has momentous meaning to the transmission of quantum entanglement in free space. What's more, the results have an extremely vital reference value for quantum communications in diverse natural environments.

TI Potential quantum advantage for simulation of fluid dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Numerical simulation of turbulent fluid dynamics needs to either parametrize turbulence-which introduces large uncertainties-or explicitly resolve the smallest scales-which is prohibitively expensive. Here, we provide evidence through analytic bounds and numerical studies that a potential quantum speedup can be achieved to simulate fluid dynamics using quantum computing. Specifically, we provide a lattice Boltzmann formulation of fluid dynamics for which we give evidence that low-order Carleman linearization is much more accurate than previously believed for these systems. This is achieved via a combination of reformulating the NavierStokes nonlinearity (u <middle dot> del u) to lattice-Boltzmann nonlinearity (u2) and accurately linearizing the dynamical equations, which effectively trades nonlinearity for additional degrees of freedom that add negligible expense in the quantum solver. Based on this, we apply a quantum algorithm for simulating the Carleman-linearized lattice Boltzmann equation and provide evidence that its cost scales logarithmically with system size compared with polynomial scaling in the best known classical algorithms. In this paper, we suggest that a quantum advantage may exist for simulating fluid dynamics, paving the way for simulating nonlinear multiscale transport phenomena in a wide range of disciplines using quantum computing.

TI Quantum natural stochastic pairwise coordinate descent
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum algorithms, optimized using gradient-based methods, often exhibit sub-optimal convergence performance due to their dependence on Euclidean geometry. Quantum natural gradient descent (QNGD) is a more efficient method that incorporates the geometry of the state space via a quantum information metric. However, QNGD is computationally intensive and suffers from high sample complexity. In this work, we formulate a novel quantum information metric and construct an unbiased estimator for this metric using single-shot measurements. We develop a quantum optimization algorithm that leverages the geometry of the state space via this estimator while avoiding full-state tomography, as in conventional techniques. We provide the convergence analysis of the algorithm under mild conditions. Furthermore, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the better sample complexity and faster convergence of our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Our results illustrate the algorithm's ability to avoid saddle points and local minima.

TI Improved description of trapped ions as a modular electromechanical
   system
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Trapped ions are among the leading candidates for quantum computing technologies. Interfacing ion qubits in separate traps and interfacing ion qubits with superconducting qubits are two of the many challenges to scale up quantum computers. One approach to overcome both problems is to use a conducting wire to mediate the Coulomb interaction between ions in different traps or between ions and superconducting qubits. To this end, a trapped charged particle inducing charge on a conductor has long been modeled as a system of equivalent lumped element electronic components. Our careful consideration reveals two assumptions in the derivation of this model, which are generally unjustified. We explain how these assumptions undermine the model's validity, and then introduce an improved way to use linear relationships to describe the interaction of trapped ions with nearby conductors. The new method reproduces results equivalent to those of other works that are not based on the circuit element model. This method is targeted for trouble-shooting experimental designs and allows experiments to test and compare the accuracy of different theoretical models. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Tunable cavity coupling of a single Sn-V-center in
   nanodiamond across the bad-emitter and bad-cavity regimes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Efficient coupling between quantum emitters and optical cavities is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. Group-IV vacancy centers in diamond, particularly the negatively charged tin-vacancy center, have emerged as promising candidates due to their spectral stability, high Debye-Waller factor, and large orbital splitting in ground states. Here, we demonstrate controlled coupling of a single negatively charged tin-vacancy center hosted in a nanodiamond to a fully tunable Fabry-P & eacute;rot microcavity. At cryogenic temperatures, we access the weak-coupling regime and observe a transition from the bad-emitter regime to the bad-cavity regime as the optical transition of the color center narrows. At 4 K, a Purcell factor exceeding 1.7 is measured, confirming cavity-enhanced emission. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of Sn-V- centers in nanodiamonds as a coherent single-photon source for quantum networks.

TI Quantum state tomography as a numerical optimization problem
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a framework that formulates the quest for the most efficient quantum state tomography (QST) measurement set as an optimization problem which can be solved numerically, where the optimization goal is the maximization of the information gain. This approach can be applied to a broad spectrum of relevant setups including measurements restricted to a subsystem. To illustrate the power of this method we present results for the six-dimensional Hilbert space constituted by a qubit-qutrit system, which could be realized e.g. by the N-14 nuclear spin-1 and two electronic spin states of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Measurements of the qubit subsystem are expressed by projectors of rank three, i.e. projectors on half-dimensional subspaces. For systems consisting only of qubits, it was shown analytically that a set of projectors on half-dimensional subspaces can be arranged in an informationally optimal fashion for QST, thus forming so-called mutually unbiased subspaces. Our method goes beyond qubits-only systems and we find that in dimension six such a set of mutually-unbiased subspaces can be approximated with a deviation irrelevant for practical applications.

TI Chiral-induced spin selectivity in photo-induced electron transfer:
   Investigating charge and spin dynamics in a master equation framework
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Investigating the role of chiral-induced spin selectivity in the generation of spin correlated radical pairs in a photoexcited donor-chiral bridge-acceptor system is fundamental to exploit it in quantum technologies. This requires a minimal master equation description of both charge separation and recombination through a chiral bridge. To achieve this without adding complexity and entering in the microscopic origin of the phenomenon, we investigate the implications of spin-polarizing reaction operators to the master equation. The explicit inclusion of coherent evolution yields non-trivial behaviors in the charge and spin dynamics of the system. Finally, we apply this master equation to a setup comprising a molecular qubit attached to the donor-bridge-acceptor molecule, enabling qubit initialization, control, and read-out. Promising results are found by simulating this sequence of operations assuming realistic parameters and achievable experimental conditions.

TI Purcell-Enhanced and Tunable Single-Photon Emission from Telecom Quantum
   Dots in Circular Photonic Crystal Resonators
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Embedding semiconductor quantum dots into bullseye resonators has significantly advanced the development of bright telecom quantum light sources for fiber-based quantum networks. To further improve the device flexibility and stability, the bullseye approach should be combined with a pin diode structure to enable Stark tuning, deterministic charging, and enhanced coherence. In this work, we fabricate and characterize photonic structures incorporating hole gratings that efficiently support charge carrier transport while maintaining excellent optical performance. We report bright, Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission in the telecom C-band under above-band and phonon-assisted excitation. Additionally, we present electrically contacted resonators, demonstrating tunability of quantum dot transitions in the telecom O-band. These results mark significant steps toward scalable and tunable quantum light sources for real-world quantum photonic applications.

TI Anomalous Subkelvin Thermal Frequency Shifts of Ultranarrow Linewidth
   Solid State Emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the frequency response of narrow spectral holes in a doped crystal structure as a function of temperature below 1 K. We identify a particular regime in which this response significantly deviates from the expected two-phonon Raman scattering theory. Namely, near 290 mK, we observed a behavior exhibiting a temperature-dependent frequency shift of zero to first order. This is of particular interest for applications that require high frequency stability, such as laser frequency stabilization, as by operating the scheme at this specific point would result in the spectral hole frequency being highly immune to temperature fluctuations, providing the potential for a laser fractional frequency instability as low as similar to 2 x 10 - 22 at 1 s.

TI Optimal local unitary encoding circuits for the surface code
SO QUANTUM
AB The surface code is a leading candidate quantum error correcting code, owing to its high threshold, and compatibility with existing experimental architectures. Bravyi et al. [7] showed that encoding a state in the surface code using local unitary operations requires time at least linear in the lattice size L, however the most efficient known method for encoding an unknown state, introduced by Dennis et al. [18], has O(L-2) time complexity. Here, we present an optimal local unitary encoding circuit for the planar surface code that uses exactly 2L time steps to encode an unknown state in a distance L planar code. We further show how an O(L) complexity local unitary encoder for the toric code can be found by enforcing locality in the O(log L)-depth non-local renormalisation encoder. We relate these techniques by providing an O(L) local unitary circuit to convert between a toric code and a planar code, and also provide optimal encoders for the rectangular, rotated and 3D surface codes. Furthermore, we show how our encoding circuit for the planar code can be used to prepare fermionic states in the compact mapping, a recently introduced fermion to qubit mapping that has a stabiliser structure similar to that of the surface code and is particularly efficient for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model.

TI Numerical ranges of Bargmann invariants
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB For a set of ordered quantum states represented by density operators {pj}j =1n, the Bargmann invariant for this set is defined as Tr(rho 1 rho 2 ... rho n). Bargmann invariants have recently emerged as powerful tools in quantum information theory. Despite their widespread use, a complete characterization of their range of permissible values has remained an outstanding challenge. Numerical ranges of Bargmann invariants establish fundamental limits on Bargmann invariants in quantum mechanics. In this work, we rigorously determine the numerical range of Bargmann invariants for quantum systems of arbitrary finite dimension. We demonstrate that any permissible value of these invariants can be achieved using either (i) pure states exhibiting circular Gram matrix symmetry or (ii) qubit states alone. These results provide a solid foundation for the diverse applications of Bargmann invariants in quantum information processing.

AB Conventional asymmetric cryptography is threatened by the ongoing development of quantum computers. A mandatory countermeasure in the context of virtual private networks (VPNs) is to use post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as a drop-in replacement for the authenticated key exchange in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. However, the results of the ongoing cryptanalysis of PQC cannot be predicted. Consequently, this article discusses orthogonal methods for quantum-resistant key exchanges, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and multipath key reinforcement (MKR). As each method has limitations when used on its own, we conclude that it is best to maximize security by combining all available sources of symmetric key material to protect traffic inside a VPN. As one possible realization, we propose a lightweight proxy concept that uses available symmetric keys, like QKD and MKR keys, to implement a transparent cryptographic tunnel for all IKE packets, and consequently for PQC key exchanges. In contrast to combining PQC and symmetric key material within the IKE protocol, our approach provides security in depth: If secure symmetric keys are available, attacks on IKE and hence on PQC algorithms are infeasible. But even otherwise, the security properties of IKE and thus PQC are not weakened, so the overall security of the VPN is guaranteed to increase.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Solid-state defects susceptible of spin manipulation hold great promise for scalable quantum technology. To broaden their utility, operation at room temperature and emission in the telecom wavelength range are desired, eliminating cryogenic requirements and leveraging existing optical fiber infrastructure for the transmission of quantum information. To that end, we report that telecom singlephoton emitters (SPEs) in gallium nitride (GaN) exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) at room temperature. The analysis of ODMR as a function of magnetic field orientation enables the determination of the orientation of the spin quantization axis with respect to the GaN crystalline lattice. The optical transitions dynamics are analyzed to gain further insight into the transition rates dominating ODMR. Our findings, coupled with the mature fabrication technology of GaNs, could facilitate the realization of scalable quantum technology.

AB An optomechanical system is a promising platform to connect different "notes" of quantum networks. Therefore, entanglements generated from it is also of great importance. In this paper, the parameter dependence of optomechanical and optical-optical entanglements generated from the double-longitudinal-mode cavity optomechanical system are discussed and two quadrapartite entanglement generation schemes based on such a system are proposed. Furthermore, 2N and 4N-par tite entangled states of optical modes can be obtained by coupling N cavities that used in the above two schemes with N-1 beamsplitters, respectively. Certain ladder or linear entanglement structures are included in the finally obtained entangled state, which are important for its application in one-way quantum computing.

TI Photoinduced Magnetic Exchange-Jump Promotes Ground State Biradical
   Electron Spin Polarization
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Photoinduced electron spin polarization (ESP) is reported in the electronic ground states of three Pt(II) complexes comprised of two S = 1/2 nitronyl nitroxide (NN) radicals attached through different length para-phenylethynyl bridges to the 3,6 positions of a catecholate (CAT, donor) and 4,4 '-di-tert-butyl-2,2 '-bipyridine (bpy, acceptor). Complexes 1-3 have from 17 to 41 bonds separating NN radicals and display cw-EPR spectra consistent with |J(NN-NN)| >> |a(N)|, |J(NN-NN)| >= |a(N)|, and |J(NN-NN)| < |a(N)|, respectively, where J(NN-NN) is the magnetic exchange coupling between NN radicals in the electronic ground state, and a(N) is the isotropic N-14 hyperfine coupling constant. Light-induced transient EPR spectra characterized as enhanced ground-state absorption were observed for all three complexes using 532 nm pulsed laser excitation into the ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LL'CT) band of the (CAT)Pt(bpy) chromophore. The magnitude of the observed ESP increases in the order 1 < 2 < 3 and is inversely correlated with the magnitude of ground-state J(NN-NN). In addition to the experimental observation of net absorptive polarization in 1-3, light excitation also produces multiplet polarization in 2. Since the weak dipolar coupling leads to a strong spectral overlap of the absorptive and emissive components, the multiplet polarization is not observed in 1 and 3 and is very weak in 2. The ability to spin-polarize multiple radical spins with a single photon is anticipated to advance new photoinduced multi qubit/qudit ESP protocols for quantum information science applications.

TI High-fidelity multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid
   passage
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a robust protocol for implementing high-fidelity multiqubit controlled phase gates (CkZ) on neutral atom qubits coupled to highly excited Rydberg states. Our approach is based on extending adiabatic rapid passage to two-photon excitation via a short-lived intermediate excited state common to alkali-atom Rydberg experiments, accounting for the full impact of spontaneous decay and differential AC Stark shifts from the complete manifold of hyperfine excited states. We evaluate and optimise gate performance, concluding that for Cs and currently available laser frequencies and powers, a CCZ gate with fidelity F > 0.995 for three qubits and CCCZ with F > 0.99 for four qubits is attainable in similar to 1.8 mu s via this protocol. Higher fidelities are accessible with future technologies, and our results highlight the utility of neutral atom arrays for the native implementation of multiqubit unitaries.

TI Studying many-body localization in exchange-coupled electron spin qubits
   using spin-spin correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We show that many-body localization (MBL) effects can be observed in a finite chain of exchange-coupled spin qubits in the presence of both exchange and magnetic noise, a system that has been experimentally realized in semiconductors and is a potential solid-state quantum computing platform. In addition to established measures of MBL, the level spacing ratio and the entanglement entropy, we propose another quantity, the spin-spin correlation function, that can be measured experimentally and is particularly well-suited to experiments in semiconductor-based electron spin qubit systems. We show that, in cases that the established measures detect as delocalized "phases," the spin-spin correlation functions retain no memory of the system's initial state (i.e., the long-time value deviates significantly from the initial value), but that they do retain memory in cases that the established measures detect as localized "phases." We also discover an interesting counterintuitive result that there is no clear tendency towards localization with increasing charge noise in small systems (3-10 spins). The proposed experiments should be feasible in the existing semiconductor spin qubit systems.

We investigate a light-matter interface based on the photonic counterpart of these states and prove that it can lead to phenomena with no analog in other setups. First, we show how to image the Fermi arcs by studying the spontaneous decay of one or many emitters coupled to the system's border. Second, we demonstrate that, exploiting the negative refraction of these modes, the Fermi arc surface states can act as a robust quantum link, enabling, e.g., the occurrence of perfect quantum state transfer between the considered emitters or the formation of highly entangled states. In addition to their fundamental interest, our findings evidence the potential offered by the photonic Fermi arc light-matter interfaces for the design of more robust quantum technologies.

TI Continuous and time-discrete non-Markovian system-reservoir
   interactions: Dissipative coherent quantum feedback in Liouville space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Based on tensor-network realizations of path integrals reducing exponential memory scaling to polynomial efficiency and a Liouville space implementation of a time-discrete quantum memory, we investigate a quantum system simultaneously exposed to two structured reservoirs. For this purpose, we employ a numerically exact quasi-two-dimensional tensor network combining both diagonal and off-diagonal system-reservoir interactions with a twofold memory for continuous and discrete retardation effects. As a possible example, we study the non-Markovian dynamical interplay between discrete photonic feedback and structured acoustic phonon modes, resulting in emerging inter-reservoir correlations and long-living population trapping within an initially excited two-level system.

TI QuL: Programming Library for Computational Cooling of Qubits
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB A key hurdle to the success of quantum computers is the ability to initialize qubits into a pure state, which can be achieved by cooling qubits down to very low temperatures. Computational cooling of qubits, whereby a subset of the qubits is cooled at the expense of heating the other qubits via the application of special sets of logic gates, offers a route to effectively cool qubits. Here, we present QuL, a programming library which can be used to generate, analyze, and test quantum circuits for various computational cooling protocols. In its most basic usage, QuL enables a novice user to easily produce cooling circuits with minimal input or knowledge required. The programming library, however, offers flexibility to more advanced users to finely tune the cooling protocol used to generate the quantum circuit. Finally, QuL offers methods to assess and compare various cooling protocols for users interested in studying optimal implementation of computational cooling in general, or on specific quantum backends. It is our hope that QuL will not only facilitate the execution of computational cooling on current quantum computers, but also serve as a tool to investigate open questions in the optimal implementation of computational cooling.

TI Quantum Interference between Nonidentical Single Particles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum interference between identical single particles reveals the intrinsic quantum statistic nature of particles, which could not be interpreted through classical physics. Here, we demonstrate quantum interference between nonidentical bosons using a generalized beam splitter based on a quantum memory. The Hong-Ou-Mandel type interference between single photons and single magnons with high visibility is demonstrated, and the crossover from the bosonic to fermionic quantum statistics is observed by tuning the beam splitter to be non-Hermitian. Moreover, multiparticle interference that simulates the behavior of three fermions by three input photons is realized. Our work extends the understanding of the quantum interference effects and demonstrates a versatile experimental platform for studying and engineering quantum statistics of particles.

TI Chaos in Optomechanical Systems Coupled to a Non-Markovian Environment
SO ENTROPY
AB We study the chaotic motion of a semi-classical optomechanical system coupled to a non-Markovian environment with a finite correlation time. By studying the emergence of chaos using the Lyapunov exponent with the changing non-Markovian parameter, we show that the non-Markovian environment can significantly enhance chaos. It is observed that a non-Markovian environment characterized by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type noise can modify the generation of chaos with different environmental memory times. As a comparison, the crossover properties from Markov to non-Markovian regimes are also discussed. Our findings indicate that the quantum memory effects on the onset of chaos may become a useful property to be investigated in quantum manipulations and control.

TI Employing Quantum Entanglement for Real-Time Coordination of Distributed
   Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: Advancing Grid Efficiency and
   Stability
SO ENERGIES
AB The widespread deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) has introduced substantial challenges to electricity pricing, grid stability, and renewable energy integration. This paper presents the first real-time quantum-enhanced electricity pricing framework for large-scale EV charging networks, marking a significant departure from existing approaches based on mixed-integer programming (MILP) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed framework incorporates renewable intermittency, demand elasticity, and infrastructure constraints within a high-dimensional optimization model. The objective is to dynamically determine spatiotemporal electricity prices that reduce system peak load, improve renewable utilization, and minimize user charging costs. A rigorous mathematical formulation is developed, integrating over 40 system-level constraints, including power balance, transmission limits, renewable curtailment, carbon targets, voltage regulation, demand-side flexibility, social participation, and cyber-resilience. Real-time electricity prices are treated as dynamic decision variables influenced by station utilization, elasticity response curves, and the marginal cost of renewable and grid electricity. The model is solved across 96 time intervals using a quantum-classical hybrid method, with benchmark comparisons against MILP and DRL baselines. A comprehensive case study is conducted on a 500-station EV network serving 10,000 vehicles, coupled with a modified IEEE 118-bus grid and 800 MW of variable renewable energy. Historical charging data with +/- 12% stochastic demand variation and real-world solar/wind profiles are used to simulate realistic conditions. Results show that the proposed framework achieves a 23.4% average peak load reduction per station, a 17.9% gain in renewable utilization, and up to 30% user cost savings compared to flat-rate pricing. Network congestion is mitigated at over 90% of high-traffic stations. Pricing trajectories align low-price windows with high-renewable periods and off-peak hours, enabling synchronized load shifting and enhanced flexibility. Visual analytics using 3D surface plots and disaggregated bar charts confirm structured demand-price interactions and smooth, stable price evolution. These findings validate the potential of quantum-enhanced optimization for scalable, clean, and adaptive EV charging coordination in renewable-rich grid environments.

TI Quantum non-Markovian "casual bystander" environments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum memory effects can be induced even when the (time-dependent) dynamical degrees of freedom associated to the environment are not affected at all by the open system during their joint coupled evolution. In this paper, based on a completely positive bipartite representation of the system-environment dynamics, we found the more general interactions that lead to this class of quantum non-Markovian "casual bystander" environments. General properties of the resulting dynamics are studied with a focus on the system-environment correlations, a collisional measurement-based representation, and the quantum regression hypothesis. Memory effects are also characterized through an operational approach, which in turn allows one to detect when the studied properties apply. Single and multipartite qubits dynamics support and exemplify the developed results.

TI Quantum simulation of ultracold atoms in optical lattice based on
   dynamical mean-field theory
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB With the development of atomic cooling technology and optical lattice technology, the quantum system composed of optical lattice and ultracold atomic gas has become a powerful tool for quantum simulation. The purity and highly controllable nature of the optical lattice give it a strong regulatory capability. Therefore, more complex and interesting physical phenomena can be simulated, which deepens the understanding of quantum many-body physics. In recent years, we have studied different Bose systems with strong correlations in optical lattice based on the bosonic dynamical mean-field theory, including multi-component system, high-orbit bosonic system, and long-range interaction system. In this review, we introduce the research progress of the above mentioned. Through the calculation by using bosonic dynamical mean-field theory which has been generalized to multi-component and real space versions, a variety of physical phenomena of optical crystal lattice Bose system in weak interaction intervals to strong interaction intervals can be simulated. The phase diagram of spin-1 ultracold bosons in a cubic optical lattice at zero temperature and finite temperature are drawn. A spin-singlet condensate phase is found, and it is observed that the superfluid can be heated into a Mott insulator with even (odd) filling through the first (second) phase transition. In the presence of a magnetic field, the ground state degeneracy is broken, and there are very rich quantum phases in the system, such as nematic phase, ferromagnetic phase, spin-singlet insulating phase, polar superfluid, and broken-axisymmetry superfluid. In addition, multistep condensations are also observed. Further, we calculate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the mixed system of spin-1 alkali metal atoms and spin-0 alkali earth metal atoms, and find that the system exhibits a non-zero magnetic ordering, which shows a second-order Mott insulation-superfluid phase transition when the filling number is n = 1, and a first-order Mott insulation-superfluid phase transition when the filling number is n = 2. The two-step Mott-insulating-superfluid phase transition due to mass imbalance is also observed. In the study of long-range interactions, we first use Rydberg atoms to find two distinctive types of supersolids, and then realize the superradiant phase coupled to different orbits by controlling the reflection of the pump laser in the system coupled to the high-finesse cavity. Finally, we study the high-orbit Bose system. We propose a new mechanism of spin angular-momentum coupling with spinor atomic Bosons based on many-body correlation and spontaneous symmetry breaking in a two-dimensional optical lattice, and then study the orbital frustration in a hexagonal lattice. We find that the interaction between orbital frustration and the strong interaction results in exotic Mott and superfluid phases with spin orbital intertwined orders.

TI Advanced quantum image representation and compression using a DCT-EFRQI
   approach
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In recent years, quantum image computing draws a lot of attention due to storing and processing image data faster compared to classical computers. A number of approaches have been proposed to represent the quantum image inside a quantum computer. Representing and compressing medium and big-size images inside the quantum computer is still challenging. To address this issue, we have proposed a block-wise DCT-EFRQI (Direct Cosine Transform Efficient Flexible Representation of Quantum Image) approach to represent and compress the gray-scale image efficiently to save computational time and reduce the quantum bits (qubits) for the state preparation. In this work, we have demonstrated the capability of block-wise DCT and DWT transformation inside the quantum domain to investigate their relative performances. The Quirk simulation tool is used to design the corresponding quantum image circuit. In the proposed DCT-EFRQI approach, a total of 17 qubits are used to represent the coefficients, the connection between coefficients and state (i.e., auxiliary), and their position for representing and compressing grayscale images inside a quantum computer. Among those, 8 qubits are used to map the coefficient values and the rest are used to generate the corresponding coefficient XY-coordinate position including one auxiliary qubit. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed DCT-EFRQI scheme provides better representation and compression compared to DCT-GQIR, DWT-GQIR, and DWT-EFRQI in terms of rate-distortion performance.

TI Quantum identity authentication for non-entanglement multiparty
   communication: A review, state of art and future directions
SO ICT EXPRESS
AB Authentication is one of the security services that assures the system's adequate security through identification and verification. Additionally, it guarantees that the communication party is who they claim to be. In politics, the economy, banking, daily life, and other areas, quantum identity authentication is essential to guarantee the security of information in communication. The multiphoton strategy is an improved version of the single-photon approach, with higher transmission rates and longer photon travel distances via the Quantum Communication network. Despite the advantages of multiphoton, enforcing authentication on behalf of numerous participants in the quantum channel remains a problem, since existing multiphoton only considers two parties involved in secret message sharing. The issue of scalability arises here when the number of parties involved in the quantum network increases. Furthermore, an eavesdropper might hide her position among other parties and take advantage of the situation to obtain a certain information. Therefore, we require a protocol, that creates a more secure environment in term of authentication in which multiple parties may freely and openly communicate. This paper further identifies research gaps covering critical aspect on how Quantum Identity Authentication (QIA) can be realized and effectively utilized for multiphoton without entanglement based. These include suggestion of future direction to implement multiphoton in multiparty from current protocol.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI Quantum information with top quarks in QCD
SO QUANTUM
AB Top quarks represent unique high-energy systems since their spin correla-tions can be measured, thus allowing to study fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics with qubits at high-energy col-liders. We present here the general frame-work of the quantum state of a top-antitop (tt over line ) quark pair produced through quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in a high-energy collider. We argue that, in general, the to-tal quantum state that can be probed in a collider is given in terms of the produc-tion spin density matrix, which necessarily gives rise to a mixed state. We compute the quantum state of a tt over line pair produced from the most elementary QCD processes, finding the presence of entanglement and CHSH violation in different regions of phase space. We show that any realistic hadronic production of a tt over line pair is a sta-tistical mixture of these elementary QCD processes. We focus on the experimen-tally relevant cases of proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions, performed at the LHC and the Tevatron, analyzing the dependence of the quantum state with the energy of the collisions. We provide exper-imental observables for entanglement and CHSH-violation signatures. At the LHC, these signatures are given by the measure-ment of a single observable, which in the case of entanglement represents the viola-tion of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We extend the validity of the quantum tomog-raphy protocol for the tt over line pair proposed in the literature to more general quantum states, and for any production mechanism. Finally, we argue that a CHSH violation measured in a collider is only a weak form of violation of Bell's theorem, necessarily containing a number of loopholes.

TI Enhancing Knapsack-Based Financial Portfolio Optimization Using Quantum
   Approximate Optimization Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Portfolio optimization is a primary component of the decision-making process in finance, aiming to tactfully allocate assets to achieve optimal returns while considering various constraints. Herein, we proposed a method that uses the knapsack-based portfolio optimization problem and incorporates the quantum computing capabilities of the quantum walk mixer with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to address the challenges presented by the NP-hard problem. Additionally, we present the sequential procedure of our suggested approach and demonstrate empirical proof to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal asset allocations across various constraints and asset choices. Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of the QAOA components in relation to our proposed method. Consequently, our study successfully achieves the approximate ratio of the portfolio optimization technique using a circuit layer of $p\geqslant 3$ , compared to the classical best-known solution of the knapsack problem. Our proposed methods potentially contribute to the growing field of quantum finance by offering insights into the potential benefits of employing quantum algorithms for complex optimization tasks in financial portfolio management.

TI Dynamical quantum phase transitions in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate
   and criticality enhanced quantum sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum phase transitions universally exist in the ground and excited states of quantum many-body systems, and they have a close relationship with the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions, which however are challenging to identify. In the system of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates, though dynamical phase transitions with correspondence to equilibrium phase transitions in the ground state and uppermost excited state have been probed, those taking place in intermediate excited states remain untouched in experiments thus far. Here we unravel that both the ground- and excited-state quantum phase transitions in spinor condensates can be diagnosed with dynamical phase transitions. A connection between equilibrium phase transitions and nonequilibrium behaviors of the system is disclosed in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We also demonstrate that near the critical points parameter estimation beyond the standard quantum limit can be implemented. This work not only advances the exploration of excited-state quantum phase transitions via a scheme that can immediately be applied to a broad class of few-mode quantum systems, but also provides a new perspective on the relationship between quantum criticality and quantum enhanced sensing.

TI Parity-Time Symmetric Holographic Principle
SO ENTROPY
AB Originating from the Hamiltonian of a single qubit system, the phenomenon of the avoided level crossing is ubiquitous in multiple branches of physics, including the Landau-Zener transition in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, the band structure of condensed matter physics and the dispersion relation of relativistic quantum physics. We revisit this fundamental phenomenon in the simple example of a spinless relativistic quantum particle traveling in (1+1)-dimensional space-time and establish its relation to a spin-1/2 system evolving under a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. This relation allows us to simulate 1-dimensional eigenvalue problems with a single qubit. Generalizing this relation to the eigenenergy problem of a bulk system with N spatial dimensions reveals that its eigenvalue problem can be mapped onto the time evolution of the edge state with (N-1) spatial dimensions governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In other words, the bulk eigenenergy state is encoded in the edge state as a hologram, which can be decoded by the propagation of the edge state in the temporal dimension. We argue that the evolution will be PT-symmetric as long as the bulk system admits parity symmetry. Our work finds the application of PT-symmetric and non-Hermitian physics in quantum simulation and provides insights into the fundamental symmetries.

TI Quantum encryption in phase space with displacement operators
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In photonic computing, the quantum systems consist of coherent states and squeezed coherent states. Common quantum gates found in these systems are: phase shift, displacement, and squeezing gates. These gates are all unitary and reversible. Outside of quantum systems, coherent states also plays a significant role in coherent optical communications with speeds of hundreds of gigabits per second. Secure optical communications is generally implemented at the data layer with classical symmetric encryption such as Advanced Standard Encryption or AES. This inevitably allows any wiretapping to capture the transmitted data either in the plaintext mode or in the encrypted ciphertext mode in the optical infrastructure. The recent and rapid developments in Quantum computing further lift up the need for quantum secure communications in the optical infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel quantum encryption in the coherent optical domain utilizing a displacement operator and implementing with IQ-MZM optical modules, called Quantum Encryption in Phase Space or QEPS. The communication peers share a secret used to seed cryptographic pseudo random number generators to produce a synchronized random number at both the transmitter and receiver. The synchronized random numbers are used to establish displacement operators to encrypt the coherent states at the transmission and decrypt the cipher coherent states at the receiver. Therefore, malicious parties tapping along the fibre line would not extract the message in transit from optical domain due to a high Bit Error Rate or BER. The optimal displacement operator is split into a standard 16-QAM and a random phase shift operator to enhance the transmission security. We analysis the transmission security with the wiretap channel model for semantic security. We have simulated the QEPS encryption and decryption for two data modulation schemes: QPSK and 16-QAM over 80 km for transmission speeds of 56 Gbps for QPSK and 112 Gbps for 16-QAM.

TI Spontaneous emission in micro- or nanophotonic structures
SO PHOTONIX
AB Single-photon source in micro- or nanoscale is the basic building block of on-chip quantum information and scalable quantum network. Enhanced spontaneous emission based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) is one of the key principles of realizing single-photon sources fabricated by micro- or nanophotonic cavities. Here we mainly review the spontaneous emission of single emitters in micro- or nanostructures, such as whispering gallery microcavities, photonic crystals, plasmon nanostructures, metamaterials, and their hybrids. The researches have enriched light-matter interaction as well as made great influence in single-photon source, photonic circuit, and on-chip quantum information.

TI Qubits made by advanced semiconductor manufacturing
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Silicon spin qubits can be fabricated in a 300 mm semiconductor manufacturing facility using all-optical lithography and fully industrial processing.
   Full-scale quantum computers require the integration of millions of qubits, and the potential of using industrial semiconductor manufacturing to meet this need has driven the development of quantum computing in silicon quantum dots. However, fabrication has so far relied on electron-beam lithography and, with a few exceptions, conventional lift-off processes that suffer from low yield and poor uniformity. Here we report quantum dots that are hosted at a Si-28/(SiO2)-Si-28 interface and fabricated in a 300 mm semiconductor manufacturing facility using all-optical lithography and fully industrial processing. With this approach, we achieve nanoscale gate patterns with excellent yield. In the multi-electron regime, the quantum dots allow good tunnel barrier control-a crucial feature for fault-tolerant two-qubit gates. Single-spin qubit operation using magnetic resonance in the few-electron regime reveals relaxation times of over 1 s at 1 T and coherence times of over 3 ms.

TI Light pulse storage in Pr:YSO crystal based on the revival of silenced
   echo protocol
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report on the light pulse storage in Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal based on the revival of silenced echo protocol, which has the advantage of being immune from the spontaneous emission noise. We optimized the echo retrieval efficiency of the light pulse by employing complex hyperbolic secant rephasing pulses and by finely tuning the optical depth in the inhomogeneous broadening of the crystal. An echo retrieval efficiency of 24.4% was demonstrated, and an optical coherence time of 34.6 mu s was extracted from the measured decay dynamics of the echo retrieval efficiency at a cryogenic temperature of 3.4 K. These results could be useful for potential applications in quantum memory and related applications.

TI Hyperentanglement of divalent neutral atoms by Rydberg blockade
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hyperentanglement (HE), the simultaneous entanglement between two particles in more than one degree of freedom, is relevant to both fundamental physics and quantum technology. Previous study on HE has been focusing on photons. Here, we study HE in individual neutral atoms. In most alkaline-earth-like atoms with two valence electrons and a nonzero nuclear spin, there are two stable electronic states, the ground state and the long-lived clock state, which can define an electronic qubit. Meanwhile, their nuclear spin states can define a nuclear qubit. By the Rydberg blockade effect, we show that the controlled-Z (CZ) operation can be generated in the electronic qubits of two nearby atoms, and simultaneously in their nuclear qubits as well, leading to a CZ circle times CZ operation which is capable to induce HE. The possibility to induce HE in individual neutral atoms offers opportunities to study quantum science and technology based on neutral atoms.

TI Quantum fisher information of an optomechanical force sensor driven by a
   squeezed vacuum field
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate the enhancement in sensitivity when measuring a weak force through the optical response of an optomechanical oscillator driven by squeezed light. In the context of a quantum sensor based on cavity-optomechanics, the sensitivity scaling measured by the quantum Fisher information for a squeezed vacuum state pump is compared to that for a coherent state pump. We show that squeezed state inputs can produce noise levels below the standard quantum limit and even the Heisenberg limit in given regimes. This study shows that new pathways can be opened for enhanced quantum sensing with optomechanical systems conducive to measuring various physical quantities such as gravitational force, acceleration, and acoustics.

TI Synthesis of Reversible and Quantum Circuit Using ROCBDD and
   Mixed-Polarity Toffoli Gate
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the last decade, the synthesis of reversible logic circuits has become a trending topic because of its future necessity and importance. Many methods have been studied and proposed, for instance, transformation-based, search-based, cycle-based, ESOP-based and BDD-based methods. Each of them has its limitation related to time processing, ancilla and garbage line, quantum cost. This study develops an algorithm that could synthesize quantum circuits based on mixed-polarity Toffoli gate and a variant of binary decision diagram (BDD) called reduced-ordered-complemented edge-bdd (ROCBDD). It is an optimized method of BDD to reduce nodes in the representation of Boolean functions, which leads to adding more lines and quantum gates in the reversible circuit. First, the differences between synthesis using ROCBDD, the traditional BDD and others methods are introduced. Then, we define a new structure consisting of mixed-polarity Toffoli gates relied on nodes of ROCBDD. An efficient algorithm to match BDD representation to the reversible logic circuit is also mentioned. Finally, the experimental results show that our algorithm has better synthesizing costs than previous BDD-based methods.

TI Relaxation of single-electron spin qubits in silicon in the presence of
   interface steps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We develop a valley-dependent envelope function theory that can describe the effects of arbitrary configurations of interface steps and miscuts on the qubit relaxation time. For a given interface roughness, we show how our theory can be used to find the valley-dependent dipole matrix elements, the valley splitting, and the spin-valley coupling as a function of the electromagnetic fields in a Si/SiGe quantum dot spin qubit. We demonstrate that our theory can quantitatively reproduce and explain the result of experimental measurements for the spin relaxation time with only a minimal set of free parameters. Investigating the sample dependence of spin relaxation, we find that at certain conditions for a disordered quantum dot, the spin-valley coupling vanishes. This, in turn, completely blocks the valley-induced qubit decay. We show that the presence of interface steps can in general give rise to a strongly anisotropic behavior of the spin relaxation time. Remarkably, by properly tuning the gate-induced out-of-plane electric field, it is possible to turn the spin-valley hot spot into a "cold spot" at which the relaxation time is significantly prolonged and where the spin relaxation time is additionally first-order insensitive to the fluctuations of the magnetic field. This electrical tunability enables on-demand fast qubit reset and initialization that is critical for many quantum algorithms and error correction schemes. We therefore argue that the valley degree of freedom can be used as an advantage for Si spin qubits.

TI Fisher and Skew Information Correlations of Two Coupled Trapped Ions:
   Intrinsic Decoherence and Lamb-Dicke Nonlinearity
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB It is well known that many quantum information processing methods in artificial atoms depend largely on their engineering properties and their ability to generate quantum correlations. In this paper, we investigate the non-classical correlation dynamics of two trapped ions by using local quantum Fisher information, local quantum uncertainty, as well as logarithmic negativity. The system engineering is designed such that the two-trapped-ions work as two diploe-coupled qubits in a Lamb-Dicke regime. The center-of-mass vibrational modes are initially in coherent/even coherent states. It is found that the two-trapped-ions correlations can be controlled by the Lamb-Dicke nonlinearity, the nonclassicality effect of the initial center-of-mass vibrational mode, as well as the trapped-ion coupling and the intrinsic decoherence. The sudden changes in the non-classical correlations and their stability are shown against Lamb-Dicke nonlinearity, the nonclassicality, the trapped-ion coupling, and the intrinsic decoherence.

TI First-Principles Design of Qubits in Charged Carbon Nanomaterials
SO MATERIALS
AB Our first-principles calculations have unveiled a profound influence of varied external charges on the energy levels and spin distributions of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional carbon nanomaterials. By leveraging the Fermi distribution formula, we systematically analyze the temperature-dependent electron occupancy probabilities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Notably, configurations with specific additional electron loads exhibit a stable total occupancy of HOMO + LUMO equal to 1 across a wide temperature range, forming a robust basis for orbital qubits. This stability persists even under Fermi energy corrections, demonstrating minimal temperature sensitivity up to 300 K. Furthermore, we identify a universal criterion-EHOMO + ELUMO = 2EFermi-that governs qubit feasibility across diverse carbon nanostructures, independent of dimensionality or atom count. Experimental validation via charge injection methods (e.g., gate modulation or electron beam irradiation) is supported by existing precedents in carbon-based quantum devices. Our findings establish low-dimensional carbon nanomaterials as versatile, scalable platforms for quantum computing, combining thermal stability and dimensional adaptability, thus bridging theoretical insights with practical quantum engineering.

TI Applying NV center-based quantum sensing to study intracellular free
   radical response upon viral infections
SO REDOX BIOLOGY
AB Although viruses are known to modify the free radical concentration in infected cells, the exact location and concentrations of such changes remain unknown. Although this information is important to understand the virus pathogenesis and design better anti-viral drugs or vaccines, obtaining it with the conventional free radical/ROS detection techniques is impossible. Here, we elucidate the utility of diamond magnetometry for studying the free radical response of baby hamster kidney-21 cells upon Semliki Forest virus infection. Specifically, we optically probe the alterations in free radical concentration near infectious viruses via measuring the spin-lattice relaxation (T-1) of NV defect ensembles embedded in intracellular nanodiamonds. We performed measurements both at random locations as well as close to the virus entry by conjugating viruses to nanodiamond sensors. We observed alterations of T-1, which represent the intracellular free radical concentration during the viral replication process. Moreover, relaxometry is also used to monitor real-time free radical variation during the early infectious process.

TI Loss-induced quantum nonreciprocity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Attribute to their robustness against loss and external noise, nonreciprocal photonic devices hold great promise for applications in quantum information processing. Recent advancements have demonstrated that nonreciprocal optical transmission in linear systems can be achieved through the strategic introduction of loss. However, a crucial question remains unanswered: can loss be harnessed as a resource for generating nonreciprocal quantum correlations? Here, we take a counterintuitive stance by engineering loss to generate a vital form of nonreciprocal quantum correlations, termed nonreciprocal photon blockade. We examine a dissipative three-cavity system comprising two nonlinear cavities and a linear cavity. The interplay of loss and nonlinearity leads to a robust nonreciprocal single- and two-photon blockade, facilitated by destructive quantum interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of this nonreciprocal photon blockade by manipulating the relative phase between the two nonlinear cavities. Remarkably, this allows for the reversal of the direction of nonreciprocity. Our study not only sheds a light on the concept of loss-engineered quantum nonreciprocity but also opens up a pathway for the design of quantum nonreciprocal photonic devices.

TI Anomaly detection speed-up by quantum restricted Boltzmann machines
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum machine learning promises to revolutionize traditional machine learning by efficiently addressing hard tasks for classical computation. While claims of quantum speed-up have been announced for gate-based quantum computers and photon-based boson samplers, demonstration of an advantage by adiabatic quantum annealers (AQAs) is open. Here we quantify the computational cost and the performance of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), a widely investigated machine learning model, by classical and quantum annealing. Despite the lower computational complexity of the quantum RBM being lost due to physical implementation overheads, a quantum speed-up may arise as a reduction by orders of magnitude of the computational time. By employing real-world cybersecurity datasets, we observe that the negative phase on sufficiently challenging tasks is computed up to 64 times faster by AQAs during the exploitation phase. Therefore, although a quantum speed-up highly depends on the problem's characteristics, it emerges in existing hardware on real-world data.
   Adiabatic quantum annealers offer a promising path to establish an edge over classical computation, even though the demonstration of an advantage is still open. In this paper, the authors employ Quantum RBMs on Adiabatic quantum annealers, finding orders-of-magnitude speed-up compared to classical computers on real-world cybersecurity tasks for negative phase sampling.

TI Constraining work fluctuations of non-Hermitian dynamics across the
   exceptional point of a superconducting qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Thermodynamics constrains changes to the energy of a system, both deliberate and random, via its first and second laws. When the system is not in equilibrium, fluctuation theorems such as the Jarzynski equality further restrict the distributions of deliberate work done. Such fluctuation theorems have been experimentally verified in small, nonequilibrium quantum systems undergoing unitary or decohering dynamics. Yet, their validity in systems governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian has long been contentious due to the false premise of the Hamiltonian's dual and equivalent roles in dynamics and energetics. Here we show that work fluctuations in a non-Hermitian qubit obey the Jarzynski equality even if its Hamiltonian has complex or purely imaginary eigenvalues. With postselection on a dissipative superconducting circuit undergoing a cyclic parameter sweep, we experimentally quantify the work distribution using projective energy measurements and show that the fate of the Jarzynski equality is determined by the parity-time symmetry of, and the energetics that result from, the corresponding non-Hermitian, Floquet Hamiltonian. By distinguishing the energetics from non-Hermitian dynamics, our results provide the recipe for investigating the nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics of such open systems.

TI Classification of Single-Photon Emitters in Confocal Fluorescence
   Microscope Images by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In the rapidly evolving field of quantum information technology, the accurate and efficient classification of single-photon emitters is paramount. Traditional methods, which rely on conducting time-intensive Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) experiments to acquire the 2nd-order correlation function of photon statistics, are not efficient. This study presents a pioneering solution that employs Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify single-photon emitters in confocal fluorescence microscope images, thereby bypassing the need for laborious HBT experiments. Focusing on the nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, the model is trained using fluorescence images of emitters that have been previously classified through HBT experiments. Applied to unclassified fluorescence images, the model achieves up to 98% accuracy in classification, substantially accelerating the identification process. This advancement not only makes the classification workflow more efficient but also promises wider applicability across various color centers and isolated atomic systems that necessitate imaging for isolation verification. This research signifies a substantial advancement in the application of quantum technologies, leveraging the power of deep learning to optimize the utilization of single-photon emitters.

TI Observing a changing Hilbert-space inner product
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In quantum mechanics, physical states are represented by rays in Hilbert space H, which is a vector space imbued by an inner product <vertical bar >, whose physical meaning arises as the overlap <phi vertical bar psi > for vertical bar psi > a pure state (description of preparation) and <phi vertical bar a projective measurement. However, current quantum theory does not formally address the consequences of a changing inner product during the interval between preparation and measurement. We establish a theoretical framework for such a changing inner product, which we show is consistent with standard quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we show that this change is described by a quantum operation, which is tomographically observable, and we elucidate how our result is strongly related to the exploding topic of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. We explain how to realize experimentally a changing inner product for a qubit in terms of a qutrit protocol with a unitary channel.

TI Quantum Support Vector Machines for Aerodynamic Classification
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Aerodynamics plays an important role in the aviation industry and aircraft design. Detecting and minimizing the phenomenon of flow separation from scattered pressure data on the airfoil is critical for ensuring stable and efficient aviation. However, given that it is challenging to understand the mechanics of flow-field separation, aerodynamic parameters are emphasized for the identification and control of flow separation. The mechanics of flow-field separation have been extensively investigated using traditional algorithms and machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM) models. Recently, growing interest in quantum computing and its applications in various research communities has shed light on the use of quantum techniques to solve aerodynamic problems. In this study, we applied qSVM, a quantum SVM algorithm based on the quantum annealing model, to identify flow separation and compared its performance to that of the widely used classical SVM. We demonstrated that our approach outperforms the classical SVM with an 11.1% increase in accuracy, from 0.818 to 0.909, for this binary classification task. We further developed a multiclass qSVM based on a one-against-all algorithm and applied it to the classification of multiple angles of attack on the wings, where its advantage over its classical multiclass counterparts was maintained with a 17.9% increase in accuracy, from 0.67 to 0.79. Our study demonstrates a useful quantum technique for classifying flow separation scenarios and may promote the investigation of quantum computing applications in fluid dynamics.

TI Performance of dense coding and teleportation for random states:
   Augmentation via preprocessing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In order to understand the resourcefulness of a natural quantum system in quantum communication tasks, we study the dense coding capacity (DCC) and teleportation fidelity of Haar uniformly generated random multipartite states of various ranks. We prove that when a rank-2 two-qubit state, a Werner state, and a pure state possess the same amount of entanglement, the DCC of a rank-2 state belongs to the envelope made by pure and Werner states. In a similar way, we obtain an upper bound via the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state for rank-2 three-qubit states when the dense coding with two senders and a single receiver is performed and entanglement is measured in the senders:receiver bipartition. The normalized frequency distributions of DCC for randomly generated two-, three-, and four-qubit density matrices with global as well as local decodings at the receiver's end are reported. The estimation of mean DCC for two-qubit states is found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Universally, we observe that the performance of random states for dense coding as well as teleportation decreases with the increase of the rank of states, which we have shown to be surmounted by the local preprocessing operations performed on the shared states before starting the protocols, irrespective of the rank of the states. The local preprocessing employed here is based on positive operator valued measurements along with classical communication and we show that unlike dense coding with two-qubit random states, the senders' operations are always helpful to probabilistically enhance the capabilities of implementing dense coding as well as teleportation.

TI Routing, Channel, Key-Rate, and Time-Slot Assignment for QKD in Optical
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is currently being explored as a solution to the threats posed to current cryptographic protocols by the evolution of quantum computers and algorithms. However, single-photon quantum signals used for QKD permit to achieve key rates strongly limited by link performance (e.g., loss and noise) and propagation distance, especially in multi-node QKD networks, making it necessary to design a scheme to efficiently and timely distribute keys to the various nodes. In this work, we introduce the new problem of joint Routing, Channel, Key-rate and Time-slot Assignment (RCKTA), which is addressed with four different network settings, i.e., allowing or not the use of optical bypass (OB) and trusted relay (TR). We first prove the NP-hardness of the RCKTA problem for all network settings and formulate it using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that combines both quantum channels and quantum key pool (QKP) to provide an optimized solution in terms of number of accepted key rate requests and key storing rate. To deal with problem complexity, we also propose a heuristic algorithm based on an auxiliary graph, and show that it is able to obtain near-optimal solutions in polynomial time. Results show that allowing OB and TR achieves an acceptance ratio of 39% and 14% higher than that of OB and TR, respectively. Remarkably, these acceptance ratios are obtained with up to 46% less QKD modules (transceivers) compared to TR and only few (less than 1 per path) additional QKD modules than OB.

TI Two-dimensional Planck spectroscopy for microwave photon calibration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum state tomography of weak microwave signals is an important part of many protocols in the field of quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. This step typically relies on an accurate in-situ estimation of signal losses in the experimental setup and requires a careful photon-number calibration. Here, we present an improved method for the microwave loss estimation inside of a closed cryogenic system. Our approach is based on Planck's law and makes use of independent temperature sweeps of individual parts of the cryogenic setup. Using this technique, we can experimentally resolve changes in microwave losses of less than 0.1 dB in the cryogenic environment. We discuss potential applications of this approach for the precise characterization of quantum limited superconducting amplifiers and in other prominent experimental settings.

TI Decoherence-Induced Exceptional Points in a Dissipative Superconducting
   Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Open quantum systems interacting with an environment exhibit dynamics described by the combination of dissipation and coherent Hamiltonian evolution. Taken together, these effects are captured by a Liouvillian superoperator. The degeneracies of the (generically non-Hermitian) Liouvillian are exceptional points, which are associated with critical dynamics as the system approaches steady state. We use a superconducting transmon circuit coupled to an engineered environment to observe two different types of Liouvillian exceptional points that arise either from the interplay of energy loss and decoherence or purely due to decoherence. By dynamically tuning the Liouvillian superoperators in real time we observe a nonHermiticity-induced chiral state transfer. Our study motivates a new look at open quantum system dynamics from the vantage of Liouvillian exceptional points, enabling applications of non-Hermitian dynamics in the understanding and control of open quantum systems.

TI Machine Learning-Assisted Precision Manufacturing of Atom Qubits in
   Silicon
SO ACS NANO
AB Donor-based qubits in silicon, manufactured using scanning tunneling microscope (STM) lithography, provide a promising route to realizing full-scale quantum computing architectures. This is due to the precision of donor placement, long coherence times, and scalability of the silicon material platform. The properties of multiatom quantum dot qubits, however, depend on the exact number and location of the donor atoms within the quantum dots. In this work, we develop machine learning techniques that allow accurate and real-time prediction of the donor number at the qubit site during STM patterning. Machine learning image recognition is used to determine the probability distribution of donor numbers at the qubit site directly from STM images during device manufacturing. Models in excess of 90% accuracy are found to be consistently achieved by mitigating overfitting through reduced model complexity, image preprocessing, data augmentation, and examination of the intermediate layers of the convolutional neural networks. The results presented in this paper constitute an important milestone in automating the manufacture of atom-based qubits for computation and sensing applications.

TI Design-for-testability for reversible logic circuits based on
   bit-swapping
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The emerging technology of reversible circuits offers a potential solution to the synthesis of ultra low-power quantum computing systems. A reversible circuit can be envisaged as a cascade of reversible gates only, such as Toffoli gate, which has two components: k control bits and a target bit (k-CNOT), k >= 1. While analysing testability issues in a reversible circuit, the missing-gate fault model is often used for modelling physical defects in k-CNOT gates. A new design-for-testability (DFT) technique is proposed for reversible circuits that deploys bit-swapping using Fredkin reversible gates. It is shown that in an (n x n) circuit implemented with k-CNOT gates, addition of only two extra inputs along with a few Fredkin gates yields easy testability in the circuit. The modified design admits a universal test set of maximum size 2n + 1 that detects all detectable missing gate faults in the original circuit, where n is the number of input/output lines in the circuit. The DFT overhead in terms of quantum cost is much less compared to that of previous approaches. The method is more advantageous for large circuits.
   A novel design-for-testability technique is proposed for reversible circuits to make them easily testable with a universal test set of length of maximum size 2n + 1, where n is the number of input/output lines in the circuit. The design is found to be best suited for large-sized circuits. The design achieves a significant reduction in quantum cost compared to previous approaches and offers 100% multiple missing gate fault detection while other design failed to achieve.image

TI Spectral splits and entanglement entropy in collective neutrino
   oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, or the early universe, where the neutrino fluxes can be extremely high, neutrino-neutrino interactions are appreciable and contribute substantially to their flavor evolution. Such a system of interacting neutrinos can be regarded as a quantum many-body system, and prospects for nontrivial quantum correlations, i.e., entanglement, developing in a gas of interacting neutrinos have been investigated previously. In this work, we uncover an intriguing connection between the entropy of entanglement of individual neutrinos with the rest of the ensemble, and the occurrence of spectral splits in the energy spectra of these neutrinos, which develop as a result of collective neutrino oscillations. In particular, for various types of neutrino spectra, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy is highest for the neutrinos whose locations in the energy spectrum are closest to the spectral split(s). This trend demonstrates that the quantum entanglement is strongest among the neutrinos that are close to these splits, a behavior that seems to persist even as the size of the many-body system is increased.

TI Complete Incompatibility, Support Uncertainty, and Kirkwood-Dirac
   Nonclassicality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB For quantum systems with a finite dimensional Hilbert space of states, we show that the complete incompatibility of two observables-a notion we introduce-is equivalent to the large support uncertainty of all states. The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution of a state-which depends on the choice of two observables-has emerged in quantum information theory as a tool for assessing nonclassical features of the state that can serve as a resource in quantum protocols. We apply our result to show that, when the two observables are completely incompatible, only states with minimal support uncertainty can be KD classical, all others being KD nonclassical. We illustrate our findings with examples.

TI Exploring graph cuts in quantum approximate optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Graph cut, a combinatorial optimization, is explored in quantum computing, seeking optimal bi-partitions of a directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted graph. The cut models, such as max-cut and min-cut, are applied in domains including VLSI design, circuit partitioning, data clustering, and network analysis. This paper explores the Ising modeling of max-cut and min-cut in a Laplacian-based QAOA, including benchmarking, spectral analysis, and a detailed analysis of the results. It aims to discover how Ising cut modeling and QAOA perform on a structured graph class, such as a weighted chordal graph. Chordal graphs offer decomposition properties favorable to QUBO and Ising models. Experimental results show that the proposed QAOA framework yields optimal or near-optimal cut values with high and stable approximation ratios across circuit depths. Also, hardware-aware considerations are introduced through superconducting qubit layout design and eigenmode simulations in Qiskit Metal and Ansys EPR HFSS. Further analysis reveals challenges related to convergence and performance in denser topologies. The study gives the modeling and the comprehensive evaluation of QAOA for graph-cuts, including a conceptual hardware-aware analysis.

TI FPGA-Based Distributed Union-Find Decoder for Surface Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB A fault-tolerant quantum computer must decode and correct errors faster than they appea rto prevent exponential slowdown due to error correction. The Union-Find (UF) decoder is promising with an average time complexity slightly higher thanO(d(3)). We report a distributed version of the UF decoder that exploits parallel computing resources for further speedup. Using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementation, we empirically show that this distributed UF decoder has a sublinear average time complexity with regard tod, given O(d(3)) parallel computing resources. The decoding time per measurement round decreases as d increases, the first time for a quantum error decoder. The implementation employs a scalable architecture called Helios that organizes parallel computing resources into a hybrid tree-grid structure. Using a Xilinx VCU129 FPGA, we successfully implement d up to 21 with an average decoding time of 11.5 ns per measurement round under 0.1% phenomenological noise and 23.7 ns ford=17 under equivalent circuit-level noise. This performance is significantly faster than any existing decoder implementation. Furthermore, we show that Helios can optimize for resource efficiency by decoding d =51on a Xilinx VCU129 FPGA with an average latency of 544 ns per measurement round

TI Phonon-coupled hole-spin qubits in high-purity germanium: design and
   modeling of a scalable architecture
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a design and modeling of a scalable quantum processor architecture utilizing hole-spin qubits defined in gate-controlled germanium (Ge) quantum dots, where coherent spin-phonon coupling is predicted to facilitate qubit manipulation and long-range interactions. The architecture exploits the strong, electrically tunable spin-orbit interactions intrinsic to hole states in Ge, integrated with high-quality phononic crystal cavities to enable fully electrical qubit control and phonon-mediated coupling. Employing a streamlined simulation framework built upon multiband k & sdot;p modeling and finite-element methods, we quantify key performance metrics, including electrically tunable g-factors ranging from 1.3 to 2.0, spin-phonon coupling strengths up to 6.3MHz, phononic cavity quality factors exceeding 104, and phonon-mediated spin relaxation times (T1) reaching milliseconds. The proposed architecture concurrently achieves extended spin coherence and rapid gate operations through strategic electric field modulation and engineered phononic bandgap environments. Furthermore, isotopically enriched, high-purity Ge crystals significantly enhance device coherence by minimizing disorder and hyperfine interactions. This integrated approach, merging advanced materials engineering, precise spin-orbit coupling, and phononic cavity design, establishes a promising complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible pathway toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computing.

TI Quantum Approximate Bayesian Optimization Algorithms With Two Mixers and
   Uncertainty Quantification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The searching efficiency of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm is dependent on both the classical and quantum sides of the algorithm. Recently, a quantum approximate Bayesian optimization algorithm (QABOA) that includes two mixers was developed, where surrogate-based Bayesian optimization is applied to improve the sampling efficiency of the classical optimizer. A continuous-time quantum walk mixer is used to enhance exploration, and the generalized Grover mixer is also applied to improve exploitation. In this article, an extension of the QABOA is proposed to further improve its searching efficiency. The searching efficiency is enhanced through two aspects. First, two mixers, including one for exploration and the other for exploitation, are applied in an alternating fashion. Second, uncertainty of the quantum circuit is quantified with a new quantum Mat & eacute;rn kernel based on the kurtosis of the basis state distribution, which increases the chance of obtaining the optimum. The proposed new two-mixer QABOA's with and without uncertainty quantification are compared with three single-mixer QABOA's on five discrete and four mixed-integer problems. The results show that the proposed two-mixer QABOA with uncertainty quantification has the best performance in efficiency and consistency for five out of the nine tested problems. The results also show that QABOA with the generalized Grover mixer performs the best among the single-mixer algorithms, thereby demonstrating the benefit of exploitation and the importance of dynamic exploration-exploitation balance in improving searching efficiency.

TI A Scalable Fully Distributed Quantum Alternating Direction Method of
   Multipliers for Unit Commitment Problems
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The unit commitment problem (UCP) is a non-convex mixed-integer programming issue that is crucial in the power system. The quantum alternating direction method of multipliers (QADMM) decompose the UCP into quadratic binary optimization (QBO) subproblems and continuous optimization subproblems. Relaxing constraints reformulate the QBO into a quadratic unconstrainted binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which can be addressed using quantum algorithms. Nevertheless, this approach lacks precision for hard constraints and requires more qubits, limiting the UCP scale addressed within QADMM. To confront the aforementioned challenges, this study introduces the consensus constraint-encoded divide-and-conquer QADMM (CCDC-QADMM). As a scalable fully distributed algorithm, CCDC-QADMM decomposes the UCP into two subproblems: Subproblem 1, a QUBO problem embedded with minimum up/down constraints, and Subproblem 2, a UC problem without minimum up/down constraints. By employing variable duplication for decoupling and leveraging the principles of average consensus, CCDC-QADMM achieves fully distributed computation. Specifically, in the QUBO subproblem 1, this algorithm encodes minimum up/down constraints into a hard constraint form within the mixing Hamiltonian. Simultaneously, it employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to accommodate the current constraints posed by the limited qubit resources. The effectiveness and scalability of this algorithm are substantiated through practical validation within real-world UCP scenarios.
   This paper introduces the consensus constraint-encoded divide-and-conquer quantum alternating direction method of multipliers (CCDC-QADMM), a scalable fully distributed algorithm for solving the unit commitment problem (UCP) with minimum up/down constraints. By efficiently encoding hard constraints and utilizing quantum principles, the algorithm demonstrates effectiveness and scalability across various UCP scenarios, advancing quantum computing applications in power system optimization. image

TI Nonlocal coherence harvesting from quantum vacuum
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB It is well known that nonlocal coherence reflects nonclassical correlations better than quantum entanglement. Here, we analyze nonlocal coherence harvesting from the quantum vacuum to particle detectors adiabatically interacting with a quantum scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. We find that the harvesting-achievable separation range of nonlocal coherence is larger than that of quantum entanglement. As the energy gap grows sufficiently large, the detectors harvest less quantum coherence, while the detectors could extract more quantum entanglement from the vacuum state. Compared with the linear configuration and the scalene configuration, we should choose the model of equilateral triangle configuration to harvest tripartite coherence from the vacuum. Finally, we find a monogamous relationship, which means that tripartite l1-norm of coherence is essentially bipartite types.

TI Recycling qubits for the generation of Bell nonlocality between
   independent sequential observers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB There is currently much interest in the recycling of entangled systems, for use in quantum information protocols by sequential observers. In this work, we study the sequential generation of Bell nonlocality via recycling one or both components of two-qubit states. We first give a description of two-valued qubit measurements in terms of measurement bias, strength, and reversibility, and derive useful tradeoff relations between them. Then, we derive one-sided monogamy relations for unbiased observables that strengthen the recent conjecture by Cheng et al. [Phys. Rev. A 104, L060201 (2021)] that if the first pair of observers violate Bell nonlocality then a subsequent independent pair cannot, and give semianalytic results for the best possible monogamy relation. We also extend the construction by Brown and Colbeck [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 090401 (2020)] to obtain (i) a broader class of two-qubit states that allow the recycling of one qubit by a given number of observers on one side and (ii) a scheme for generating Bell nonlocality between arbitrarily many independent observers on each side, via the two-sided recycling of multiqubit states. Our results are based on a formalism that is applicable to more general problems in recycling entanglement and hence is expected to aid progress in this field.

TI On the independence heuristic in the dual attack
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB Post-quantum cryptography deals with the development and analysis of cryptographic schemes that are assumed to be secure even against attackers with access to a powerful quantum computer. Along the main candidates for quantum-safe solutions are cryptographic schemes, whose security is based on classic lattice problems such as the bounded-distance decoding (BDD) problem or the learning with error problem. In this work, we contribute to the analysis of an attack category against these problems called dual attack. In recent years, a lot of notable progress was achieved in this topic. Our first contribution is to provide theoretical counterarguments against a so-called independence assumption, which was used in earlier works on this attack, and which was shown in a previous work to be contradicting practical experiments. Then, we provide estimates on the success probability and the cost of the dual attack against the decisional version of the BDD problem. These estimates are derived both rigorously and heuristically. Finally, we also provide experimental evidence that confirms these results.

TI Solving the Hubbard model using density matrix embedding theory and the
   variational quantum eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Calculating the ground state properties of a Hamiltonian can be mapped to the problem of finding the ground state of a smaller Hamiltonian through the use of embedding methods. These embedding techniques have the ability to drastically reduce the problem size, and hence the number of qubits required when running on a quantum computer. However, the embedding process can produce a relatively complicated Hamiltonian, leading to a more complex quantum algorithm. In this paper we carry out a detailed study into how density matrix embedding theory (DMET) could be implemented on a quantum computer to solve the Hubbard model. We consider the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) as the solver for the embedded Hamiltonian within the DMET algorithm. We derive the exact form of the embedded Hamiltonian and use it to construct efficient ansatz circuits and measurement schemes. We conduct detailed numerical simulations up to 16 qubits, the largest to date, for a range of Hubbard model parameters and find that the combination of DMET and VQE is effective for reproducing ground state properties of the model.

TI Phase-Sensitive Quantum Measurement without Controlled Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Many quantum algorithms rely on the measurement of complex quantum amplitudes. Standard approaches to obtain the phase information, such as the Hadamard test, give rise to large overheads due to the need for global controlled-unitary operations. We introduce a quantum algorithm based on complex analysis that overcomes this problem for amplitudes that are a continuous function of time. Our method only requires the implementation of real-time evolution and a shallow circuit that approximates a short imaginary-time evolution. We show that the method outperforms the Hadamard test in terms of circuit depth and that it is suitable for current noisy quantum computers when combined with a simple errormitigation strategy.

TI Quantum Simulation of Fractal Fracture in Amorphous Silica
SO MATERIALS
AB In order to design new materials at atomic-length scales, there is a need to connect the fractal nature of fracture surfaces at the atomic scale using quantum mechanics modeling with that of the experimental data of fracture surfaces at macroscopic-length scales. We use a semi-empirical quantum mechanics simulation of fracture in amorphous silica to calculate a parameter identified as a critical characteristic length, a0, which has been experimentally derived from the fractal nature of fracture for many materials that fail in a brittle matter. To our knowledge, there are no known simulation models other than our related research that use the fractal parameter a0 to describe the fractal fracture of the fracture surface using quantum mechanical simulations. We provide evidence that a0 can be calculated at both the atomic and macroscopic scale, making it a fundamental property of the structure and one of the elements of fractal fracture. We use a continuous random network model and reaction coordinate method to simulate fracture. We propose that fracture in amorphous silica occurs due to bond reconfiguration resulting in increased strain volume at the crack tip. We hypothesize two specific configurations leading to fracture from a four-fold ring reconfiguration to three-fold ring or (newly observed) five-fold ring configurations resulting in a change in volume. Finally, we define a reconfiguration fracture energy at the atomic level, which is approximately the value of the experimental fracture surface energy.

TI On hardware acceleration of quantum-resistant FOTA systems in automotive
SO COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB The Firmware Over -The -Air (FOTA) technology aims at updating the firmware of mobile computing devices via wireless. In the automotive industry, FOTA can keep the firmware of the various electronic controllers up-to-date without any manual intervention, so that to improve the operational performance and quickly fix the security vulnerabilities of vehicles. Of course, FOTA must avoid that a malicious party installs vulnerable or backdoored firmware on electronic controllers, which may lead to safety risks for the driver. It follows that a FOTA management system must guarantee the integrity and authenticity of all the firmware updates. While these security requirements are generally guaranteed by means of digital signatures, the advent of quantum computing is making traditional signature schemes increasingly vulnerable. Large-scale quantum computers able to break RSA and ECDSA could appear during the long lifetime of vehicles that are now in production, which can often reach two decades. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the performance from an automotive FOTA perspective of CrystalsDilithium and Falcon, two quantum -resistant lattice -based digital signature schemes that have been selected in 2022 by the NIST Post -Quantum Cryptography standardization process, and that represent the most probable choices for the future security technology. In particular, we evaluate the running time of various cryptographic operations performed by Uptane, which is a standard for automotive FOTA systems by the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization, on three reference hardware architectures representing different classes of electronic control units. By means of experiments we also highlight that the hashing function is the primary limiting factor for the performance of automotive FOTA and, consequently, is the most convenient component to accelerate in hardware to improve FOTA execution time. Finally, we propose a hardware accelerator for SHAKE, the hash function used by both Crystals-Dilithium and Falcon, and experimentally evaluate the performance improvement that it brings about in automotive FOTA operations.

TI Genuine entanglement near multi-event horizon in N-partite system
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields new a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, respectively. We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared by N observers, each located near the BEH and CEH, respectively. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement situated near the BEH can decrease to zero with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. Because the Hawking effect of the black hole located near the CEH is very weak, its impact on quantum entanglement is negligible. In addition, choosing appropriate initial parameters is beneficial to protecting quantum entanglement in multi-event horizon spacetime.

TI Theoretical study of reflection spectroscopy for superconducting quantum
   parametrons
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Superconducting parametrons in the single-photon Kerr regime, also called KPOs, have been attracting increasing attention in terms of their applications to quantum annealing and universal quantum computation. It is of practical importance to obtain information of superconducting parametrons operating under an oscillating pump field. Spectroscopy can provide information of a superconducting parametron under examination, such as energy level structure, and also useful information for calibration of the pump field. We theoretically study the reflection spectroscopy of superconducting parametrons, and develop a method to obtain the reflection coefficient. We present formulae of the reflection coefficient, the nominal external and the internal decay rates, and examine the obtained spectra. It is shown that the difference of the populations of energy levels manifests itself as a dip or peak in the amplitude of the reflection coefficient, and one can directly extract the coupling strength between the energy levels by measuring the nominal decay rates when the pump field is sufficiently large.

TI Quantum enhancement to information acquisition speed
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The speed of the transmission of a physical signal from a sender to a receiver is limited by the speed of light, regardless of the physical system being classical or quantum. In this sense, quantum mechanics can not provide any enhancement of the speed of information transmission. If instead we consider that the information needing to be transmitted is not localized at the sender's location, but dispersed throughout space, spatial coherence might provide some enhancement. In this work, we demonstrate a quantum mechanical advantage in the speed of acquirement and transmission of information globally encoded in space. We present a task for which we prove a quadratic enhancement to the information acquisition speed using quantum information carriers with respect to their classical counterpart. Our findings can naturally be applied in situations where the information source has limited power, i.e. bounded number of signals that can be sent per unit time.

We present here a novel Si quantum device integration that halves the effective gate pitch and provides full controllability in 1D FDSOI QD arrays. The major advantages of this architecture are explored through numerical simulations. Functionality of the fabricated structure is validated via 300K statistical electrical characterization, while tunnel-coupling control is demonstrated at cryogenic temperature.

TI Falcon/Kyber and Dilithium/Kyber Network Stack on Nvidia’s Data
   Processing Unit Platform
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Commercially available quantum computers are expected to reshape the world in the near future. They are said to break conventional cryptographic security mechanisms that are deeply embedded in our today's communication. Symmetric cryptography, such as AES, will withstand quantum attacks as long as the key sizes are doubled compared to today's key lengths. Asymmetric cryptographic procedures, e.g. RSA, however are broken. It is therefore necessary to change the way we assure our privacy by adopting and moving towards post-quantum cryptography (PQC) principles. In this work, we benchmark three PQC algorithms, Falcon, Dilithium, and Kyber. Moreover, we present an implementation of a PQC stack consisting of the algorithms Dilithium/Kyber and Falcon/Kyber which use hardware accelerators for some key functions and evaluate their performance and resource utilization. Regarding a classic server-client model, the computational load of the Dilithium/Kyber stack is distributed more equally among server and client. The stack Falcon/Kyber biases the computational challenges towards the server, hence relieving the client of performing costly operations. We found that Dilithium's advantage over Falcon is that Dilithium's execution is faster while the workload to be performed is distributed equally among client and server, whereas Falcon's advantage over Dilithium lies within the small signature sizes and the unequally distributed computational tasks. In a client server model with a performance limited client (i.e. Internet-of-Things - IoT - environments) Falcon could proof useful for it constrains the computational hard tasks to the server and leaves a minimal workload to the client. Furthermore, Falcon requires smaller bandwidth, making it a strong candidate for deep-edge or IoT applications.

TI Post-Quantum Era Privacy Protection for Intelligent Infrastructures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB As we move into a new decade, the global world of Intelligent Infrastructure (II) services integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT) are at the forefront of technological advancements. With billions of connected devices spanning continents through interconnected networks, security and privacy protection techniques for the emerging II services become a paramount concern. In this paper, an up-to-date privacy method mapping and relevant use cases are surveyed for II services. Particularly, we emphasize on post-quantum cryptography techniques that may (or must when quantum computers become a reality) be used in the future through concrete products, pilots, and projects. The topics presented in this paper are of utmost importance as (1) several recent regulations such as Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have given privacy a significant place in digital society, and (2) the increase of IoT/II applications and digital services with growing data collection capabilities are introducing new threats and risks on citizens' privacy. This in-depth survey begins with an overview of security and privacy threats in IoT/IIs. Next, we summarize some selected Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) suitable for privacy-concerned II services, and then map recent PET schemes based on post-quantum cryptographic primitives which are capable of withstanding quantum computing attacks. This paper also overviews how PETs can be deployed in practical use cases in the scope of IoT/IIs, and maps some current projects, pilots, and products that deal with PETs. A practical case study on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is presented to demonstrate how PETs can be applied in reality. Finally, we discuss the main challenges with respect to current PETs and highlight some future directions for developing their post-quantum counterparts.

TI Almost-linear time decoding algorithm for topological codes
SO QUANTUM
AB In order to build a large scale quantum computer, one must be able to correct errors extremely fast. We design a fast decoding algorithm for topological codes to correct for Pauli errors and erasure and combination of both errors and erasure. Our algorithm has a worst case complexity of O(n alpha(n)), where n is the number of physical qubits and alpha is the inverse of Ackermann's function, which is very slowly growing. For all practical purposes, alpha(n) <= 3. We prove that our algorithm performs optimally for errors of weight up to (d - 1)/2 and for loss of up to d - 1 qubits, where d is the minimum distance of the code. Numerically, we obtain a threshold of 9.9% for the 2d-toric code with perfect syndrome measurements and 2.6% with faulty measurements.

TI Quantum Information Entropy of Hyperbolic Potentials in Fractional
   Schrodinger Equation
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work we have studied the Shannon information entropy for two hyperbolic single-well potentials in the fractional Schrodinger equation (the fractional derivative number (0 < n <= 2) by calculating position and momentum entropy. We find that the wave function will move towards the origin as the fractional derivative number n decreases and the position entropy density becomes more severely localized in more fractional system, i.e., for smaller values of n, but the momentum probability density becomes more delocalized. And then we study the Beckner Bialynicki-Birula-Mycieslki (BBM) inequality and notice that the Shannon entropies still satisfy this inequality for different depth u even though this inequality decreases (or increases) gradually as the depth u of the hyperbolic potential U-1 (or U-2) increases. Finally, we also carry out the Fisher entropy and observe that the Fisher entropy increases as the depth u of the potential wells increases, while the fractional derivative number n decreases.

TI Decoy-State and Purification Protocols for Superior Quantum Key
   Distribution with Imperfect Quantum-Dot-Based Single-Photon Sources:
   Theory and Experiment
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The original proposal of quantum key distribution (QKD) was based on ideal single-photon sources, which, 40 years later, are still challenging to develop. Therefore, the development of decoy-state protocols using weak coherent states (WCS) from lasers set the frontier in terms of secure-key rates and distances. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two simple-to-implement QKD protocols that allow practical far from ideal sub-Poissonian photon sources to outperform state-of-the-art WCS. By engineering the photon statistics of a biexciton-exciton cascade in room-temperature single-photon sources based on giant colloidal quantum dots coupled to nanoantennas, we show that either a truncated decoy-state protocol or a heralded-purification protocol can be employed to achieve a significantly increased performance in terms of the maximal allowed channel loss for secure-key creation, which can exceed even that of ideal WCS by more than 3 dB. We then experimentally emulate a BB84 QKD using such a quantum dot source, verifying the superiority of our protocols over the best possible BB84 WCS performance. These protocols can be utilized efficiently on a host of various quantum emitters having controllable photon statistics with a finite photon-number basis, offering a practical approach to QKD without the hindering requirements on the single-photon purity of the photon source.

TI Sub-Diffraction Photon Trapping: The Possible Optical Energy Eigenstates
   within a Tiny Circular Aperture with a Finite Depth
SO ELECTRONICS
AB One of the challenging riddles that is set by light is: do photons have wavefunctions like other elementary particles do? Wave-particle duality has been a prevailing fact since the beginning of quantum theory thought; in electromagnetism, light is already a kind of undulation, so what about the waves of probability then? Well, Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has a rigorous explanation and supports the idea when they are considered as fields of particles via second quantization; they do have wavefunctions of probability, and it does not have anything to do with the regular oscillations. They can be related to the energy and momentum signatures of harmonic oscillations, resembling an imitation of the behavior of a classical harmonic oscillator, which then has a wavefunction to solve the corresponding time-independent Schrodinger equation. For the last half century, electrical engineering has owned the best out of these implications of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and QFT by engineering better semiconductor techniques with finely miniaturized transistors and composite devices for digital electronics and optoelectronics fields. More importantly, these engineering applications have also greatly evolved into combined fields like quantum computing that have introduced a completely new and extraordinary world to electronics applications. The study takes advantage of the power of QFT to mathematically reveal the bosonic modes (Laguerre-Gaussian) that appear in a sub-diffraction cylindrical aperture. In this way, this may lead to the construction of the techniques and characteristics of room-temperature photonic quantum gates which can isolate photon modes under a diffraction limit.

AB The ability to coherently control and read out qubits is a crucial requirement for any quantum processor. Individual nuclear spins in solid-state systems have been used as long-lived qubits with control and readout performed using individual electron spin ancilla qubits that can be addressed either electrically or optically. Here we present a platform for quantum information processing, consisting of 183W nuclear spin qubits adjacent to an Er3+ impurity in a CaWO4 crystal coupled to a superconducting resonator. We study two nuclear spin qubits with T2*\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${T}_{2}<^>{* }$$\end{document} of 0.8(2) s and 1.2(3) s, and T2 of 3.4(4) s and 4.4(6) s, respectively. The nuclear spin state influences the number of photons emitted after repeated excitation of the Er3+ electron ancilla spin qubit, enabling quantum non-demolition readout using a single microwave photon detector. Using stimulated Raman driving on the coupled electron-nuclear-spin system, we implement all-microwave one- and two-qubit gates on a timescale of a few milliseconds, and prepare a decoherence-protected Bell state. Our results position this platform as a potential route towards quantum processing using nuclear spins.

TI Quantum-Assisted Joint Virtual Network Function Deployment and Maximum
   Flow Routing for Space Information Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Network function virtualization (NFV)-enabled space information network (SIN) has emerged as a promising method to facilitate global coverage and seamless service. This paper proposes a novel NFV-enabled SIN to provide end-to-end communication and computation services for ground users. Based on the multi-functional time expanded graph (MF-TEG), we jointly optimize the user association, virtual network function (VNF) deployment, and flow routing strategy (U-VNF-R) to maximize the total processed data received by users. The original problem is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that is intractable for classical computers. Inspired by quantum computing techniques, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition (HQCBD) algorithm. Specifically, we convert the master problem of the Benders' decomposition into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and solve it with quantum computers. To further accelerate the optimization, we also design a multi-cut strategy based on the quantum advantages in parallel computing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm and U-VNF-R scheme.

TI Fano interference of photon pairs from a metasurface
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Two-photon interference, a quantum phenomenon arising from the principle of indistinguishability, is a powerful tool for quantum state engineering and plays a fundamental role in various quantum technologies. These technologies demand robust and efficient sources of quantum light, as well as scalable, integrable, and multifunctional platforms. In this regard, quantum optical metasurfaces (QOMs) are emerging as promising platforms for the generation and engineering of quantum light, in particular pairs of entangled photons (biphotons) via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Due to the relaxation of the phase-matching condition, SPDC in QOMs allows different channels of biphoton generation, such as those supported by overlapping resonances, to occur simultaneously. In previously reported QOMs, however, SPDC was too weak to observe such effects. Here, we develop QOMs based on [110]-oriented GaAs that provide an order-of-magnitude enhancement in SPDC rate, after accounting for the spectral bandwidth, compared to any other QOMs studied to date. This boosted efficiency allows the QOMs to support the simultaneous generation of SPDC from several spectrally overlapping optical modes. Using a linear polarizer, we intentionally erase the distinguishability between the biphotons from a high-Q quasi-bound-state-in-the-continuum resonance and a low-Q Mie resonance, which results in the first-time observation of two-photon interference, shown in the form of a Fano contour, in the spectrum of biphotons. This quantum interference can enrich the generation of entangled photons in metasurfaces. Their advanced multifunctionality, improved nonlinear response, ease of fabrication, and compact footprint of [110]-GaAs QOMs position them as promising platforms to fulfill the requirements of photonic quantum technologies.

SO COGENT ENGINEERING
AB General methods to quantize combined descriptors of both the probability and phase/current distributions in molecular electronic reference frame transformations to a "superposition of coordinate transformations" have been previously introduced. Quantum gravity Continuity equations are expected to resolve the singularities of classical general relativity for these transformations that have been already explored on an array of recent fundamental observations developed through gravitational amplification of primeval density fluctuations generated in the exceedingly early phase of cosmic evolution. Based on destructive interference of singular spacetime-configurations, I show that higher-order vertical-equilibrium states in curvature terms direct me to resolve black-hole singularities for a vanishing current entanglement in a chemical space both in the spherically symmetric and axisymmetric case. Dynamical mechanisms for singularity-resolution and orbital superpositions are considered observer-dependent features in these quantum reference frames including Galilean transformation, and near-horizon symmetries ranging from supergravity theories to Lorentzian cryptographic signatures to enhance the RoccuffirnaTM's gravity to trap the SARS-COV-2 viruses in practice. The corresponding stationary radial Schrodinger equations with these potential energy functions are solved analytically, in the underlying information continuity equation that determines machine learning characteristics for both Euclidean and Lorentzian signatures to Quantum microBlackHole-Inspired Kerr- (A) dS-Myers-Perry black Gravitational in an approximate scheme for zero total angular momentum. It is also found that the wave functions for bound states can be expressed in terms of the Jacoby polynomial involving either the nonclassical or resultant entropy/information concepts the so called horizontal-equilibrium state, that represents the phase-transformed quantum state of a molecule, corresponding to the optimum, density-dependent "thermodynamic" phase in the near-horizon limit, with either SL(2, R) or Poincare iso(1, 1) symmetry as extended to the entire near-horizon geometry. In this paper, I propose an implementation of the algorithm for the Quantum Inspired blAckhole ProductS of TaylOr Fast FourIer transforMatIons (QubAPSOFFiMi) as a quantum circuit consisting of a combination of some Lorentzian signature quantum gates. In my implementation, a data sequence is expressed by a tensor product of vector spaces. Namely, my QFFT is defined as a transformation of the tensor product of stationary radial Schrodinger equations with these potential energy functions of quantum states. It is essentially different from the so-called quantum Fourier transform (QFT) defined to be a horizontal-equilibrium state of linear transformation of the amplitudes for the superposition of quantum states. The quantum circuit for the (QubAPSOFFiMi) consists of several circuits for elementary arithmetic operations such as a quantum adder, subtractor and shift operations, which are implemented as effectively as possible. These analytical expressions for purely vibrational energy levels of the electronic state, without an accompanying change of quantum observables, preserves the electron probability distribution and modifies its current by varying the moduli to a weakly-coupled description of a pharmacophoric system, where states with fixed conserved charge charges can be electronically counted.
   The influence of the continuity chemical relations between equilibrium-phase gravitational transformation, quantum phase density, and local entropy formalism productions are examined here towards Black-Hole Singularity-Mass Schrodinger Equations in a Quantum Kerr- (A) Ds Galilean Myers-Perr driven Lorentzian Gravitational Path for the anti-COVID-19 RoccuffirnaTM and EplerotiffirnaTM molecular equilibrium states in regular blackhole spacetimes.

AB To make progress in science, we often build abstract representations of physical systems that meaningfully encode information about the systems. Such representations ignore redundant features and treat parameters such as velocity and position separately because they can be useful for making statements about different experimental settings. Here, we capture this notion by formally defining the concept of operationally meaningful representations. We present an autoencoder architecture with attention mechanism that can generate such representations and demonstrate it on examples involving both classical and quantum physics. For instance, our architecture finds a compact representation of an arbitrary two-qubit system that separates local parameters from parameters describing quantum correlations.

TI Error-Corrected Fermionic Quantum Processors with Neutral Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Many-body fermionic systems can be simulated in a hardware-efficient manner using a fermionic quantum processor. Neutral atoms trapped in optical potentials can realize such processors, where nonlocal fermionic statistics are guaranteed at the hardware level. Implementing quantum error correction in this setup is, however, challenging, due to the atom-number superselection present in atomic systems, that is, the impossibility of creating coherent superpositions of different particle numbers. In this Letter, we overcome this constraint and present a blueprint for an error-corrected fermionic quantum processor that can be implemented using current experimental capabilities. To achieve this, we first consider an ancillary set of fermionic modes and design a fermionic reference, which we then use to construct superpositions of different numbers of referenced fermions. This allows us to build logical fermionic modes that can be error corrected using standard atomic operations. Here, we focus on phase errors, which we expect to be a dominant source of errors in neutral-atom quantum processors. We then construct logical fermionic gates, and show their implementation for the logical particle-number conserving processes relevant for quantum simulation. Finally, our protocol is illustrated with a minimal fermionic circuit, where it leads to a quadratic suppression of the logical error rate.

TI Annihilating Entanglement Between Cones
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Every multipartite entangled quantum state becomes fully separable after an entanglement breaking quantum channel acted locally on each of its subsystems. Whether there are other quantum channels with this property has been an open problem with important implications for entanglement theory (e.g., for the distillation problem and the PPT squared conjecture). We cast this problem in the general setting of proper convex cones in finite-dimensional vector spaces. The max-entanglement annihilating maps transform the k-fold maximal tensor product of a cone C-1 into the k-fold minimal tensor product of a cone C-2, and the pair (C-1, C-2) is called resilient if all max-entanglement annihilating maps are entanglement breaking. Our main result is that (C-1, C-2) is resilient if either C-1 or C-2 is a Lorentz cone. Our proof exploits the symmetries of the Lorentz cones and applies two constructions resembling protocols for entanglement distillation: As a warm-up, we use the multiplication tensors of real composition algebras to construct a finite family of generalized distillation protocols for Lorentz cones, containing the distillation protocol for entangled qubit states by Bennett et al. (Phys Rev Lett 76(5):722, 1996) as a special case. Then, we construct an infinite family of protocols using solutions to the Hurwitz matrix equations. After proving these results, we focus on maps between cones of positive semidefinite matrices, where we derive necessary conditions for max-entanglement annihilation similar to the reduction criterion in entanglement distillation. Finally, we apply results from the theory of Banach space tensor norms to show that the Lorentz cones are the only cones with a symmetric base for which a certain stronger version of the resilience property is satisfied.

TI Dependence of integrated, instantaneous, and fluctuating entropy
   production on the initial state in quantum and classical processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We consider the additional entropy production (EP) incurred by a fixed quantum or classical process on some initial state p, above the minimum EP incurred by the same process on any initial state. We show that this additional EP, which we term the "mismatch cost of p," has a universal information-theoretic form: it is given by the contraction of the relative entropy between p and the least-dissipative initial state yo over time. We derive versions of this result for integrated EP incurred over the course of a process, for trajectory-level fluctuating EP, and for instantaneous EP rate. We also show that mismatch cost for fluctuating EP obeys an integral fluctuation theorem. Our results demonstrate a fundamental relationship between thermodynamic irreversibility (generation of EP) and logical irreversibility (inability to know the initial state corresponding to a given final state). We use this relationship to derive quantitative bounds on the thermodynamics of quantum error correction and to propose a thermodynamically operationalized measure of the logical irreversibility of a quantum channel. Our results hold for both finite- and infinite-dimensional systems, and generalize beyond EP to many other thermodynamic costs, including nonadiabatic EP, free-energy loss, and entropy gain.

TI Quantum Machine-Based Decision Support System for the Detection of
   Schizophrenia from EEG Records
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Schizophrenia is a serious chronic mental disorder that significantly affects daily life. Electroencephalography (EEG), a method used to measure mental activities in the brain, is among the techniques employed in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The symptoms of the disease typically begin in childhood and become more pronounced as one grows older. However, it can be managed with specific treatments. Computer-aided methods can be used to achieve an early diagnosis of this illness. In this study, various machine learning algorithms and the emerging technology of quantum-based machine learning algorithm were used to detect schizophrenia using EEG signals. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was applied to process the obtained data in quantum systems. The data, which were reduced in dimensionality, were transformed into qubit form using various feature maps and provided as input to the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm. Thus, the QSVM algorithm was applied using different qubit numbers and different circuits in addition to classical machine learning algorithms. All analyses were conducted in the simulator environment of the IBM Quantum Platform. In the classification of this EEG dataset, it is evident that the QSVM algorithm demonstrated superior performance with a 100% success rate when using Pauli X and Pauli Z feature maps.

TI Adiabatic quantum linear regression
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A major challenge in machine learning is the computational expense of training these models. Model training can be viewed as a form of optimization used to fit a machine learning model to a set of data, which can take up significant amount of time on classical computers. Adiabatic quantum computers have been shown to excel at solving optimization problems, and therefore, we believe, present a promising alternative to improve machine learning training times. In this paper, we present an adiabatic quantum computing approach for training a linear regression model. In order to do this, we formulate the regression problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. We analyze our quantum approach theoretically, test it on the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer and compare its performance to a classical approach that uses the Scikit-learn library in Python. Our analysis shows that the quantum approach attains up to 2.8 x speedup over the classical approach on larger datasets, and performs at par with the classical approach on the regression error metric. The quantum approach used the D-Wave 2000Q adiabatic quantum computer, whereas the classical approach used a desktop workstation with an 8-core Intel i9 processor. As such, the results obtained in this work must be interpreted within the context of the specific hardware and software implementations of these machines.

TI Non-Gaussian Quantum States and Where to Find Them
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Gaussian states have played an important role in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In this Tutorial, we provide a roadmap for the physics of non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a framework to describe the different properties of quantum states in continuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to explore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states can be characterized not only through the negative values of their Wigner function, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the related stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with the question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum correlations. To answer this question, we first show how non-Gaussian states can be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian state. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via specific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum non-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand, non-Gaussian operations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations. Finally, we demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate Bell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end of the Tutorial, we also provide an overview of several experimental realizations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond.

TI Quantum Subspace Verification for Error Correction Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction is pivotal in advancing toward large-scale quantum computation, and efficient verification is crucial for ensuring the high fidelity of code states. Traditional methodologies, such as state tomography, direct fidelity estimation, and state verification, either fall short in measurement efficiency, especially for large-scale systems, or are restricted to some specific states. In this work, we introduce a general framework for quantum subspace verification, enabling efficient and measurement-noise-robust fidelity estimation between a given state and the target subspace with a specified confidence level. By integrating the proposed subspace verification with direct fidelity estimation, we develop a composite protocol that significantly improves the efficiency of verifying the fidelity of general magic logical states, as demonstrated by intuitive numerical results. This improvement stems from the use of subspace verification, which leverages the knowledge of code subspaces to significantly reduce measurement costs. Additionally, we detail the construction of verification operators for typical error correction codes, including general stabilizer codes and quantum low-density parity-check codes, enabling their efficient implementation using practical local measurements. Notably, for certain codes, such as the Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes and quantum low-density parity-check stabilizer codes, we reduce the number of required measurement settings and sample complexity to a constant level using graphical methods. Our approach facilitates efficient and feasible verification of error correction codes and generic magic logical states, advancing their practical implementations on quantum platforms.

TI Entanglement signature in quantum work statistics in the slow-driving
   regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In slowly driven classical systems, work is a stochastic quantity and its probability distribution is known to satisfy the work fluctuation-dissipation relation, which states that the mean and variance of the dissipated work are linearly related. Recently, it was shown that generation of quantum coherence in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis leads to a correction to this linear relation in the slow-driving regime. Here, we go even further by investigating nonclassical features of work fluctuations in setups with more than one system. To do this, we first generalize slow control protocols to encompass multipartite systems, allowing for the generation of quantum correlations during the driving process. Then, focusing on two-qubit systems, we show that entanglement generation leads to a positive contribution to the dissipated work, which is distinct from the quantum correction due to local coherence generation known from previous work. Our results show that entanglement generated during slow control protocols, e.g., as an unavoidable consequence of qubit crosstalk, comes at the cost of increased dissipation.

TI Error mitigation of BQP computations using measurement-based
   verification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a modular error mitigation protocol for running bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) computations on a quantum computer with time-dependent noise. Utilizing existing tools from quantum verification and measurement-based quantum computation, our protocol interleaves standard computation rounds alongside test rounds for noise sampling and inherits an exponential bound (in the number of circuit runs) on the probability that a returned classical output is correct. We introduce a postselection technique called basketing to address time-dependent noise and reduce overhead. The result is an error mitigation protocol which requires minimal noise assumptions, making it straightforwardly implementable on existing, noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We perform a demonstration of the protocol using classical noisy simulation, presenting a universal measurement pattern which directly maps to (and can be tiled on) the heavy-hex layout of current IBM hardware.

We explore the sum uncertainty relations for arbitrary N mutually noncommutative observables based on (alpha,beta,gamma) WWYD skew information. A series of uncertainty inequalities are derived. We show by detailed example that our results cover and improve the previous ones based on the original Wigner-Yanase (WY) skew information. Finally, we establish new sum uncertainty relations in terms of the (alpha,beta,gamma) MWWYD skew information for arbitrary N quantum channels.

TI Construction of Metaplectic Representations of
   SL2(Z2n) nd Twisted Magnetic Translations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Unitary metaplectic representations of the group SL2(Z(2)n) are necessary to describe the time evolution of 2(n)-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving n qubits. It is shown that in order for the metaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved n-qubit Hilbert spaces, from 2(n) to 2(2n), is necessary. Thus we construct the general matrix form of such representations based on the magnetic translations of the diagonal subgroup HW2n circle times HW2n. Comparisson with other approaches on this problem of the literature are discussed.

TI Super-Poissonian Light Statistics from Individual Silicon Vacancy
   Centers Coupled to a Laser-Written Diamond Waveguide
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Modifying light fields at the single-photon level is a key challenge for upcoming quantum technologies and can be realized in a scalable manner through integrated quantum photonics. Laser-written diamond photonics offers 3D fabrication capabilities and large mode-field diameters matched to fiber optic technology, though limiting the cooperativity at the single-emitter level. To realize large coupling efficiencies, we combine excitation of single shallow-implanted silicon vacancy centers via high numerical aperture optics with detection assisted by laser-written type-II waveguides. We demonstrate single-emitter extinction measurements with a cooperativity of 0.0050 and a relative beta factor of 13%. The transmission of resonant photons reveals single-photon subtraction from a quasi-coherent field resulting in super-Poissonian light statistics. Our architecture enables light field engineering in an integrated design on the single quantum level although the intrinsic cooperativity is low. Laser-written structures can be fabricated in three dimensions and with a natural connectivity to optical fiber arrays.

TI Waveguide-integrated silicon T centres
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The performance of modular, networked quantum technologies will be strongly dependent upon the quality of their quantum light-matter interconnects. Solid-state colour centres, and in particular T centres in silicon, offer competitive technological and commercial advantages as the basis for quantum networking technologies and distributed quantum computing. These newly rediscovered silicon defects offer direct telecommunications-band photonic emission, long-lived electron and nuclear spin qubits, and proven native integration into industry-standard, CMOS-compatible, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic chips at scale. Here we demonstrate further levels of integration by characterizing T centre spin ensembles in single-mode waveguides in SOI. In addition to measuring long spin T1 times, we report on the integrated centres' optical properties. We find that the narrow homogeneous linewidth of these waveguide-integrated emitters is already sufficiently low to predict the future success of remote spin-entangling protocols with only modest cavity Purcell enhancements. We show that further improvements may still be possible by measuring nearly lifetime-limited homogeneous linewidths in isotopically pure bulk crystals. In each case the measured linewidths are more than an order of magnitude lower than previously reported and further support the view that high-performance, large-scale distributed quantum technologies based upon T centres in silicon may be attainable in the near term.

TI Feasible time-bin entanglement purification based on sum-frequency
   generation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB High quality time-bin entanglement is widely exploited to achieve the purposes of fundamental tests of physics and the implementation of quantum communication protocols both in free space and optical fiber propagation. However, the imperfect approaches of generating time-bin entangled state will degrade its quality and limit its practical application. Entanglement purification is to distill high quality entangled states from low quality entangled states. In this paper, we present the first entanglement purification protocol (EPP) for time-bin entanglement. We first explain this EPP for two-photon time-bin entangled state and then extend it to the system of multi-photon time-bin entangled state. We also design a possible realization of this EPP with practical spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) source. Differ from the conventional EPPs, this EPP does not require the sophisticated controlled-not (CNOT) gate or similar operations, and it uses the feasible sum-frequency generation (SFG) to perform the purification. Moreover, the double-pair noise emitted from the SPDC source can be eliminated automatically which is the other advantage of this EPP. If we combine with the faithful entanglement swapping, this EPP may have potential to be a part of full quantum repeaters.

TI Quantifying Entanglement with Coherence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantifying entanglement is a work in progress which is important for the active field of quantum information and computation. A measure of bipartite pure state entanglement is proposed here, named entanglement coherence, which is essentially the normalized coherence of the entangled state in its Schmidt basis. Its value is 1 for maximally entangled states, and 0 for separable states, irrespective of the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. So a maximally entangled state is also the one which is maximally coherent in its Schmidt basis. Quantum entanglement and quantum coherence are thus intimately connected. Entanglement coherence turns out to be closely related to the unified entropy of the reduced state of one of the subsystems. Additionally it is shown that the entanglement coherence is closely connected to the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the reduced density operator of one of the subsystems, in an interesting way.

TI Tomography of Parametrized Quantum States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Characterizing quantum systems is a fundamental task that enables the development of quantum technologies. Various approaches, ranging from full tomography to instances of classical shadows, have been proposed to this end. However, quantum states that are being prepared in practice often involve families of quantum states characterized by continuous parameters, such as the time evolution of a quantum state. In this work, we extend the foundations of quantum state tomography to parametrized quantum states. We introduce a framework that unifies different notions of tomography and use it to establish a natural figure of merit for tomography of parametrized quantum states. Building on this, we provide an explicit algorithm that combines signal processing techniques with a tomography scheme to recover an approximation to the parametrized quantum state equipped with explicit guarantees. Our algorithm uses techniques from compressed sensing to exploit structure in the parameter dependence and operates with a "plug-and-play" nature, using the underlying tomography scheme as a black box. In an analogous fashion, we derive a figure of merit that applies to parametrized quantum channels. Substituting the state tomography scheme with a scheme for process tomography in our algorithm, we then obtain a protocol for tomography of parametrized quantum channels. We showcase our algorithm with two examples of shadow tomography of states time evolved under an NMR Hamiltonian and a free-fermionic Hamiltonian.

TI Optimizing quantum heuristics with meta-learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Variational quantum algorithms, a class of quantum heuristics, are promising candidates for the demonstration of useful quantum computation. Finding the best way to amplify the performance of these methods on hardware is an important task. Here, we evaluate the optimization of quantum heuristics with an existing class of techniques called "meta-learners." We compare the performance of a meta-learner to evolutionary strategies, L-BFGS-B and Nelder-Mead approaches, for two quantum heuristics (quantum alternating operator ansatz and variational quantum eigensolver), on three problems, in three simulation environments. We show that the meta-learner comes near to the global optima more frequently than all other optimizers we tested in a noisy parameter setting environment. We also find that the meta-learner is generally more resistant to noise, for example, seeing a smaller reduction in performance in Noisy and Sampling environments, and performs better on average by a "gain" metric than its closest comparable competitor L-BFGS-B. Finally, we present evidence that indicates the meta-learner trained on small problems will generalize to larger problems. These results are an important indication that meta-learning and associated machine learning methods will be integral to the useful application of noisy near-term quantum computers.

For a nitrogen-vacancy center spin strongly coupled to a mechanical resonator via the second-order magnetic gradient, we show that the qubit driving can lead to the implementation of the two-phonon blockade, while the usual mechanical driving only allows for the appearance of a single-phonon blockade. As a signature, we investigate three-phonon antibunching with a simultaneous two-phonon bunching process by numerically calculating the second-order and third-order correlation functions. We also analyze in detail the influence of the system parameters (including the qubit driving strength, the dephasing rate of the qubit, as well as the thermal phonon number) on the quality of the two-phonon blockade effect. Our work provides an alternative method for extending the concept of a phonon blockade from a single phonon to multiphonon. It is of direct relevance for the engineering of multiphonon quantum coherent devices and thus has potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Microwave-Enabled Two-Step Scheme for Continuous Variable Quantum
   Communications in Integrated Superconducting
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is convenient for the direct transmission of secure messages without requiring a prior key exchange by two participants, offering an elegant advantage in transmission security. The traditional implementations usually focus on the discrete-variable (DV) system, whereas its continuous-variable (CV) counterpart has attracted much attention due to its compatibility with existing optical infrastructure. In order to address its practical deployment in harsh environments, we propose a microwave-based scheme for the CV-QSDC that leverages entangled microwave quantum states through free-space channels in cryogenic environments. The two-step scheme is designed for the secure direct communication, where the classical messages can be encoded by using Gaussian modulation and then transmitted via displacement operations on microwave quantum states. The data processing procedures involve microwave entangled state generation, channel detection, parameter estimation, and so on. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the microwave-based CV-QSDC, highlighting its potential for secure communication in integrated superconducting and solid-state quantum technologies.

TI Parallel Implementation of CNOTN and
   C2NOT2 Gates via Homonuclear and Heteronuclear
   Förster Interactions of Rydberg Atoms
SO PHOTONICS
AB We analyze schemes of high-fidelity multi-qubit CNOTN and C2NOT2 gates for alkali metal neutral atoms used as qubits. These schemes are based on the electromagnetically induced transparency and Rydberg blockade. The fidelity of homonuclear multi-qubit CNOTN gate based on Rydberg blockade was limited by the undesirable interaction between the target atoms and by the coupling laser intensity. We propose overcoming these limits by using strong heteronuclear dipole-dipole interactions via F & ouml;rster resonances for control and target atoms, while the target atoms are coupled by a weaker van der Waals interaction. We optimized the gate performance in order to achieve higher fidelity, while keeping the coupling laser intensity as small as possible in order to improve the experimental feasibility of the gate schemes. We also considered the optimization of the schemes of the C2NOT2 gates, where the fidelity is affected by the relation between the control-control, control-target and target-target interaction energies. Our numeric simulations confirm that the fidelity of the CNOT4 gate (single control and four target atoms) can be up to 99.3% and the fidelity of the C2NOT2 (two control and two target atoms) is up to 99.7% for the conditions which are experimentally feasible.

TI Multi-exponential error extrapolation and combining error mitigation
   techniques for NISQ applications
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Noise in quantum hardware remains the biggest roadblock for the implementation of quantum computers. To fight the noise in the practical application of near-term quantum computers, instead of relying on quantum error correction which requires large qubit overhead, we turn to quantum error mitigation, in which we make use of extra measurements. Error extrapolation is an error mitigation technique that has been successfully implemented experimentally. Numerical simulation and heuristic arguments have indicated that exponential curves are effective for extrapolation in the large circuit limit with an expected circuit error count around unity. In this Article, we extend this to multi-exponential error extrapolation and provide more rigorous proof for its effectiveness under Pauli noise. This is further validated via our numerical simulations, showing orders of magnitude improvements in the estimation accuracy over single-exponential extrapolation. Moreover, we develop methods to combine error extrapolation with two other error mitigation techniques: quasi-probability and symmetry verification, through exploiting features of these individual techniques. As shown in our simulation, our combined method can achieve low estimation bias with a sampling cost multiple times smaller than quasi-probability while without needing to be able to adjust the hardware error rate as required in canonical error extrapolation.

TI Microwave and Optical Entanglement for Quantum Transduction with
   Electro-Optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum transduction refers to the coherent conversion between microwave and optical states, which can be achieved by quantum teleportation if given high-fidelity microwave-optical entanglement, namely entanglement-based quantum transduction. Reliable microwave-optical entanglement can be generated using various platforms. In this paper we base the discussion on a piezo-optomechanical system and make the teleportation induced conversion scheme more concrete in the framework of quantum chan-nel theory. By comparing the quantum capacity between the entanglement-based conversion channel and the traditional direct quantum transduction channel, we show that the entanglement-based scheme indeed admits a positive transduction rate when the direct quantum transduction has zero quantum capacity. Given two piezo-optomechanical systems, we also investigate the generation of microwave-microwave entan-glement from entanglement swapping within continuous-variable and discrete-variable settings, showing the potentials of directly connecting microwave quantum processors by microwave-microwave quantum teleportation.

TI Quantum secrecy in thermal states III
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper we expanded the security of a central broadcast protocol using thermal states to the case in which the eavesdropper controls the source. Quantum secrecy in a continuous variable central broadcast scheme is guaranteed by the quantum correlations present in thermal states arising from the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect. This work allows for a method of key exchange in which two parties can agree a key as long as both can detect the same source and they are within the spatial coherence length of the source. This is important because it allows quantum secure key exchange with only minimal changes to existing infrastructure.

TI Conventional photon blockade in the dispersive limit for Tavis-Cummings
   model
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In the dispersive limit, the conventional photon blockade effect cannot be realized due to the absence of photon nonlinearity. We propose a scheme to recover the photon blockade effect of the dispersive Tavis-Cummings model, which makes it possible to realize the conventional photon blockade effect in the dispersive limit. It is shown that both single-photon and two-photon blockade effects can be recovered at appropriate qubit driving strength. The optimal qubit drive strength and cavity field drive detuning are given analytically. All analyses can be verified by numerical simulation, and the strongest photon blockade effect with the largest average photon number can be produced when the single excitation resonance condition is satisfied. Moreover, we find that the achieved two-photon blockade effect is relatively robust to thermal noise. Our proposal is able to obtain single-photon sources with high purity and high brightness and has great potential for applications in quantum communication processing.

TI Quantum spinning photonic circulator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a scheme to realize a four-port quantum optical circulator for critical coupling of a spinning Kerr resonator to two tapered fibers. Its nonreciprocal effect arises from the Fizeau drag induced splitting of the resonance frequencies of the two counter-travelling optical modes. The transmitted photons exhibit direction dependent quantum correlations and nonreciprocal photon blockade occurs for photons transferred between the two fibers. Moreover, the quantum optical circulator is robust against the back scattering induced by intermodal coupling between counter-travelling optical modes. The present quantum optical circulator has significant potential as an elementary cell in chiral quantum information processing without magnetic field.

TI Recycled entanglement detection by arbitrarily many sequential and
   independent pairs of observers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Two spatially separated observers, Alice and Bob, share a bipartite two-qubit entangled state and perform measurements to witness entanglement. After their measurements, they pass their qubits to a subsequent pair of observers who try to perform the same task independently, and so on. Here we ask: what is the maximum number of such pairs that can perform this task successfully? It has previously been conjectured that not more than one pair of observers can detect Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt "Bell-nonlocal" correlations in this setup. We prove that, on the contrary, entanglement can be witnessed by arbitrarily many pairs of observers. The dissimilar nature between entanglement and Bell-nonlocal correlations is therefore uncovered in a rather radical way, when considering sequentially acting pairs of observers. We prove this statement to be true when the initial shared state is any pure entangled state, a class of Bell-nonlocal mixed states, or a class of Bell-local entangled states.

TI Branch-Assisted Sign-Flipping Belief Propagation Decoding for
   Topological Quantum Codes Based on Hypergraph Product Structure
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Topological codes, a kind of quantum error correction code, have been used for current quantum computers due to their local qubit layout and high threshold. With nearly linear complexity, syndrome-based belief propagation (BP) can be considered as a decoding candidate for topological codes. However, such highly degenerate codes will lead to multiple low-weight errors where the syndrome is identical so that the BP decoding is not able to distinguish it, resulting in degradation in performance. In this article, we propose a branch-assisted sign-flipping belief propagation (BSFBP) decoding method for topological codes based on the hypergraph product structure. In our algorithm, we introduce the criteria to enter the new decoding path branched from BP combined with a syndrome residual, which is obtained from the syndrome-pruning process. A sign-flipping process is also conducted to disturb the log-likelihood ratio of the selected variable nodes, which provides diversity in the syndrome residual. Simulation results show that using the proposed BSFBP decoding is able to outperform the BP decoding by about two orders of magnitude.

TI Room-temperature on-chip orbital angular momentum single-photon sources
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB On-chip photon sources carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) are in demand for high-capacity optical information processing in both classical and quantum regimes. However, currently exploited integrated OAM sources have been primarily limited to the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate a room-temperature on-chip integrated OAM source that emits well-collimated single photons, with a single-photon purity of g((2))(0) approximate to 0.22, carrying entangled spin and OAM states and forming two spatially separated entangled radiation channels with different polarization properties. The OAM-encoded single photons are generated by efficiently outcoupling diverging surface plasmon polaritons excited with a deterministically positioned quantum emitter via Archimedean spiral gratings. Our OAM single-photon source platform bridges the gap between conventional OAM manipulation and nonclassical light sources, enabling high-dimensional and large-scale photonic quantum systems for quantum information processing.

TI Deterministic steady-state subradiance within a single-excitation basis
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Subradiance shows promising applications in quantum information, yet its realization remains more challenging than superradiance due to the need to suppress various decay channels. This study introduces a state space within a single-excitation basis with perfect subradiance and genuine multipartite quantum entanglement resources for the all-to-all case. Utilizing the quantum jump operator method, we also provide an analytical derivation of the system's steady final state for any single-excitation initial state. Additionally, we determine the approximate final state in the quasi-all-to-all coupling scenario. As an illustrative example, we evaluate the coupling and dynamical properties of emitters in a photonic crystal slab possessing an ultra-high quality bound state in the continuum, thereby validating the efficacy of our theoretical approach. This theoretical framework facilitates the analytical prediction of dynamics for long-lived multipartite entanglement while elucidating a pathway toward realizing autonomous subradiance in atomic systems.

TI Visibility of noisy quantum dot-based measurements of Majorana qubits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Measurement schemes of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) based on quantum dots (QDs) are of current interest as they provide a scalable platform for topological quantum computation. In a coupled qubit-QD setup we calculate the dependence of the charge of the QD and its differential capacitance on experimentally tunable parameters for both 2-MZM and 4-MZM measurements. We quantify the effect of noise on the measurement visibility by considering 1/f noise in detuning, tunneling amplitudes or phase. We find that on- or close-to-resonance measurements are generally preferable and predict, using conservative noise estimates, that noise coupling to the QDs is not a limitation to high-fidelity measurements of topological qubits.

TI Energy-participation quantization of Josephson circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Superconducting microwave circuits incorporating nonlinear devices, such as Josephson junctions, are a leading platform for emerging quantum technologies. Increasing circuit complexity further requires efficient methods for the calculation and optimization of the spectrum, nonlinear interactions, and dissipation in multi-mode distributed quantum circuits. Here we present a method based on the energy-participation ratio (EPR) of a dissipative or nonlinear element in an electromagnetic mode. The EPR, a number between zero and one, quantifies how much of the mode energy is stored in each element. The EPRs obey universal constraints and are calculated from one electromagnetic-eigenmode simulation. They lead directly to the system quantum Hamiltonian and dissipative parameters. The method provides an intuitive and simple-to-use tool to quantize multi-junction circuits. We experimentally tested this method on a variety of Josephson circuits and demonstrated agreement within several percents for nonlinear couplings and modal Hamiltonian parameters, spanning five orders of magnitude in energy, across a dozen samples.

TI Analytical bounds for dynamic multichannel discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The ability to precisely discriminate multiple quantum channels is fundamental to achieving quantum enhancements in data-readout, target detection, pattern recognition, and more. Optimal discrimination protocols often rely on entanglement shared between an incident probe and a protected idler-mode. While these protocols can be highly advantageous over classical ones, the storage of idler-modes is extremely challenging in practice. In this work, we investigate idler-free block protocols based on the use of multipartite entangled probe states. In particular, we focus on a class of idler-free protocol which uses nondisjoint distributions of multipartite probe states irradiated over multichannels, known as dynamic discrimination protocols. We derive analytical bounds for the average error probability of such protocols in a bosonic Gaussian channel setting, revealing idler-free strategies that display performance close to idler-assistance for powerful, near-term quantum sensing applications.

TI Space-ground QKD network based on a compact payload and
   medium-inclination orbit
SO OPTICA
AB Significant progress has been made in satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD), and urgent follow-up work is to explore the optimal solution for building practical quantum constellations. Here, we demonstrate successful QKD based on the compact terminal on the Tiangong-2 Space Lab and construct a space-ground quantum network among four ground stations. The medium-inclination orbit of Tiangong-2 Space Lab can obtain multiple available passes for the same ground station in one night, increasing the key generation amount directly. Further analysis results show that the medium-inclination orbit and Sun-synchronous orbit can form good complementarity in future quantum constellations. As a comprehensive demonstration, this work takes a step toward cost-effective quantum satellites and provides a perspective for satellite constellation construction with different orbit types.

TI Room-Temperature Generation of Heralded Single Photons on Silicon Chip
   with Switchable Orbital Angular Momentum
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB In quantum optics, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is very promising to achieve high-dimensional quantum states due to the nature of infinite and discrete eigenvalues, which is quantized by the topological charge of l. Here, a heralded single-photon source with switchable OAM modes is proposed and demonstrated on silicon chip. At room temperature, the heralded single photons with 11 OAM modes (l = 2-6, -6 to -1) are successfully generated and switched through thermo-optical effect. It is believed that such an integrated quantum source with multiple OAM modes and operating at room temperature can provide a practical platform for high-dimensional quantum information processing. Moreover, this proposed architecture can also be extended to other material systems to further improve the performance of OAM quantum source.

TI Non-Markovianity criteria for mixtures of noninvertible Pauli dynamical
   maps
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We analyze the connections between the non-Markovianity degree of the most general phase-damping qubit maps and their legitimate mixtures. Using the results for image non-increasing dynamical maps, we formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the Pauli maps to satisfy specific divisibility criteria. Next, we examine how the non-Markovianity properties for (in general noninvertible) Pauli dynamical maps influence the properties of their convex combinations. Our results are illustrated with instructive examples. For P-divisible maps, we propose a legitimate time-local generator whose all decoherence rates are temporarily infinite.

TI Dynamic Josephson-junction metasurfaces for multiplexed control of
   superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Scaling superconducting quantum processors to large qubit counts faces challenges in control-signal delivery, thermal management, and hardware complexity, particularly in achieving microwave signal multiplexing and long-distance quantum information routing at millikelvin temperatures. We propose a space-time modulated Josephson-junction metasurface architecture to generate and multiplex microwave control signals directly at millikelvin temperatures. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the generation of multiple frequency tones with controlled parameters, enabling efficient and scalable qubit control while minimizing thermal loads and wiring overhead. We derive the nonlinear wave equation governing this system, simulate beam steering and frequency conversion, and discuss the feasibility of experimental implementation. These results lay the groundwork for a next-generation cryogenic signal-delivery paradigm that may enable scaling of superconducting quantum processors to thousands of qubits without overwhelming limited dilution-refrigerator cooling power.

TI Steady-entangled-state generation via the cross-Kerr effect in a
   ferrimagnetic crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB For solid-state spin systems, the collective spin motion in a single crystal embodies multiple magnetostatic modes. Recently, it was found that the cross-Kerr interaction between the higher-order magnetostatic mode and the Kittel mode introduces a new operable degree of freedom. In this work we propose a scheme to entangle two magnon modes via the cross-Kerr nonlinearity when the bias field is inhomogeneous and the system is driven. Quantum entanglement persists at the steady state, as demonstrated by numerical results using experimentally feasible parameters. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that entangled states can survive better in the system where self-Kerr and cross-Kerr nonlinearities coexist. Our work provides insights and guidance for designing experiments to observe entanglement between different degrees of freedom within a single ferrimagnetic crystal. Additionally, it may stimulate potential applications in quantum information processing using spintronic devices.

TI Spontaneous Quantum Phase Synchronization in the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg
   Chain System
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum synchronization, characterized by correlated dynamics in coupled quantum systems, is an active field with profound implications for quantum technologies. This work investigates near-perfect spontaneous quantum phase synchronization (QPS) within a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain system, a cornerstone in the study of quantum magnetism, enhancing both fundamental insights and technological prospects. We explore the dependencies of synchronization time on interaction strength and system size. Moreover, our analysis confirms the resilience of QPS against random frequency and interaction fluctuations. Intriguingly, we reveal that dephasing can enhance spontaneous QPS, presenting a paradoxical avenue for synchronization improvement. We demonstrate that QPS can attain Heisenberg-limit precision and discuss practical implementations using superconducting quantum circuits. Our results enrich the understanding of quantum synchronization mechanisms and highlight their potential in enhancing the functionality of quantum systems, essential for both natural and engineered systems.

TI Noise-agnostic quantum error mitigation with data augmented neural
   models
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum error mitigation, a data processing technique for recovering the statistics of target processes from their noisy version, is a crucial task for near-term quantum technologies. Most existing methods require prior knowledge of the noise model or the noise parameters. Deep neural networks have the potential to lift this requirement, but current models require training data produced by ideal processes in the absence of noise. Here we build a neural model that achieves quantum error mitigation without any prior knowledge of the noise and without training on noise-free data. To achieve this feature, we introduce a quantum augmentation technique for error mitigation. Our approach applies to quantum circuits and to the dynamics of many-body and continuous-variable quantum systems, accommodating various types of noise models. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it both on simulated noisy circuits and on real quantum hardware.

TI Entanglement Negativity and Exceptional-Point Signatures in a
   PT-Symmetric Non-Hermitian XY Dimer: Parameter Regimes and
   Directional-Coupler Mapping
SO PHOTONICS
AB We investigate a non-Hermitian two-spin XY model driven by alternating real and imaginary transverse fields and derive an explicit analytic formula for the ground-state entanglement negativity. This provides a systematic analytic characterization of how ground-state entanglement behaves across PT-symmetry breaking in a non-Hermitian spin dimer. In the PT-symmetric regime, the anisotropy gamma enhances entanglement, whereas the real field h0 suppresses it; in the PT-broken regime dominated by phi 3, the negativity decreases monotonically with the imaginary field eta 0. Moreover, the first derivative of the negativity exhibits a cusp-type non-analyticity at the exceptional point (EP), consistent with the ground-state phase boundary and revealing a direct correspondence between entanglement transitions and exceptional-point physics. To facilitate implementation in integrated quantum photonics, we map h0,eta 0,gamma onto the device parameters Delta beta,g,kappa of a PT-symmetric directional coupler and propose a two-qubit quantum state tomography readout based on local Pauli measurements, thereby offering a concrete entanglement-based probe of exceptional-point signatures in a realistic photonic platform. Within this model, we identify parameter regimes for observing this signature: a cusp feature is expected near Delta beta approximate to 0 and g approximate to kappa, which remains observable under small detuning and moderate loss mismatch. These results offer a testable avenue for entanglement-based probing of PT-symmetry breaking and may inform device characterization and quantitative assessment in integrated quantum photonics. These combined advances provide both analytical insight into non-Hermitian entanglement structure and a feasible route toward experimentally diagnosing PT-symmetry breaking using entanglement.

TI An Efficient Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme Based on Restricted Threshold
   Access Structure
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum secret sharing is an important branch of quantum cryptography, and secure multi-party quantum key distribution protocols can be constructed using quantum secret sharing. In this paper, we construct a quantum secret sharing scheme built on a constrained (t, n ) threshold access structure, where n is the number of participants and t is the threshold number of participants and the distributor. Participants from two different sets perform the corresponding phase shift operations on two particles in the GHZ state passed to them, and then t - 1 participants with the distributor can recover the key, where the participant recovering the key measures the particles received by himself and finally obtains the key through the collaboration of the distributors. Security analysis shows that this protocol can be resistant to direct measurement attacks, interception retransmission attacks, and entanglement measurement attacks. This protocol is more secure, flexible, and efficient compared with similar existing protocols, which can save more quantum resources.

TI Characterizing entanglement robustness of an N-qubit W superposition
   state against particle loss from quantum Fisher information
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We investigate the entanglement robustness of an N-qubit W superposition state against particle loss with quantum Fisher information. In the noninteracting environment, the quantum Fisher information of reduced W superposition state is found same as it from W superposition state when the number of qubits is larger than 5, which shows very strong entanglement robustness compared to Twin-Fock state and GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger state. Meanwhile, the re-particle-loss effect is also studied and it presents a rapid decay of quantum Fisher information with the increase of the number of losing qubits, indicating the weak entanglement robustness. In the Ising-type interacting environment, the results show that reduced W superposition state performs better than it in noninteracting environment. With the increasing qubits (N > 5) the reduced W superposition state behaves much more robust than original W state. To simulate a real noisy environment, the effects of different decoherence channels are also considered.

TI A quantum fluctuation description of charge qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We consider a specific instance of a superconducting circuit, the so-called charge-qubit, consisting of a capacitor and a Josephson junction that we describe by means of the BCS microscopic model in terms of two tunnelling superconducting systems in the strong-coupling quasi-spin formulation. Then, by means of collective observables we derive the Hamiltonian governing the quantum behaviour of the circuit in the limit of a large number N of quasi-spins. Our approach relies on suitable quantum fluctuations, i.e. on collective quasi-spin operators, different from mean-field observables, that retain a quantum character in the large-N limit. These collective operators generate the Heisenberg algebra on the circle and we show that their dynamics reproduces the phenomenological one generated by the charge qubit Hamiltonian obtained by quantizing the macroscopic classical Hamiltonian of the circuit. The microscopic derivation of the emergent, large-N behaviour provides a rigorous setting to investigate more in detail both general quantum circuits and quantum macroscopic scenarios; in particular, in the specific case of charge-qubits, it allows to explicitly obtain the temperature dependence of the critical Josephson current in the strong coupling regime, a result not accessible using standard approximation techniques.

AB Analog quantum simulation is expected to be a significant application of near-term quantum devices. Verification of these devices without comparison to known simulation results will be an important task as the system size grows beyond the regime that can be simulated classically. We introduce a set of experimentally-motivated verification protocols for analog quantum simulators, discussing their sensitivity to a variety of error sources and their scalability to larger system sizes. We demonstrate these protocols experimentally using a two-qubit trapped-ion analog quantum simulator and numerically using models of up to five qubits.

TI Generation of true quantum random numbers with on-demand probability
   distributions via single-photon quantum walks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Random numbers are at the heart of diverse fields, ranging from simulations of stochastic processes to classical and quantum cryptography. The requirement for true randomness in these applications has motivated various proposals for generating random numbers based on the inherent randomness of quantum systems. The generation of true random numbers with arbitrarily defined probability distributions is highly desirable for applications, but it is very challenging. Here we show that single-photon quantum walks can generate multi-bit random numbers with on-demand probability distributions, when the required "coin" parameters are found with the gradient descent (GD) algorithm. Our theoretical and experimental results exhibit high fidelity for various selected distributions. This GD-enhanced single-photon system provides a convenient way for building flexible and reliable quantum random number generators. Multi-bit random numbers are a necessary resource for high-dimensional quantum key distribution. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for solving the learning-with-errors
   problem on NISQ devices
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is a fundamental computational challenge with implications for post-quantum cryptography and computational learning theory. Here we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model to address LWE, transforming it into the Shortest Vector Problem and using variable qubits to encode lattice vectors into an Ising Hamiltonian. By identifying low-energy Hamiltonian levels, the solution is extracted, making the method suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The required number of qubits is less than m(m + 1), where m is the number of samples. Our heuristic algorithm's time complexity depends on the specific quantum eigensolver used to find low-energy levels, and the performance when using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is investigated. We validate the algorithm by solving a 2-dimensional LWE problem on a 5-qubit quantum device, demonstrating its potential for solving meaningful LWE instances on near-term quantum devices.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering for Mixed Entangled Coherent States
SO ENTROPY
AB By using the Born Markovian master equation, we study the relationship among the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, Bell nonlocality, and quantum entanglement of entangled coherent states (ECSs) under decoherence. We illustrate the dynamical behavior of the three types of correlations for various optical field strength regimes. In general, we find that correlation measurements begin at their maximum and decline over time. We find that quantum steering and nonlocality behave similarly in terms of photon number during dynamics. Furthermore, we discover that ECSs with steerability can violate the Bell inequality, and that not every ECS with Bell nonlocality is steerable. In the current work, without the memory stored in the environment, some of the initial states with maximal values of quantum steering, Bell nonlocality, and entanglement can provide a delayed loss of that value during temporal evolution, which is of interest to the current study.

AB We present a complete optimization procedure for hybrid quantum-classical circuits with classical parity logic. While common optimization techniques for quantum algorithms focus on rewriting solely the pure quantum segments, there is interest in applying a global optimization process for applications such as quantum error correction and quantum assertions. This work, based on the pure-quantum circuit optimization procedure by Duncan et al., uses an extension of the formal graphical ZX-calculus called ZX(sic) as an intermediary representation of the hybrid circuits to allow for granular optimizations below the quantum-gate level. We define a translation from hybrid circuits into diagrams that admit the graph-theoretical focused-gFlow property, needed for the final extraction back into a circuit. We then derive a number of gFlow-preserving optimization rules for ZX(sic) diagrams that reduce the size of the graph, and devise a strategy to find optimization opportunities by rewriting the diagram guided by a Gauss elimination process. Then, after extracting the circuit, we present a general procedure for detecting segments of circuit-like ZX(sic) diagrams which can be implemented with classical gates in the extracted circuit. We have implemented our optimization procedure as an extension to the open-source python library PyZX.

TI Integrating quantum and classical computing for multi-energy system
   optimization using Benders decomposition
SO COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB During recent years, quantum computers have received increasing attention, primarily due to their ability to significantly increase computational performance for specific problems. Computational performance could be improved for mathematical optimization by quantum annealers. This special type of quantum computer can solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. However, multi -energy systems optimization commonly involves integer and continuous decision variables. Due to their mixed -integer problem structure, quantum annealers cannot be directly used for multi -energy system optimization. To solve multi -energy system optimization problems, we present a hybrid Benders decomposition approach combining optimization on quantum and classical computers. In our approach, the quantum computer solves the master problem, which involves only the integer variables from the original energy system optimization problem. The subproblem includes the continuous variables and is solved by a classical computer. For better performance, we apply improvement techniques to the Benders decomposition. We test the approach on a case study to design a cost -optimal multi -energy system. While we provide a proof of concept that our Benders decomposition approach is applicable for the design of multi -energy systems, the computational time is still higher than for approaches using classical computers only. We therefore estimate the potential improvement of our approach to be expected for larger and fault -tolerant quantum computers.

AB We investigate multiple photon-assisted Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions in a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics device in which each of two interacting transmission-line resonators is coupled to a qubit, and the qubits are driven by periodic driving fields and also coupled to a common phonon mode. The quantum state of the entire composite system is modeled using the multi-D(2)Ansatz in combination with the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle. Applying a sinusoidal driving field to one of the qubits, this device is an ideal platform to study the photon-assisted LZ transitions by comparing the dynamics of the two qubits. A series of interfering photon-assisted LZ transitions takes place if the photon frequency is much smaller than the driving amplitude. Once the two energy scales are comparable, independent LZ transitions arise and a transition pathway is revealed using an energy diagram. It is found that both adiabatic and nonadiabatic transitions are involved in the dynamics. Used to model environmental effects on the LZ transitions, the common phonon mode coupled to the qubits allows for more available states to facilitate the LZ transitions. An analytical formula is obtained to estimate the short time phonon population and produces results in reasonable agreement with numerical calculations. Equipped with the knowledge of the photon-assisted LZ transitions in the system, we can precisely manipulate the qubit state and successfully generate the qubit dynamics with a square-wave pattern by applying driving fields to both qubits, opening up new venues to manipulate the states of qubits and photons in quantum information devices and quantum computers.

TI Experimental demonstration of a quantum engine driven by entanglement
   and local measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Understanding entanglement and quantum measurements from a thermodynamics point of view is a funda-mental and challenging task. Recently, a two-qubit engine was put forward as an appropriate platform to tackle these challenges. Here we achieve an experimental simulation and provide the direct experimental proof of these findings using single photons and linear optics. Encoding the qubits by polarization and transverse spatial modes of single photons, entanglement is created through the interaction between them. We show that, upon local measurement, classical mutual information can be extracted in order to fuel a quantum measurement engine. By measuring the energy changes, we identify that the energy gain comes from the measurement channel and corresponds to the cost of erasing the quantum correlations between qubits. The scheme is further generalized to an N-qubit chain for energy upconversion. Our experimental results provide a thorough understanding of this quantum engine with entanglement and local measurements as a new kind of fuel, as well as a general platform for exploration of quantum engines.

TI Entanglement witnessing by arbitrarily many independent observers
   recycling a local quantum shared state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the scenario where an observer, Alice, shares a two-qubit state with an arbitrary number of observers, Bobs, via sequentially and independently recycling the qubit in possession of the first Bob. It is known that there exist entangled states which can be used to have an arbitrarily long sequence of Bobs who can violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality with the single Alice. We show that there exist entangled states that do not violate the Bell inequality and whose entanglement can be detected by an arbitrary number of Bobs by suitably choosing the entanglement witness operator and the unsharp measurement settings by the Bobs. This proves that the set of states that can be used to witness entanglement sequentially is larger than those that can witness sequential violation of local realism. There exist, therefore, two-party quantum correlations that are Bell "classical", but whose entanglement "nonclassicality" can be witnessed sequentially and independently by an arbitrarily large number of observers at one end of the shared state with the single observer at the other end.

TI Implementation of entropically secure encryption: Securing personal
   health data
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB Entropically secure encryption (ESE) offers unconditional security with shorter keys compared to the One-Time Pad. Here, the first implementation of ESE for bulk encryption is presented. The main computational bottleneck for bulk ESE is a multiplication in a very large finite field. This involves multiplication of polynomials followed by modular reduction. A polynomial multiplication is implemented based on the gf2x library, with modifications that avoid inputs of vastly different length, thus improving speed. Additionally, a recently proposed efficient reduction algorithm that works for any polynomial degree is implemented. Two use cases are investigated: x-ray images of patients and human genome data. Entropy estimation is conducted using compression methods whose results determine the key lengths required for ESE. The running times for all steps of the encryption are reported. The potential of ESE to be used in conjunction with quantum key distribution (QKD), in order to achieve full information-theoretic security of QKD-protected links for these use cases is discussed.

TI Measurements of Quantum Hamiltonians with Locally-Biased Classical
   Shadows
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Obtaining precise estimates of quantum observables is a crucial step of variational quantum algorithms. We consider the problem of estimating expectation values of quantum Hamiltonians, obtained on states prepared on a quantum computer. We propose a novel estimator for this task, which is locally optimised with knowledge of the Hamiltonian and a classical approximation to the underlying quantum state. Our estimator is based on the concept of classical shadows of a quantum state, and has the important property of not adding to the circuit depth for the state preparation. We test its performance numerically for molecular Hamiltonians of increasing size, finding a sizable reduction in variance with respect to current measurement protocols that do not increase circuit depths.

TI Hybrid spin-phonon architecture for scalable solid-state quantum nodes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Solid-state spins are promising for quantum information processing and networks, but their inhomogeneity hinders scalable control and entanglement. We propose a hybrid spin-phonon architecture based on spin-embedded SiC optomechanical crystal (OMC) cavities, which integrate photonic and phononic channels for multi-spin interactions. Using a Raman-facilitated process, spins strongly couple to the OMC cavity's zero-point motion at 0.57 MHz, enabling coherent spin-phonon interactions. This interface supports a two-qubit controlled-Z gate with simulated fidelity of 96.80% and efficiently generates entangled Dicke states with over 99% fidelity by leveraging a robust spin-phonon dark state resilient to spectral inhomogeneity and excited-state loss. The platform offers potential scalability and all-to-all connectivity via phonons, along with optical links, enabling both entanglement generation and quantum acoustics studies in the solid state.

TI Detecting entanglement by pure bosonic extension
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the realm of quantum information theory, the detection and quantification of quantum entanglement stand as paramount tasks. The relative entropy of entanglement (REE) serves as a prominent measure of entanglement, with extensive applications spanning numerous related fields. The positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion, while providing an efficient method for the computation of REE, unfortunately, falls short when dealing with bound entanglement. In this study, we propose a method termed "pure bosonic extension" to enhance the practicability of k-bosonic extensions, which approximates the set of separable states from the "outside", through a hierarchical structure. It enables efficient characterization of the set of k-bosonic extendible states, facilitating the derivation of accurate lower bounds for REE. Compared to the semi-definite programming (SDP) approach, such as the symmetric/bosonic extension function in QETLAB, our algorithm supports much larger dimensions and higher values of extension k.

TI Entanglement enhancement and EPR steering based on a PT-symmetric-like
   cavity-opto-magnomechanical hybrid system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate the enhancement of entanglement and EPR steering in a paritytime(PT-) symmetric-like cavity-opto-magnomechanical system. The system consists of an optical cavity, a magnon mode in a ferromagnetic crystal, a phonon mode, and a microwave cavity. Our findings demonstrate that microwave-cavity gain significantly boosts distant quantum entanglement and greatly improves the robustness of bipartite entanglement against environment temperature. Additionally, we observe an enhancement of tripartite entanglement within the system and uncover the phenomenon of entanglement transfer. Notably, we also achieve one-way steering and two-way asymmetric steering in the system. This study offers insights into the integration of traditional optomechanics and cavity magnomechanics, presenting a novel approach to manipulate asymmetric quantum steering between two distant macroscopic objects. The implications of our research extend to the fields of quantum state preparation and quantum information.

TI Spin Digitizer for High-Fidelity Readout of a Cavity-Coupled Silicon
   Triple Quantum Dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB An important requirement for spin-based quantum information processing is reliable and fast readout of electron spin states, allowing for feedback and error correction. However, common readout techniques often require additional gate structures, hindering device scaling, or impose stringent constraints on the tuning configuration of the sensed quantum dots. Here, we operate an in-line charge sensor within a triple quantum dot, where one of the dots is coupled to a microwave cavity and used to readout the charge states of the other two dots. Owing to the proximity of the charge sensor, we observe a near-digital sensor response with a power signal-to-noise ratio greater than 450 at an integration time of tint = 1 ?s. Despite small singlet-triplet splittings of approximately 40 ?eV, we further utilize the sensor to measure the spin relaxation time of a singlet-triplet qubit, achieving an average single-shot spin readout fidelity greater than 99%. Our approach enables high-fidelity spin readout, combining minimal device overhead with flexible qubit operation in semiconductor quantum devices.

TI Quantum clock synchronization with the silicon-chip based entangled
   photon source
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Leveraging the properties of quantum entanglement and squeezing, quantum clock synchronization offers significant advantages in improving precision and security. For scalable quantum clock synchronization networks, developing an accurate time deviation analysis model is essential to characterize long-term timing stability and enable reliable deployment in real-world systems. This paper proposes a synchronization stability analysis model that establishes the theoretically achievable time deviation based on the Cram & eacute;r-Rao lower bound. We experimentally validate this model using a round-trip quantum clock synchronization protocol over 50 km of fiber, employing an integrated silicon-photonic chip that generates frequency-entangled photon pairs via four-wave mixing. Results show a synchronization accuracy of 15.08 ps and a time deviation of 901 fs at an averaging time of 10,240 seconds, while our model analysis shows a standard deviation of 12.21 ps. This work provides a fundamental framework for building robust, large-scale quantum networks.

AB The fidelity of applications on near-term quantum computers is limited by hardware errors. In addition to errors that occur during gate and measurement operations, a qubit is susceptible to idling errors, which occur when the qubit is idle and not actively undergoing any operations. To mitigate idling errors, prior works in the quantum devices community have proposed Dynamical Decoupling (DD), that reduces stray noise on idle qubits by continuously executing a specific sequence of single-qubit operations that effectively behave as an identity gate. Unfortunately, existing DD protocols have been primarily studied for individual qubits and their efficacy at the application-level is not yet fully understood.
   Our experiments show that naively enabling DD for every idle qubit does not necessarily improve fidelity. While DD reduces the idling error-rates for some qubits, it increases the overall error-rate for others due to the additional operations of the DD protocol. Furthermore, idling errors are program-specific and the set of qubits that benefit from DD changes with each program. To enable robust use of DD, we propose Adaptive Dynamical Decoupling (ADAPT), a software framework that estimates the efficacy of DD for each qubit combination and judiciously applies DD only to the subset of qubits that provide the most benefit. ADAPT employs a Decoy Circuit, which is structurally similar to the original program but with a known solution, to identify the DD sequence that maximizes the fidelity. To avoid the exponential search of all possible DD combinations, ADAPT employs a localized algorithm that has linear complexity in the number of qubits. Our experiments on IBM quantum machines (with 16-27 qubits) show that ADAPT improves the application fidelity by 1.86x on average and up-to 5.73x compared to no DD and by 1.2x compared to DD on all qubits.

TI Predictability as a quantum resource
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Just recently, complementarity relations (CRs) have been derived from the basic rules of Quantum Mechanics. The complete CRs are equalities involving quantum coherence, C, quantum entanglement, and predictability, P. While the first two are already quantified in the resource theory framework, such a characterization lacks for the last. In this article, we start showing that, for a system prepared in a state rho, P of rho, with reference to an observable X, is equal to C, with reference to observables mutually unbiased (MU) to X, of the state Phi(X) (rho), which is obtained from a non-revealing von Neumann measurement (NRvNM) of X. We also show that P-X (rho) > C-Y (Phi(X) (rho)) for observables X, Y not MU. Afterwards, we provide quantum circuits for implementing NRvNMs and use these circuits to experimentally test these (in)equalities using the IBM's quantum computers. Furthermore, we give a resource theory for predictability, identifying its free quantum states and free quantum operations and discussing some predictability monotones. Besides, after applying one of these predictability monotones to study bipartite systems, we discuss the relation among the resource theories of quantum coherence, predictability, and purity.

These QPDs potentially act as spin based quantum devices and systems which exhibit valuable quantum properties, making them highly sought after in quantum research. This mini-review focuses on the recent progress of neutron irradiated h-BN, the resulting QPDs, and how they function as spin-based quantum sensors. We also outline the key technical challenges associated with the development of high performance quantum devices as well as the improvements needed to enhance quantum properties in such neutron irradiated h-BN. Our review is expected to accelerate further research on neutron irradiation of h-BN for quantum applications and drive interest in the deterministic creation of spin-based quantum emitters.

TI Quantum computational advantage attested by nonlocal games with the
   cyclic cluster state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a set of Bell-type nonlocal games that can be used to prove an unconditional quantum advantage in an objective and hardware-agnostic manner. In these games, the circuit depth needed to prepare a cyclic cluster state and measure a subset of its Pauli stabilizers on a quantum computer is compared to that of classical Boolean circuits with the same, nearest-neighboring gate connectivity. Using a circuit-based trapped-ion quantum computer, we prepare and measure a six-qubit cyclic cluster state with an overall fidelity of 60.6% and 66.4%, before and after correcting for measurement-readout errors, respectively. Our experimental results indicate that while this fidelity readily passes conventional (or depth-0) Bell bounds for local hidden-variable models, it is on the cusp of demonstrating a higher probability of success than what is possible by depth-1 classical circuits. Our games offer a practical and scalable set of quantitative benchmarks for quantum computers in the pre-fault-tolerant regime as the number of qubits available increases.

TI COVID-19 detection on IBM quantum computer with classical-quantum
   transfer learning
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Diagnose the infected patient as soon as possible in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak which is declared as a pandemic by the world health organization (WHO) is extremely important. Experts recommend CT imaging as a diagnostic tool because of the weak points of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). In this study, the detection of COVID-19 from CT images, which give the most accurate response in a short time, was investigated in the classical computer and firstly in quantum computers. Using the quantum transfer learning method, we experimentally perform COVID-19 detection in different quantum real processors (IBMQx2, IBMQ-London and IBMQ-Rome) of IBM, as well as in different simulators (Pennylane, Qiskit-Aer and Cirq). By using a small number of data sets such as 126 COVID-19 and 100 normal CT images, we obtained a positive or negative classification of COVID-19 with 90% success in classical computers, while we achieved a high success rate of 94%-100% in quantum computers. Also, according to the results obtained, machine learning process in classical computers requiring more processors and time than quantum computers can be realized in a very short time with a very small quantum processor such as 4 qubits in quantum computers. If the size of the data set is small; due to the superior properties of quantum, it is seen that according to the classification of COVID-19 and normal, in terms of machine learning, quantum computers seem to outperform traditional computers.

TI Hexapartite steering based on a four-wave-mixing process with a
   spatially structured pump
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering has been widely studied, for realizing safer quantum communication. The steering properties of six spatially separated beams from the four-wave-mixing process with a spatially structured pump are investigated. Behaviors of all (1+i)/(i+1)-mode (i=1,2,3) steerings are understandable, if the role of the corresponding relative interaction strengths are taken into account. Moreover, stronger collective multipartite steerings including five modes can be obtained in our scheme, which has potential applications in ultra-secure multiuser quantum networks when the issue of trust is critical. By further discussing about all monogamy relations, it is noticed that the type-IV monogamy relations, which are naturally included in our model, are conditionally satisfied. Matrix representation is used to express the steerings for the first time, which is very useful to understand the monogamy relations intuitively. Different steering properties obtained in this compact phase-insensitive scheme have potential applications for different kinds of quantum communication tasks.

AB Optimizing the performance of cryogenic quantum amplifiers is a key step toward achieving high-fidelity and scalable qubit readout. In this work, we present efficient and accurate modeling of a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on electromagnetic (EM) and circuit co-simulation. In contrast to conventional simulation methods where an equivalent lumped-element circuit model of the JTWPA is required, we directly perform full EM analysis of the device to faithfully determine the linear response. The extracted S-parameters are then fed into a nonlinear harmonic balance simulator with Josephson junctions represented as circuit elements. The simulated linear and gain properties are compared with experimental results and show good agreement.

   and optics
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Seeking solutions to nonlinear differential equations cannot be overemphasized as this illuminates clarity in the dynamical behavior of the described model, and thus, enables precise forecasting of the processes with respect to time. In this study, Elzaki integral transform as a means to complement domain decomposition for a more convergent result has been coupled with the projected differential transform viz: an improved differential transform scheme, to solve the renowned Schrodinger equation derived from the quantum physics, waves, and field theory; describing the mechanics of wave-particle duality, quantum entanglement, energy quantization, motions of optical waves; consequently applicable in quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, quantum field theory, solid-state physics, plasma physics, Optics, reaction-diffusion theory, interest rate dynamics, shock-wave for-mation, quantum computing, financial modeling, quantum finance, and so on. Achieved results from the implementation of this method through tables, convergence plots, and other graphical illustrations when the mass of the particle and constant of proportionality in the system is varied arbitrarily revealed quite an excellent convergence to the exact solution, rich in reliability than existing works of literature while an increase in the mass of the particle induces a contraction of the surface area of the complex system whilst decreasing the radical axis of concentric circles, and notably, an increase in proportionality con-stant decreases the spiral effect of the system and all plots tend to converge as this increases.

TI Security analysis of simultaneous classical communication and CVQKD with
   a local local oscillator under the phase reference pulse intensity
   attack
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The simultaneous classical and continuous variable quantum communication can allow classical communication and continuous variable quantum key distribution with a local local oscillator (LLO CVQKD) to be implemented simultaneously using the same communication architecture. Such scheme enables LLO CVQKD to be integrated with classical communication at the minimum cost, but the existence of reference pulses will bring security loopholes to the simultaneous communication system, allowing eavesdroppers to launch attacks. In this paper, we analyze and simulate the performance of the system by introducing the trusted noise model under the phase reference pulse intensity attack, where Eve can hide her attack by manipulating the intensity of the reference pulse using a phase insensitive amplifier. A reconstructed noise model is proposed to solve this problem. Moreover, we show that the reconstructed noise model can strengthen the security of the practical simultaneous communication system.

TI Direct visualization of quasiparticle concentration around
   superconducting vortices
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Bogoliubov quasiparticles play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of a superconductor and in achieving reliable operations of superconducting quantum circuits. Diagnosis of quasiparticle poisoning at the nanoscale provides invaluable benefits in designing superconducting qubits. Here, we use scanning tunneling noise microscopy to locally quantify quasiparticles by measuring the effective charge. Using the vortex lattice as a model system, we directly visualize the spatial variation of the quasiparticle concentration around superconducting vortices, which can be described within the Ginzburg-Landau framework. This shows a direct, noninvasive approach for the atomic-scale detection of relative quasiparticle concentration as small as 10(-4) in various superconducting qubit systems. Our results alert of a quick increase in quasiparticle concentration with decreasing intervortex distance in vortex-based Majorana qubits.

TI Modelling efficient BB84 with applications for medium-range, terrestrial
   free-space QKD
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Terrestrial free-space (FS) quantum key distribution (QKD) is ideally suited for deployment in dense urban environments. The transition from laboratory to commercial deployment, however, raises a number of important engineering and deployment issues. Here, we investigate these issues for efficient BB84 using a weak coherent pulse-decoy state protocol. We calculate expected key lengths for different environmental conditions and when the scope for optimisation of protocol parameters is restricted due to practical considerations. In particular, we find that for a fixed receiver basis choice probability, it can be advantageous to allow the transmitter to have a different basis choice probability depending on varying channel loss and background light levels. Finally, we examine the effects of pulse intensity uncertainty finding that they can dramatically reduce the key length. These results can be used to determine the loss budget for the FS optics of a QKD systems and assist in their design.

TI Symmetries and effect of time dimension in non-equilibrium quantum

SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems have attracted considerable attention in the past decades. The scope of the research of this kind of novel system involves interdisciplinary research of condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics, quantum optics, quantum information and quantum computation, as well as the non-equilibrium statistical physics. The non-equilibrium phenomena emerging from the aforementioned quantum systems can exhibit rich and universal behaviors, which have far from being well understood due to the novelties and complexities of these systems, and hence the quantum many-body physics becomes the research highlight. At the same time, with the rapid development of quantum techniques, the understanding of these complex systems is of important practical significance due to their potential applications in quantum computation and quantum manipulation. In this paper, we show our recent progress of non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems. We focus on the novel phenomena closely related to the temporary symmetry breaking, including the exotic quantum matter, quasi-particles as well as the dynamical universality classes in non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

TI Hardware-efficient error-correcting codes for large nuclear spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Universal quantum computers require a large network of qubits robust against errors. Recent theoretical and experimental studies on donor nuclear spins in silicon, engineered on semiconductor platforms compatible with industrial fabrication, show their coherent behavior and potential for scalability. Here we present a hardware-efficient quantum protocol that corrects phase flips of a nuclear spin using explicit experimentally feasible operations. We introduce moment angular system encoding that uses the large Hilbert space provided by the nuclear spin of the donor to encode the information and employ the electron spin of the donor as an ancilla for error correction. Simulations using present-day experimental manipulation fidelities predict significant improvement in logical qubit fidelity over existing spin quantumerror-correction protocols. These results provide a realizable blueprint for a corrected spin-based qubit.

For a target bit security, SPHINCS+ supports many different tradeoffs between the signature size and the signing speed. SPHINCS+ provides 6 parameter sets: 3 parameter sets for size optimization and 3 parameter sets for speed optimization. We propose new parameter sets with better performance. Specifically, SPHINCS+ implementations with our parameter sets are up to 26.5% faster with slightly shorter signature sizes.

TI Quantum simulation of a honeycomb lattice model by high-order moiré
   pattern
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Moir & eacute; superlattices have become an emergent solid-state platform for simulating quantum lattice models. However, in a single moir & eacute; device, Hamiltonian parameters like the lattice constant, hopping, and interaction terms can hardly be manipulated, limiting the controllability and accessibility of a moir & eacute; quantum simulator. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that high-order moir & eacute; patterns in graphene-monolayered xenon/krypton heterostructures can simulate a honeycomb model in the mesoscale, with in situ tunable Hamiltonian parameters. The length scale of the simulated lattice constant can be tuned by annealing processes, which in situ adjusts intervalley interaction and hopping parameters in the simulated honeycomb lattice. The sign of the lattice constant can be switched by choosing a xenon or krypton monolayer deposited on graphene, which controls the sublattice degree of freedom and valley arrangement of Dirac fermions. In this letter, we establish a path for experimentally simulating the honeycomb model with tunable parameters by high-order moir & eacute; patterns.

SO JOURNAL OF LOGICAL AND ALGEBRAIC METHODS IN PROGRAMMING
AB Digital signatures ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital assets, vital properties for any secure communication. The National Institute of Standards and Technologies launched the Post-Quantum Cryptography project to standardise new algorithms and protocols that are secure against quantum attackers. The post-quantum signature scheme FALCON was one of the finalists. We present a continuation of the first steps towards the formal specification and analysis, in the high-performance language Maude, of signature schemes. We have adapted and improved a previous framework, originally aimed to formally specify and analyse post- quantum key encapsulation mechanisms. As a use case of the new framework, we specify an executable symbolic model of FALCON. On the symbolic model, we verify termination and fairness using LTL formulas with Maude's model checker. Furthermore, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation are analysed through invariant analysis. Integrity and non-repudiation hold, meanwhile, authentication does not hold in our symbolic model.

TI Bi-tone-driven optomechanical photon blockade
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optomechanical systems are capable of coupling to various engineered quantum systems. The ability of extending optomechanical systems to the quantum regime holds the potential for wide applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Due to its importance in single-photon sources and hybrid quantum devices, optomechanical photon blockade (OMPB) has been theoretically predicted with various types of interactions. However, the realization of OMPB requires strict conditions, such as strong optomechanical coupling or precise control of system parameters. Here, we propose how to release such conditions and realize OMPB with experimentally accessible parameters. We find strong OMPB in a weak coupling regime by using bi-tone drive. Moreover, such OMPB can be flexibly controlled by tuning optical detuning. Our work provides a method for achieving strong antibunched photon-photon correlation in weak coupling optomechanics, enabling hybrid quantum devices for applications in quantum information processing.

SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Organic radicals with light-emitting properties and exceptional stability offer exciting opportunities to address spin-statistical limi-tations in organic electronics and advance quantum technologies. These radicals, acting as small molecular magnets, exhibit sensi-tivity to minute magnetic fields and can be tailored with diverse spin centers, making them ideal for spin-optical interfaces, repre-senting key components in quantum communication systems. Furthermore, their ability to form organized, higher-dimensionalassemblies presents a promising avenue for overcoming scalability challenges in quantum technologies. Despite their potential,achieving high luminescence quantum yields has largely been limited to donor-functionalized monoradicals, and a detailed under-standing of the luminescent behavior of open-shell organic molecules remains elusive. This review delves into the photolumines-cent properties and spin ground states of trityl-based mono-, di-, and multiradicals, examining the strategies employed to enhancetheir performance. Additionally, we review predictive methods for determining the luminescence and spin states of radicals, high-lighting critical unresolved questions that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of trityl-based radicals in advanced techno-logical applications.

TI Variational quantum eigensolver for SU(N) fermions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Variational quantum algorithms aim at harnessing the power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, by using a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit to solve tractable quantum problems. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the aforementioned algorithms designed to determine the ground-state of many-body Hamiltonians. Here, we apply the VQE to study the ground-state properties of N-component fermions. With such knowledge, we study the persistent current of interacting SU(N) fermions, which is employed to reliably map out the different quantum phases of the system. Our approach lays out the basis for a current-based quantum simulator of many-body systems that can be implemented on NISQ computers.

TI Nonequilibrium Critical Scaling of a Squeezing Phase Transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1=2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a collective phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase with scalable squeezing. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent timescale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases within the framework of nonequilibrium critical phenomena. Our Letter demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular, or Rydberg platforms.

TI Group-velocity symmetry in photonic crystal fibre for ultra-tunable
   quantum frequency conversion
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Low-noise frequency conversion of single photons is a critical tool in establishing fibre-based quantum networks. We show that a single photonic crystal fibre can achieve frequency conversion by Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing of source photons from an ultra-broad wavelength range by engineering a symmetric group velocity profile. Furthermore, we discuss how pump tuning can mitigate realistic discrepancies in device fabrication. This enables a single highly adaptable frequency conversion interface to link disparate nodes in a quantum network via the telecoms band.

TI Digital Quantum Simulation of the Schwinger Model and Symmetry
   Protection with Trapped Ions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Tracking the dynamics of physical systems in real time is a prime application of quantum computers. Using a trapped-ion system with up to six qubits, we simulate the real-time dynamics of a lattice gauge theory in 1 + 1 dimensions, i.e., the lattice Schwinger model, and demonstrate nonperturbative effects such as pair creation for times much longer than previously accessible. We study the gate requirement of two formulations of the model using the Suzuki-Trotter product formula, as well as the trade-off between errors from the ordering of the Hamiltonian terms, the Trotter step size, and experimental imperfections. To mitigate experimental errors, a recent symmetry-protection protocol for suppressing coherent errors and a symmetry-inspired postselection scheme are applied. This work demonstrates the integrated theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental approach that is essential for efficient simulation of lattice gauge theories and other complex physical systems.

TI Device-independent verification of quantum coherence without quantum
   control
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Quantum coherence plays a crucial role in manipulating and controlling quantum systems, leading to breakthroughs in various fields such as quantum information, quantum sensing, and the detection of gravitational waves. Most coherence witnesses rely on the assumption of being able to control quantum states. Here, we report a device-independent coherence model by extending the standard Bell theory to multiple source scenarios. We propose a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type paradox to verify the particle and wave behaviors of a coherent carrier. We experimentally generate generalized two-photon entangled states that violate the present paradox, witnessing spatial quantum superposition through local measurements.

TI Quantum Security Multi-Party Extremum Protocol with
   Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger States
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB Secure multi-party extremum, as a significant offshoot of secure multi-party computation, has extensive applications in various domains, including healthcare, financial transactions, market analysis, sports events, etc. Nevertheless, most existing secure multi-party extremum protocols rely on computational hard problems and are thus vulnerable to quantum algorithms. This paper presents a quantum secure multi-party extremum protocol that is built upon the correlations of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Within this protocol, multiple participants, with the aid of a semi-honest third party, can obtain the maximum and minimum values of their secret inputs. GHZ states act as the information carriers and are transmitted among the participants and the third party. Their unique correlations ensure the secure transmission of quantum particles. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol is capable of not only warding off common external attacks but also resisting internal attacks launched by dishonest participants and the semi-honest third party. Moreover, the protocol boasts correctness and high scalability.

TI Fast correlated-photon imaging enhanced by deep learning
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum imaging using photon pairs with strong quantum correlations has been harnessed to bring quantum advantages to various fields from biological imaging to range finding. Such inherent non-classical properties support the extraction of more valid signals to build photon-limited images, even in low-light conditions where the shot noise becomes dominant as light decreases to a single-photon level. Numerical optimization algorithms are possible but require thousands of photon-sparse frames, and they are thus unavailable in real time. We demonstrate fast correlated-photon imaging enhanced by deep learning as an intelligent computational strategy to discover a deeper structure in big data. Our work verifies that a convolutional neural network can efficiently solve inverse imaging problems associated with strong shot noise and background noise (electronic noise, scattered light). Our results show that we can overcome limitations due to the trade-off between imaging speed and image quality by pushing the low-light imaging technique to the single-photon level in real time, which enables deep-learning-enhanced quantum imaging for real-life applications.

TI Experimental Test of the Three-Setting Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
   Inequality with Nonmaximally Orbital Angular Momentum Entangled States
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Nonmaximally entangled states are pivotal for quantum technologies, offering enhanced noise resilience and resource efficiency for quantum communication tasks. However, the maximum violation of the multisetting Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality in nonmaximally entangled systems has yet to be explored, primarily due to the algebraic complexity associated with such systems. Herein, it is demonstrated that the maximization of the correlation measure in the three-setting CHSH inequality, for both pure and mixed states, can be elegantly reformulated as a geometric optimization problem: maximizing the perimeter of a triangle inscribed within an ellipse. Leveraging this analytical insight, the maximum violation of the three-setting CHSH inequality using photonic orbital angular momentum entanglement and spatial light modulators for precise intensity measurements is experimentally realized, observing that the Bell parameter diminishes to the classical bound as entanglement decreases. The findings shed new light on optimal measurement strategies for nonmaximally entangled states, demonstrating conclusively that phase-only measurements are insufficient for achieving maximum violations in such states. Thus, the work may offer valuable guidance for harnessing nonmaximally entangled states in practical quantum technologies.

TI From Vlasov-Poisson to Schrödinger-Poisson: Dark matter simulation with
   a quantum variational time evolution algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Cosmological simulations describing the evolution of density perturbations of a self-gravitating collisionless dark matter (DM) fluid in an expanding background provide a powerful tool to follow the formation of cosmic structures over wide dynamic ranges. The most widely adopted approach, based on the N-body discretization of the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equations, is hampered by an unfavorable scaling when simulating the wide range of scales needed to cover at the same time the formation of single galaxies and of the largest cosmic structures. On the other hand, the dynamics described by the VP equations is limited by the rapid increase of the number of resolution elements (grid points and/or particles) which is required to simulate an ever growing range of scales. Recent studies showed an interesting mapping of the six-dimensional + 1 (6D+1) VP problem into a more amenable 3D+1 nonlinear Schrodinger-Poisson (SP) problem for simulating the evolution of DM perturbations. This opens up the possibility of improving the scaling of time propagation simulations using quantum computing. In this paper, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating the Schrodinger-Poisson (SP) equation by adapting a variational real-time evolution approach to a self-consistent, nonlinear, problem. To achieve this, we designed a novel set of quantum circuits that establish connections between the solution of the original Poisson equation and the solution of the corresponding time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We also analyzed how nonlinearity impacts the variance of observables. Furthermore, we explored how the spatial resolution behaves as the SP dynamics approaches the classical limit (h over bar /m -> 0) and discovered an empirical logarithmic relationship between the required number of qubits and the scale of the SP equation (h over bar /m). This entire approach holds the potential to serve as an efficient alternative for solving the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equation by means of classical algorithms.

TI Hierarchies of localizable entanglement due to spatial distribution of
   local noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Complete characterization of a noisy multipartite quantum state in terms of entanglement requires full knowledge of how the entanglement content in the state is affected by the spatial distribution of noise in the state. Specifically, we find that if the measurement basis in the protocol of computing localizable entanglement and the basis of the Kraus operator representing the local noisy channel do not commute, the information regarding the noise is retained in the system even after the qubit is traced out after measurement. Using this result and the basic properties of entanglement under noise, we present a set of hierarchies that localizable entanglement over a specific subsystem in a multiqubit state can obey when local noise acts on the subparts or on all the qubits of the whole system. In particular, we propose two types of hierarchies-one tailored according to the number of noisy unmeasured qubits, and the other one that depends additionally on the cardinality of the set of noisy measured qubits, leading to the classification of quantum states. We report the percentage of states satisfying the proposed hierarchies in the case of random three- and four-qubit systems and show, using both analytical methods and numerical simulations, that in almost all the cases, anticipated hierarchies tend to hold with the variation of the strength of noise.

TI A Cryogenic Broadband Sub-1-dB NF CMOS Low Noise Amplifier for Quantum
   Applications
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB A cryogenic broadband low noise amplifier (LNA) for quantum applications based on a standard 40-nm CMOS technology is reported. The LNA specifications are derived from the readout of semiconductor quantum bits at 4.2 K, whose quantum information signals are characterized as phase-modulated signals. To achieve broadband input matching impedance and low noise figure, the gate-to-drain capacitance of the input transistor is exploited. The goal is to involve a resistive and capacitive load into the input impedance match of a common-source stage with source inductive degeneration. The capacitive load is created by an LC parallel tank whose resonant frequency is lower than the operating frequency. The achieved non-constant in-band equivalent capacitance is proven to be beneficial to input impedance matching. The resistive part of the load is provided by the transconductance of the cascode stage implicitly. An inductor is added to the gate of the cascode transistor to suppress its noise, and a transformer-based resonator with two resonant frequencies serves as the load of the first stage, thus extending the operating bandwidth. Design considerations for the cryogenic temperature operation of the LNA are proposed and analyzed. The LNA achieves a measured gain (S-21) of 35 +/- 0.5 dB, return loss > 12 dB, and NF of 0.75-1.3 dB across the band (4.1-7.9 GHz), with 51.1-mW power consumption at room temperature, while it shows a measured gain of 42 +/- 3.3 dB, and NF of 0.23-0.65 dB with 39-mW power consumption at 4.2 K between 4.6 and 8 GHz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cryogenic LNA based on a bulk CMOS process working above 4 GHz showing sub-1-dB NF both at room and cryogenic temperatures.

TI Enhanced Coherence in Superconducting Circuits via Band Engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In superconducting circuits interrupted by Josephson junctions, the dependence of the energy spectrum on offset charges on different islands is 2e periodic through the Aharonov-Casher effect and resembles a crystal band structure that reflects the symmetries of the Josephson potential. We show that higher-harmonic Josephson elements described by a cos(2 phi) energy-phase relation provide an increased freedom to tailor the shape of the Josephson potential and design spectra featuring multiplets of flat bands and Dirac points in the charge Brillouin zone. Flat bands provide noise-insensitive energy levels, and consequently, engineering band pairs with flat spectral gaps can help improve the coherence of the system. We discuss a modified version of a flux qubit that achieves, in principle, no decoherence from charge noise and introduce a flux qutrit that shows a spin-1 Dirac spectrum and is simultaneously quite robust to both charge and flux noise.

TI Efficient Implementation of Lightweight Hash Functions on GPU and
   Quantum Computers for IoT Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Secure communication is important for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to avoid cyber-security attacks. One of the key security aspects is data integrity, which can be protected by employing cryptographic hash functions. Recently, US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced a competition to standardize lightweight hash functions, which can be used in IoT applications. IoT communication involves various hardware platforms, from low-end microcontrollers to high-end cloud servers with GPU accelerators. Since many sensor nodes are connected to the gateway devices and cloud servers, performing high throughput integrity check is important to secure IoT applications. However, this is a time consuming task even for high-end servers, which may affect the response time in IoT systems. Moreover, no prior work had evaluated the performance of NIST candidates on contemporary processors like GPU and quantum computers. In this study, we showed that with carefully crafted implementation techniques, all the finalist hash function candidates in the NIST standardization competition can achieve high throughput (up-to 1,000 Gbps) on a RTX 3080 GPU. This research output can be used by IoT gateway devices and cloud servers to perform data integrity checks at high speed, thus ensuring a timely response. In addition, this is also the first study that showcase the implementation of NIST lightweight hash functions on a quantum computer (ProjectQ). Besides securing the communication in IoT, these efficient implementations on a GPU and quantum computer can be used to evaluate the strength of respective hash functions against brute-force attack.

SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB BackgroundQuantum Computing (QC) represents a disruptive paradigm in computing, with significant implications across various domains such as medicine, logistics, chemistry, and defense. However, quantum software development-the discipline that enables the exploitation of QC's potential-faces considerable challenges due to the inherent complexity of quantum mechanics.ObjectiveThis work aims to facilitate the systematic development of quantum software by introducing a method aligned with classical software engineering principles, particularly the analysis and synthesis phases, through the automated generation and optimization of quantum circuit components.MethodsThe proposed approach focuses on the automated generation of quantum circuit components whose behavior can be formally described using truth tables. To this end, (i) a set of algorithms for the automatic generation of components is introduced, (ii) an optimization algorithm is developed to improve the efficiency of the generated components, and (iii) an automated support system is provided, allowing users to specify truth tables through multiple modeling strategies.ResultsThe resulting system enables a structured and automated process for building reusable quantum circuit components, reducing manual effort and supporting higher abstraction levels in quantum programming. The design of the system adheres to foundational principles of Software Engineering, including agnosticism and automatic code generation.ConclusionsThis proposal contributes to quantum software development by providing a practical, engineering-driven methodology for generating and optimizing quantum circuit components, thereby improving the efficiency, scalability, and accessibility of quantum programming practices.

   photon emitters
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Silicon, a ubiquitous material in modern computing, is an emerging platform for realizing a source of indistinguishable single photons on demand. The integration of recently discovered single-photon emitters in silicon into photonic structures is advantageous to exploit their full potential for integrated photonic quantum technologies. Here, we show the integration of an ensemble of telecom photon emitters in a two-dimensional array of silicon nanopillars. We developed a top-down nanofabrication method, enabling the production of thousands of nanopillars per square millimeter with state-of-the-art photonic-circuit pitch, all the while being free of fabrication-related radiation damage defects. We found a waveguiding effect of the 1278 nm-G center emission along individual pillars accompanied by improved brightness compared to that of bulk silicon. These results unlock clear pathways to monolithically integrating single-photon emitters into a photonic platform at a scale that matches the required pitch of quantum photonic circuits.

AB Thermodynamics plays an important role both in the foundations of physics and in technological applications. An operational perspective adopted in recent years is to formulate it as a quantum resource theory. At the core of this theory is the interconversion between athermality states, i.e. states out of thermal equilibrium. Here, we solve the question of how athermality can be used to heat and cool other quantum systems that are initially at thermal equilibrium. We then show that the convertibility between quasi-classical resources (resources that do not exhibit coherence between different energy eigenstates) is fully characterized by their ability to cool and heat qubits, i.e. by two of the most fundamental thermodynamical tasks on the simplest quantum systems.

TI Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics in Hyperbolic Space: From Photon Bound
   States to Frustrated Spin Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Circuit quantum electrodynamics is one of the most promising platforms for efficient quantum simulation and computation. In recent groundbreaking experiments, the immense flexibility of superconducting microwave resonators was utilized to realize hyperbolic lattices that emulate quantum physics in negatively curved space. Here we investigate experimentally feasible settings in which a few superconducting qubits are coupled to a bath of photons evolving on the hyperbolic lattice. We compare our numerical results for finite lattices with analytical results for continuous hyperbolic space on the Poincare disk. We find good agreement between the two descriptions in the long-wavelength regime. We show that photon-qubit bound states have a curvature-limited size. We propose to use a qubit as a local probe of the hyperbolic bath, for example, by measuring the relaxation dynamics of the qubit. We find that, although the boundary effects strongly impact the photonic density of states, the spectral density is well described by the continuum theory. We show that interactions between qubits are mediated by photons propagating along geodesics. We demonstrate that the photonic bath can give rise to geometrically frustrated hyperbolic quantum spin models with finite-range or exponentially decaying interaction.

TI Polarization-entangled photon pairs generation from a single lithium
   niobate waveguide with single poling period
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Polarization-entangled photon pairs are essential sources for photonic quantum information processing. However, generating entangled photon pairs with large detuning via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) often requires complex configurations to compensate for phase matching. Here, we propose a simple and efficient scheme to generate polarization-entangled photon pairs based on type-0 SPDC in a thin-film lithium niobate waveguide with a single poling period. By utilizing the strong dispersion engineering capabilities of thin-film waveguides, we can achieve both degenerate and highly detuned entangled photon pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate on-chip temporal compensation using an integrated waveguide structure. Our approach offers a compact and scalable solution for integrated quantum photonic circuits.

TI Transient and Fast Generation of Bose-Einstein-Condensate Macroscopic
   Quantum Superposition States via Impurity Catalysing
SO PHOTONICS
AB Macroscopic quantum superposition is an important embodiment of the core of the quantum theory. The engineering of macroscopic quantum superposition states is the key to quantum communication and quantum computation. Thus, we present a theoretical proposal to engineer macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS) states of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) via impurity atoms. We firstly propose a deterministic generation scheme of transient multi-component MQS states of the BEC via impurity catalysing. It is found that the structure of the generated transient multi-component MQS states can be manipulated by the impurity number parity. Then, we illustrate the influence of impurity number parity on MQS states through three aspects: generation of approximately orthogonal continuous-variable cat states, manipulation of non-classicality in phase space, and switching of non-classical degree of BEC states. The influence of the BEC decoherence on the generation of MQS states is discussed by the fidelity between actually generated states and target states. Finally, the results show that the high-fidelity multi-component MQS states of the BEC can be fast generated by increasing the coherent interaction strength between impurities and the BEC in an open system.

TI Shortcut to multipartite entanglement generation: A graph approach to
   boson subtractions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a graph method for systematically searching for schemes that can generate multipartite entanglement in linear bosonic systems with heralding. While heralded entanglement generation offers more tolerable schemes for quantum tasks than postselected ones, it is generally more challenging to find appropriate circuits for multipartite systems. We show that our graph mapping from boson subtractions provides handy tactics to overcome the limitations in circuit designs. Within our graph framework, we identify enhanced schemes for qubit N-partite GHZ, W, and the superposition of N = 3 GHZ and W states. Furthermore, we have found a qudit N-partite GHZ state generation scheme, which requires substantially fewer particles than previous proposals. These results demonstrate the power of our approach in discovering optimized solutions for the generation of intricate heralded entangled states. We expect our method to serve as a promising tool in generating diverse entanglement.

TI A quantum synthetic aperture radar image denoising algorithm based on
   grayscale morphology
SO ISCIENCE
AB The quantum denoising technology efficiently removes noise from images; however, the existing algorithms are only effective for additive noise and cannot remove multiplicative noise, such as speckle noise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this paper, based on the grayscale morphology method, a quantum SAR image denoising algorithm is proposed, which performs morphological operations on all pixels simultaneously to remove the noise in the SAR image. In addition, we design a feasible quantum adder to perform cyclic shift operations. Then, quantum circuits for dilation and erosion are designed, and the complete quantum circuit is then constructed. For a 2 n 3 2 n quantum SAR image with q grayscale levels, the complexity of our algorithm is O & eth; n + q & THORN; . Compared with classical algorithms, it achieves exponential improvement and also has polynomial -level improvements than existing quantum algorithms. Finally, the feasibility of our algorithm is validated on IBM Q.

TI Average correlation as an indicator for nonclassicality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Bell inequalities are an essential part of quantum information theory. Based on these fundamental inequalities, we propose a different indicator for nonclassicality in the Bell sense: average correlation. We derive a general expression for average correlation and calculate its value for pure states and Werner states. From there we show how two inequalities emerge which serve as necessary and sufficient conditions for nonclassicality. They are simple to evaluate and can even be used to classify all bipartite qubit states.

TI Capturing non-Markovian dynamics on near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB With the rapid progress in quantum hardware, there has been an increased interest in new quantum algorithms to describe complex many-body systems searching for the still-elusive goal of "useful quantum advantage." Surprisingly, quantum algorithms for the treatment of open quantum systems (OQSs) have remained under-explored, in part due to the inherent challenges of mapping non-unitary evolution into the framework of unitary gates. Evolving an open system unitarily necessitates dilation into a new effective system to incorporate critical environmental degrees of freedom. In this context, we present and validate a new quantum algorithm to treat non-Markovian dynamics in OQSs built on the ensemble of Lindblad's trajectories approach, invoking the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem. Here we demonstrate our algorithm on the Jaynes-Cummings model in the strong-coupling and detuned regimes, relevant in quantum optics and driven quantum system studies. This algorithm, a key step towards generalized modeling of non-Markovian dynamics on a noisy-quantum device, captures a broad class of dynamics and opens up a new direction in OQS problems.

TI A diamond nanophotonic interface with an optically accessible
   deterministic electronuclear spin register
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB A contemporary challenge for the scalability of quantum networks is developing quantum nodes with simultaneous high photonic efficiency and long-lived qubits. Here we present a fibre-packaged nanophotonic diamond waveguide hosting a tin-vacancy centre with a spin-1/2 Sn-117 nucleus. The interaction between the electronic and nuclear spins results in a signature 452(7) MHz hyperfine splitting. This exceeds the natural optical linewidth by a factor of 16, enabling direct optical nuclear spin initialization with 98.6(3)% fidelity and single-shot readout with 80.0(1)% fidelity. The waveguide-to-fibre extraction efficiency of our device of 57(6)% enables the practical detection of five-photon events. Combining the photonic performance with the optically initialized nuclear spin, we demonstrate a spin-gated single-photon nonlinearity with 11(1)% contrast in the absence of an external magnetic field. These capabilities position our nanophotonic interface as a versatile quantum node in the pursuit of scalable quantum networks.

TI Ab initio simulation of spin-charge qubits based on bilayer

SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB We propose a spin-charge qubit based on a bilayer graphene and WSe2 van der Waals heterostructure that together form a quantum dot and demonstrate its functionality from first-principles simulations. Electron and hole confinement as well as electrically controllable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are modeled by self-consistently solving the Schr & ouml;dinger and Poisson equations with material parameters extracted from density functional theory as inputs. In both electron and hole quantum dots, we find a two orders of magnitude enhancement of SOC (1.8 meV) compared to intrinsic graphene, in the layer directly adjacent to WSe2. Time-dependent investigations of the quantum device reveal rapid qubit gate operation in the order of picoseconds. Our simulations indicate that bilayer graphene and WSe2 heterostructures provide a promising platform for the processing of quantum information.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Generalized Pattern Search Optimization
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB While the development of quantum computers promises a myriad of advantages over their classical counterparts, care must be taken when designing algorithms that substitute a classical technique with a potentially advantageous quantum method. The probabilistic nature of many quantum algorithms may result in new behavior that could negatively impact the performance of the larger algorithm. The purpose of this work is to preserve the advantages of applying quantum search methods for generalized pattern search algorithms (GPSs) without violating the convergence criteria. It is well known that quantum search methods are able to reduce the expected number of oracle calls needed for finding the solution to a search problem from O(N) to O(N) However, the number of oracle calls needed to determine that no solution exists with certainty is exceedingly high and potentially infinite. In the case of GPS, this is a significant problem since overlooking a solution during an iteration will violate a needed assumption for convergence. Here, we overcome this problem by introducing the quantum improved point search (QIPS), a classical-quantum hybrid variant of the quantum search algorithm QSearch. QIPS retains the O(N) oracle query complexity of QSearch when a solution exists. However, it is able to determine when no solution exists, with certainty, using only O(N) oracle calls.

There are two types of quantum walks. One is the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in long time.

TI Quantum State Tomography of Qudits via Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a method to perform the quantum state tomography (QST) of an n-partite qudit state embedded in single photons based on the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between the target photon and ancillary probe light. Our method requires only passive beam splitters in the target modes by shifting all of the active devices used in conventional QST methods to the probe preparation system. This feature is useful when the active optical devices for QST have large optical losses. Moreover, even when the probe is prepared by a laser light having a mode mismatch with the target photon, the method offers an accurate estimation of the target state. As a proof-of-principle, we perform the experimental demonstration using a polarization qubit. Regardless of the photon statistics of the probe light, the estimated results of state reconstruction are as accurate as those verified by the conventional QST.

TI Open-loop quantum control of small-size networks for high-order
   cumulants and cross-correlations sensing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum control techniques are one of the most efficient tools for attaining high-fidelity quantum operations and a convenient approach for quantum sensing and quantum noise spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate dynamical decoupling while processing an entangling two-qubit gate based on an Ising-xx interaction, each qubit affected by pure dephasing classical correlated 1/f-noises. To evaluate the gate error, we used the Magnus expansion introducing generalized filter functions that describe decoupling while processing and allow us to derive an approximate analytic expression as a hierarchy of nested integrals of noise cumulants. The error is separated in contributions of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, with the corresponding generalized filter functions calculated up to the fourth order. By exploiting the properties of selected pulse sequences, we show that it is possible to extract the second-order statistics (spectrum and cross-spectrum) and to highlight non-Gaussian features contained in the fourth-order cumulant. We discuss the applicability of these results to state-of-the-art small networks based on solid-state platforms.

TI A QUBO formulation for top-τ eigencentrality nodes
SO PLOS ONE
AB The efficient calculation of the centrality or "hierarchy" of nodes in a network has gained great relevance in recent years due to the generation of large amounts of data. The eigenvector centrality (aka eigencentrality) is quickly becoming a good metric for centrality due to both its simplicity and fidelity. In this work we lay the foundations for solving the eigencentrality problem of ranking the importance of the nodes of a network with scores from the eigenvector of the network, using quantum computational paradigms such as quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing. The problem is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that can be solved on both quantum architectures. The results focus on correctly identifying a given number of the most important nodes in numerous networks given by the sparse vector solution of our QUBO formulation of the problem of identifying the top-tau highest eigencentrality nodes in a network on both the D-Wave and IBM quantum computers.

TI Quantum Edge Detection in Digital Imaging: A Novel Approach Using
   Quantum Exponential Entropy
SO TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
AB Quantum image processing is for the application of quantum computing and algorithms to the solution of various problems. Classical edge detection algorithms are generally effective but are prone to performing poorly in the handling of large sets of data and high-resolution pictures, which could degrade performance. Quantum computing can significantly increase efficiency and hasten breakthroughs in various sectors, thus making it an appealing solution for complex image processing problems. Automated methods for the processing and analysis of medical pictures can significantly benefit medics in the therapeutic and diagnostic process. Here, the difficult problem of edge detection in medical pictures is specifically addressed through the introduction of new multilevel solutions based on quantum image representations of the one-dimensional histograms of the distributions of gray levels. Our methods use the quantum exponential entropy approach to the determination of the quantum information in image histograms, allowing us to recognize and study subtle details within medical pictures on the quantum level. To establish the efficiency of the approaches presented, we approach comparative analysis in comparison to the classic techniques through the application of the varied sets of medical pictures. Experiment results show unequivocal proof for the efficiency of our approaches, illustrating the possibility for our new multilevel techniques based on quantum image representations and the quantum exponential entropy approach to the determination of the quantum information in image histograms to outclass the currently used techniques of edge detection in medical pictures. Through the enhancement of the precision and the efficiency of the detection of the edges, our work fosters the additional ongoing research in the topic of the automated techniques of quantum medical image analysis.

TI Weak-measurement-based pseudospin pointer: A cost-effective scheme for
   precision measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB As an essential component of state-of-the-art quantum technologies, fast and efficient quantum measurements are in persistent demand over time. Here, we present a precision measurement scheme for weak signals. We propose a dimensionless pseudo -spin pointer based on weak measurement which effectively converts a continuous measurement into a discrete one. We demonstrate experimentally that a weak perturbation of the parametric distribution's moment can be retrieved efficiently by employing the pointer without measuring the distribution literally. The results show that for signals three to four orders weaker in strength than the area -array camera method, an order of improvement in precision is achieved experimentally. We expect that this method can be effectively loaded into various quantum systems and promote the development of quantum precision measurement or quantum computing.

TI Reconstructing Quantum States With Quantum Reservoir Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Reconstructing quantum states is an important task for various emerging quantum technologies. The process of reconstructing the density matrix of a quantum state is known as quantum state tomography. Conventionally, tomography of arbitrary quantum states is challenging as the paradigm of efficient protocols has remained in applying specific techniques for different types of quantum states. Here, we introduce a quantum state tomography platform based on the framework of reservoir computing. It forms a quantum neural network and operates as a comprehensive device for reconstructing an arbitrary quantum state (finite-dimensional or continuous variable). This is achieved with only measuring the average occupation numbers in a single physical setup, without the need of any knowledge of optimum measurement basis or correlation measurements.

TI Symmetry-Related Topological Phases and Applications: From Classical to
   Quantum Regimes
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Topological phase has received considerable attention in recent decades. One of the crucial factors to determine the phase is symmetry. Such a concept involves mathematical, geometrical, and physical meanings, which displays many fascinating phases in Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. In this paper, we first briefly review the symmetry-related topological phases in Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. The study in this section focuses on the topological phase itself, not the realizations therein. Then, we present a thorough review of the observations about these symmetry-related topological phenomena in classical platforms. Accompanied by the rise of quantum technology, the combination of symmetry-related topological phase and quantum technology leads to an additional new avenue, in which quantum information tasks can be accomplished better. Finally, we provide comments about future research into symmetry-related topological phases.

TI Asymmetric Post-Quantum Digital Signature Scheme with k-ary Verkle Trees
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Many public key cryptosystems in use today run the risk of being broken as quantum computing develops, affecting the security of popular commercial applications. Although there are possible defenses against quantum assaults, their complexity and inefficiency make them unsuitable for daily usage. This article discusses asymmetric hash-based digital signature algorithms, focusing on the symmetric and balanced structure achieved through the use of k-ary Verkle trees and lattice-based vector commitments. The study investigates the new concepts using vector commitments, a Verkle tree, and k-ary Verkle tree, which enhance efficiency and scalability while maintaining a symmetric structure in cryptographic proofs. Using cutting-edge Verkle tree technology, the authors of this paper provide a novel approach to creating a digital signature system. This is accomplished by using vector commitments, a k-ary Verkle tree, Verkle tree, and lattice-based vector commitments for post-quantum characteristics. The study also presents the ideas for designing post-quantum signatures using a k-ary Verkle tree, emphasizing the symmetry in tree structures and the balance between security and efficiency in asymmetric cryptographic systems.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated entangled photon-pair sources are key elements for enabling large-scale quantum photonic solutions and address the challenges of both scaling-up and stability. Here we report the first demonstration of an energy-time entangled photon-pair source based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in silicon-based platform-stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si3N4)-through an optically induced second-order (chi((2))) nonlinearity, ensuring type-0 quasi-phase-matching of fundamental harmonic and its second-harmonic inside the waveguide. The developed source shows a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 1635 for 8 mu W pump power. We report two-photon interference with remarkable near-perfect visibility of 99.36 +/- 1.94%, showing high-quality photonic entanglement without excess background noise. This opens a new horizon for quantum technologies requiring the integration of a large variety of building functionalities on a single chip.

TI Toward the Speed Limit of High-Fidelity Two-Qubit Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Most implementations of quantum gate operations rely on external control fields to drive the evolution of the quantum system. Generating these control fields requires significant efforts to design the suitable control Hamiltonians. Furthermore, any error in the control fields reduces the fidelity of the implemented control operation with respect to the ideal target operation. Achieving sufficiently fast gate operations at low error rates remains therefore a huge challenge. In this Letter, we present a novel approach to overcome this challenge by eliminating, for specific gate operations, the time-dependent control fields entirely. This approach appears useful for maximizing the speed of the gate operation while simultaneously eliminating relevant sources of errors. We present an experimental demonstration of the concept in a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature.

TI Low-depth phase oracle using a parallel piecewise circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We explore the important task of applying a phase exp(i f (x)) to a computational basis state |x). The closely related task of rotating a target qubit by an angle depending on f (x) is also studied. Such operations are key in many quantum subroutines, and frequently f (x) can be well approximated by a piecewise function; examples range from the application of diagonal Hamiltonian terms (such as the Coulomb interaction) in grid-based many-body simulation to derivative pricing algorithms. Here, we exploit a parallelization of the piecewise approach so that all constituent elementary rotations are performed simultaneously, that is, we achieve a total rotation depth of one. Moreover, we explore the use of recursive catalyst "towers" to implement these elementary rotations efficiently. We find that strategies prioritizing execution speed can achieve circuit depth as low as O(log2 n+ log2 S) for a register of n qubits and a piecewise approximation of S sections (presuming prior preparation of enabling resource states), albeit total qubit count then scales with S. In the limit of multiple repetitions of the oracle, we find that catalyst tower approaches have an O(S n) T-count.

TI Experimental quantum natural gradient optimization in photonics
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) combining the advantages of parameterized quantum circuits and clas-sical optimizers, promise practical quantum applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The perfor-mance of VQAs heavily depends on the optimization method. Compared with gradient-free and ordinary gradient descent methods, the quantum natural gradient (QNG), which mir-rors the geometric structure of the parameter space, can achieve faster convergence and avoid local minima more easily, thereby reducing the cost of circuit executions. We uti-lized a fully programmable photonic chip to experimentally estimate the QNG in photonics for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. We obtained the dissociation curve of the He-H+ cation and achieved chemical accuracy, verifying the outperformance of QNG optimization on a photonic device. Our work opens up a vista of utilizing QNG in photonics to implement practical near-term quantum applications.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Hyperparameter importance and optimization of quantum neural networks
   across small datasets
SO MACHINE LEARNING
AB As restricted quantum computers become available, research focuses on finding meaningful applications. For example, in quantum machine learning, a special type of quantum circuit called a quantum neural network is one of the most investigated approaches. However, we know little about suitable circuit architectures or important model hyperparameters for a given task. In this work, we apply the functional ANOVA framework to the quantum neural network architectures to analyze which of the quantum machine learning hyperparameters are most influential for their predictive performance. We restrict our study to 7 open-source datasets from the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark, which are small enough for simulations on quantum hardware with fewer than 20 qubits. Using this framework, three main levels of importance were identified, confirming expected patterns and revealing new insights. For instance, the learning rate is identified as the most important hyperparameter on all datasets, whereas the particular choice of entangling gates used is found to be the least important on all except for one dataset. In addition to identifying the relevant hyperparameters, for each of them, we also learned data-driven priors based on values that perform well on previously seen datasets, which can then be used to steer hyperparameter optimization processes. We utilize these priors in the hyperparameter optimization method hyperband and show that these improve performance against uniform sampling across all datasets by, on average, 0.53%, up to 6.11%, in cross-validation accuracy. We also demonstrate that such improvements hold on average regardless of the configuration hyperband is run with. Our work introduces new methodologies for studying quantum machine learning models toward quantum model selection in practice. All research code is made publicly available.

TI Reducing molecular electronic Hamiltonian simulation cost for linear
   combination of unitaries approaches
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We consider different linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions for molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. Using these LCU decompositions for Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum computer, the main figure of merit is the 1-norm of their coefficients, which is associated with the quantum circuit complexity. It is derived that the lowest possible LCU 1-norm for a given Hamiltonian is half of its spectral range. This lowest norm decomposition is practically unattainable for general Hamiltonians; therefore, multiple practical techniques to generate LCU decompositions are proposed and assessed. A technique using symmetries to reduce the 1-norm further is also introduced. In addition to considering LCU in the Schrodinger picture, we extend it to the interaction picture, which substantially further reduces the 1-norm.

TI Evaluating integration methods of a quantum random number generator in
   OpenSSL for TLS
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a significant threat to conventional cryptography. Whilst post-quantum cryptography (PQC) stands as the prevailing trend for fortifying the security of cryptographic systems, the coexistence of quantum and classical computing paradigms presents an opportunity to leverage the strengths of both technologies, for instance, nowadays the use of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) - considered as True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) - opens up the possibility of discussing hybrid systems. In this paper, we evaluate both aspects, on the one hand, we use hybrid TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol that leverages the widely used secure protocol on the Internet and integrates PQC algorithms, and, on the other hand, we evaluate two approaches to integrate a QRNG, i.e., Quantis PCIe-240M, in OpenSSL 3.0 to be used by TLS. Both approaches are compared through a Nginx Web server, that uses OpenSSL's implementation of TLS 1.3 for secure web communication. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing such integration method, because while direct integration can lead to performance penalties specific to the method and hardware used, alternative methods demonstrate the potential for efficient QRNG deployment in cryptographic systems.

TI Relation Between Quantum Advantage in Supervised Learning and Quantum
   Computational Advantage
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The widespread use of machine learning has raised the question of quantum supremacy for supervised learning as compared to quantum computational advantage. In fact, a recent work shows that computational and learning advantages are, in general, not equivalent, i.e., the additional information provided by a training set can reduce the hardness of some problems. This article investigates under which conditions they are found to be equivalent or, at least, highly related. This relation is analyzed by considering two definitions of learning speed-up: one tied to the distribution and another that is distribution-independent. In both cases, the existence of efficient algorithms to generate training sets emerges as the cornerstone of such conditions, although, for the distribution-independent definition, additional mild conditions must also be met. Finally, these results are applied to prove that there is a quantum speed-up for some learning tasks based on the prime factorization problem, assuming the classical intractability of this problem.

TI Slow measurement-only dynamics of entanglement in Pauli subsystem codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the nonunitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy that scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (i.e., disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (i.e., become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits in which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our paper is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes for which subsystem symmetries are nonlocally generated, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.

TI Design of quantum approximation optimization algorithm for the maximum
   cut problem
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The max-cut problem (MCP) is a classic problem in the field of combinatorial optimization and has important applications in various fields, including statistical physics and image processing. However, except for some special cases, the MCP still encounters a non-deterministic polynomial complete problem (an NP-complete problem), and there is currently no known efficient classical algorithm that can solve it in polynomial time. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), as a pivotal algorithm in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, has shown significant potential for solving the MCP. However, due to the lack of quantum error correction, the reliability of computations in NISQ systems sharply declines as the circuit depth of the algorithm increases. Therefore, designing an efficient, shallow-depth, and low-complexity QAOA for the MCP is a critical challenge in demonstrating the advantages of quantum computing in the NISQ era.<br /> In this paper, according to the standard QAOA algorithm, we introduce Pauli Y rotation gates into the target Hamiltonian circuit for the MCP. By enhancing the flexibility of quantum trial functions and improving the efficiency of Hilbert space exploration within a single iteration, we significantly improve the performance of QAOA on the MCP.<br /> We conduct extensive numerical simulations using the MindSpore quantum platform, and compare the proposed RY-layer-assisted QAOA with standard QAOA and its existing variants, including MA-QAOA and QAOA+. The experiments are performed on various graph types, including complete graphs, 3-regular graphs, 4-regular graphs, and random graphs with edge probabilities between 0.3 and 0.5. Our results show that the RY-layer-assisted QAOA achieves higher approximation ratios in all graph types, particularly in regular and random graphs, where traditional QAOA variants are difficult to implement. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits strong robustness as the graph size increases, and can maintain high performance even for larger graphs. Importantly, the RY-layer-assisted QAOA requires fewer CNOT gates and has a lower circuit depth than the standard QAOA and its variants, making it more suitable for NISQ devices with limited coherence times and high error rates. In conclusion, the RY-layer-assisted QAOA provides a promising approach for solving MCP in the NISQ era. By improving the approximation ratio while reducing circuit complexity, this method demonstrates significant potential for practical quantum computing applications, thus paving the way for developing more efficient and reliable quantum optimization algorithms.

TI Approaching Collateral Optimization for NISQ and Quantum-Inspired
   Computing (May 2023)
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Collateral optimization refers to the systematic allocation of financial assets to satisfy obligations or secure transactions while simultaneously minimizing costs and optimizing the usage of available resources. This involves assessing the number of characteristics, such as the cost of funding and quality of the underlying assets to ascertain the optimal collateral quantity to be posted to cover exposure arising from a given transaction or a set of transactions. One of the common objectives is to minimize the cost of collateral required to mitigate the risk associated with a particular transaction or a portfolio of transactions while ensuring sufficient protection for the involved parties. Often, this results in a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem. In this study, we initially present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the collateral optimization problem, followed by a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation in order to pave the way toward approaching the problem in a hybrid-quantum and noisy intermediate-scale quantum-ready way. We conduct local computational small-scale tests using various software development kits and discuss the behavior of our formulations as well as the potential for performance enhancements. We find that while the QUBO-based approaches fail to find the global optima in the small-scale experiments, they are reasonably close suggesting their potential for large instances. We further survey the recent literature that proposes alternative ways to attack combinatorial optimization problems suitable for collateral optimization.

TI Noisy quantum trees: infinite protection without correction
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We study quantum networks with tree structures, in which information propagates from a root to leaves. At each node in the network, the received qubit unitarily interacts with fresh ancilla qubits, after which each qubit is sent through a noisy channel to a different node in the next level. Therefore, as the tree depth grows, there is a competition between the irreversible effect of noise and the protection against such noise achieved by the delocalization of information. In the classical setting, where each node simply copies the input bit into multiple output bits, this model has been studied as the broadcasting or reconstruction problem on trees, which has broad applications. In this work, we study the quantum version of this problem. We consider a Clifford encoder at each node that encodes the input qubit in a stabilizer code, along with a single qubit Pauli noise channel at each edge. Such noisy quantum trees describe a scenario in which one has access to a stream of fresh (low-entropy) ancilla qubits, but cannot perform error correction. Therefore, they provide a different perspective on quantum fault tolerance. Furthermore, they provide a useful model for describing the effect of noise within the encoders of concatenated codes. We prove that above certain noise thresholds, which depend on the properties of the code such as its distance, as well as the properties of the encoder, information decays exponentially with the depth of the tree. On the other hand, by studying certain efficient decoders, we prove that for codes with distance d >= 2 and for sufficiently small (but non-zero) noise, classical information and entanglement propagate over a noisy tree with infinite depth. Indeed, we find that this remains true even for binary trees with certain 2-qubit encoders at each node, which encodes the received qubit in the binary repetition code with distance d = 1.

TI Coupled Harmonic Oscillator in a System of Free Particles
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The coupled quantum harmonic oscillator is one of the most researched and important model systems in quantum optics and quantum informatics. This system is often investigated for quantum entanglement in the environment. As a result, such studies are complex and can only be carried out using numerical methods that do not reveal the general pattern of such systems. In this work, the external environment is considered to be two independent particles interacting with coupled harmonic oscillators. It is shown that such a system has an exact analytical solution to the dynamic Schrodinger equation. The analysis of this solution is carried out, and the main parameters of this system are revealed. The solutions obtained can be used to study more complex systems and their quantum entanglement.

AB Maintaining data confidentiality at the asymmetric-resource devices across emerging technologies needs varying cryptographic algorithms. Quantum computing makes preserving data confidentiality across asymmetric infrastructure more difficult. However, exploiting the architecture of classical cryptographic schemes to integrate the post-quantum constructs could be used to maintain post-quantum level confidentiality over the Internet. This paper presents a post-quantum secure classical ABE-IBE proxy re-encryption scheme (L_ABE-IBE PRE) that utilizes the classical ABE-IBE proxy re-encryption capabilities at the end nodes in a system and raises the data confidentiality to post-quantum secure level over the Internet. The proposed L ABE-IBE PRE transforms a ciphertext of the classical ABE scheme to a post-quantum secure ciphertext and from a postquantum secure ciphertext to a ciphertext of the classical IBE scheme. We compare our proposed L_ABE-IBE PRE scheme with classical ABE-IBE proxy re-encryption schemes, including Encryption Switching ABE-IBE (ES.ABE-IBE) scheme (He et al., 2019). We discuss the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme.

TI Error budgeting for a controlled-phase gate with strontium-88 Rydberg
   atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the implementation of a high fidelity controlled-phase gate in a Rydberg quantum computer. The protocol is based on a symmetric gate with respect to the two qubits as experimentally realized by Levine et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 170503 (2019)], but allows for arbitrary pulse shapes with time-dependent detuning. Optimizing the pulse shapes, we introduce laser pulses which shorten the time spent in the Rydberg state by 10% and reduce the leading contribution to the gate infidelity, i.e., the decay from the Rydberg state. Remarkably, this reduction can be achieved for smooth pulses in detuning and smooth turning on of the Rabi frequency as required in any experimental realization. We carefully analyze the influence of fundamental error sources such as the photon recoil and the microscopic interaction potential, as well as the harmonic trapping of the atoms for an experimentally realistic setup based on strontium-88 atoms. We find that an average gate fidelity above 99.9% is possible for a very conservative estimation of experimental parameters.

TI Suppressed paramagnetism in amorphous
   Ta2O5-x oxides and its link to
   superconducting-qubit performance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Amorphous-oxide layers in thin-film capacitors are linked to reduced transmon-qubit T-1 coherence times. Ta-based capacitors outperform Nb-based ones, suggesting that amorphous Ta2O5-x is less lossy than Nb2O5-x. We investigate the microscopic features of these amorphous oxides using ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional theory, revealing the origins of the superior performance of Ta2O5-x. We establish that oxygen deficiency is less likely to occur in amorphous Ta2O5-x than in Nb2O5-x for 0 <= x <= 0.25 and that for a given oxygen deficiency x, metal Ta-Ta bond formation is enhanced. Such bonds, which are accommodated by structural flaws in the amorphous network, capture electrons better than in amorphous Nb2O5-x. These thermochemical differences quench or highly suppress magnetic moments in amorphous Ta2O5-x and eliminate a potential source of quasiparticles and magnetic flux noise. We also show that hyperfine couplings between Nb nuclei and local magnetic moments in Nb2O5-x can form "two-level systems" (TLSs) or "two-level fluctuators" with energy splittings of 100-1000 MHz or higher. This reveals a TLS mechanism in amorphous Nb2O5-x oxide layers that is likely inactive in Ta2O5-x. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the materials chemistry and limitations imposed by native oxides of superconducting qubits that can be used to guide materials selection and processing.

TI Hidden Single-Qubit Topological Phase Transition without Gap Closing in
   Anisotropic Light-Matter Interactions
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Conventionally the occurrence of topological phase transitions (TPTs) requires gap closing, whereas there are also unconventional cases without need of gap closing. Although traditionally TPTs lie in many-body systems in condensed matter, both cases of TPTs may find analogs in few-body systems. Indeed, the ground-state node number provides a topological classification for single-qubit systems. While the no-node theorem of spinless systems is shown to restrict the fundamental quantum Rabi model in light-matter interactions, it is demonstrated that the limitation of the no-node theorem can be broken not only in small counter-rotating terms (CRTs) but also in the large-CRT regime, which striates a rich phase diagram with different TPTs. While these transitions are mostly accompanied with gap closing and parity reversal, a hidden node-phase transition is revealed that has neither gap closing nor parity change, which turns out to be an analog of the unconventional TPT in condensed matter. A hysteresis sign for the unconventional TPT is unveiled via the transition from phase squeezing to amplitude squeezing in the gapped phase. The imprints in the Wigner function are also addressed. The clarified mechanisms provide some special insights for the subtle role of the CRTs.

TI Single photon randomness originating from the symmetric dipole emission
   pattern of quantum emitters
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum random number generation is a key ingredient for quantum cryptography and fundamental quantum optics and could advance Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning. An established generation scheme is based on single photons impinging on a beam splitter. Here, we experimentally demonstrate quantum random number generation solely based on the symmetric emission profile of a dipole aligned orthogonal to the laboratory frame. The demonstration builds on defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride that emit photons in random directions within the dipole emission profile and benefits from the ability to manipulate and align the emission directionality. We prove the randomness in correlated photon detection events making use of the NIST randomness test suite and show that the randomness remains for two independently emitting defect centers. The scheme can be extended to random number generation by coherent single photons with potential applications in solid-state based quantum communication at room temperature. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Quantum process tomography of a Molmer-Sorensen gate via a global beam
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a framework for quantum process tomography of two-ion interactions that leverages modulations of the trapping potential and composite pulses from a global laser beam to achieve individual-ion addressing. Tomographic analysis of identity and delay processes reveals dominant error contributions from laser decoherence and slow qubit frequency drift during the tomography experiment. We use this framework on two co-trapped Ca-40(+) ions to analyze both an optimized and an overpowered Molmer-Sorensen gate and to compare the results of this analysis to a less informative Bell-state tomography measurement and to predictions based on a simplified noise model. These results show that the technique is effective for the characterization of two-ion quantum processes and for the extraction of meaningful information about the errors present in the system. The experimental convenience of this method will allow for more widespread use of process tomography for characterizing entangling gates in trapped-ion systems.

TI Examining Experimental Raman Mode Behavior in Mono- and Bilayer
   2H-TaSe2 via Density Functional Theory: Implications for
   Quantum Information Science
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Tantalum diselenide (TaSe2) is a metallic transition metal dichalcogenide whose structure and vibrational behavior strongly depend on temperature and thickness, and this behavior includes the emergence of charge density wave (CDW) states at very low temperatures. In this work, observed Raman modes for mono- and bilayer are described across several spectral regions and compared to those seen in the bulk case. These modes, which include an experimentally observed forbidden Raman mode and low-frequency CDWs, are then matched to corresponding vibrations predicted by density functional theory (DFT). The reported match between experimental and computational results supports the presented vibrational visualizations of these modes. Support is also provided by experimental phonons observed in additional Raman spectra as a function of temperature and thickness. These results highlight the importance of understanding CDWs since they are likely to play a fundamental role in the future realization of solid-state quantum information platforms based on nonequilibrium phenomena.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical reservoir computing of thermal convection flow
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We simulate the nonlinear chaotic dynamics of Lorenz-type models for a classical two-dimensional thermal convection flow with three and eight degrees of freedom by a hybrid quantum-classical reservoir computing model. The high-dimensional quantum reservoir dynamics are established by universal quantum gates that rotate and entangle the individual qubits of the tensor product quantum state. A comparison of the quantum reservoir computing model with its classical counterpart shows that the same prediction and reconstruction capabilities of classical reservoirs with thousands of perceptrons can be obtained by a few strongly entangled qubits. We demonstrate that the mean squared error between model output and ground truth in the test phase of the quantum reservoir computing algorithm increases when the reservoir is decomposed into separable subsets of qubits. Furthermore, the quantum reservoir computing model is implemented on a real noisy IBM quantum computer for up to seven qubits. Our work thus opens the door to model the dynamics of classical complex systems in a high-dimensional phase space effectively with an algorithm that requires a small number of qubits.

TI Quantum information engines: Bounds on performance metrics by
   measurement time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Information engines, sometimes referred to as Maxwell Demon engines, utilize information obtained through measurement to control the conversion of energy into useful work. Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement step to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure within the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement. We also discuss ways to extend our considerations using these concepts, such as in measurement-enhanced photochemical reactions.

TI General quantum correlation from nonreal values of Kirkwood-Dirac
   quasiprobability over orthonormal product bases
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We propose a characterization and a quantification of the general quantum correlation which is exhibited even by a separable (unentangled) mixed bipartite state in terms of the nonclassical values of the associated Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability. Such a general quantum correlation, wherein entanglement is a subset, is not only intriguing from a fundamental point of view, but it has also been recognized as a resource in a variety of schemes of quantum information processing and quantum technology. Given a bipartite state, we construct a quantity based on the imaginary part the associated KD quasiprobability defined over a pair of orthonormal product bases and an optimization procedure over all pairs of such bases. We show that it satisfies certain requirements expected for a quantifier of general quantum correlations. It gives a lower bound to the total sum of the quantum standard deviation of all the elements of the product (local) basis, minimized over all such bases. It suggests an interpretation as the minimum genuine quantum share of uncertainty in all local von-Neumann projective measurements. Moreover, it is a faithful witness for entanglement and measurement-induced nonlocality of pure bipartite states. We then discuss a variational scheme for its estimation, and based on this, we offer information theoretical meanings of the general quantum correlation. Our results suggest a deep connection between the nonclassical concept of general quantum correlation and the nonclassical values of the KD quasiprobability and the associated strange weak values.

TI Doubly Optimal Parallel Wire Cutting without Ancilla Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A restriction in the quality and quantity of available qubits presents a substantial obstacle to the application of near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers in practical tasks. To confront this challenge, some techniques for effectively augmenting the system size through classical processing have been proposed; one promising approach is quantum circuit cutting. The main idea of quantum circuit cutting is to decompose an original circuit into smaller subcircuits and combine outputs from these subcircuits to recover the original output. Although this approach enables us to simulate larger quantum circuits beyond physically available circuits, it needs classical overheads quantified by two metrics: the sampling overhead in the number of measurements to reconstruct the original output, and the number of channels in the decomposition. Thus, it is crucial to devise a decomposition method that minimizes both of these metrics, thereby reducing the overall execution time. This paper studies the problem of decomposing the n-qubit identity channel, i.e., n-parallel wire cutting, into a set of local operations and classical communication; then we give an optimal wire-cutting method composed of channels based on mutually unbiased bases that achieves minimal overheads in both the sampling overhead and the number of channels, without ancilla qubits. This is in stark contrast to the existing method that achieves the optimal sampling overhead yet with ancilla qubits. Moreover, we derive a tight lower bound on the number of channels in parallel wire cutting without ancilla systems and show that only our method achieves this lower bound among the existing methods. Notably, our method shows an exponential improvement in the number of channels, compared to the aforementioned ancilla-assisted method that achieves optimal sampling overhead. Our work significantly alleviates the additional overheads for the wire-cutting method and may provide essential components for the early success of quantum computing.

TI The α → 1 limit of the sharp quantum Renyi divergence
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Fawzi and Fawzi [Quantum 5, 387 (2021)] recently defined the sharp Renyi divergence, D-alpha(#), for alpha epsilon (1, infinity), as an additional quantum Renyi divergence with nice mathematical properties and applications in quantum channel discrimination and quantum communication. One of their open questions was the limit alpha -> 1 of this divergence. By finding a new expression of the sharp divergence in terms of a minimization of the geometric Renyi divergence, we show that this limit is equal to the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. Analogous minimizations of arbitrary generalized divergences lead to a new family of generalized divergences that we call kringel divergences for which we prove various properties, including the data-processing inequality.

TI A square-root speedup for finding the smallest eigenvalue
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We describe a quantum algorithm for finding the smallest eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix. This algorithm combines quantum phase estimation and quantum amplitude estimation to achieve a quadratic speedup with respect to the best classical algorithm in terms of matrix dimensionality, i.e. (O)over tilde(N/epsilon)( 9) black-box queries to an oracle encoding the matrix, where N is the matrix dimension and epsilon is the desired precision. In contrast, the best classical algorithm for the same task requires Omega(N)polylog(1/epsilon) queries. In addition, this algorithm allows the user to select any constant success probability. We also provide a similar algorithm with the same runtime that allows us to prepare a quantum state lying mostly in the matrix's low-energy subspace. We implement simulations of both algorithms and demonstrate their application to problems in quantum chemistry and materials science.

TI Multi-channel Hong-Ou-Mandle interference between independent comb-based
   weak coherent pulses
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB With the widespread application of quantum communication technology, there is an urgent need to enhance unconditionally secure key rates and capacity. Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), proven to be immune to detection-side channel attacks, is a secure and reliable quantum communication scheme. The core of this scheme is Hong-Ou-Mandle (HOM) interference, a quantum optical phenomenon with no classical analog, where identical photons meeting on a symmetric beam splitter (BS) undergo interference and bunching. Any differences in the degrees of freedom (frequency, arrival time, spectrum, polarization, and the average number of photons per pulse) between the photons will deteriorate the interference visibility. Here, we demonstrate 16-channel weak coherent pulses (WCPs) of HOM interference with all channels' interference visibility over 46% based on two independent frequency-post-aligned soliton microcombs (SMCs). In our experiment, full locking and frequency alignment of the comb teeth between the two SMCs were achieved through pump frequency stabilization, SMC repetition rate locking, and fine tuning of the repetition rate. This demonstrates the feasibility of using independently generated SMCs as multi-wavelength sources for quantum communication. Meanwhile, SMC can achieve hundreds of frequency-stable comb teeth by locking only two parameters, which further reduces the complexity of frequency locking and the need for finding sufficient suitable frequency references compared to independent laser arrays.

TI Single-photon emission from silicon-vacancy color centers in
   polycrystalline diamond membranes
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Single-color centers in thin polycrystalline diamond membranes allow the platform to be used in integrated quantum photonics, hybrid quantum systems, and other complex functional materials. While single-crystal diamond membranes are still technologically challenging to fabricate as they cannot be grown on a non-diamond substrate, free-standing polycrystalline diamond membranes can be conveniently fabricated at large-scale from nanocrystalline diamond seeds on a substrate that can be selectively etched. However, their practical application for quantum photonics is so far limited by crystallographic defects, impurities, graphitic grain boundaries, small grain sizes, scattering loss, and strain. In this paper, we report on a single-photon source based on silicon-vacancy color centers in a polycrystalline diamond membrane. We discuss the spectroscopic approach and quantify the photon statistics, obtaining a g(2)(0) approximate to 0.04. Our findings hold promise for introducing polycrystalline diamond to quantum photonics and hybrid quantum systems.

   Precision
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A robust single-molecule light-emitting diode (SM-LED) with high color purity, linear polarization, and efficiency tunability is prepared by covalently integrating one fluorescent molecule into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Furthermore, single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer from the electroluminescent center to different accepters is achieved through rational molecular engineering, enabling construction of a multicolor SM-LED. All these characterizations are accomplished in the photoelectrical integration system with high temporal/spatial/energy resolution, demonstrating the capability of the single-photon emission of SM-LEDs. The success in developing high-performance SM-LEDs inspires the development of the next generation of commercial display devices and promises a single-photon emitter for use in quantum computation and quantum communication.

TI Robust thermal correlations induced by spin-orbit interactions
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this work, we demonstrate that the thermal nonclassical correlations can enhance and become more stable under the magnetic field and second-order spin-orbit interaction effect. Also, we show that the local quantum uncertainty measure can reveal purely quantum correlations beyond other quantifiers of correlations. Our analytical model describes a Heisenberg XYZ two-spin system with an inhomogeneous magnetic field and spin-orbit interaction. A special emphasis is devoted to local quantum uncertainty, concurrence, and Bell-nonlocality measures to investigate the correlations of the bipartite-system at the equilibrium temperature. Our results indicate that temperature, magnetic field, and magnetic field inhomogeneity with DMI and Kaplan- Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) exchanges all play a role in determining the degree of correlation between the quantum spins to some extent. The KSEA interaction greatly enhances the quantum correlation in the system whereas quantum quantifiers are more stable under the influence of the external magnetic field, especially when inhomogeneous and homogeneous magnetic field are near to zero. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the thermal LQU captures a stronger quantum correlation than the Bell-nonlocality and entanglement measures.

TI New coding scheme to compile circuits for Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm by genetic evolution
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Compiling quantum circuits on target quantum hardware architectures is one of the key issues in the development of quantum algorithms, and the related problem is known as the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem (QCCP). This paper presents a genetic algorithm for solving QCCP instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA). In particular, such instances represent quantum circuits for the resolution of both MaxCut and Graph-Coloring combinatorial problems. The presented algorithm represents a significant improvement over an already existing genetic algorithm called Decomposition Based Genetic Algorithm (DBGA), and is characterized by a completely new coding scheme that allows to reduce the number of SWAP gates introduced in the decoding step, consequently reducing the circuit depth. After providing a description of the problem, this paper presents the newly produced genetic algorithm (termed DBGA-X) in detail, especially focusing on the new coding/decoding scheme. Subsequently, a set of results will be presented that demonstrate the superior performance of the new method compared with the results obtained from recent literature against the same benchmark. In addition, new benchmarks characterized by larger quantum architectures and by a higher number of compilation passes are proposed in this paper, to the aim of testing the scalability of the proposed method in more realistic scenarios.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI Experimental demonstration of enhanced quantum tomography via quantum
   reservoir processing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning is a rapidly advancing discipline that leverages the features of quantum mechanics to enhance the performance of computational tasks. Quantum reservoir processing (QRP), which allows efficient optimization of a single output layer without precise control over the quantum system, stands out as one of the most versatile and practical quantum machine learning techniques. Here we experimentally demonstrate a QRP approach for continuous-variable state reconstruction on a bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics platform. The scheme learns the true dynamical process through a minimum set of measurement outcomes of a known set of initial states. We show that the map learnt this way achieves high reconstruction fidelity for several test states, offering significantly enhanced performance over using a map calculated based on an idealized model of the system. This is due to a key feature of reservoir processing which accurately accounts for physical non-idealities such as decoherence, spurious dynamics, and systematic errors. Our results present a valuable tool for robust bosonic state and process reconstruction, concretely demonstrating the power of QRP in enhancing real-world applications.

TI Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and
   Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes, however, strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.

CT 19th International Conference on Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT)
CY JUL 11-13, 2022
CL Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB Lattice-based cryptography is believed to be a promising candidate for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The NIST announced that the third-round finalists in the standardization project of PQC (NIST-PQC) and four out of seven finalists are lattice-based cryptography. An implementation is desired that is resistant to side-channel analysis for the widespread use of lattice-based cryptography. This paper studies possible side-channel analysis on the signature scheme MLWRSign, a lattice-based signature scheme. We apply differential power analysis to the implementation of MLWRSign to specify all the sensitive parts. The experimental results show that only Karatsuba and Toom-Cook multiplications can be vulnerable to DPA with the Hamming weight power consumption model. Furthermore, we propose masking countermeasures for multiplication: inter-functional and intra-functional masking. Our lightweight countermeasure is beneficial to further enhance the security of post-quantum cryptography, which is naturally resistant to side-channel attacks.

TI Rolled-Up Quantum Wells Composed of Nanolayered InGaAs/GaAs
   Heterostructures as Optical Materials for Quantum Information Technology
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Strain-based band structure engineering is a powerful tool to tune the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures. We show that we can tune the band structure of InGaAs semiconductor quantum wells and modify the helicity of the emitted light by integrating them into rolled-up heterostructures and changing their geometrical configuration. Experimental results from photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy demonstrate a strong energy shift of the valence-band states in comparison to flat structures, as a consequence of an inversion of the heavy-hole with the light-hole states in a rolled-up InGaAs quantum well. The inversion and mixing of the band states lead to a strong change in the optical selection rules for the rolled-up quantum wells, which show vanishing spin polarization in the conduction band even under near-resonant excitation conditions. Band structure calculations are carried out to understand the changes in the electronic transitions and to predict the emission and absorption spectra for a given geometrical configuration. Comparison between experiment and theory shows an excellent agreement. These observed profound changes in the fundamental properties can be applied as a strategic route to develop novel optical devices for quantum information technology.

TI Carving entangled multiparticle states with exponentially improved
   fidelity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method that uses the "no-jump" evolution of a probe to generate entangled multiparticle states of high fidelity. The probe is coupled to a target ensemble of qubits and engineered to exponentially decay at a rate depending on the target collective spin, such that postselecting on observing no probe decay precisely removes select faster-decaying spin components. When a probe and N-qubit target interact via a cavity mode of cooperativity C, our procedure generates entangled states with infidelities of e-C/N, an exponential improvement over previous carving schemes. This scheme, which we call "counterfactual" carving, can generate complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum computing.

TI High-Q tunable orbital angular momentum radiation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Lasers and light emitters typically do not radiate fields with orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, the generation of single photons carrying OAM mainly relies on nonlinear processes in bulk crystals, which limits the scalability and efficiency of the source. To facilitate the realization of highly efficient OAM single-photon sources, we demonstrate a microresonator vortex emitter producing high-Q OAM vortex beams with the ability to precisely define the topological charge of the OAM mode. The phenomenon relies on the application of periodic perturbations on the nanobars, which generate a series of resonance modes in continuous guided spectra. Future developments of integrated quantum photonic devices with OAM single-photon sources may enable high-dimensional quantum information processing.

TI Partial Landau-Zener transitions and applications to qubit shuttling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The transition dynamics of two-state systems with time-dependent energy levels, first considered by Landau, Zener, Majorana, and St & uuml;ckelberg, is one of the basic models in quantum physics and has been used to describe various physical systems. We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability P between the two states, and can lead to a substantial reduction of P, being possible even to achieve P = 0 in an instructive extreme case, and also to large P even in the absence of any anticrossing point. The partial LZ model can describe valley transition dynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.

TI A Versatile Quantum Simulator for Coupled Oscillators Using a 1D Chain
   of Atoms Trapped near an Optical Nanofiber
SO PHOTONICS
AB The transversely confined propagating light modes of a nanophotonic optical waveguide or nanofiber can effectively mediate infinite-range forces. We show that for a linear chain of particles trapped within the waveguide's evanescent field, transverse illumination with a suitable set of laser frequencies should allow the implementation of a coupled-oscillator quantum simulator with time-dependent and widely controllable all-to-all interactions. Using the example of the energy spectrum of oscillators with simulated Coulomb interactions, we show that different effective coupling geometries can be emulated with high precision by proper choice of laser illumination conditions. Similarly, basic quantum gates can be selectively implemented between arbitrarily chosen pairs of oscillators in the energy as well as in the coherent-state basis. Key properties of the system dynamics and states can be monitored continuously by analysis of the out-coupled fiber fields.

TI Measuring the stress tensor in nitrogen-doped CVD diamond using
   solid-state quantum sensor
SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB We measured the residual stress tensor in a nitrogen-doped chemical vapor deposition (001) diamond film. The stress tensor was evaluated from the amount of the shift in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra of NV center in the diamond. A confocal microscopy setup was used to observe the spatial variation of the stress tensor in the diamond film. We found that the components of the stress tensor, sigma xy, sigma yz, sigma zx and sigma xx+ sigma yy+ sigma zz, of the residual stress were approximately 0.077, -0.39, -0.67 and 1.52 GPa, respectively, in the x = [100], y = [010], z = [001] coordinate system. Regarding the components of the shear stress, sigma xy, sigma yz and sigma zx, the nitrogen-doped CVD diamond film grown in this study had mainly sheared stress in the z-direction, which was the growth direction of the CVD diamond film. In addition, regarding axial stress sigma xx+ sigma yy+ sigma zz, the CVD diamond film was subjected to compressive stress. Due to this compressive stress, the volume of the CVD diamond film decreased by approximately 0.073%. We considered that nitrogen doping contributed to the decrease in volume of the CVD diamond film.

TI In the Shadow of the Hadamard Test: Using the Garbage State for Good and
   Further Modifications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Hadamard test is one of the pillars on which quantum algorithm development rests and, at the same time, is naturally suited for the intermediate regime between the current era of noisy quantum devices and complete fault tolerance. Its applications use measurements of the auxiliary qubit to extract information but disregard the system register completely. Concomitantly, but independently of this development, advances in quantum learning theory have enabled the efficient representation of quantum states via classical shadows. This Letter shows that, strikingly, putting both lines of thought into a new context results in substantial improvements to the Hadamard test on a single auxiliary readout qubit, by suitably exploiting classical shadows on the remaining n-qubit work register. We argue that this combination inherits the best of both worlds and discuss statistical phase estimation as a vignette application. At the same time, the framework is more general and applicable to a wide range of other algorithms. There, we can use the Hadamard test to estimate energies on the auxiliary qubit, while classical shadows on the system register provide access to additional features such as (i) the fidelity of the initial state with certain pure quantum states, (ii) the initial state's energy, and (iii) how pure and how close the initial state is to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Finally, we also discuss how anticontrolled unitaries can further augment this framework and explain how this Letter settles the exploitation of the Hadamard test for intermediate applications.

TI All-Optical Ultrafast Arbitrary Rotation of Hole Orbital Qubits with
   Direct Phase Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Complete quantum control of a stationary quantum bit embedded in a quantum emitter is crucial for photonic quantum information technologies. Recently, the orbital degree of freedom in optically active quantum dots has emerged as a promising candidate. However, the essential ability to perform arbitrary rotations on orbital qubits remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary rotation of a hole orbital qubit with direct phase control using picosecond optical pulses. This is achieved by inducing stimulated Raman transitions within Lambda systems coupled via radiative Auger processes. This new capability enables direct control of polar and azimuth angles of the Bloch vector without requiring timed precession. Our results establish orbital states in solid-state quantum emitters as a viable resource for applications in high-speed quantum information processing.

TI Demonstration of the Effectiveness of the Cascaded Variational Quantum
   Eigensolver Using the Jastrow Ansatz for Molecular Calculations
SO ACS OMEGA
AB We demonstrate how the cascaded variational quantum eigensolver (CVQE) can be applied to study molecular systems for the family of Jastrow ansatzes. Specifically, we applied CVQE to the water molecule. We find that CVQE has a number of advantages. In particular, our results show that CVQE requires 2 to 3 orders of magnitude fewer quantum computing (QC) executions than VQE for the water molecule. Furthermore, our results indicate that CVQE might provide some robustness against two-qubit gate errors given that the number of CNOT gates used in our calculation was similar to 300 and the errors in the QC calculations are still comparable to those obtained by VQE.

TI Epitaxial α-Ta (110) film on a-plane sapphire substrate for
   superconducting qubits on wafer scale
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Realization of practical superconducting quantum computing requires many qubits of long coherence time. Compared to the commonly used Ta deposited on c-plane sapphire, which occasionally form alpha-Ta (111) grains and beta-tantalum grains, high quality Ta (110) film can grow epitaxial on a-plane sapphire because of the atomic relationships at the interface. Well-ordered alpha -Ta (110) film on wafer-scale a-plane sapphire has been prepared. The film exhibits high residual resistance ratio. Transmon qubits fabricated using these film shows relaxation times exceeding 150 mu s. The results suggest Ta film on a-plane sapphire is a promising choice for long coherence time qubit on wafer scale.

TI Quantum Information Scrambling in Non-Markovian Open Quantum System
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a spin chain whose two end spins interact with two independent non-Markovian baths by using the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation approach. Specifically, two issues about information scrambling in an open quantum system are addressed. The first issue is that tripartite mutual information (TMI) can quantify information scrambling properly via its negative value in a closed system, whether it is still suitable to indicate information scrambling in an open quantum system. We find that negative TMI is not a suitable quantifier of information scrambling in an open quantum system in some cases, while negative tripartite logarithmic negativity (TLN) is an appropriate one. The second one is that up to now almost all information scrambling in open quantum systems reported were focus on a Markovian environment, while the effect of a non-Markovian environment on information scrambling is still elusive. Our results show that the memory effect of an environment will be beneficial to information scrambling. Moreover, it is found that the environment is generally detrimental for information scrambling in the long-term, while in some cases it will be helpful for information scrambling in the short-term.

TI Time-series quantum reservoir computing with weak and projective
   measurements
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Time-series processing is a major challenge in machine learning with enormous progress in the last years in tasks such as speech recognition and chaotic series prediction. A promising avenue for sequential data analysis is quantum machine learning, with computational models like quantum neural networks and reservoir computing. An open question is how to efficiently include quantum measurement in realistic protocols while retaining the needed processing memory and preserving the quantum advantage offered by large Hilbert spaces. In this work, we propose different measurement protocols and assess their efficiency in terms of resources, through theoretical predictions and numerical analysis. We show that it is possible to exploit the quantumness of the reservoir and to obtain ideal performance both for memory and forecasting tasks with two successful measurement protocols. One repeats part of the experiment after each projective measurement while the other employs weak measurements operating online at the trade-off where information can be extracted accurately and without hindering the needed memory, in spite of back-action effects. Our work establishes the conditions for efficient time-series processing paving the way to its implementation in different quantum technologies.

TI Hybrid coupling optomechanical assisted nonreciprocal photon blockade
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The properties of the open quantum system in quantum information is a science now extensively investigated more generally as a fundamental issue for a variety of applications. Usually, the states of the open quantum system might be disturbed by decoherence which will reduce the fidelity in the quantum information processing. So it is better to eliminate the influence of the environment. However, as part of the composite system, rational use of the environment system could be beneficial to quantum information processing. Here we theoretically studied the environment induced quantum nonlinearity and energy spectrum tuning method in the optomechanical system. And we found that the dissipation coupling of the hybrid dissipation and dispersion optomechanical system can induce the coupling between the environment and system in the cross-Kerr interaction form. When the symmetry is broken with a directional auxiliary field, the system exhibits the non-reciprocal behavior during the photon excitation and photon blockade for the clockwise and counterclockwise modes of the whispering gallery mode microcavity. Furthermore, we believe that the cross-Kerr coupling can be more widely used in quantum information processing and quantum simulation.

TI A novel quantum security multi-party extremum protocol in a
   d-dimensional quantum system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Secure multi-party extremum computation (SMEC) is a specific application scenario of secure multi-party computation, which allows multiple participants to compute the extremum of data without disclosing private information. The extremum includes maximum, minimum, sum of extremums, and difference of extremums. SMEC has wide applications in financial transactions, market analysis, sports events, healthcare, etc. Current protocol research mainly exists in the classical domain and cannot withstand quantum computing attacks. To address this issue, we propose a novel QSME protocol based on a d-dimensional quantum system, capable of computing the maximum and minimum values among multi-party data under unconditional security, and can compute the sum and difference of extremums without disclosing the maximum and minimum values, to adapt to complex application scenarios. The article proposes a coding method for a d-dimensional quantum system to further enhance security, provides correctness analysis, security analysis, robustness analysis, and comparative analysis, and proposes an experimental method for a d-dimensional quantum system to verify the effectiveness of the protocol, demonstrating strong practicality.

TI Quantum Circuit Architecture Search on a Superconducting Processor
SO ENTROPY
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have shown strong evidence to gain provable computational advantages in diverse fields such as finance, machine learning, and chemistry. However, the heuristic ansatz exploited in modern VQAs is incapable of balancing the trade-off between expressivity and trainability, which may lead to degraded performance when executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines. To address this issue, here, we demonstrate the first proof-of-principle experiment of applying an efficient automatic ansatz design technique, i.e., quantum architecture search (QAS), to enhance VQAs on an 8-qubit superconducting quantum processor. In particular, we apply QAS to tailor the hardware-efficient ansatz toward classification tasks. Compared with heuristic ans & auml;tze, the ansatz designed by QAS improves the test accuracy from 31% to 98%. We further explain this superior performance by visualizing the loss landscape and analyzing effective parameters of all ans & auml;tze. Our work provides concrete guidance for developing variable ans & auml;tze to tackle various large-scale quantum learning problems with advantages.

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum chemistry calculations such as the prediction of molecular properties and modeling of chemical reactions are a few of the critical areas where near-term quantum computers are speculated to showcase quantum advantage in select problems. We present a method to calculate energy derivatives for both ground state and excited state energies with respect to the parameters of a chemical system based on the framework of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). A low-depth implementation of quantum circuits within the hybrid variational paradigm is designed, and their computational costs are analyzed. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by incorporating it in some key quantum chemistry applications of energy derivatives, such as to perform minimum energy configuration search and estimate molecular response properties of H-2 molecule, and also to find the transition state of H-2 + H <-> H + H-2 reaction. The obtained results are shown to be in complete agreement with their respective full configuration interaction (FCI) values.

TI Exchange Coupling in a Linear Chain of Three Quantum-Dot Spin Qubits in
   Silicon
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum gates between spin qubits can be implemented leveraging the natural Heisenberg exchange interaction between two electrons in contact with each other. This interaction is controllable by electrically tailoring the overlap between electronic wave functions in quantum dot systems, as long as they occupy neighboring dots. An alternative route is the exploration of superexchange-the coupling between remote spins mediated by a third idle electron that bridges the distance between quantum dots. We experimentally demonstrate direct exchange coupling and provide evidence for second neighbor mediated superexchange in a linear array of three single-electron spin qubits in silicon, inferred from the electron spin resonance frequency spectra. We confirm theoretically, through atomistic modeling, that the device geometry only allows for sizable direct exchange coupling for neighboring dots, while next-nearest neighbor coupling cannot stem from the vanishingly small tail of the electronic wave function of the remote dots, and is only possible if mediated.

TI Trainable embedding quantum physics informed neural networks for solving
   nonlinear PDEs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper proposes a novel approach for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with a quantum computer, the trainable embedding quantum physics informed neural network (TE-QPINN). We combine quantum machine learning (QML) with physics informed neural networks (PINNs) in a hybrid approach. By leveraging the advantages of classical and quantum computers, we can create algorithms that have a potential to be run on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices (NISQ). We use feedforward neural networks (FNN) as problem-agnostic embedding functions, giving the used quantum circuit greater expressibility than previously introduced embedding. This expressibility allows us to solve a wide range of problems without using a problem specific ansatz. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid backpropagation algorithm that allows efficient updates of the used weights and biases in the FNN embedding functions. In this paper we showcase the capabilities of TE-QPINNs of a wide range of problems, including the two-dimensional Poisson, Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations. In direct comparison with classical PINNs, this approach showed an ability to achieve superior results while using the same number of parameters, highlighting their potential for more efficient optimization in high-dimensional parameter spaces, which could be transformative for future applications.

AB Thermal transport and quantum thermodynamics at the nanoscale are nowadays garnering increasing attention, in particular, in the context of quantum technologies. Experiments relevant for quantum technology are expected to be performed in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we build on previous results derived in the linear response regime for the performance of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer operated as a heat engine. In the nonlinear regime, we demonstrate the tunability, large efficiency, and thermopower that this mesoscopic quantum machine can achieve, confirming the exciting perspectives that this AB ring offers for developing efficient thermal machines in the fully quantum regime.(c) 2021 Author(s)

TI Floquet-tailored Rydberg interactions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Rydberg blockade is a key ingredient for entangling atoms in arrays. However, it requires atoms to be spaced well within the blockade radius, which limits the range of local quantum gates. Here we break this constraint using Floquet frequency modulation, with which we demonstrate Rydberg-blockade entanglement beyond the traditional blockade radius and show how the enlarged entanglement range improves qubit connectivity in a neutral atom array. Further, we find that the coherence of entangled states can be extended under Floquet frequency modulation. Finally, we realize Rydberg anti-blockade states for two sodium Rydberg atoms within the blockade radius. Such Rydberg anti-blockade states for atoms at close range enables the robust preparation of strongly-interacting, long-lived Rydberg states, yet their steady-state population cannot be achieved with only the conventional static drive. Our work transforms between the paradigmatic regimes of Rydberg blockade versus anti-blockade and paves the way for realizing more connected, coherent, and tunable neutral atom quantum processors with a single approach.

TI Quantum Representation for Deterministic Push-Down Automata
SO ELECTRONICS
AB There are many papers presenting quantum computing models. The definitions parallel the classical definitions of finite state automata, push-down automata, context-free grammars, etc. Classical computing model definitions define languages precisely. We can state that a string belongs to a language or does not belong to it with no room for error. Quantum definitions do not possess this certainty. Sacrificing the certainty and adopting a quantum definition of a computing model does not appear to provide any concrete power to the model. Therefore, the path of this paper is to begin from the classical definition and end in a quantum circuit. In this paper, we start from a deterministic push-down automaton (DPDA). We present circuits for state transition and stack operations. The circuits presented can be viewed as independent algorithms. As an example, the approach used to construct the circuit for state transition can be utilized to build the circuit for a function presented as a Boolean matrix.

TI Application of polarization transfer algorithm in organic molecules with
   three nonequivalent coupled spins
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Polarization transfer between three 1/2 nuclear spins in a specially prepared isotopically enriched molecule diethylphthalimide malonate-2-13C,15N molecule was obtained using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method. The polarization transfer was performed by implementing a sequence of radio frequency pulses and waiting intervals. Relaxation times and NMR spectrum for the studied nuclei were measured in samples of molecules with natural and enriched isotopes 13 C and 15 N. Measurements of the proton relaxation rate for diethylphthalimidomalonate and diethylpthalimidomalonate-2-13 C,15 N showed an increase in relaxation rate by a factor of 4 for protons bound to13 C,15 N nuclei. The use of the quantum polarization transfer method made it possible to reduce the measurement time of the relaxation rate of spin polarization 15N by about 500 times. In addition, the possibility of implementing three-qubit quantum gates using this molecule was shown.

TI Graph coloring using the reduced quantum genetic algorithm
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Genetic algorithms (GA) are computational methods for solving optimization problems inspired by natural selection. Because we can simulate the quantum circuits that implement GA in different highly configurable noise models and even run GA on actual quantum computers, we can analyze this class of heuristic methods in the quantum context for NP-hard problems. This paper proposes an instantiation of the Reduced Quantum Genetic Algorithm (RQGA) that solves the NP-hard graph coloring problem in O(N1/2). The proposed implementation solves both vertex and edge coloring and can also determine the chromatic number (i.e., the minimum number of colors required to color the graph). We examine the results, analyze the algorithm convergence, and measure the algorithm's performance using the Qiskit simulation environment. Our Reduced Quantum Genetic Algorithm (RQGA) circuit implementation and the graph coloring results show that quantum heuristics can tackle complex computational problems more efficiently than their conventional counterparts.

TI A Quantum Strategy for the Simulation of Large Proteins: From
   Fragmentation in Small Proteins to Scalability in Complex Systems
SO ELECTRONICS
AB We present a scalable and resource-aware framework for the quantum simulation of large proteins, grounded in systematic molecular fragmentation, analytical Toffoli gate modeling, and empirical validation. The ground-state energy of a target biomolecule is reconstructed from capped amino acid fragments, with fixed corrections to account for artificial boundaries. Analytical cost estimates-derived from reduced Hamiltonians-are benchmarked against empirical Toffoli counts using PennyLane's resource estimation module. Our model maintains predictive accuracy across biologically relevant systems of up to 1852 electrons, capturing consistent patterns across diverse fragments. This framework enables early-stage feasibility assessments for achieving quantum advantage in biochemical simulation pipelines.

TI Study on Diamond NV Centers Excited by Green Light Emission from
   Upconversion Luminescence
SO PHOTONICS
AB The NV center in diamonds has been widely employed in quantum sensing, quantum computing, and bioimaging due to its controllable ground-state spin, detectable magnetic resonance, excellent photostability, favorable biocompatibility, and chemical inertness. However, conventional excitation using 532 nm green light still exhibits certain limitations in practical applications. To address this, we propose a novel NV center excitation method based on the upconversion of near-infrared light to green emission. Through the synthesis of molybdenum-doped NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 1.5% Er3+ upconversion materials, efficient excitation of NV centers has been achieved. Both UC-LED luminescence spectroscopy and ODMR measurements confirm that the green light generated via the upconversion process exhibits sufficient intensity to effectively excite NV centers. Meanwhile, the characteristic sharp emission peaks of rare-earth upconversion materials eliminate the need for optical filters, facilitating device miniaturization, and a miniaturized UC-LED sensor has been developed.

TI In situ scanning gate imaging of individual quantum two-level system
   defects in live superconducting circuits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The low-temperature physics of structurally amorphous materials is governed by low-energy two-level system (TLS) defects. Being impervious to most traditional condensed matter probes, the exact origin and nature of TLS remain elusive. Recent advances toward realizing stable high-coherence quantum computing platforms have increased the importance of studying TLS in solid-state quantum circuits, as they are a persistent source of decoherence and instability. Here, performing scanning gate microscopy on a live superconducting NbN resonator at millikelvin temperatures, we locate individual TLS, directly revealing their microscopic nature. Mapping and visualizing the most detrimental TLS in the bath pinpoints the dominant sources of ubiquitous 1/f dielectric noise and energy relaxation. We also deduce the three-dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Combining these insights with structural information of the underlying materials can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing targeted strategies for their eventual mitigation.

Among the most recent quantum ML approaches, Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) emerged as an important tool for data analysis. With the QNN advent, higher-level programming interfaces for QNN have been developed. In this paper, we survey the current state-of-the-art high-level programming approaches for QNN development. We discuss target architectures, critical QNN algorithmic components, such as the hybrid workflow of Quantum Annealers and Parametrized Quantum Circuits, QNN architectures, optimizers, gradient calculations, and applications. Finally, we overview the existing programming QNN frameworks, their software architecture, and associated quantum simulators.

AB The procedure of tossing quantum coins and dice is described. This case is an important example of a quantum procedure because it presents a typical framework employed in quantum information processing and quantum computing. The emphasis is on the clarification of the difference between quantum and classical conditional probabilities. These probabilities are designed for characterizing different systems, either quantum or classical, and they, generally, cannot be reduced to each other. Thus the Luders probability cannot be treated as a generalization of the classical conditional probability. The analogies between quantum theory of measurements and quantum decision theory are elucidated.

TI Tensor network noise characterization for near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Characterization of noise in current near-term quantum devices is of paramount importance to fully use their computational power. However, direct quantum process tomography becomes unfeasible for systems composed of tens of qubits. A promising alternative method based on tensor networks was recently proposed [Nat. Commun. 14, 2858 (2023)]. In this paper, we adapt it for the characterization of noise channels on near-term quantum computers and investigate its performance thoroughly. In particular, we show how experimentally feasible tomographic samples are sufficient to accurately characterize realistic correlated noise models affecting individual layers of quantum circuits, and study its performance on systems composed of up to 20 qubits. Furthermore, we combine this noise characterization method with a recently proposed noise-aware tensor network error mitigation protocol for correcting outcomes in noisy circuits, resulting accurate estimations even on deep circuit instances. This positions the tensor-network-based noise characterization protocol as a valuable tool for practical error characterization and mitigation in the near-term quantum computing era.

TI Efficient percolation simulations for lossy photonic fusion networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The study of percolation phenomena has various applications ranging from social networks or materials science to quantum information. The most common percolation models are bond or site percolation for which the Newman-Ziff algorithm enables an efficient simulation. Here, we consider several nonstandard percolation models that appear in the context of measurement-based photonic quantum computing with so-called graph states and fusion networks. The associated percolation thresholds determine the tolerance to photon loss in such systems and we develop modifications of the Newman-Ziff algorithm to efficiently perform the corresponding percolation simulations. We demonstrate our algorithms by using them to characterize exemplary fusion networks and graph states.

TI Adaptive Trotterization for Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Quantum Dynamics
   Using Piecewise Conservation Laws
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Digital quantum simulation relies on Trotterization to discretize time evolution into elementary quantum gates. On current quantum processors with notable gate imperfections, there is a critical trade-off between improved accuracy for finer time steps, and increased error rate on account of the larger circuit depth. We present an adaptive Trotterization algorithm to cope with time dependent Hamiltonians, where we propose a concept of piecewise "conserved" quantities to estimate errors in the time evolution between two (nearby) points in time; these allow us to bound the errors accumulated over the full simulation period. They reduce to standard conservation laws in the case of time independent Hamiltonians, for which we first developed an adaptive Trotterization scheme [H. Zhao et al., Making Trotterization adaptive and energyself-correcting for NISQ devices and beyond, PRX Quantum 4, 030319 (2023).]. We validate the algorithm for a time dependent quantum spin chain, demonstrating that it can outperform the conventional Trotter algorithm with a fixed step size at a controlled error.

TI Non-unitary transformation on quantum interference in a chip
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB In quantum information processing, unitary transformations are oftentimes used to implement computing tasks. However, unitary transformations are not enough for all situations. Therefore, it is important to explore non-unitary transformations in quantum computing and simulation. Here, we introduce non-unitary transformations by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on two-photon interference. Through simulation, we show that losses modeled by non-unitary transformation can be perceived as variables to control two-photon interference continuously, and the coincidence statistics can be changed by an appropriate choice of observation basis. The results are promising in the design of integrated optical circuits, providing a way toward fabricating large-scale programmable circuits.

TI On the uniqueness and computation of commuting extensions
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB A tuple (Z(1) , ... , Z( p) ) of matrices of size r x r is said to be a commuting extension of a tuple (A(1), ... , A(p) ) of matrices of size n x n if the Z i pairwise commute and each A i sits in the upper left corner of a block decomposition of Z i (here, r and n are two arbitrary integers with n < r ). This notion was discovered and rediscovered in several contexts including algebraic complexity theory (in Strassen's work on tensor rank), in numerical analysis for the construction of cubature formulas and in quantum mechanics for the study of computational methods and the study of the so-called "quantum Zeno dynamics." Commuting extensions have also attracted the attention of the linear algebra community. In this paper we present 3 types of results: (i) Theorems on the uniqueness of commuting extensions for three matrices or more. (ii) Algorithms for the computation of commuting extensions of minimal size. These algorithms work under the same assumptions as our uniqueness theorems. They are applicable up to r = 4n/3, n/ 3, and are apparently the first provably efficient algorithms for this problem applicable beyond r = n + 1. (iii) A genericity theorem showing that our algorithms and uniqueness theorems can be applied to a wide range of input matrices. (c) 2024 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Duality Analysis in a Symmetric Group and its Application to Random
   Tensor Network Models
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB The Ising model is the simplest model for describing many-body effects in classical statistical mechanics. A duality analysis leads to its critical point under several assumptions. The Ising model has $Z_2$-symmetry. The basis of duality analysis is a nontrivial relationship between low- and high-temperature expansions. However, discrete Fourier transformation automatically determines the hidden relationship. The duality analysis can naturally extend to systems with various degrees of freedom, $Z_q$ symmetry, and random spin systems. Furthermore, we obtained the duality relation in a series of permutation models in the present study by considering the symmetric group $S_q$ and its Fourier transformation. The permutation model in a symmetric group is closely related to random quantum circuits and random tensor network models, which are frequently discussed in quantum computing. It also relates to the holographic principle, a property of string theories and quantum gravity. We provide a systematic approach using duality analysis to examine the phase transition in these models.

TI Experimental investigation of the trade-off between quantum speed and
   energy cost
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The implementation of information processing on a quantum device is a fundamental challenge for many technologies. As a matter of fact, the faster one wants to implement a quantum operation, the higher is the thermodynamic cost of realizing the quantum process. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally verify a trade-off between quantum speed and energy cost using Schatten 2-norm. Our findings demonstrate that this trade-off remains tight for any instant of time, whether dealing with initial eigenstates or initial thermal equilibrium states, as illustrated by the Landau-Zehner model. This observation underscores the significance of coherence of the evolved states. By extending our method to open system, we find that quantum speed can be significantly affected by environmental decoherence effect. These results illuminate the fundamental limits of quantum state dynamics and hold promise for potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum computing.

TI Classical and quantum parts of conditional mutual information for open
   quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the classical, classical-quantum, and quantum parts of conditional mutual information in the "system-environment-ancilla" setting of open quantum systems. We perform the separation of conditional mutual information by generalizing the classification of correlations of quantum states. The condition for identifying the classical part of conditional mutual information is given by adapting the no-local-broadcasting theorem to this setting, while the condition for the classical-quantum part of conditional mutual information is obtained by considering the multipartite quantum discord and the no-unilocal-broadcasting theorem. For the quantum part of conditional mutual information, we further generalize the characterization of entanglement by quantum discord of state extensions to the multipartite setting to derive a generalized Koashi-Winter-type monogamy equality for conditional mutual information. Our results have explicit dependence on the extensions of the environment, which are useful for studying different environmental contributions to the quantum non-Markovianity of open quantum systems.

AB Quantum cryptography is known for enabling functionalities that are unattainable using classical information alone. Recently, Secure Software Leasing (SSL) has emerged as one of these areas of interest. Given a target circuit C from a circuit class, SSL produces an encoding of C that enables a recipient to evaluate C, and also enables the originator of the software to verify that the software has been returned-meaning that the recipient has relinquished the possibility of any further use of the software. Clearly, such a functionality is unachievable using classical information alone, since it is impossible to prevent a user from keeping a copy of the software. Recent results have shown the achievability of SSL using quantum information for a class of functions called compute-and-compare (these are a generalization of the well-known point functions). These prior works, however all make use of setup or computational assumptions. Here, we show that SSL is achievable for compute-and-compare circuits without any assumptions.
   Our technique involves the study of quantum copy protection, which is a notion related to SSL, but where the encoding procedure inherently prevents a would-be quantum software pirate from splitting a single copy of an encoding for C into two parts, each of which enables a user to evaluate C. We show that point functions can be copy-protected without any assumptions, for a novel security definition involving one honest and one malicious evaluator; this is achieved by showing that from any quantum message authentication code, we can derive such an honest-malicious copy protection scheme. We then show that a generic honest-malicious copy protection scheme implies SSL; by prior work, this yields SSL for compute-and-compare functions.

TI Fault-tolerant operation and materials science with neutral atom logical
   qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We report on the fault-tolerant operation of logical qubits on a neutral atom quantum computer, with logical performance surpassing physical performance for multiple circuits including Bell state preparation (12x error reduction), random circuits (15x), and a prototype Anderson Impurity Model ground state solver for materials science applications (up to 6x, non-fault-tolerantly). The logical qubits are implemented via the [[4, 2, 2]] code (C4). Our work constitutes the first complete realization of the benchmarking protocol proposed by Gottesman 2016 demonstrating results consistent with fault tolerance. In light of recent advances on applying concatenated C4/C6 detection codes to achieve error correction with high code rates and thresholds, our work can be regarded as a building block towards a practical scheme for fault tolerant quantum computation. Our demonstration of a materials science application with logical qubits particularly demonstrates the immediate value of these techniques on current experiments.

TI Traveling-wave electro-optics for microwave-to-optical quantum

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB High -efficiency microwave -to -optical quantum transduction is crucial for quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. Cavity-based electro-optic transducers have been widely explored due to their cavityenhanced conversion efficiency, albeit at the compromise of limited transduction bandwidth and strict frequency alignment requirements between microwave and optical modes. A recent advancement in meter -long superconducting electro-optic modulators (SEOM) has demonstrated conversion efficiency approaching that of the cavity-based transducers on a traveling-wave structure while maintaining a broad bandwidth of tens of gigahertz. This paper provides a further theoretical investigation into the dynamics of the microwave -to -optical conversion process in a traveling-wave geometry. Based on this analysis, we propose a traveling-wave electro-optic transducer design featuring near-unity conversion efficiency and tunable conversion frequency.

TI Meta-learning digitized-counterdiabatic quantum optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The use of variational quantum algorithms for optimization tasks has emerged as a crucial application for the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. However, these algorithms face significant difficulties in finding suitable ansatz and appropriate initial parameters. In this paper, we employ meta-learning using recurrent neural networks to address these issues for the recently proposed digitized-counterdiabatic quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). By combining meta-learning and counterdiabaticity, we find suitable variational parameters and reduce the number of optimization iterations required. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the MaxCut problem and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Our method offers a short-depth circuit ansatz with optimal initial parameters, thus improving the performance of the state-of-the-art QAOA.

TI Multipartite Entanglement: A Journey through Geometry
SO ENTROPY
AB Genuine multipartite entanglement is crucial for quantum information and related technologies, but quantifying it has been a long-standing challenge. Most proposed measures do not meet the "genuine" requirement, making them unsuitable for many applications. In this work, we propose a journey toward addressing this issue by introducing an unexpected relation between multipartite entanglement and hypervolume of geometric simplices, leading to a tetrahedron measure of quadripartite entanglement. By comparing the entanglement ranking of two highly entangled four-qubit states, we show that the tetrahedron measure relies on the degree of permutation invariance among parties within the quantum system. We demonstrate potential future applications of our measure in the context of quantum information scrambling within many-body systems.

TI Second-scale rotational coherence and dipolar interactions in a gas of
   ultracold polar molecules
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Ultracold polar molecules combine a rich structure of long-lived internal states with access to controllable long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. In particular, the rotational states of polar molecules confined in optical tweezers or optical lattices may be used to encode interacting qubits for quantum computation or pseudo-spins for simulating quantum magnetism. As with all quantum platforms, the engineering of robust coherent superpositions of states is vital. However, for optically trapped molecules, the coherence time between rotational states is typically limited by inhomogeneous differential light shifts. Here we demonstrate a rotationally magic optical trap for (RbCs)-Rb-87-Cs-133 molecules that supports a Ramsey coherence time of 0.78(4) s in the absence of dipole-dipole interactions. This is estimated to extend to >1.4 s at the 95% confidence level using a single spin-echo pulse. In our trap, dipolar interactions become the dominant mechanism by which Ramsey contrast is lost for superpositions that generate oscillating dipoles. By changing the states forming the superposition, we tune the effective dipole moment and show that the coherence time is inversely proportional to the strength of the dipolar interaction. Our work unlocks the full potential of the rotational degree of freedom in molecules for quantum computation and quantum simulation.

TI Flavor-mass majorization uncertainty relations and their links to the

SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Uncertainties in flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos are considered within the majorization approach. Nontrivial bounds reflect the fact that neutrinos cannot be simultaneously in flavor and mass eigenstates. As quantitative measures of uncertainties, both the Renyi and Tsallis entropies are utilized. Within the current amount of experience concerning the mixing matrix, majorization uncertainty relations need to put values of only two parameters, viz. theta(12) and theta(13). That is, the majorization approach is applicable within the same framework as the Maassen-Uffink relation recently utilized in this context. We also consider the case of detection inefficiencies, since it can naturally be incorporated into the entropic framework. Short comments on applications of entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory are given.

TI Adiabatic paths of Hamiltonians, symmetries of topological order, and
   automorphism codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The recent "honeycomb code" is a fault-tolerant quantum memory defined by a sequence of checks, which implements a nontrivial automorphism of the toric code. We argue that a general framework to understand this code is to consider continuous adiabatic paths of gapped Hamiltonians and we give a conjectured description of the fundamental group and second and third homotopy groups of this space in two spatial dimensions. A single cycle of such a path can implement some automorphism of the topological order of that Hamiltonian. We construct such paths for arbitrary automorphisms of two-dimensional doubled topological order. Then, realizing this in the case of the toric code, we turn this path back into a sequence of checks, constructing an automorphism code closely related to the honeycomb code.

AB We analyze the coupling efficiency of a single dipole with a nanofiber Bragg cavity (NFBC) for single photon sources. Conventionally, NFBC diameters are set at approximately half of the emission wavelength to maximize coupling efficiency, but these thin structures are fragile at low temperatures. By employing three-dimensional finite difference time domain simulations, we investigate NFBCs with diameters ranging from 450 to 600 nm, which offer more mechanical robustness. Our results show that NFBCs with diameters of 450 and 500 nm achieve coupling efficiencies exceeding 80%. This study paves the way for practical single-photon sources with enhanced mechanical stability, which is crucial for applications in quantum networks and quantum computing.

AB We present a fault-tolerant Bell-pair distillation scheme achieving constant overhead through high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Our approach maintains a constant distillation rate equal to the code rate while requiring no additional overhead beyond the physical qubits of the code. Full circuit-level analysis demonstrates fault-tolerance for input Bell-pair infidelities below a threshold 10%, readily achievable with near-term capabilities. Unlike previous proposals, our scheme keeps the output Bell pairs encoded in qLDPC codes at each node, eliminating unencoding overhead and enabling direct use in distributed quantum applications through recent advances in qLDPC computation. These results establish qLDPC-based distillation as a practical route toward resource-efficient quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.

AB With the continuous growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), the trend of increasing numbers of IoT devices will continue. To increase the network's capability to support a large number of active devices accessing a network concurrently, this work presents IoT-ResQ, a warm-started quantum annealing-based multi-device detector via quantum reverse annealing (RA). Unlike in typical quantum forward annealing (FA) protocol, IoT-ResQ's RA starts its search operation on a controllable candidate classical state, instead of a quantum superposition, and thus allows refined local quantum search around the initial state. This procedure can provide an opportunity of utilizing both conventional classical- and quantum-based detectors together in a hybrid synergy, to boost quantum optimization performance, mitigating the effect of quantum decoherence and noise on quantum hardware. In our evaluation, IoT-ResQ achieves nearly two to three orders of magnitude better BER and over 2x packet success rate with packet size of 32-byte compared to other quantum and conventional detectors at SNR 9 dB to support 48 active IoT devices with QPSK modulation (implying 48,000 deployed devices with 0.1% wake-up radio rate at a time), requiring approximate to 140 mu s pure compute time for detection.

TI Quantum speedup for nonreversible Markov chains

AB Quantum algorithms can potentially solve a handful of problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. In that context, it has been discussed that Markov chains problems could be solved significantly faster using quantum computing. Indeed, previous work suggests that quantum computers could accelerate sampling from the stationary distribution of reversible Markov chains. However, in practice, certain physical processes of interest are nonreversible in the probabilistic sense and reversible Markov chains can sometimes be replaced by more efficient nonreversible chains targeting the same stationary distribution. This study constructs Markov chain reversibilizations and develops quantum algorithmic techniques to accelerate nonreversible processes. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains and is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.

TI Quantum intrusion detection system using outlier analysis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the field of cybersecurity, hackers often enter computer systems despite current security measures, owing to the huge amount of network traffic that makes intruder identification difficult. Differentiating between authorized traffic and abnormal data produced by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attackers is still a major difficulty. This research provides a unique technique that uses Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to improve security protocols for secure communication between two parties. Our strategy enhances detection accuracy and speed by using the characteristics of quantum neural networks. The approach includes creating a dataset from network traffic patterns, preprocessing it, and then turning it into quantum bits via angle embedding. The research uses outlier analysis, min-entropy, and quantum state fidelity to distinguish between normal and abnormal data patterns. The dispersed randomness of network header data is measured using entropy, which aids in identifying security concerns. The suggested QML-based methodology outperforms conventional approaches and current models, including AMM-CNN and ANN models, with a detection accuracy of 99.87% for DDoS attacks. This advancement leads to more effective and secure communication networks.

TI Roadmap on Atomtronics: State of the art and perspective
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Atomtronics deals with matter-wave circuits of ultracold atoms manipulated through magnetic or laser-generated guides with different shapes and intensities. In this way, new types of quantum networks can be constructed in which coherent fluids are controlled with the know-how developed in the atomic and molecular physics community. In particular, quantum devices with enhanced precision, control, and flexibility of their operating conditions can be accessed. Concomitantly, new quantum simulators and emulators harnessing on the coherent current flows can also be developed. Here, the authors survey the landscape of atomtronics-enabled quantum technology and draw a roadmap for the field in the near future. The authors review some of the latest progress achieved in matter-wave circuits' design and atom-chips. Atomtronic networks are deployed as promising platforms for probing many-body physics with a new angle and a new twist. The latter can be done at the level of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. Numerous relevant problems in mesoscopic physics, such as persistent currents and quantum transport in circuits of fermionic or bosonic atoms, are studied through a new lens. The authors summarize some of the atomtronics quantum devices and sensors. Finally, the authors discuss alkali-earth and Rydberg atoms as potential platforms for the realization of atomtronic circuits with special features.(c) 2021 Author(s).

TI Radiative properties of rubidium atoms trapped in solid neon and
   parahydrogen
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is known from ensemble measurements that rubidium atoms trapped in solid parahydrogen have favorable properties for quantum sensing of magnetic fields. To use a single rubidium atom as a quantum sensor requires a technique capable of efficiently measuring the internal state of a single atom, such as laser-induced fluorescence. In this work we search for laser-induced fluorescence from ensembles of rubidium atoms trapped in solid parahydrogen and, separately, in solid neon. In parahydrogen we find no evidence of fluorescence over the range explored, and we place upper limits on the radiative branching ratio. In neon, we observe laser-induced fluorescence, measure the spectrum of the emitted light, and measure the excited-state lifetime in the matrix. Bleaching of atoms from the excitation light is also reported.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical-quantum convolutional neural networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Deep learning has achieved significant success in pattern recognition, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) serving as a foundational architecture for extracting spatial features from images. Quantum computing provides an alternative computational framework, a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks (QCCNNs) leverage high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and entanglement to surpass classical CNNs in image classification accuracy under comparable architectures. Despite performance improvements, QCCNNs typically use fixed quantum layers without incorporating trainable quantum parameters. This limits their ability to capture non-linear quantum representations and separates the model from the potential advantages of expressive quantum learning. In this work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical-quantum convolutional neural network (QCQ-CNN) that incorporates a quantum convolutional filter, a shallow classical CNN, and a trainable variational quantum classifier. This architecture aims to enhance the expressivity of decision boundaries in image classification tasks by introducing tunable quantum parameters into the end-to-end learning process. Through a series of small-sample experiments on MNIST, F-MNIST, and MRI tumor datasets, QCQ-CNN demonstrates competitive accuracy and convergence behavior compared to classical and hybrid baselines. We further analyze the effect of ansatz depth and find that moderate-depth quantum circuits can improve learning stability without introducing excessive complexity. Additionally, simulations incorporating depolarizing noise and finite sampling shots suggest that QCQ-CNN maintains a certain degree of robustness under realistic quantum noise conditions. While our results are currently limited to simulations with small-scale quantum circuits, the proposed approach offers a potentially promising direction for hybrid quantum learning in near-term applications.

TI Entanglement of a cavity with a three-level atom and a graphene membrane
   in the presence of a laser field
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This paper examines the entanglement and coherence of a hybrid quantum system in the presence of an external laser field. The hybrid system is composed of a single-mode cavity field containing a vibrating graphene membrane and a superconducting qutrit in a cascade configuration. Specifically, we investigate how the coupling of qutrit-graphene, detuning parameters, and external field coupling affects different measures, such as negativity tangle, algebraic tangle, geometric tangle, and the l1 norm of coherence. Our results demonstrate that the upper bounds of tangle measures and coherence decrease with increasing the detuning parameters. The external field amplifies the detrimental impact caused by detuning. Furthermore, heightened qutrit-graphene coupling elevates the maximum bounds of tangle and coherence quantifiers, while also increasing the frequency of oscillations.& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

TI A generalisation of the Phase Kick-Back
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we present a generalisation of the Phase Kick-Back technique, which is central to some of the classical algorithms in quantum computing. We will begin by recalling the Phase Kick-Back technique to then introduce the new generalised version for f : {0, 1}(n) ->{0, 1}(m) functions using the eigenvalues of the oracle function U (f). After that, we will present a new generalised version of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem and how it can be solved using the previously defined technique. We will also deal with a generalised version of the Bernstein-Vazirani problem and solve it using the generalised Phase Kick-Back. Finally, we show how we can use this technique to obtain an algorithm for Simon's problem that improves the classical one.

TI Limits on atomic qubit control from laser noise
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Technical noise present in laser systems can limit their ability to perform high fidelity quantum control of atomic qubits. The ultimate fidelity floor for atomic qubits driven with laser radiation is due to spontaneous emission from excited energy levels. The goal is to suppress the technical noise from the laser source to below the spontaneous emission floor such that it is no longer a limiting factor. It has been shown that the spectral structure of control noise can have a large influence on achievable control fidelities, while prior studies of laser noise contributions have been restricted to noise magnitudes. Here, we study the unique spectral structure of laser noise and introduce a metric that determines when a stabilised laser source has been optimised for quantum control of atomic qubits. We find requirements on stabilisation bandwidths that can be orders of magnitude higher than those required to simply narrow the linewidth of a laser. The introduced metric, the chi-separation line, provides a tool for the study and engineering of laser sources for quantum control of atomic qubits below the spontaneous emission floor.

TI Investigating amplitude amplification in optimization-based control for
   a continuous stirred tank reactor
SO DIGITAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computers, which utilize quantum states called 'qubits' to process information, are becoming of increased interest in a variety of fields because they have the potential to outperform classical computers in certain situations. However, many challenges and hurdles remain, including the development of quantum algorithms that offer a speedup and can be applied to practical problems (some quantum algorithms that offer a speedup may only be applicable in specific and sometimes contrived circumstances). Our previous works have studied the use of quantum computers and quantum algorithms for process control applications. Our prior work evaluated the use of a gate-based quantum amplitude amplification algorithm when applied to a model predictive control optimization problem, specifically evaluating a linear systems example. The results suggested that the algorithm may be suited for the specific linear problem studied (meaning that there is a high probability of obtaining the desired result when measuring the quantum state after the algorithm has been applied). However, the results cannot be generalized to a wider class of systems or to systems containing nonlinearities. To begin to gain an understanding of how the amplitude amplification algorithm might be generalized, this work evaluates the use of the algorithm for the optimization-based control of a nonlinear dynamic system (specifically, a continuous stirred tank reactor). We seek to understand aspects of the problem, such as the development of a solution space, the effects of changing process and control parameters, and the operation of the amplitude amplification algorithm itself. The results demonstrate the challenges that still exist, and demonstrate a method involving inverse sampling transformations to potentially aid in addressing these issues.

TI Algorithmic Shadow Spectroscopy
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present shadow spectroscopy as a simulator-agnostic quantum algorithm for estimating energy gaps using very few circuit repetitions (shots) and no extra resources (ancilla qubits) beyond performing time evolution and measurements. The approach builds on the fundamental feature that every observable property of a quantum system must evolve according to the same harmonic components: we can reveal them by postprocessing classical shadows of time-evolved quantum states to extract a large number of time-periodic signals No proportional to 108, whose frequencies correspond to Hamiltonian energy differences with precision limited as F proportional to 1/T for simulation time T. We provide strong analytical guarantees that (a) quantum resources scale as O(logNo), while the classical computational complexity is linear O(No), (b) the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the number of processed signals as proportional to root No, and (c) spectral peak positions are immune to reasonable levels of noise. We demonstrate our approach on model spin systems and the excited-state conical intersection of molecular CH2 and verify that our method is indeed intuitively easy to use in practice, robust against gate noise, amiable to a new type of algorithmic-error mitigation technique, and uses relatively few shots given a reasonable initial state is supplied-we demonstrate that even 10 shots per time step can be sufficient. Finally, we measured a high-quality, experimental shadow spectrum of a spin chain on readily available IBM quantum computers, achieving the same precision as in noise-free simulations without using any advanced error mitigation, and verified scalability in tensor-network simulations of up to 100-qubit systems.

TI Engineering topological state transfer in four-period
   Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB An extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model containing four periods of the hopping coefficients, called SSH4 model, is constructed to explore robust quantum state transfer. The gap state protected by the energy gap plays the role of the topological channel where the particle initially located at the last lattice site has the probability to arise at the first and all even lattice sites equally. Serving those sites as ports, a multi-port router can be realized naturally, and the fidelity reaches unity in a wide range of parameters under the long chain and random disorder. Further, when we reduce the third intracell hopping to a small value, the occupancy probability of the second lattice site in every unit cell will reduce to zero, by which a new topological router can be induced. In addition, our SSH4 model can work as a 1/3 beam splitter. Namely, the particle initially occupies the first lattice site and finally appears with equal probability at three lattice sites. We can also realize a 1/2 beam splitter. Our four-period SSH model provides a novel way for topological quantum information processing and can engineer two kinds of quantum optical devices.

TI Rydberg Atom Electric Field Sensors for Communications and Sensing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Rydberg atom electric field sensors are projected to enable novel capabilities for resilient communications and sensing. This quantum sensor is small-size, highly sensitive, and broadly tunable, and it has the potential for performing precision vector electric field and angle-of-arrival measurements. While these atomic electric field sensors will not replace traditional receivers in commodity applications for RF signal reception, these sensors could be an enabling technology in niche application spaces.

TI Engineering of maximally entangled orbital angular momentum states via
   path identity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Cutting-edge quantum technologies lean on sources of high-dimensional entangled states (HDESs) that reliably prepare high-fidelity target states. The idea to overlap photon paths from distinct but indistinguishable sources was recently introduced for the creation of HDESs, known as entanglement by path identity. In this regard, the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes is promising, as they offer a high-dimensional and discrete Hilbert space to encode information. While entanglement by path identity with OAM has been verified experimentally, a detailed investigation of how the OAM distribution of photon pairs can be engineered to maximize the entanglement is lacking. We address this gap and identify an optimal dimensionality for maximally entangled states (MESs) when the spatial engineering of the pump beam and the path-identity approach are combined. Our theoretical study reveals notable limitations for the fidelity of high-dimensional target states. We also establish the equivalence of entangled biphoton states pumped by a spatially engineered beam and generated via path identity. These findings constitute a valuable step toward the optimized preparation of MESs in high dimensions.

TI A Scientometric Review of Practical Applications in Quantum Natural
   Language Processing (QNLP): Trends, Gaps, and Research Opportunities
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that connects quantum computing and natural language processing (NLP), with the goal of improving language models through quantum algorithms. Although the field has gained increasing attention, research in QNLP remains fragmented, with limited studies mapping its evolution or practical implementations. This article presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of QNLP research, revealing its conceptual foundations, research dynamics, and emerging directions. Using bibliographic data from the Scopus (2014-2024) and Web of Science (2014-2024) databases and analytical tools such as VOSviewer and Biblioshiny, we examined 116 publications following the PRISMA guidelines. The analysis covers publication growth, author productivity, leading journals, influential countries, and keyword trends. Network visualizations highlight the intellectual structure of the field, co-authorship patterns, and thematic clusters. The results indicate a sharp increase in QNLP studies since 2021, driven by advances in quantum hardware, frameworks such as lambeq, and growing interdisciplinary collaborations. However, during the literature mapping, we identified a significant gap regarding the applications of QNLP in various specific domains such as healthcare field. This study offers a quantitative mapping of the QNLP landscape, providing a structured overview of its development and outlining promising avenues for future exploration.

TI Differential phase shift quantum secret sharing using a twin field
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is essential for multiparty quantum communication, which is one of cornerstones in the future quantum internet. However, a linear rate-distance limitation severely constrains the secure key rate and transmission distance of QSS. Here, we present a practical QSS protocol among three participants based on the differential phase shift scheme and twin field ideas for the solution of high-efficiency multiparty communication task. In contrast to a formerly proposed differential phase shift QSS protocol, our protocol can break the linear rate-distance bound, theoretically improving the secret key rate by three orders of magnitude in a 300-km-long fiber. Furthermore, the new protocol is secure against Trojan horse attacks that cannot be resisted by previous differential phase shift QSS.

TI Real-space RG, error correction and Petz map
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB There are two parts to this work: first, we study the error correction properties of the real-space renormalization group (RG). The long-distance operators are the (approximately) correctable operators encoded in the physical algebra of short-distance operators. This is closely related to modeling the holographic map as a quantum error correction code. As opposed to holography, the real-space RG of a many-body quantum system does not have the complementary recovery property. We discuss the role of large N and a large gap in the spectrum of operators in the emergence of complementary recovery.
   Second, we study the operator algebra exact quantum error correction for any von Neumann algebra. We show that similar to the finite dimensional case, for any error map in between von Neumann algebras the Petz dual of the error map is a recovery map if the inclusion of the correctable subalgebra of operators has finite index.

TI Bayesian Parameterized Quantum Circuit Optimization (BPQCO): a task and
   hardware-dependent approach
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a promising quantum alternative for solving optimization and machine learning problems using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). The design of these circuits influences the ability of the algorithm to efficiently explore the solution space and converge to more optimal solutions. Quantum architecture search (QAS) is therefore a highly relevant topic, in which the selection of an appropriate circuit topology, gate set, and parameterization scheme is determinant to achieve good performance. In addition, it is not only problem-dependent, but the quantum hardware used also has a significant impact on the results. Therefore, we present BPQCO, a Bayesian optimization-based strategy to search for optimal PQCs adapted to the problem to be solved and to the characteristics and limitations of the chosen quantum hardware. To this end, we experimentally demonstrate the influence of the circuit design on the performance obtained for two classification problems (a synthetic dataset and the well-known Iris dataset), focusing on the design of the circuit ansatz. In addition, we study the degradation of the obtained circuits in the presence of noise when simulating real quantum computers. To mitigate the effect of noise, two alternative optimization strategies based on the characteristics of the quantum system are proposed. The results obtained confirm the relevance of the presented approach and allow its adoption in further work based on the use of PQCs.

TI Studying the phase diagram of the three-flavor Schwinger model in the
   presence of a chemical potential with measurement- and gate-based
   quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose an ansatz quantum circuit for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), suitable for exploring the phase structure of the multiflavor Schwinger model in the presence of a chemical potential. Our ansatz is capable of incorporating relevant model symmetries via constrains on the parameters, and can be implemented on circuit-based as well as measurement-based quantum devices. We show via classical simulation of the VQE that our ansatz is able to capture the phase structure of the model, and can approximate the ground state to a high level of accuracy. Moreover, we perform proof-of-principle simulations on superconducting, gate-based quantum hardware. Our results show that our approach is suitable for current gate-based quantum devices, and can be readily implemented on measurement-based quantum devices once available.

TI Localization dynamics in a centrally coupled system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In systems in which interactions couple a central degree of freedom and a bath, one would expect signatures of the bath's phase to be reflected in the dynamics of the central degree of freedom. This has been recently explored in connection with many-body localized baths coupled with a central qubit or a single-cavity mode-systems with growing experimental relevance in various platforms. Such models also have an interesting connection with Floquet many-body localization via quantizing the external drive, although this has been relatively unexplored. Here we adapt the multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method, a well-known tree tensor network algorithm, to numerically simulate the dynamics of a central degree of freedom, represented by a d-level system (qudit), coupled to a disordered interacting one-dimensional spin bath. ML-MCTDH allows us to reach approximate to 10(2) lattice sites, a far larger system size than what is feasible with exact diagonalization or kernel polynomial methods. From the intermediate time dynamics, we find a well-defined thermodynamic limit for the qudit dynamics upon appropriate rescaling of the system-bath coupling. The spin system shows similar scaling collapse in the Edward-Anderson spin-glass order parameter or entanglement entropy at relatively short times. At longer timescales, we see slow growth of the entanglement, which may arise from dephasing mechanisms in the localized system or long-range interactions mediated by the central degree of freedom. Similar signs of localization are shown to appear as well with unscaled system-bath coupling.

TI Fiber-coupled silicon carbide divacancy magnetometer and thermometer
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Divacancy in silicon carbide has become an important solid-state system for quantum metrologies. To make it more beneficial for practical applications, we realize a fiber-coupled divacancy-based magnetometer and thermometer simultaneously. First, we realize an efficient coupling between the divacancy in a silicon carbide slice with a multimode fiber. Then the optimization of the power broadening in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of divacancy is performed to obtain a higher sensing sensitivity of 3.9 mu T/Hz1/2. We then use it to detect the strength of an external magnetic field. Finally, we use the Ramsey methods to realize a temperature sensing with a sensitivity of 163.2 mK/Hz1/2. The experiments demonstrate that the compact fiber-coupled divacancy quantum sensor can be used for multiple practical quantum sensing.

TI Observation of Boron Vacancy Concentration in Hexagonal Boron Nitride at
   Nanometer Scale
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Negatively charged boron vacancy (VB -) ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have attracted considerable attention as a promising platform for quantum sensing. Current challenges include the experimental validation of the spatial distribution and electronic states of optically active VB - and optically inactive neutral boron vacancy (VB 0) defects. To address these issues, we employ electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using monochromated 30-keV electrons, effectively reducing background interference. This approach unveils distinct spectral peaks at 2.5 and 1.9 eV, corresponding to VB - and VB 0 defects, respectively. Furthermore, we achieve nanometer-scale concentration mapping for VB - and VB 0 defects, advancing insights into spin defect configurations crucial for optimizing quantum sensor performance.

TI Observing and braiding topological Majorana modes on programmable
   quantum simulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electrons are indivisible elementary particles, yet paradoxically a collection of them can act as a fraction of a single electron, exhibiting exotic and useful properties. One such collective excitation, known as a topological Majorana mode, is naturally stable against perturbations, such as unwanted local noise, and can thereby robustly store quantum information. As such, Majorana modes serve as the basic primitive of topological quantum computing, providing resilience to errors. However, their demonstration on quantum hardware has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a verifiable identification and braiding of topological Majorana modes using a superconducting quantum processor as a quantum simulator. By simulating fermions on a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic drive, we confirm the existence of Majorana modes localized at the edges, and distinguish them from other trivial modes. To simulate a basic logical operation of topological quantum computing known as braiding, we propose a non-adiabatic technique, whose implementation reveals correct braiding statistics in our experiments. This work could further be used to study topological models of matter using circuit-based simulations, and shows that long-sought quantum phenomena can be realized by anyone in cloud-run quantum simulations, whereby accelerating fundamental discoveries in quantum science and technology.

TI Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of spin-orbit hybrid entangled photons
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Structured photons are a crucial resource in both classical and quantum technologies, particularly in spin-orbit hybrid photons, enabling various practical applications ranging from ultra-sensitive metrology techniques to quantum-enhanced information processing tasks. However, the two-photon interference of spin-orbit hybrid photons, which combines polarization modes and complex transverse spatial structures across the beam profile, remains unexplored. Here, we present an experimental observation of Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference of spin-orbit hybrid photons. The tunable q-plates that work as spin-orbit coupler devices are used to prepare various forms of spin-orbit hybrid entangled photons. By harnessing the match degree in the temporal domain, the coalescence and anti-coalescence effects resulting from the symmetric and anti-symmetric properties of the incident quantum states are observed. Moreover, we demonstrated the feasibility of quantum-enhanced photon polarization gears through HOM interference and theoretically analyze the noise-resilient advantages based on coherent HOM measurements. These results provide an alternative route toward quantum experiments with structured photons that allows for controlling their quantum interference in a compact, stable, and efficient way.

We propose and demonstrate an adaptively gated hybrid intensified camera (HIC) that combines the information from a high spatial resolution sensor and a high temporal resolution detector, offering precise control over the number of photons detected within each frame. The HIC facilitates spatially resolved single-photon counting measurements. We study the measurement of momentum correlations of photon pairs generated in type-I spontaneous parametric downconversion with the HIC and demonstrate the possibility of time-tagging the registered photons. With a spatial resolution of multi-megapixels and nanosecond temporal resolution, this system allows for the realization of previously infeasible quantum optics experiments.

We achieve hyperfine-resolved detection with fidelity 0.9993(4) and atom retention of 0.9954(5), limited primarily by vacuum lifetime. Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements.

TI How likely are you to observe non-locality with imperfect detection
   efficiency and random measurement settings?
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Imperfect detection efficiency remains one of the major obstacles in achieving loophole-free Bell tests over long distances. At the same time, the challenge of establishing a common reference frame for measurements becomes more pronounced as the separation between parties increases. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by examining the impact of limited detection efficiency on the probability of Bell inequality violation with Haar random measurement settings. We derive analytical lower bounds on the violation probability for a two-qubit maximally entangled state, which is tight for correlation inequalities and perfect detection efficiencies. We further investigate it numerically for more qubits and settings using two detection efficiency models and an original method based on the linear programming. Beyond that, we show that the so-called typicality of Bell inequality violation, i.e. almost certain violation of local realism with sufficiently many particles or random measurement directions, holds even if the detection efficiency is limited. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of measurement settings can compensate for efficiency losses above the critical threshold. Additionally, we determine critical detection efficiencies for both two-party and three-party scenarios. For two parties, we recover previously established results, while for three parties, we derive a symmetric critical efficiency of eta crit=2/3 for the W and GHZ states within the binning model. In cases involving the no-detection outcome, we present a modified inequality using a pair of orthogonal observables for each party with eta crit approximate to 0.7208, which is notably less than 0.75 for the GHZ state. These results offer deeper insights into the limitations and possibilities for certifying non-locality in the presence of limited detection efficiency, shedding light on its robustness in practical Bell tests.

TI Quantum AI in Speech Emotion Recognition
SO ENTROPY
AB We evaluate a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline for speech emotion recognition (SER) on a custom Afrikaans corpus using MFCC-based spectral features with pitch and energy variants, explicitly comparing three quantum approaches-a variational quantum classifier (VQC), a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and a Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA)-based classifier-against a CNN-LSTM (CLSTM) baseline. We detail the classical-to-quantum data encoding (angle embedding with bounded rotations and an explicit feature-to-qubit map) and report test accuracy, weighted precision, recall, and F1. Under ideal analytic simulation, the quantum models reach 41-43% test accuracy; under a realistic 1% NISQ noise model (100-1000 shots) this degrades to 34-40%, versus 73.9% for the CLSTM baseline. Despite the markedly lower empirical accuracy-expected in the NISQ era-we provide an end-to-end, noise-aware hybrid SER benchmark and discuss the asymptotic advantages of quantum subroutines (Chebyshev-based quantum singular value transformation, quantum walks, and block encoding) that become relevant only in the fault-tolerant regime.

AB Pests are always the main source of field damage and severe crop output losses in agriculture. Currently, manually classifying and counting pests is time consuming, and enumeration of population accuracy might be affected by a variety of subjective measures. Additionally, due to pests' various scales and behaviors, the current pest localization algorithms based on CNN are unsuitable for effective pest management in agriculture. To overcome the existing challenges, in this study, a method is developed for the localization and classification of pests. For localization purposes, the YOLOv5 is trained using the optimal learning hyperparameters which more accurately localize the pest region in plant images with 0.93 F1 scores. After localization, pest images are classified into Paddy with pest/Paddy without pest using the proposed quantum machine learning model, which consists of fifteen layers with two-qubit nodes. The proposed network is trained from scratch with optimal parameters that provide 99.9% classification accuracy. The achieved results are compared to the existing recent methods, which are performed on the same datasets to prove the novelty of the developed model.

TI Directional emission and photon bunching from a qubit pair in waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Waveguide quantum electrodynamics represents a powerful platform to generate entanglement and tailor photonic states. We consider a pair of identical qubits coupled to a parity invariant waveguide in the microwave domain. By working in the one- and two-excitation sectors, we provide a unified view of decay processes and show the common origin of directional single-photon emission and two-photon directional bunching. Unveiling the quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that both phenomena are rooted in the selective coupling of orthogonal Bell states of the qubits with photons propagating in opposite directions. We comment on how to use this mechanism to implement optimized post-selection of Bell states, heralded by the detection of a photon on one side of the system.

TI Detecting nuclear spins in an organosilane monolayer using
   nitrogen-vacancy centers for analysis of precursor self-assembly on
   diamond surface
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We demonstrated the correlation spectroscopy of organosilane monolayers using an ensemble of shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers as the quantum sensor. Several types of organosilane monolayers were grown directly on the diamond surface by exposing the surface to a silane precursor vapor. The feasibility of detecting H-1 and F-19 in the monolayer was examined by correlation spectroscopy measurements. The effect of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction on the peak width was also discussed by comparing the spectrum of the monolayer with that of surface-attached H-1 and that of immersion oil. The results highlight the feasibility of nitrogen-vacancy centers as the spin probe for physicochemical analyses of monolayers grown on the diamond surface.

TI Ground-State Preparation and Energy Estimation on Early Fault-Tolerant
   Quantum Computers via Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary
   Matrices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Under suitable assumptions, some recently developed quantum algorithms can estimate the ground-state energy and prepare the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian with near-optimal query complexities. However, this is based on a block-encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, the implementation of which is known to require a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue transforma-tion of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU), which uses a controlled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit, and no multiqubit control operations and is thus suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that outperforms all pre-vious algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for estimating the ground-state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians, we propose a new method that exploits certain anticommutation relations and further removes the need to implement the controlled Hamiltonian evolution. Coupled with a Trotter-based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the resulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM QISKIT for the transverse-field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multiqubit Toffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary amplitude-estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases the total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal complexity for ground-state preparation and energy estimation using a constant number of ancilla qubits (no more than three).

TI Real-time observation of Cooper pair splitting showing strong non-local
   correlations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The splitting of Cooper pairs in superconductors has been challenging to detect experimentally. Here, the authors observe the real-time splitting of individual Cooper pairs in a superconducting device.
   Controlled generation and detection of quantum entanglement between spatially separated particles constitute an essential prerequisite both for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics and for realizing future quantum technologies. Splitting of Cooper pairs from a superconductor provides entangled electrons at separate locations. However, experimentally accessing the individual split Cooper pairs constitutes a major unresolved issue as they mix together with electrons from competing processes. Here, we overcome this challenge with the first real-time observation of the splitting of individual Cooper pairs, enabling direct access to the time-resolved statistics of Cooper pair splitting. We determine the correlation statistics arising from two-electron processes and find a pronounced peak that is two orders of magnitude larger than the background. Our experiment thereby allows to unambiguously pinpoint and select split Cooper pairs with 99% fidelity. These results open up an avenue for performing experiments that tap into the spin-entanglement of split Cooper pairs.

TI Ferromagnetically Shifting the Power of Pausing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We study the interplay between quantum annealing parameters in embedded problems, providing both deeper insights into the physics of these devices and pragmatic recommendations to improve performance on optimization problems. We choose as our test case the class of bounded-degree minimum-spanning tree problems. Through runs on a D-Wave quantum annealer, we demonstrate that pausing in a specific time window in the anneal provides improvement in the probability of success and in the time to solution for these problems. The time window is consistent across problem instances and its location is within the region suggested by prior theory and seen in previous results on native problems. An approach to enable gauge transformations for problems with the qubit coupling strength J in an asymmetric range is presented and shown to significantly improve performance. We also confirm that the optimal pause location exhibits a shift with the magnitude of the ferromagnetic coupling, vertical bar J(F)vertical bar, between physical qubits representing the same logical one. We extend the theoretical picture for pausing and thermalization in quantum annealing to the embedded case. This picture, along with perturbation-theory analysis and exact numerical results on small problems, confirms that the effective pause region moves earlier in the anneal as vertical bar J(F)vertical bar increases. It also suggests why pausing, while still providing significant benefit, has a less pronounced effect on embedded problems.

TI Experimental demonstration of entanglement-enabled universal quantum
   cloning in a circuit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB No-cloning theorem forbids perfect cloning of an unknown quantum state. A universal quantum cloning machine (UQCM), capable of producing two copies of any input qubit with the optimal fidelity, is of fundamental interest and has applications in quantum information processing. This is enabled by delicately tailored nonclassical correlations between the input qubit and the copying qubits, which distinguish the UQCM from a classical counterpart, but whose experimental demonstrations are still lacking. We here implement the UQCM in a superconducting circuit and investigate these correlations. The measured entanglements well agree with our theoretical prediction that they are independent of the input state and thus constitute a universal quantum behavior of the UQCM that was not previously revealed. Another feature of our experiment is the realization of deterministic and individual cloning, in contrast to previously demonstrated UQCMs, which either were probabilistic or did not constitute true cloning of individual qubits.

AB Quantum circuit simulation (QCS) plays an important role in the designs and analysis of a quantum algorithm, as it assists researchers in understanding how quantum operations work without accessing expensive quantum computers. Despite many QCS methods, they are largely limited to simulating one input at a time. However, many simulation-driven quantum computing applications, such as testing and verification, require simulating multiple inputs to reason a quantum algorithm under different scenarios. We refer to this type of QCS as batch quantum circuit simulation (BQCS). In this paper, we present BQSim, a GPU-accelerated batch quantum circuit simulator. BQSim is inspired by the state-of-the-art decision diagram (DD) that can compactly represent quantum gate matrices, but overcomes its limitation of CPU-centric simulation. Specifically, BQSim uses DD to optimize a quantum circuit for reduced BQCS computation and converts DD to a GPU-efficient data structure. Additionally, BQSim employs a task graph-based execution strategy to minimize repetitive kernel call overhead and efficiently overlap kernel execution with data movement. Compared with three state-of-the-art quantum circuit simulators, cuQuantum, Qiskit Aer, and FlatDD, BQSim is 3.25x, 159.06x, and 311.42x faster on average.

TI Crystalline phases and devil's staircase in qubit spin ice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Motivated by the recent realization of an artificial quantum spin ice in an array of superconducting qubits with tunable parameters [King et al., Science 373, 576 (2021)], we scrutinize a quantum six-vertex model on the square lattice that distinguishes type-I and type-II vertices. We map the zero-temperature phase diagram using numerical (exact diagonalization) and analytical (perturbation expansion, Gershgorin theorem) methods. Following a symmetry classification, we identify three crystalline phases alongside a subextensive manifold of isolated configurations. Monte Carlo simulations at the multicritical Rokhsar-Kivelson point provide evidence for a quantum phase exhibiting a cascade of transitions with increasing flux. By comparing structure factors, we find evidence for the emergence of the fully flippable and plaquette phases in the artificial quantum spin ice.

TI Diabatic quantum and classical annealing of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum annealing is a contender to solve combinatorial optimization problems based on quantum dynamics. While significant efforts have been undertaken to investigate the quality of the solutions and the required run times, much less attention has been paid to understanding the dynamics of quantum annealing and the process leading to the solution during the sweep itself. In this comprehensive study, we investigate various aspects of the quantum annealing dynamics using different approaches. We perform quantum annealing, simulated quantum annealing, and classical annealing on several hundred instances of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with intermediate system sizes up to 22 spins using numerical simulations. We observe qualitative differences between the quantum and classical methods, in particular at intermediate times, where a peak in the fidelity, also known as diabatic bump, appears for hard instances. Furthermore, we investigate the two-point correlation functions, which feature differences at intermediate times as well. At short times, however, the methods are similar again, which can be explained by relating the short-time expansion of quantum annealing to a high-temperature expansion, thus allowing one in principle to find the classical solution already at short times, albeit at prohibitive sampling cost.

TI Simple Sentiment Analysis Ansatz for Sentiment Classification in Quantum
   Natural Language Processing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Sentiment classification is a valuable application of natural language processing that has seen wide usage in optimizing business processes. This paper explores a novel implementation of sentiment analysis using the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) framework. As ansatz choice determines model performance in VQA, this paper proposes an alternative ansatz for the sentiment classification task in quantum representation. Specifically, it builds upon previous work in quantum sentiment classification by proposing an alternative ansatz to the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime ansatz, entitled Simple Sentiment Analysis (SimpleSA) ansatz. A key feature of the SimpleSA ansatz is the decision to neglect noun parameterization. The proposed SimpleSA has less complexity than the other ansatze in terms of the number of parameters and the number of gates. Moreover, experimental results show that the SimpleSA ansatz with H-CNOT-Rz-H compound block construction outperforms the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) ansatz at 85.00% accuracy. Furthermore, SimpleSA optimization converges 20.89% faster than Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) for the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method with 130 iterations. The proposed work is useful for applications of quantum computers for sentiment analyses and classifications.

TI Realizing acoustic qubit analogues with nonlinearly tunable phi-bits in
   externally driven coupled acoustic waveguides
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Using experiments and theory, we investigate the behavior of nonlinear acoustic modes in a physical system composed of an array of three coupled acoustic waveguides, two of which are externally driven with two different frequencies. Nonlinear modes with frequency given by linear combinations of the driving frequencies are realizations of so-called logical phi-bits. A phi-bit is a two-state degree of freedom of an acoustic wave, which can be in a coherent superposition of states with complex amplitude coefficients, i.e., a qubit analogue. We demonstrate experimentally that phi-bit modes are supported in the array of waveguides. Using perturbation theory, we show that phi-bits may result from the intrinsic nonlinearity of the material used to couple the waveguides. We have also isolated possible effects on phi-bit states associated with the systems' electronics, transducers and ultrasonic coupling agents used to probe the array and that may introduce extrinsic nonlinearities. These extrinsic effects are shown to be easily separable from the intrinsic behavior. The intrinsic behavior includes sharp jumps in phi-bit phases occurring over very narrow ranges of driving frequency. These jumps may also exhibit hysteretic behavior dependent on the direction of driving frequency tuning. The intrinsic states of phi-bits and multiple nonlinearly correlated phi-bits may serve as foundation for robust and practical quantum-analogue information technologies.

Recently, hybrid systems based on magnons have provided a series of high-quality platforms for quantum information science with their unique advantages. Magnons, spin wave quanta generated by the collective excitation of magnetic materials, have high spin density, low dissipation rate, and flexible tunability and can be coupled with microwave photons, optical photons, phonons, and superconducting qubits, showing exceptional compatibility and scalability. The ferromagnet-superconducting system is composed of the magnon and superconducting qubit, thus combining their complementary advantages, and has been investigated extensively in theory and experiments. Here, we provide an overview of the development and research progress of the ferromagnet-superconductor system in quantum optics and prospects of future development in this field.

TI Learning Quantum States and Unitaries of Bounded Gate Complexity
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB While quantum state tomography is notoriously hard, most states hold little interest to practically minded tomographers. Given that states and unitaries appearing in nature are of bounded gate complexity, it is natural to ask if efficient learning becomes possible. In this work, we prove that to learn a state generated by a quantum circuit with G two-qubit gates to a small trace distance, a sample complexity scaling linearly in G is necessary and sufficient. We also prove that the optimal query complexity to learn a unitary generated by G gates to a small average-case error scales linearly in G. While sample-efficient learning can be achieved, we show that under reasonable cryptographic conjectures, the computational complexity for learning states and unitaries of gate complexity G must scale exponentially in G. We illustrate how these results establish fundamental limitations on the expressivity of quantum machine-learning models and provide new perspectives on no-free-lunch theorems in unitary learning. Together, our results answer how the complexity of learning quantum states and unitaries relate to the complexity of creating these states and unitaries.

TI Quantum sensing using atomic clocks for nuclear and particle physics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Technologies for manipulating single atoms have advanced drastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of internal states, atoms serve as one of the ideal platforms for quantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise determination of physical quantities using atoms, which is included in the field of precision measurements. One of such precisely measured physical quantities is the energy differences between two energy levels in atoms, which is symbolized by the remarkable fractional uncertainty of 10(-18) or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external fields and can, therefore, function as quantum sensors. The effect of these fields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such shifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before the advent of precision spectroscopy with lasers. With high-precision measurements, tiny energy shifts caused by hypothetical fields weakly coupled to ordinary matter or by small effects mediated by massive particles can be potentially detectable, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear and particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have not been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments searching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants, except in a few cases where the effects are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in atomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics. In some cases, they open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated topics, e.g., dark matter, fifth force, and other physics beyond the Standard Model. In other cases, these measurements provide alternative experimental approaches to established topics, e.g., variations of fundamental constants searched for astronomically and nuclear structure studied in high-energy scattering experiments. The use of atomic clocks as quantum sensors for phenomena originating from nuclear and particle physics evolved significantly in the past decades. This paper highlights the recent developments in the field.

TI Nonperturbative theory of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in open
   and dispersive optical systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We develop a nonperturbative formulation based on the Green's function quantization method that can describe spontaneous parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime in nonlinear optical structures with arbitrary amount of loss and dispersion. This formalism opens the way for description and design of arbitrary complex and/or open nanostructured nonlinear optical systems in quantum technology applications, such as squeezedlight generation, nonlinearity-based quantum sensing, and hybrid quantum systems mediated by nonlinear interactions. As an example case, we numerically investigate the scenario of integrated quantum spectroscopy with undetected photons, in the high-gain regime, and uncover novel gain-dependent effects in the performance of the system.

TI Error Rates in Deterministic Ion Implantation for Qubit Arrays
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB The theoretical error rates in deterministic ion implantation when using an ion beam governed by a Poisson point process with a detector that counts the impacts are investigated. It is concluded that if the error rates are small, then for spots with nominally one implanted ion the probability of failure to implant the correct number is approximate to kappa/lambda+eta over bar +lambda/2 for a synchronous (i.e., pulsed) system or K/L+eta over bar +Lts for an asynchronous (i.e., continuous beam) system, where eta over bar is the probability that the detector misses an ion impact, and L(K) and lambda(kappa) are the number of ions (dark counts) per unit time and per pulse, respectively. t(s) is the system reaction time for an asynchronous system. This approximation allows easy identification of the greatest need for engineering effort. Some experimental efforts to measure these parameters and their uncertainties are examined.

TI Hybrid Classical-Quantum Text Search Based on Hashing
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The paper considers the problem of finding a given substring in a text. It is known that the complexity of a classical search query in an unordered database is linear in the length of the text and a given substring. At the same time, Grover's quantum search provides a quadratic speed-up in the complexity of the query and gives the correct result with a high probability. We propose a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm (hybrid random-quantum algorithm, to be more precise) that implements Grover's search to find a given substring in a text. As expected, the algorithm works (a) with a high probability of obtaining the correct result and (b) with a quadratic query acceleration compared to the classical one. What is new is that our algorithm uses the uniform hash family functions technique. As a result, our algorithm is much more memory efficient (in terms of the number of qubits used) compared to previously known quantum algorithms.

AB High error rates and limited fidelity of quantum gates in near-term quantum devices are the central obstacles to successful execution of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this paper we introduce an application-specific approach for mitigating the errors in QAOA evolution by leveraging the symmetries present in the classical objective function to be optimized. Specifically, the QAOA state is projected into the symmetry-restricted subspace, with projection being performed either at the end of the circuit or throughout the evolution. Our approach improves the fidelity of the QAOA state, thereby increasing both the accuracy of the sample estimate of the QAOA objective and the probability of sampling the binary string corresponding to that objective value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods on QAOA applied to the MaxCut problem, although our methods are general and apply to any objective function with symmetries, as well as to the generalization of QAOA with alternative mixers. We experimentally verify the proposed methods on an IBM Quantum processor, utilizing up to 5 qubits. When leveraging a global bit-flip symmetry, our approach leads to a 23% average improvement in quantum state fidelity.

TI Information Geometry under Hierarchical Quantum Measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In most quantum technologies, measurements need to be performed on the parametrized quantum states to transform the quantum information to classical information. The measurements, however, inevitably distort the information. The characterization of the discrepancy is an important subject in quantum information science, which plays a key role in understanding the difference between the structures of quantum and classical informations. Here we analyze the difference in terms of the Fisher information metric and present a framework that can provide analytical bounds on the discrepancy under hierarchical quantum measurements. Specifically, we present a set of analytical bounds on the difference between the quantum and classical Fisher information metric under hierarchical p-local quantum measurements, which are measurements that can be performed collectively on at most p copies of quantum states. The results can be directly transformed to the precision limit in multiparameter quantum metrology, which leads to characterizations of the trade-off among the precision of different parameters. The framework also provides a coherent picture for various existing results by including them as special cases.

TI Probability Representation of Quantum States
SO ENTROPY
AB The review of new formulation of conventional quantum mechanics where the quantum states are identified with probability distributions is presented. The invertible map of density operators and wave functions onto the probability distributions describing the quantum states in quantum mechanics is constructed both for systems with continuous variables and systems with discrete variables by using the Born's rule and recently suggested method of dequantizer-quantizer operators. Examples of discussed probability representations of qubits (spin-1/2, two-level atoms), harmonic oscillator and free particle are studied in detail. Schrodinger and von Neumann equations, as well as equations for the evolution of open systems, are written in the form of linear classical-like equations for the probability distributions determining the quantum system states. Relations to phase-space representation of quantum states (Wigner functions) with quantum tomography and classical mechanics are elucidated.

TI Quantum-Based Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO-NOMA Systems for 6G
   Networks
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB As wireless networks advance toward the Sixth Generation (6G), which will support highly heterogeneous scenarios and massive data traffic, conventional computing methods may struggle to meet the immense processing demands in a resource-efficient manner. This paper explores the potential of quantum computing (QC) to address these challenges, specifically by enhancing the efficiency of Maximum-Likelihood detection in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication systems, an essential technology anticipated for 6G. The study proposes the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a variational quantum algorithm known for providing quantum advantages in certain combinatorial optimization problems. While current quantum systems are not yet capable of managing millions of physical qubits or performing high-fidelity, long gate sequences, the results indicate that QAOA is a promising QC approach for radio signal processing tasks. This research provides valuable insights into the potential transformative impact of QC on future wireless networks. This sets the stage for discussions on practical implementation challenges, such as constrained problem sizes and sensitivity to noise, and opens pathways for future research aimed at fully harnessing the potential of QC for 6G and beyond.

TI Vortex creation and control in the Kitaev spin liquid by local bond
   modulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The Kitaev model realizes a quantum spin liquid where the spin excitations are fractionalized into itinerant Majorana fermions and localized Z(2) vortices. Quantum entanglement between the fractional excitations can be utilized for decoherence-free topological quantum computation. Of particular interest is the anyonic statistics realized by braiding the vortex excitations under a magnetic field. Despite the promising potential, the practical methodology for creation and control of the vortex excitations remains elusive thus far. Here we theoretically propose how one can create and move the vortices in the Kitaev spin liquid. We find that the vortices are induced by a local modulation of the exchange interaction; especially, the local Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (symmetric off-diagonal) interaction can create vortices most efficiently in the (anti)ferromagnetic Kitaev model, as it effectively flips the sign of the Kitaev interaction. We test this idea by performing the ab initio calculation for the candidate material alpha-RuCl3 through the manipulation of the ligand positions that breaks the inversion symmetry and induces the local Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also demonstrate a braiding of vortices by adiabatically and successively changing the local bond modulations.

TI Transfer Entropy and O-Information to Detect Grokking in Tensor Network
   Multi-Class Classification Problems
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum-enhanced machine learning, encompassing both quantum algorithms and quantum-inspired classical methods such as tensor networks, offers promising tools for extracting structure from complex, high-dimensional data. In this work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyperspectral satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information-theory tools to gain deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted hyperspectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.

TI Generalized geometric speed limits for quantum observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Leveraging quantum information geometry, we derive generalized quantum speed limits on the rate of change of the expectation values of observables. These bounds subsume and, for Hilbert space dimension ,3, tighten existing bounds-in some cases by an arbitrarily large multiplicative constant. Our theoretical results are supported by illustrative examples and an experimental demonstration using a superconducting qutrit. We also derive two upper bounds on the generalized quantum Fisher information in terms of the condition number of the density matrix. One of these bounds applies only to coherent dynamics and depends also on the variance of the Hamiltonian. The other bound depends also on the so-called Wigner-Yanase skew information. These bounds generalize well-known bounds on the symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum Fisher information and are tighter than the existing bounds for sufficiently mixed states (e.g., for sufficiently high temperature thermal states).

TI Manipulating Coherent Exciton Dynamics in CsPbI3 Perovskite
   Quantum Dots Using Magnetic Field
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a promising material platform for quantum information processing owing to their strong light-matter interaction and relatively long-lived optical and spin coherences. In particular, the coherence of the fine-structure bright excitons is sustainable up to room temperature and can be observed even at an ensemble level. Here modulation of the polarization of these excitons in CsPbI3 QDs and manipulation of their time-domain coherent dynamics using a longitudinal magnetic field are demonstrated. The manipulation is realized using femtosecond quantum beat spectroscopy performed with both circularly- and linearly-polarized pulses. The results are well captured by the density of matrix simulation and are picturized using a Bloch sphere. This study forms the basis for preparing arbitrary coherent superpositions of excitons in perovskite QDs for an array of quantum technologies under near-ambient conditions.

TI Improving Hamiltonian encodings with the Gray code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Due to the limitations of present-day quantum hardware, it is especially critical to design algorithms that make the best possible use of available resources. When simulating quantum many-body systems on a quantum computer, straightforward encodings that transform many-body Hamiltonians into qubit Hamiltonians use N of the available basis states of an N-qubit system, whereas 2(N) are in theory available. We explore an efficient encoding that uses the entire set of basis states, where terms in the Hamiltonian are mapped to qubit operators with a Hamiltonian that acts on the basis states in Gray code order. This encoding is applied to the commonly studied problem of finding the ground-state energy of a deuteron with a simulated variational quantum eigen-solver (VQE). It is compared to a standard "one-hot" encoding, and various trade-offs that arise are analyzed. The energy distribution of VQE solutions has smaller variance than the one obtained by the one-hot encoding even in the presence of simulated hardware noise, despite an increase in the number of measurements. The reduced number of qubits and a shorter-depth variational Ansatz enables the encoding of larger problems on current-generation machines. This encoding also demonstrates improvements for simulating time evolution of the same system, producing circuits for the evolution operators with reduced depth and roughly half the number of gates compared to a one-hot encoding.

TI Systems of quaternionic linear matrix equations: solution, computation,
   algorithm, and applications
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB In applied and computational mathematics, quaternions are fundamental in representing three-dimensional rotations. However, specific types of quaternionic linear matrix equations remain few explored. This study introduces new quaternionic linear matrix equations and their necessary and sufficient ffi cient conditions for solvability. We employ a methodology involving lemmas and ranks of coefficient ffi cient matrices to develop a novel algorithm. This algorithm is validated through numerical examples, showing its applications in advanced fields. In control theory, these equations are used for analyzing control systems, particularly for spacecraft attitude control in aerospace engineering and for control of arms in robotics. In quantum computing, quaternionic equations model quantum gates and transformations, which are important for algorithms and error correction, contributing to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. In signal processing, these equations enhance multidimensional signal filtering and noise reduction, with applications in color image processing and radar signal analysis. We extend our study to include cases of eta-Hermitian and i-Hermitian solutions. Our work represents an advancement in applied mathematics, providing computational methods for solving quaternionic matrix equations and expanding their practical applications.

AB The advent of quantum computing has engendered a widespread proliferation of efforts utilizing qubits for optimizing classical computational algorithms. Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is one such popular algorithm that accelerates polynomial multiplication significantly and is consequently, the core arithmetic operation in most homomorphic encryption algorithms. Hence, fast and efficient execution of NTT is highly imperative for practical implementation of homomorphic encryption schemes in different computing paradigms. In this paper, we, for the first time, propose an efficient and scalable Quantum Number Theoretic Transform (QNTT) circuit using quantum gates. We introduce a novel exponential unit for modular exponential operation, which furnishes an algorithmic complexity of O(n). Our proposed methodology performs further optimization and logic synthesis of QNTT, that is significantly fast and facilitates efficient implementations on IBM's quantum computers. The optimized QNTT achieves a gate-level complexity reduction from power of two to one with respect to bit length. Our methodology utilizes 44.2% fewer gates, thereby minimizing the circuit depth and a corresponding reduction in overhead and error probability, for a 4-point QNTT compared to its unoptimized counterpart.

TI Application of metric space method in quantum information in
   quasi-periodic systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Due to the rapid advancement of quantum information theory, some concepts such as fidelity and entanglement entropy have been introduced into the study of quantum phase transitions, which can be used not only to identify novel matter phases but also to detect the critical point and describe the critical behavior of the quantum phase transitions. From the point of view of the metric space, these physical quantities can be understood as the distance between the two functions in the metric space. In this work, we study a class of quasi-periodic system represented by the generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model, by using the distance between various wavefunctions or density distribution functions in real space. The generalized AAH model, an ideal platform to understand Anderson localization and other novel quantum phenomena, provides rich phase diagrams including extended, localized, even critical (multifractal) phases and can be realized in a variety of experimental platforms. In the standard AAH model, we find that the extended and localized phases can be identified. In addition, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between two distinct distances. We are able to precisely identify the critical point and compute the critical exponent by fitting the numerical results of different system sizes. In the off-diagonal AAH model, a complete phase diagram including extended phase, localized phase, and critical phase is obtained and the distance of critical phases is intermediate between the localized phase and extended phase. Meanwhile, we apply the metric space method to the wave packet propagation and discover that depending on the phase, the distance between wave functions or density functions exhibits varying dynamical evolution behavior, which is characterized by the exponent of the power-law relationship varying with time. Finally, the distance between the state density distribution functions is proposed, and it effectively identifies distinct matter phases and critical points. The critical phase which displays a multifractal structure, when compared with the other two phases, has the large state density distribution function distance. In a word, by defining the distances of a function under different parameters, we provide not only a physical quantity to identify familiar phase transitions but also an intuitive way to identify different matter phases of unknown systems, phase transition points, and their critical behaviors.

TI Optimizing for periodicity: a model-independent approach to flux
   crosstalk calibration for superconducting circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Flux tunability is an important engineering resource for superconducting circuits. Large-scale quantum computers based on flux-tunable superconducting circuits face the problem of flux crosstalk, which needs to be accurately calibrated to realize high-fidelity quantum operations. Typical calibration methods either assume that circuit elements can be effectively decoupled and simple models can be applied, or require a large amount of data. Such methods become ineffective as the system size increases and circuit interactions become stronger. Here we propose a new method for calibrating flux crosstalk, which is independent of the underlying circuit model. Using the fundamental property that superconducting circuits respond periodically to external fluxes, crosstalk calibration of N flux channels can be treated as N independent optimization problems, with the objective functions being the periodicity of a measured signal depending on the compensation parameters. We demonstrate this method on a small-scale quantum annealing circuit based on superconducting flux qubits, achieving comparable accuracy with previous methods. We also show that the objective function usually has a nearly convex landscape, allowing efficient optimization.

TI A tunable entangled photon-pair source based on a Van der Waals
   insulator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Scalable quantum photonic devices drive the development of compact sources of entangled photons, which are pivotal for quantum communication, computing, and cryptography. In this work, we present entangled photon pair generation in rhombohedral boron nitride (r-BN), leveraging its unique optical and structural properties. Unlike conventional hexagonal boron nitride, which suffers from reduced nonlinear response due to centrosymmetric structure in even-layered stacks, r-BN features interlayer ABC stacking and maintains robust in-plane inversion symmetry. These characteristics lead to highly efficient entangled photon generation. Our system demonstrates an entangled photon pair generation rate up to 8667 Hz/(mW<middle dot>mm) and offers a tunable platform for Bell state generation by simply adjusting the pump polarization, without compromising the entanglement quality or generation efficiency. The polarization entangled state is measured with a fidelity up to 94%. This advancement not only marks a significant step towards ultrathin, scalable quantum devices but also establishes r-BN as a promising candidate for on-chip integrated quantum optical applications.

TI All-optical reversible single-photon isolation at room temperature
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Nonreciprocal devices operating at the single-photon level are fundamental elements for quantum technologies. Because magneto-optical nonreciprocal devices are incompatible for magnetic-sensitive or on-chip quantum information processing, all-optical nonreciprocal isolation is highly desired, but its realization at the quantum level is yet to be accomplished at room temperature. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two regimes, using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) or a Raman transition, for all-optical isolation with warm atoms. We achieve an isolation of 22.52 +/- 0.10 dB and an insertion loss of about 1.95 dB for a genuine single photon, with bandwidth up to hundreds of megahertz. The Raman regime realized in the same experimental setup enables us to achieve high isolation and low insertion loss for coherent optical fields with reversed isolation direction. These realizations of single-photon isolation and coherent light isolation at room temperature are promising for simpler reconfiguration of high-speed classical and quantum information processing.

TI Measuring magic on a quantum processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Magic states are the resource that allows quantum computers to attain an advantage over classical computers. This resource consists in the deviation from a property called stabilizerness which in turn implies that stabilizer circuits can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Without magic, no quantum computer can do anything that a classical computer cannot do. Given the importance of magic for quantum computation, it would be useful to have a method for measuring the amount of magic in a quantum state. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for measuring magic based on randomized measurements. Our experiments are carried out on two IBM Quantum Falcon processors. This protocol can provide a characterization of the effectiveness of a quantum hardware in producing states that cannot be effectively simulated on a classical computer. We show how from these measurements one can construct realistic noise models affecting the hardware.

TI Fixed-Point Grover Adaptive Search for Quadratic Binary Optimization
   Problems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we study a Grover-type method for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. For an n -dimensional QUBO problem with m nonzero terms, we construct a marker oracle for such problems with a tunable parameter, Lambda is an element of [1,m] boolean AND Z . At d is an element of Z(+) precision, the oracle uses O(n+Lambda d) qubits and has total depth of O(m/Lambda log(2)(n)+log(2)(d)) and a non-Clifford depth of O(m/Lambda) . Moreover, each qubit is required to be connected to at most O(log(2)(Lambda+d)) other qubits. In the case of a maximum graph cuts, as d=2(sic)log(2)(n)(sic) always suffices, the depth of the marker oracle can be made as shallow as O(log(2)(n)) . For all values of Lambda , the non-Clifford gate count of these oracles is strictly lower (at least by a factor of similar to 2 ) than previous constructions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fixed-point Grover adaptive search for QUBO problems, using our oracle design and a hybrid fixed-point Grover search, motivated by the works of Boyer et al. (1988) and Li et al. (2019). This method has better performance guarantees than previous Grover adaptive search methods. Some of our results are novel and useful for any method based on the fixed-point Grover search. Finally, we give a heuristic argument that, with high probability and in O(log(2)(n)/root epsilon) time, this adaptive method finds a configuration that is among the best & varepsilon;2(n) ones.

TI Demonstration of universal time-reversal for qubit processes
SO OPTICA
AB In quantum mechanics, the unitary nature of time evolution makes it intrinsically reversible, given control over the system in question. Remarkably, there have been several recent demonstrations of protocols for reverting unknown unitaries in scenarios where even the interactions with the target system are unknown. These protocols are limited by their probabilistic nature, raising the fundamental question of whether time-reversal could be performed deterministically. Here we show that quantum physics indeed allows for this by exploiting the non-commuting nature of quantum operators, and demonstrate a recursive protocol for two-level quantum systems with an arbitrarily high probability of success. Using a photonic platform, we achieve an average rewinding fidelity of over 95%. Our protocol, requiring no knowledge of the quantum process to be rewound, is optimal in its running time, and brings quantum rewinding into a regime of practical relevance.

CA JUNO Collaboration
TI Damping signatures at JUNO, a medium-baseline reactor neutrino
   oscillation experiment
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study damping signatures at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a medium-baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiment. These damping signatures are motivated by various new physics models, including quantum decoherence, nu(3) decay, neutrino absorption, and wave packet decoherence. The phenomenological effects of these models can be characterized by exponential damping factors at the probability level. We assess how well JUNO can constrain these damping parameters and how to disentangle these different damping signatures at JUNO. Compared to current experimental limits, JUNO can significantly improve the limits on tau(3)/m(3) in the nu(3) decay model, the width of the neutrino wave packet sigma(x), and the intrinsic relative dispersion of neutrino momentum sigma(rel).

TI Room Temperature Quantum Emitters in van der Waals α-MoO3
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the generation of room temperature single-photon emission from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals alpha-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 0.4 Mcts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in alpha-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.

TI Finding All Solutions with Grover's Algorithm by Integrating Estimation
   and Discovery
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Grover's algorithm leverages quantum computing to efficiently locate solutions in unstructured search spaces, outperforming classical approaches. Since Grover's algorithm requires prior knowledge of the number of solutions (M) within a search space of size N, previous studies assume M is estimated beforehand and focus on identifying all solutions. Here, we propose a two-step process that integrates both the estimation of M and the discovery of the solutions, optimizing the interactions between the two steps. To enhance efficiency, the estimation step captures as many solutions as possible, leaving the discovery step to focus on the remaining ones. To ensure accuracy, the discovery step continues searching until the probability of finding additional solutions becomes sufficiently low. We implemented and evaluated our methods, showing that over 80% of solutions were found during the estimation phase, allowing the discovery phase to conclude earlier, while identifying over 99% of solutions on average. In theory, the process requires NM x log(M) Grover's iterations in the worst case, but in practice, it typically terminates after iterations proportional to N. We expect that our methods will be applicable to various search problems and inspire further research on efficiently finding all solutions.

TI Detectability of Seamount Eruptions Through a Quantum Technology Gravity
   Mission MOCAST plus : Hunga Tonga, Fani Maoré and Other Smaller
   Eruptions
SO SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
AB Seamount eruptions alter the bathymetry and can occur undetected due to lack of explosive character. We review documented eruptions to define whether they could be detected by a future satellite gravity mission. We adopt the noise level in acquisitions of multi-satellite constellations as in the MOCAST+ study, with a proposed payload of a quantum technology gradiometer and clock. The review of underwater volcanoes includes the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) islands for which the exposed surface changed during volcanic unrests of 2014/2015 and 2021/2022. The Fani Maor & eacute; submarine volcanic eruption of 2018-2021 produced a new seamount 800 m high, emerging from a depth of 3500 m, and therefore not seen above sea surface. We review further documented submarine eruptions and estimate the upper limit of the expected gravity changes. We find that a MOCAST+ type mission should allow us to detect the subsurface mass changes generated by deep ocean submarine volcanic activity for volume changes of 6.5 km3 upwards, with latency of 1 year. This change is met by the HTHH and Fani Maor & eacute; volcanoes.

TI Adversarial Attack Defense Method for a Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution System Based on Kernel Robust Manifold Non-Negative Matrix
   Factorization
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Machine learning has been applied in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems to address the growing threat of quantum hacking attacks. However, the use of machine learning algorithms for detecting these attacks has uncovered a vulnerability to adversarial disturbances that can compromise security. By subtly perturbing the detection networks used in CVQKD, significant misclassifications can occur. To address this issue, we utilize an adversarial sample defense method based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), considering the nonlinearity and high-dimensional nature of CVQKD data. Specifically, we employ the Kernel Robust Manifold Non-negative Matrix Factorization (KRMNMF) algorithm to reconstruct input samples, reducing the impact of adversarial perturbations. Firstly, we extract attack features against CVQKD by considering the adversary known as Eve. Then, we design an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) detection model to identify these attacks. Next, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the data generated by Eve. Finally, we use the KRMNMF decomposition to extract features from CVQKD data and mitigate the influence of adversarial perturbations through reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of KRMNMF can effectively defend against adversarial attacks to a certain extent. The accuracy of KRMNMF surpasses the commonly used Comdefend method by 32.2% and the JPEG method by 30.8%. Moreover, it exhibits an improvement of 20.8% compared to NMF and outperforms other NMF-related algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, it can complement other defense strategies, thus enhancing the overall defensive capabilities of CVQKD systems.

TI Secure and Reliable Big-Data-Based Decision Making Using Quantum
   Approach in IIoT Systems
SO SENSORS
AB Nowadays, the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) and smart factories are relying on intelligence and big data analytics for large-scale decision making. Yet, this method is facing critical challenges regarding computation and data processing due to the complexity and heterogeneous nature of big data. Smart factory systems rely primarily on the analysis results to optimize production, predict future market directions, prevent and manage risks, and so on. However, deploying the existing classical solutions such as machine learning, cloud, and AI is not effective anymore. Smart factory systems and industries need novel solutions to sustain their development. On the other hand, with the fast development of quantum information systems (QISs), multiple sectors are studying the opportunities and challenges of implementing quantum-based solutions for a more efficient and exponentially faster processing time. To this end, in this paper, we discuss the implementation of quantum solutions for reliable and sustainable IIoT-based smart factory development. We depict various applications where quantum algorithms could improve the scalability and productivity of IIoT systems. Moreover, we design a universal system model where smart factories would not need to acquire quantum computers to run quantum algorithms based on their needs; instead, they can use quantum cloud servers and quantum terminals implemented at the edge layer to help them run the desired quantum algorithms without the need of an expert. To prove the feasibility of our model, we implement two real-world case studies and evaluate their performance. The analysis shows the benefits of quantum solutions in different sectors of smart factories.

TI Coherence Properties of Rare-Earth Spins in Micrometer-Thin Films
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Rare-earth ions in bulk crystals are excellent solid-state quantum systems in quantum information science owing to their exceptional optical and spin coherence properties. However, the weak fluorescence of single rare-earth ions presents a significant challenge for scalability, necessitating the integration into microcavities. Thin films serve as a promising material platform for the integration, yet fabrication without compromising the properties of the materials and rare-earth ions remains challenging. In this work, we fabricate micrometer-thin yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) films from bulk crystals using ion implantation techniques. The resulting films preserve the single-crystalline structure of the original bulk crystal. Notably, the embedded rare-earth ions are photostable and exhibit bulk-like spin coherence properties. Our results demonstrate the compatibility of bulk-like spin properties with the thin-film fabrication technique, facilitating the efficient integration of rare-earth ions into on-chip photonic devices and advancing the applications of rare-earth ionsin quantum technologies.

TI 24 Days-Stable CNOT Gate on Fluxonium Qubits with Over 99.9% Fidelity
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fluxonium qubit is a promising elementary building block for quantum information processing due to its long coherence time combined with a strong anharmonicity. In this paper, we realize a 60-ns direct CNOT gate on two inductively coupled fluxoniums, which behave almost exactly as a pair of transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. The CNOT-gate fidelity, estimated using randomized benchmarking, was as high as 99.94%. Furthermore, the fidelity remains above 99.9% for 24 days without any recalibration between measurements. Compared with the 99.96% fidelity of a 60-ns identity gate, our data brings the investigation of the nondecoherence-related errors during logical operations down to 2 x 10-4. The present result adds a simple and robust two-qubit gate into the still relatively small family of the "beyond three nines" gates on superconducting qubits.

TI A time-parallel multiple-shooting method for large-scale quantum optimal
   control
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in quantum computing by providing the interface between compiler and hardware. Solving the optimal control problem is particularly challenging for multi-qubit gates, due to the exponential growth in computational complexity with the system's dimensionality and the deterioration of optimization convergence. To ameliorate the computational complexity of time-integration, this paper introduces a multiple-shooting approach in which the time domain is divided into multiple windows and the intermediate states at window boundaries are treated as additional optimization variables. This enables parallel computation of state evolution across time-windows, significantly accelerating objective function and gradient evaluations. Since the initial state matrix in each window is only guaranteed to be unitary upon convergence of the optimization algorithm, the conventional gate trace infidelity is replaced by a generalized infidelity that is convex for non-unitary state matrices. Continuity of the state across window boundaries is enforced by equality constraints. A quadratic penalty optimization method is used to solve the constrained optimal control problem, and an efficient adjoint technique is employed to calculate the gradients in each iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on quantum Fourier transform gates in systems with 2, 3, and 4 qubits, noting a speedup of 80x for evaluating the gradient in the 4-qubit case, highlighting the method's potential for optimizing control pulses in multi-qubit quantum systems.

TI Fetal magnetocardiography: Using quantum technologies to define fetal
   rhythm, conduction, and repolarization prior to birth
SO AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL PLUS: CARDIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB The timeframe of fetal development holds many risks, and mortality is higher than at almost any other time in the human life-cycle. To date, echocardiography has dominated fetal cardiac assessment. Since the 1990's, the potential value of fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) as a means of recording the fetal rhythm and cardiac time intervals (RR, P, PR, QRS, QT, QTc) has been appreciated. Over the intervening 3 decades, well over 1000 fetal studies have been performed in pregnancies with various high-risk conditions, the majority with fetal arrhythmias or congenital heart disease. Most studies to date have been performed using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQIUD) magnetometers within a magnetically-shielded room (MSR). Since 2015, a new type of quantum device called an Optically-pumped magnetometer (OPM) has been introduced. These small sensors can be assembled for multichannel recording. OPMs do not require cryogenics, dramatically reducing the potential cost of a system, and thus allowing for the concept of a "person-sized shield rather than a full-sized MSR. Yet no OPM systems are yet FDA approved for the fetus. This contemporary review will summarize the current and future use of fMCG in the clinical and research setting and will compare fetal MCG by OPM with that of SQUID. Challenges to commercialization will be discussed.

TI Quantum neural networks for power flow analysis
SO ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB This paper explores the potential application of quantum and hybrid quantum-classical neural networks in power flow analysis. Experiments are conducted using two datasets based on 4-bus and 33-bus test systems. A systematic performance comparison is also conducted among quantum, hybrid quantum-classical, and classical neural networks. The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) training dataset size needed, (iv) training error, and (v) training process stability. The results show that the developed hybrid quantum-classical neural network outperforms both quantum and classical neural networks, and hence can improve deep learning-based power flow analysis in the noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) and fault-tolerant quantum (FTQ) era.

TI Prospects for quantum process tomography at high energies
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system-a unitary evolution followed by a measurement-is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as quantum instruments. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The experimental reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model, which predict different input-output transitions. In addition, the methodology constitutes a new foundational test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline the quantum process tomography approach applied to the e+e--> tt<overline> process at a polarised lepton collider.

TI Experimental Fiber-Based Quantum Triangle-Network Nonlocality with a
   Telecom AlGaAs Multiplexed Entangled-Photon Source
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The exploration of the concept of nonlocality beyond standard Bell scenarios in quantum network architectures unveils fundamentally new forms of correlations that hold a strong potential for future applications of quantum communication networks. To materialize this potential, it is necessary to adapt theoretical advances to realistic configurations. Here, we consider a quantum triangle network, for which is has been shown in theory that, remarkably, quantum nonlocality without inputs can be demonstrated for sources with an arbitrarily small level of independence. We realize such correlated sources experimentally by carefully engineering the output state of a single AlGaAs multiplexed entangled-photon source, exploiting energy-matched channels cut in its broad spectrum. This simulated triangle network, based on standard fiber telecom components, is then used to violate experimentally a Bell-like inequality that we derive to capture the effect of noise in the correlations present in our system. We also rigorously validate our findings by analyzing the mutual information between the generated states. Our results allow us to deepen our understanding of network nonlocality while also pushing its practical relevance for quantum communication networks.

TI Qoolchain: A QUBO Preprocessing Toolchain for Enhancing Quantum
   Optimization
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Solving combinatorial optimization problems is crucial in research and industry but still challenging since these problems are usually NP-hard or NP-complete. Classical solvers struggle with their non-polynomial complexity. Although heuristic algorithms are widely used, they often fall short in execution time and accuracy, increasing the interest in quantum computing alternatives using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. However, current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers and future early fault-tolerant quantum devices face limitations in qubit availability and circuit depth, necessitating preprocessing to reduce problem complexity. This study introduces Qoolchain, a QUBO preprocessing toolchain designed to reduce problem size and enhance solver performance. Developed in Cython, Qoolchain is compatible with major quantum frameworks and optimized for the Grover Adaptive Search (GAS) algorithm. It includes steps like persistency identification, decomposition, and probing to estimate function bounds, all with polynomial complexity. Qoolchain also proposes using the Grover Search algorithm for problem segments whose optimal value is known a priori from graph theory and Shannon decomposition to reduce QUBO problem complexity further. Evaluated against the D-Wave preprocessing toolchain on various problems, Qoolchain demonstrates higher efficiency and accuracy. It represents a significant advancement in enabling practical quantum solvers, addressing hardware limitations, and solving complex industry-relevant problems.

AB In today's software engineering, iterations, affordable en masse, form an important part of just about any system. However, not all computing resources are cheap to consume. In High-Performance (HPC) and Quantum Computing (QC), executions can consume considerable amounts of energy and time, which is reserved and used even if the very first steps in the process fail. This means that developers must assume a different attitude towards programming, and aim at error-free software before its execution. This is commonly facilitated using simulators, which are commonplace for both HPC and QC. However the fashion developers advance from one tool to another is ad-hoc, with no established software engineering guidelines, and the final step from simulators to HPC/QC is still a leap of faith, comparable to releasing software.
   In this paper, we propose a vision where developers can iterate in an agile fashion when developing quantum software. The iterations are defined such that when the solution is still vague in the beginning, computations are interactive and provide instant feedback, thus supporting conceptualization of the software and experimenting with new ideas. When the solution becomes more precise, more expensive computations such as quantum algorithm and hyperparameter optimization are executed in batches.

AB Quantum algorithms are raising concerns in the field of cryptography all over the world. A growing number of symmetric cryptography algorithms have been attacked in the quantum setting. Type-3 generalized Feistel scheme (GFS) and unbalanced Feistel scheme with expanding functions (UFS-E) are common symmetric cryptography schemes, which are often used in cryptographic analysis and design. We propose quantum distinguishing attacks on Type-3 GFS and UFS-E in the quantum chosen plaintext attack setting. The results of key recovery are better than those based on exhaustive search in the quantum setting.

TI Quantum Entropy and Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Denial of
   Service Attack Detection in Smart Grid
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) threats in Smart Grid are very challenging and considered one of the most destructive cyber-attacks. They are harmfully affecting the power sector and causing substantial financial loss. Classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) models are proposed as a promising solution to the DDoS problem as they learn optimal mitigation policies under different attack scenarios. However, as the RL environment is generally dynamic, which leads to more computation capabilities, classical RL efficiency can be limited as a result of serial processing using classical computing. In this paper, a Quantum Entropy Q-Learning (QEQ) is proposed to fight DDoS in Smart Grid. The proposed framework is compared to a classical Q-Learning (QL) model with and without the Entropy method. The convergence speed and the total rewards performed with the same conditions for QL and are Entropy Q-Learning (EQ) are analyzed to show the QEQ performance. Moreover, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are evaluated to prove the effectiveness of our QEQ in fighting DDoS attacks. Using the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System (CICIDS 2019) dataset, a thorough systematic simulation using MATLAB, Python, the open-source Qiskit software, and the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm is carried out. This proposed QEQ is better performing the DDoS detection as it is faster enough and more adaptable to dynamic environment changing and able to improve the agent's decision-making in a changing state action space. Finally, conclusions with some open issues of the Quantum Q-Learning are presented.

TI How to Design a Classically Difficult Random Quantum Circuit for Quantum
   Computational Advantage Experiments
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Quantum computational advantage is a critical milestone for near-term quantum technologies and a crucial step toward building practical quantum computers. Recent successful demonstrations of quantum computational advantage owe much to specially designed random quantum circuit (RQC) protocols that enable hardware-friendly implementation and, more importantly, pose great challenges for classical simulation. Here, we report an automated protocol-design approach for determining the optimal RQC in the Zuchongzhi quantum computational advantage experiment. Without a carefully designed protocol, the classical simulation cost of the Zuchongzhi 56-qubit 20-cycle RQC experiment would not be considerably higher than Google's 53-qubit 20-cycle experiment, even though more qubits are involved. For Google's latest RQC experiment using 70 qubits and 24 cycles, we estimate that the classical simulation cost can be increased by at least one order of magnitude using the proposed approach. The proposed method can be applied to generic planar quantum processor architectures and addresses realistic imperfections such as processor defects, underpinning quantum computational advantage experiments in future generations of quantum processors.

TI Ab initio simulation of non-Abelian braiding statistics in
   topological superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We numerically investigate non-Abelian braiding dynamics of vortices in two-dimensional topological superconductors, such as s-wave superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Majorana zero modes (MZMs) hosted by the vortices constitute a topological qubit, which offers a fundamental building block of topological quantum computation. As the MZMs are protected by Z(2) invariant, however, the Majorana qubit and quantum gate operations may be sensitive to intrinsic decoherence caused by MZM hybridization. Numerically simulating the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation without assuming a priori existence of MZMs, we examine quantum noises on the unitary operators of non-Abelian braiding dynamics due to interactions with neighboring MZMs and other quasiparticle states. We demonstrate that after the interchange of two vortices, the lowest vortex-bound states accumulate the geometric phase pi/2, and errors stemming from dynamical phases are negligibly small, irrespective of interactions of MZMs. Furthermore, we numerically simulate the braiding dynamics of four vortices in two-dimensional topological superconductors, and discuss an optimal braiding condition for realizing the high performance of non-Abelian statistics and quantum gate operations of Majorana-based qubits.

AB The Quantum Internet (QI) necessitates a complete revision of the classical protocol stack and the technologies used, whereas its operating principles depend on the physical laws governing quantum mechanics. Recent experiments demonstrate that Optical Fibers (OFs) allow connections only in urban areas. Therefore, a novel Quantum Satellite Backbone (QSB) composed of a considerable number of Quantum Satellite Repeaters (QSRs) deployed in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) would allow for the overcoming of typical OFs' attenuation problems. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of the scenario represents a challenge for novel satellite networks, making their design and management complicated. Therefore, we have designed an ad hoc QSB considering the interaction between Digital Twin (DT) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). In addition to defining the system architecture, we present a DT monitoring protocol that allows efficient status recovery for the creation of multiple End-to-End (E2E) entanglement states. Moreover, we have evaluated the system performance by assessing the path monitoring and configuration time, the time required to establish the E2E entanglement, and the fidelity between a couple of Ground Stations (GSs) interconnected through the QSB, also conducting a deep analysis of the created temporal paths.

TI Tightly-Secure Two-Tier Signatures on Code-Based Digital Signatures with
   Chameleon Hash Functions
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In the current landscape where quantum algorithms pose a significant threat to conventional digital signature algorithms, code-based digital signature algorithms have emerged as the primary focus of ongoing research in post-quantum cryptography. Digital signatures play a pivotal role in ensuring non-repudiation and authentication, making them an indispensable cryptographic technique. The vulnerability of most digital signature algorithms to quantum attacks have prompted a significant surge in research on code-based digital signature algorithms, which have emerged as a prominent field within post-quantum cryptography. There are generally three distinct approaches to constructing code-based digital signature algorithms: (1) Developing an algorithm that follows the inverse process of the code-based public-key encryption algorithm; (2) Utilizing zero-knowledge identification algorithms in conjunction with the Fiat-Shamir paradigm to formulate a signature algorithm; (3) Constructing a specialized subset of the syndrome space as the foundation for the digital signature algorithm. Chameleon Signature is a non-interactive signature that operates on the hash and signature paradigm, exhibiting comparable efficiency to conventional schemes. Its distinct advantage lies in the fact that the owner of the public key does not necessarily require access to the corresponding secret key within the Chameleon hash algorithm. Notably, Chameleon signatures possess an inherent characteristic of non-transferability, with their validity ascertainable solely by designated recipients. This paper introduces the first Chameleon hash function based on both KKS and HFE schemes, showcasing its superiority over traditional schemes through rank metrics and big fields for enhanced security. The deployment of Chameleon hash functions within hash-and-sign signature schemes introduces a nuanced layer of security and verification flexibility. This study elucidates the implications of integrating Chameleon hash functions into the recipient's public key infrastructure, highlighting the dual capability it affords authorized parties for secure and adaptable verification processes, alongside mechanisms for the detection of unauthorized alterations.

Barad's work in agential realism, based on her interpretations of quantum physics, has been widely cited within a growing body of new materialist publications. However, in translating Barad's assertions into social domains, there has been increasing critical appraisal of the physics underlying her work and its relationship with non-quantum domains. In this paper, we contribute to this discussion by exploring aspects of agential realism through quantum decoherence and quantum Darwinism. We explore implications for Barad's metaphysics and the relationship of the social with the rest of the material world.

TI Characterization and stability measurement of deployed multicore fibers

SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Multicore fibers are expected to be a game-changer in the coming decades thanks to their intrinsic properties, allowing a larger transmission bandwidth and a lower footprint in optical communications. In addition, multicore fibers have recently been explored for quantum communication, attesting to their uniqueness in transporting high-dimensional quantum states. However, investigations and experiments reported in literature have been carried out in research laboratories, typically making use of short fiber links in controlled environments. Thus, the possibility of using long-distance multicore fibers for quantum applications is still to be proven. We characterize here for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in terms of phase stability, multiple strands of a four-core multicore fiber installed underground in the city of L'Aquila, with an overall fiber length up to about 25 km. In this preliminary study, we investigate the possibility of using such an infrastructure to implement quantumenhanced schemes, such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution, quantum-based environmental sensors, and more, in general, quantum communication protocols.

TI Nonlinearity-Induced Enhancement of Entanglement in Quantum Walk
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The quantum entanglement between the coin state and the position in nonlinear quantum walks is investigated. This study reveals that the nonlinearity of the quantum walk has a significant impact on the enhancement of quantum entanglement in an initially separable bipartite system. It is demonstrated that by selecting appropriate nonlinear parameters the initial separable states may turn to be entangled, and even approach to maximal entangled states.
   Entanglement entropy (EE) as a function of steps t and nonlinearity strength alpha$\alpha$ Nonlinearity induces augmentation entanglement. For alpha$\alpha$ not equal 0$\ne 0$, which indicates the presence of nonlinearity, the values of EE depicted in the figure are greater than no nonlinearity (alpha=0$\alpha = 0$). By judiciously selecting an appropriate nonlinear parameter and the initial state of quantum walk heightens the level of quantum entanglement, eventually reaching maximum entanglement. image

TI The Effect of Quantum Noise on Multipartite Entanglement from a Cascaded
   Parametric Amplifier
SO PHOTONICS
AB The tripartite entanglement generated from a cascaded parametric amplifier is always present in the whole gain region in the ideal condition. However, in practical applications, the quantum entanglement is very fragile and easily deteriorated by quantum noise from interactions with external environments, e.g., the avoidable attenuation and amplification operations may lead to some degradation effects on the quantum entanglement. Therefore, in this work, bipartite entanglement for the three pairs and tripartite entanglement in this cascaded parametric amplifier under the circumstances of attenuation and amplification operations are analyzed by using positivity under partial transposition criterion. The results show that tripartite entanglement is robust to the deterioration effects from the attenuation and amplification operations rather than bipartite entanglement. Our results may find some practical applications of multipartite quantum entanglement in quantum secure communications.

AB When multiple agents collaborate to perform distributed operations, they can be modeled as cooperative games. Considering a network of agents work together and they can only communicate in a limited way (e.g., only to neighbor peers), the goal is to maximize the cooperation success globally, or maximize the total value and social welfare of the whole network. The type of cooperation is challenging since the game is not zero-sum. There are not any outside agents to serve as referees. The objective functions may be non-stationary and non-convex. In this paper, each agent is modeled as a content supplier or consumer. Each agent optimizes its own objective locally. We show that each agent self-organizes or converges to its "value" via the principles of quantum computing and game theories. We prove two theorems that can optimize an agent's own objective and simultaneously optimize the global social welfare of its peer network. The quantum intelligence game algorithms are unsupervised and self-organizing, where the weights expressed in quantum neural networks or transformers can be computed from a natural mechanism known as a quantum adiabatic evolution.

TI Bi-chromatic intensity squeezing using four-wave mixing in 85Rb vapor
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We experimentally investigate four-wave mixing (FWM) in a diamond interaction scheme using 85Rb vapor, and identify the optimal conditions for joint amplification and relative intensity squeezing of two optical fields: one near the 85Rb D1 optical transition (lambda = 794.6 nm) and the other in the telecom O-band (lambda = 1324 nm). We achieved a reduction of relative intensity noise by up to 2.6 +/- 0.4 dB compared with the shot noise level, signifying the non-classical quantum correlations. The observed level of intensity squeezing is primarily limited by the available pump laser power, which constrains the achievable FWM gain. Numerical simulations show good agreement with the experimental results.

TI HyQ2: A Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for NextG Vulnerability Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As fifth-generation (5G) and next-generation communication systems advance and find widespread application in critical infrastructures, the importance of vulnerability detection becomes increasingly critical. The growing complexity of these systems necessitates rigorous testing and analysis, with stringent requirements for both accuracy and speed. In this article, we present a state-of-the-art supervised hybrid quantum neural network named HyQ2 for vulnerability detection in next-generation wireless communication systems. The proposed HyQ2 is integrated with graph-embedded and quantum variational circuits to validate and detect vulnerabilities from the 5G system's state transitions based on graphs extracted from log files. We address the limitations of classical machine learning models in processing the intrinsic linkage relationships of high-dimensional data. These models often suffer from dead neurons and excessively large outputs caused by the unbounded range of the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. We propose the HyQ2 method to overcome these challenges, which constructs quantum neurons by selecting random neurons' outputs from a classical neural network. These quantum neurons are then utilized to capture more complex relationships, effectively limiting the ReLU output. Using only two qubits, our validation results demonstrate that HyQ2 outperforms traditional classical machine learning models in vulnerability detection. The small and compact variational circuit of HyQ2 minimizes the noise and errors in the measurement. Our results demonstrate that HyQ2 achieves a high area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9708 and an accuracy of 95.91%. To test the model's performance in quantum noise environments, we simulate quantum noise by adding bit flipping, phase flipping, amplitude damping, and depolarizing noise. The results show that the prediction accuracy and receiver operating characteristic AUC value fluctuate around 0.2%, indicating HyQ2's robustness in noisy quantum environments. In addition, the noise resilience and robustness of the HyQ2 algorithm were substantiated through experiments on the IBM quantum machine with only a 0.2% decrease compared to the simulation results.

TI Solid-State Quantum Coherence From a High-Spin Donor-Acceptor Conjugated
   Polymer
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Molecular spin systems that can be chemically tuned, coherently controlled, and readily integrated within devices remain central to the realization of emerging quantum technologies. Organic high-spin materials are prime candidates owing to their similarity in electronic structure to leading solid-state defect-based systems, light element composition, and the potential for entanglement and qubit operations mediated through spin-spin exchange. However, the inherent instability of these species precludes their rational design, development, and application. Here, the first example of an organic high-spin qubit based on a conjugated polymer semiconductor comprised of alternating dithienosilole and thiadiazoloquinoxaline heterocycles is demonstrated. It is shown that electron spins within the macromolecule demonstrate high-fidelity coherent control of the superposition state with room temperature coherence and solid-state relaxation times that are competitive with or exceed other synthetic molecular qubits. These attributes, along with robust stability, chemical tunability, rich interrelated optoelectronic functionalities, and solution processability, offer a fundamentally new approach to integrating quantum phenomena within functional device platforms.

TI Experimental Detection of Initial System-Environment Entanglement in
   Open Systems
SO PHOTONICS
AB We experimentally investigate how initial entanglement between the system and environment can be detected in an open system by using some prior knowledge of the joint evolutions. The protocol we employed requires classical optimization on the results after performing measurements on the system state. Such an approach does not require a full 2-qubit QST, and works in scenarios where one has access to the system only. We demonstrate the protocol on both pure entangled states and mixed entangled states. The obtained results show the experimental accessibility and validity of the protocol. Compared with the previous methods, which also assume access only to the system, this protocol is less demanding in terms of measurement and state preparation. The experimental results also show that, using the knowledge of the interaction, we can fine-tune the protocol, thus showing the potential of the protocol for developing experimentally feasible and practical entanglement detection methods.

TI Unraveling quantum environments: Transformer-assisted learning in
   Lindblad dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Understanding dissipation in open quantum systems is crucial for the development of robust quantum technologies. In this work, we introduce a transformer-based machine learning framework to infer time-dependent dissipation rates in systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. Our method requires only time series of observable quantities, such as (sigma x(t)), (sigma y(t)), and (sigma z(t)), and does not require prior knowledge of the initial quantum state or the system Hamiltonian during inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a hierarchy of open quantum models, including single-qubit systems with time-independent and time-dependent jump rates, two-qubit interacting systems (e.g., Heisenberg and transverse Ising models), and the Jaynes-Cummings model with cavity loss and time-dependent decay. Our method accurately reconstructs both fixed and time-varying dissipation profiles from observable trajectories. We further show that under reasonable assumptions, the jump rates in these models are uniquely determined by a small set of measurable observables. The results suggest that transformer-based learning provides a scalable and data-driven route for identifying environmental effects in open quantum systems.

TI High-fidelity and polarization-insensitive universal photonic processors
   fabricated by femtosecond laser writing
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Universal photonic processors (UPPs) are fully programmable photonic integrated circuits that are key components in quantum photonics. With this work, we present a novel platform for the realization of low-loss, low-power, and high-fidelity UPPs based on femtosecond laser writing (FLW) and compatible with a large wavelength spectrum. In fact, we demonstrate different UPPs, tailored for operation at 785 nm and 1550 nm, providing similar high-level performances. Moreover, we show that standard calibration techniques applied to FLW-UPPs result in Haar random polarization-insensitive photonic transformations implemented with average amplitude fidelity as high as 0.9979 at 785 nm (0.9970 at 1550 nm), with the possibility of increasing the fidelity over 0.9990 thanks to novel optimization algorithms. Besides being the first demonstrations of polarization-insensitive UPPs, these devices show the highest level of control and reconfigurability ever reported for a FLW circuit. These qualities will be greatly beneficial to applications in quantum information processing.

TI On-chip polarization-encoded single-qubit gates with twisted waveguides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Integrated photonics is a remarkable platform for scalable classical and quantum light-based information processing. However, polarization manipulation on a chip despite of its fundamental significance in infor-mation processing remains elusive. Polarization manipulation capabilities have been recently demonstrated in femtosecond laser-inscribed twisted waveguides, although the systematic theoretical description of polarization manipulation has not been established for this architecture. In this paper we develop a rigorous theory of a twisted waveguide unveiling its eigenmodes and transmission matrix in the closed form. Utilizing the developed theory, we demonstrate that twisted waveguides can realize virtually arbitrary polarization transformations while satisfying reasonable design constraints. This fact combined with low cost and ease of prototyping of laser inscribed photonic integrated circuits allows us to suggest twisted waveguide as a robust building block for on-chip polarization-encoded information processing.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The Laplacian learning method has proven effective in classical graph-based semi-supervised learning, yet its quantum counterpart remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates the Laplacian-based quantum semi-supervised learning (QSSL) approach across four benchmark datasets-Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease. By experimenting with varying qubit counts and entangling layers, we demonstrate that increased quantum resources do not necessarily lead to improved performance. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of the method is highly sensitive to dataset characteristics, as well as the number of entangling layers. Optimal configurations, generally featuring moderate entanglement, strike a balance between model complexity and generalization. These results emphasize the importance of dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning in quantum semi-supervised learning frameworks.

Generally quantum correlations may substantially modify the universality of classical thermodynamic relations in composite systems. Our fluctuation theorem finds a non-equilibrium parameter of genuinely quantum nature that sheds light on the emerging quantum information thermodynamics. Specifically we show that the statistics of quantum correlation fluctuation obtained in a time-reversed process can provide a useful insight into addressing work and heat in the resulting thermodynamic evolution. We illustrate these quantum thermodynamic relations by two examples of quantum correlated systems.

In this work, we address the problem of calculating analytical expressions of the time complexity of finding a marked vertex using quantum-walk-based search algorithms with multiple marked vertices on arbitrary graphs, extending previous analytical methods based on Szegedy's quantum walk, which can be applied only to bipartite graphs. Two examples based on the coined quantum walk on two-dimensional lattices and hypercubes show the details of our method.

Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as a promising high sensitivity platform for measuring magnetic fields at room temperature. Transferring this technology from laboratory setups into products and applications, the total size of the sensor, the overall power consumption, and the costs need to be reduced and optimized.

TI Towards understanding the power of quantum kernels in the NISQ era
SO QUANTUM
AB A key problem in the field of quantum computing is understanding whether quantum machine learning (QML) models implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines can achieve quantum advantages. Recently, Huang et al. [Nat Commun 12, 2631] partially answered this question by the lens of quantum kernel learning. Namely, they exhibited that quantum kernels can learn specific datasets with lower generalization error over the optimal classical kernel methods. However, most of their results are established on the ideal setting and ignore the caveats of near-term quantum machines. To this end, a crucial open question is: does the power of quantum kernels still hold under the NISQ setting? In this study, we fill this knowledge gap by exploiting the power of quantum kernels when the quantum system noise and sample error are considered. Concretely, we first prove that the advantage of quantum kernels vanishes for large size of datasets, few number of measurements, and large system noise. With the aim of preserving the superiority of quantum kernels in the NISQ era, we further devise an effective method via indefinite kernel learning. Numerical simulations accord with our theoretical results. Our work provides theoretical guidance of exploring advanced quantum kernels to attain quantum advantages on NISQ devices.

TI Linear-frequency conversion with time-varying metasurfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Frequency conversion is a hallmark of nonlinearity. The spectral manifestations, emergent within a system, can typically be attributed to a marked nonlinearity within the material properties, complex geometric configurations, and/or the unique functional form of interactions taking place in the constitutive subsystems. These phenomena, irrespective of their origins, have been harnessed and exploited in applications ranging from the generation of entangled photons, a cornerstone in quantum technologies, to nanomechanical frequency mixing, advancing subsurface scanning probe microscopy. Here, we propose a frequency conversion mechanism based on time-varying metasurfaces, an emerging frontier in metamaterial research. We show how temporal properties of metasurfaces can effectively emulate a nonlinear medium, thereby facilitating frequency conversion. The proposed material configuration has the potential not only to advance integrated photonics and quantum optics, but also to create opportunities in quantum sensing, quantum materials, and crucially quantum communications.

TI Quantum Reservoir Computing Using Arrays of Rydberg Atoms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing promises to speed up machine-learning algorithms. However, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices pose engineering challenges to realizing quantum machine-learning (QML) advantages. Recently, a series of QML computational models inspired by the noise-tolerant dynamics of the brain has emerged as a means to circumvent the hardware limitations of NISQ devices. In this paper, we introduce a quantum version of a recurrent neural network (RNN), a well-known model for neural circuits in the brain. Our quantum RNN (qRNN) makes use of the natural Hamiltonian dynamics of an ensemble of interacting spin-1/2 particles as a means for computation. In the limit where the Hamiltonian is diagonal, the qRNN recovers the dynamics of the classical version. Beyond this limit, we observe that the quantum dynamics of the qRNN provide it with quantum computational features that can aid it in computation. To this end, we study a fixed-geometry qRNN, i.e., a quantum reservoir computer, based on arrays of Rydberg atoms and show that the Rydberg reservoir is indeed capable of replicating the learning of several cognitive tasks such as multitasking, decision making, and long-term memory by taking advantage of several key features of this platform such as interatomic species interactions and quantum many-body scars.

TI Direct characteristic-function tomography of the quantum states of
   quantum fields
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Herein, we propose a novel strategy for implementing a direct readout of the symmetric characteristic function of the quantum states of quantum fields without the involvement of idealized measurements, an aspect that has always been deemed ill-defined in quantum field theory. This proposed scheme relies on the quantum control and measurements of an auxiliary qubit locally coupled to the quantum fields. By mapping the expectation values of both the real and imaginary parts of the field displacement operator to the qubit states, the qubit's readout provides complete information regarding the symmetric characteristic function. We characterize our technique by applying it to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (thermal) and squeezed states of a quantum scalar field. In addition, we have discussed general applications of this approach to analogue-gravity systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, within the scope of state-of-the-art experimental capabilities. This proposed strategy may serve as an essential in understanding and optimizing the control of quantum fields for relativistic quantum information applications, particularly in exploring the interplay between gravity and quantum, for example, the relation to locality, causality, and information.

TI Circuit centric quantum architecture design
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB With the development in the field of quantum physics, several methods for building a quantum computer have emerged. These differ in qubit technologies, interaction topologies, and noise characteristics. In this article, insights are given into the circuit-centric architecture design of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The dependence of the circuit size, circuit depth on the interaction and connection between different qubits present in quantum hardware are discussed. A noise-aware procedure is presented which helps in determining the optimal interactions between different qubits of a quantum chip to execute a given circuit in the most efficient way possible. In this article, the 5-qubit hardware in a noiseless setting is illustrated with an example. Also, a benchmark-driven analysis is performed to show the importance of noise adaptivity in determining the hardware reliability. It is concluded that a generalized and flexible procedure such as this approach can aid in determining the design of hardware accurately for which the circuit runs efficiently, that is, with the least number of clock cycles, the lowest gate operations, and noise-based errors.

TI Quantum vs. Classical Algorithms for Solving the Heat Equation
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers are predicted to outperform classical ones for solving partial differential equations, perhaps exponentially. Here we consider a prototypical PDE-the heat equation in a rectangular region-and compare in detail the complexities of ten classical and quantum algorithms for solving it, in the sense of approximately computing the amount of heat in a given region. We find that, for spatial dimension d >= 2, there is an at most quadratic quantum speedup in terms of the allowable error epsilon using an approach based on applying amplitude estimation to an accelerated classical random walk. However, an alternative approach based on a quantum algorithm for linear equations is never faster than the best classical algorithms.

TI Machine learning algorithm for modeling oxytetracycline adsorption
   kinetics on microplastics in marine environments
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ADVANCES
AB Marine plastic waste undergoes physicochemical degradation into microplastics, which accumulate and release toxic pollutants via adsorption-desorption kinetics, enabling tissue invasion and physiological disruption in marine organisms. This study established a mathematical model to characterize the adsorption kinetics of typical pollutants on microplastics in marine environments using convection diffusion reaction (CDR) equation. The adsorption of microplastics in marine environments exhibits complex nonlinear dynamics, characterized by coupled transport reaction processes. Traditional numerical methods result in high computational costs during the processing. By combining quantum state encoding with machine learning, a microplastic adsorption kinetics algorithm based on quantum machine learning (QML) is proposed, which achieves acceleration in handling the nonlinear dynamics of multi-component adsorption systems. Quantum computing, through its properties of quantum superposition and entanglement, can process high-dimensional data in parallel. It has great potential in tasks such as feature extraction, classification, and regression, which can improve computational efficiency and model performance. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance in the adsorption kinetics and isotherm fitting of typical adsorbents by microplastics in marine environments, providing theoretical and data support for studying the influence of surface property changes of microplastics on the behavior of coexisting pollutants in marine environments.
