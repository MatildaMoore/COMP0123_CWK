TI Quantum error correction of spin quantum memories in diamond under a
   zero magnetic field
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The efficacy of quantum error correction of spins in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy that uses magnetic fields depends on spin's location in the lattice. Here, an alternative, zero-field approach relying on geometric phase is demonstrated in a three-qubit system.
   Fault-tolerant quantum memory plays a key role in interfacing quantum computers with quantum networks to construct quantum computer networks. Manipulation of spin quantum memory generally requires a magnetic field, which hinders the integration with superconducting qubits. Completely zero-field operation is desirable for scaling up a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Here we demonstrate quantum error correction to protect the nuclear spin of the nitrogen as a quantum memory in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center with two nuclear spins of the surrounding carbon isotopes under a zero magnetic field. The quantum error correction makes quantum memory resilient against operational or environmental errors without the need for magnetic fields and opens a way toward distributed quantum computation and a quantum internet with memory-based quantum interfaces or quantum repeaters.

TI Quantum repeaters: From quantum networks to the quantum internet
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB A quantum internet is the holy grail of quantum information processing, enabling the deployment of a broad range of quantum technologies and protocols on a global scale. However, numerous challenges must be addressed before the quantum internet can become a reality. Perhaps the most crucial of these is the realization of a quantum repeater, an essential component in the long-distance transmission of quantum information. As the analog of a classical repeater, extender, or booster, the quantum repeater works to overcome loss and noise in the quantum channels constituting a quantum network. Here the conceptual frameworks and architectures for quantum repeaters, as well as the experimental progress toward their realization, are reviewed. Various near-term proposals to overcome the limits to the communication rates set by point-to-point quantum communication are also discussed. Finally, the manner in which quantum repeaters fit within the broader challenge of designing and implementing a quantum internet is overviewed.

TI Remote quantum networks based on quantum memories
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Quantum networks, capable of transmitting arbitrary quantum states, provide a foundation for a wide range of quantum applications, including distributed quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and quantum communication. Photons are the natural carrier of information in quantum networks, but the exponential loss of optical fiber channels prevents the construction of large-scale quantum networks. A potential solution is implementing quantum repeaters based on quantum memories, which can efficiently establish long-distance entanglement from short-distance entanglement. In the past decades, intense efforts have been devoted to constructing large-scale quantum networks based on various atomic quantum memories. In this Perspective, we present a concise overview of current advancements in remote quantum networks, elucidate the imminent challenges that must be addressed, and discuss the future directions.

TI Multicell Atomic Quantum Memory as a Hardware-Efficient Quantum Repeater
   Node
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB For scalable quantum communication and networks, a key step is to realize a quantum repeater node that can efficiently connect different segments of atom-photon entanglement using quantum memories. We report a compact and hardware-efficient realization of a quantum repeater node using a single atomic ensemble for multicell quantum memories. A millisecond lifetime is achieved for individual memory cells after suppressing the magnetic-field-induced inhomogeneous broadening and the atomic-motion-induced spin-wave dephasing. Based on these long-lived memory cells, we achieve heralded asynchronous entanglement generation in two quantum repeater segments one after another and then an on-demand entanglement connection of these two repeater segments. As another application of the multicell atomic quantum memory, we further demonstrate storage and on-demand retrieval of heralded atomic spin-wave qubits by implementing a random access quantum memory with individual addressing capacity. This work provides a promising constituent for efficient realization of quantum repeaters for large-scale quantum networks.

TI Enhanced quantum teleportation using multi-qubit logical states
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this paper, an innovative approach is suggested for quantum teleportation of multi-qubit physical state into an error correctable multi-qubit logical state. For this purpose, an efficient quantum error correction scheme is applied to detect and correct one bit flip and/or phase flip error in the teleported logical state. In addition, the proposed mechanism is substantiated by teleporting an eight-qubit physical state via four-qubit cluster state which involves three-qubit logical states as a quantum channel. The proposed scheme may be physically realized in the future fault tolerant quantum technologies.

TI From quantum communication fundamentals to decoherence mitigation
   strategies: Addressing global quantum network challenges and projected
   applications
SO HELIYON
AB In the aftermath of unparalleled disruptive technologies, the quantum realm has become a fundamental field of research due to unrivaled computational power and super-secure communication. In addition to conventional networks, a new word in the quantum domain is quantum network. The quantum network uses quantum communication (QC) to send quantum information bits known as qubits, to predetermined destination nodes. It governs the new quantum mechanics notions like superposition, quantum entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and quantum teleportation. Quantum communication, like classical communication, is prone to noise, which is known as quantum decoherence. Quantum decoherence is a significant barrier to the implementation of a global quantum network. It deteriorates the quantum information, causing it to lie in an undetermined state. Environmental factors that cause quantum entanglement loss are the key factors that cause qubits to lose their states. To mitigate the impact of quantum decoherence, quantum error correction codes (QECC) and entanglement distillation have proved their potential. They add extra qubits or maintain entanglements among quantum networks. This survey presents quantum mechanics principles, quantum decoherence, and techniques to mitigate the effect of quantum decoherence. At the end, we highlighted some challenges in the realization of the quantum network, along with some projected applications.

TI Quantum cryptography integrating an optical quantum memory
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Developments in scalable quantum networks rely critically on optical quantum memories, which are key components enabling the storage of quantum information. These memories play a pivotal role for entanglement distribution and long-distance quantum communication, with remarkable advances achieved in this context. However, optical memories have broader applications, and their storage and buffering capabilities can benefit a wide range of future quantum technologies. Here, we present the demonstration of a cryptography protocol incorporating an intermediate quantum memory layer. Specifically, we implement Wiesner's unforgeable quantum money primitive with a storage step, rather than as an on-the-fly procedure. This protocol imposes stringent requirements on storage efficiency and noise level to reach a secure regime. We demonstrate the implementation with polarization encoding of weak coherent states of light and a high-efficiency cold atom-based quantum memory and validate the full scheme. Our results showcase a major capability, opening broader avenues for quantum memory utilization and network functionalities.

TI Impacts of noise and structure on quantum information encoded in a
   quantum memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB As larger, higher-quality quantum devices are built and demonstrated in quantum information applications, such as quantum computation and quantum communication, the need for high-quality quantum memories to store quantum states becomes ever more pressing. Future quantum devices likely will use a variety of physical hardware, some being used primarily for processing of quantum information and others for storage. Here we study the correlation of the structure of quantum information with physical noise models of various possible quantum memory implementations. Through numerical simulation of different noise models and approximate analytical formulas applied to a variety of interesting quantum states, we provide comparisons between quantum hardware with different structure, including both qubit- and qudit-based quantum memories. Our findings point to simple, experimentally relevant formulas for the relative lifetimes of quantum information in different quantum memories and have relevance to the design of hybrid quantum devices.

AB Quantum computing is implicated as a next-generation solution to supplement traditional von Neumann architectures in an era of post-Moore's law computing. As classical computational infrastructure becomes more limited, quantum platforms offer expandability in terms of scale, energy consumption, and native 3-D problem modeling. Quantum information science is a multidisciplinary field drawing from physics, mathematics, computer science, and photonics. Quantum systems are expressed with the properties of superposition and entanglement, evolved indirectly with operators (ladder operators, master equations, neural operators, and quantum walks), and transmitted (via quantum teleportation) with entanglement generation, operator size manipulation, and error correction protocols. This article discusses emerging applications in quantum cryptography, quantum machine learning, quantum finance, quantum neuroscience, quantum networks, and quantum error correction.

TI Entanglement distribution with wavevector-multiplexed quantum memory
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Feasible distribution of quantum entanglement over long distances remains a fundamental step towards quantum secure communication and quantum network implementations. Quantum repeater nodes based on quantum memories promise to overcome exponential signal decay inherent to optical implementations of quantum communication. While performance of current quantum memories hinders their practical application, multimode solutions with multiplexing can offer tremendous increase in entanglement distribution rates. We propose to use a wavevector-multiplexed atomic quantum memory (WV-MUX-QM) as a fundamental block of a multiplexed quantum repeater architecture. We show the WV-MUX-QM platform to provide quasi-deterministic entanglement generation over extended distances, mitigating the fundamental issue of optical loss even with currently available quantum memory devices, and exceeding performance of repeaterless solutions as well as other repeater-based protocols such as temporal multiplexing. We establish the entangled-bit (ebit) rate per number of employed nodes as a practical figure of merit reflecting the cost-efficiency of larger inter-node distances.

TI Realization of a Programmable Multipurpose Photonic Quantum Memory with

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum networks can enable various applications such as distributed quantum computing, long-distance quantum communication, and network-based quantum sensing with unprecedented performances. One of the most important building blocks for a quantum network is a photonic quantum memory which serves as the interface between the communication channel and the local functional unit. A programmable quantum memory which can process a large stream of flying qubits and fulfill the requirements of multiple core functions in a quantum network is still to be realized. Here we report a high-performance quantum memory which can simultaneously store 72 optical qubits carried by 144 spatially separated atomic ensembles and support up to a thousand consecutive write or read operations in a random access way, 2 orders of magnitude larger than the previous record. Because of the built-in programmability, this quantum memory can be adapted on demand for several functions. As example applications, we realize quantum queue, stack, and buffer which closely resemble the counterpart devices for classical information processing. We further demonstrate the storage and reshuffle of four entangled pairs of photonic pulses with probabilistic arrival time and arbitrary release order via the memory, which is an essential requirement for the realization of quantum repeaters and efficient routing in quantum networks. Realization of this multipurpose programmable quantum memory thus constitutes a key enabling building block for future large-scale fully functional quantum networks.

TI Quantum teleportation of physical qubits into logical code spaces
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum error correction is an essential tool for reliably performing tasks for processing quantum information on a large scale. However, integration into quantum circuits to achieve these tasks is problematic when one realizes that nontransverse operations, which are essential for universal quantum computation, lead to the spread of errors. Quantum gate teleportation has been proposed as an elegant solution for this. Here, one replaces these fragile, nontransverse inline gates with the generation of specific, highly entangled offline resource states that can be teleported into the circuit to implement the nontransverse gate. As the first important step, we create a maximally entangled state between a physical and an error-correctable logical qubit and use it as a teleportation resource. We then demonstrate the teleportation of quantum information encoded on the physical qubit into the error-corrected logical qubit with fidelities up to 0.786. Our scheme can be designed to be fully fault tolerant so that it can be used in future large-scale quantum technologies.

TI Optomechanical quantum teleportation
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Quantum teleportation, the faithful transfer of an unknown input state onto a remote quantum system(1), is a key component in long-distance quantum communication protocols(2) and distributed quantum computing(3,4). At the same time, high-frequency nano-optomechanical systems(5) hold great promise as nodes in a future quantum network(6), operating on-chip at low-loss optical telecom wavelengths with long mechanical lifetimes. Recent demonstrations include entanglement between two resonators(7), a quantum memory(8) and microwave-to-optics transduction(9-11). Despite these successes, quantum teleportation of an optical input state onto a long-lived optomechanical memory is an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate quantum teleportation of a polarization-encoded optical input state onto the joint state of a pair of nanomechanical resonators. Our protocol also allows to store and retrieve an arbitrary qubit state onto a dual-rail encoded optomechanical quantum memory. This work demonstrates the full functionality of a single quantum repeater node and presents a key milestone towards applications of optomechanical systems as quantum network nodes.

In this paper, we introduce a remote quantum error correction code preparation protocol for BQC using a cluster state and analyze its blindness in the measurement-based quantum computation model. Our protocol requires fewer quantum resources than previous methods, as it only needs weak coherent pulses, eliminating the need for quantum memory and limited quantum computing. The results of our theoretical analysis and simulations show that our protocol requires fewer quantum resources compared to non-coding methods with the same qubit error rate.

TI Bosonic quantum error correction codes in superconducting quantum
   circuits
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Quantum information is vulnerable to environmental noise and experimental imperfections, hindering the reli-ability of practical quantum information processors. Therefore, quantum error correction (QEC) that can pro-tect quantum information against noise is vital for universal and scalable quantum computation. Among many different experimental platforms, superconducting quantum circuits and bosonic encodings in superconducting microwave modes are appealing for their unprecedented potential in QEC. During the last few years, bosonic QEC is demonstrated to reach the break-even point, i.e. the lifetime of a logical qubit is enhanced to exceed that of any individual components composing the experimental system. Beyond that, universal gate sets and fault -tolerant operations on the bosonic codes are also realized, pushing quantum information processing towards the QEC era. In this article, we review the recent progress of the bosonic codes, including the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes, cat codes, and binomial codes, and discuss the opportunities of bosonic codes in various quantum applications, ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computation to quantum metrology. We also summarize the challenges associated with the bosonic codes and provide an outlook for the potential research directions in the long terms.

TI Superactivating Bound Entanglement in Quantum Networks via Quantum Zeno
   Dynamics and a Novel Algorithm for Optimized Zeno Evolution
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB An arbitrary amount of entanglement shared among nodes of a quantum network might be nondistillable if the nodes lack the information on the entangled Bell pairs they share. Making such a system distillable, which is called the superactivation of bound entanglement (BE), was shown to be possible through systematic quantum teleportation between the nodes, requiring the implementation of controlled-gates scaling with the number of nodes. In this work, we show in two scenarios that the superactivation of BE is possible if nodes implement the proposed local quantum Zeno strategies based on only single qubit rotations and simple threshold measurements. In the first scenario we consider, we obtain a two-qubit distillable entanglement system as in the original superactivation proposal. In the second scenario, we show that superactivation can be achieved among the entire network of eight qubits in five nodes. In addition to obtaining all-particle distillable entanglement, the overall entanglement of the system in terms of the sum of bipartite cuts is increased. We also design a general algorithm with variable greediness for optimizing the QZD evolution tasks. Implementing our algorithm for the second scenario, we show that a significant improvement can be obtained by driving the initial BE system into a maximally entangled state. We believe our work contributes to quantum technologies from both practical and fundamental perspectives bridging nonlocality, bound entanglement and the quantum Zeno dynamics among a quantum network.

AB Quantum networks are expected to enhance distributed quantum computing and quantum communication over long distances while providing security dependent upon physical effects rather than mathematical assumptions. Through simulation, we show that a quantum network utilizing only entanglement purification or only quantum error correction as error management strategies cannot create Bell pairs with fidelity that exceeds the requirement for a secured quantum key distribution protocol for a broad range of hardware parameters. We propose hybrid strategies utilizing quantum error correction on top of purification and show that they can produce Bell pairs of sufficiently high fidelity. We identify the error parameter regime for gate and measurement errors in which these hybrid strategies are applicable.

TI Coupling of a quantum memory and telecommunication wavelength photons
   for high-rate entanglement distribution in quantum repeaters
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum repeaters are indispensable tools for long-distance quantum communication. However, frequency matching between entangled photon sources and remote quantum memories (QMs) is difficult, which is an obstacle to the implementation of quantum repeaters. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to achieve the coupling of a Pr:YSO as a fixed-time QM with a single telecommunication-wavelength photon through frequency stabilization using an optical frequency comb over all applied laser wavelengths. The demonstrated method can lead to the implementation of a quantum repeater scheme enabling an improvement of the entanglement generation rate, paving the way for long-distance quantum communication.

TI Performance and application analysis of quantum memory
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Light is the best carrier of information in quantum network. By exploring the interaction of light with matter, quantum memory technology can be further developed. Quantum memory can simultaneously receive and obtain optical quantum information on demand, which is the basis for establishing large-scale quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. However, the performance of quantum memory directly affects its practical application process and the progress of quantum information technology. In the past two decades, quantum memory in various physical systems and quantum information protocols has been intensively studied, its performance has been significantly improved, and its relevant applications have been widely demonstrated. In this paper, we firstly sort the research progress of quantum memory metrics in the past ten years, and discuss the development of efficiency, lifetime, fidelity and mode capacity in detail according to the characteristics of cold atom systems and solid-state doped ion crystal systems. Secondly, the recent typical applications of quantum memory in quantum entanglement, memory-enhanced multi-photon processes, and quantum interference of different particles are introduced. Finally, the future development of quantum storage is prospected and summarized.

TI Design of a quantum repeater using quantum circuits and benchmarking its
   performance on an IBM quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum communication relies on the existence of entanglement between two nodes of a network. However, due to its fragile nature, it is nearly impossible to establish entanglement at large distances through the direct transmission of qubits. Quantum repeaters have been proposed to solve this problem, which split up the network to create small-scale entangled links and then connect them up to create the large-scale link. As researchers race to establish entanglement over larger and larger distances, it becomes essential to gauge the performance and robustness of different protocols that have been proposed to design a quantum repeater, before deploying them in real life. Currently available noisy quantum computers are ideal for this task, as they can emulate the noisy environment in a quantum communication channel, and provide a measure for how the protocols will perform on real-life hardware. In this paper, we report the circuit-level implementation of the complete architecture of a quantum repeater and benchmark this protocol on IBM's cloud quantum computer-IBMQ. Our experiments indicate a 26% fidelity of shared bell pairs for a complete on-chip quantum repeater with a yield of 49%. We also compare these results with simulation data from IBM Qiskit. The results of our experiments provide a quantitative measure for the fidelity of entanglement that currently available repeaters can establish. In addition, the proposed circuit implementation provides a robust benchmark for state-of-the-art quantum computing hardware.

In this work, the tomography of quantum memory has been implemented as a quantum process in a logical basis. It has been shown that the implemented quantum memory scheme for polarization photon qubits with a high accuracy corresponds to the identity transformation and is promising for application in quantum communication and quantum computing.

TI A quantum entanglement-based algorithm for discriminating non-orthogonal
   qubits
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Distinguishing unknown non-orthogonal qubits is an essential requirement for addressing various challenges quantum computation, including quantum machine learning, quantum communications, and quantum technologies. For instance, while quantum teleportation enables the transfer of unknown individual qubits between distant parties, an algorithm is necessary to define the associated state of a teleported qubit at receiving end. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm designed to effectively determine state of a given unknown qubit and distinguish a subset of non-orthogonal qubits. The proposed algorithm can () ( ) efficiently identify the state of an unknown qubit in the form cos | 0 > +sin |1 > using the Mz operator. 2 2 estimating the angle through the measurement of entanglement degree, the proposed algorithm can identify state of an unknown qubit. Experimental validation of the proposed algorithm is conducted using IBM quantum computer simulator chip ibmqx2. Furthermore, a t-test is conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with the direct measurement approach. The results indicate a significant difference between the two methods, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB It is crucial to design quantum circuits as small as possible and as shallow as possible for quantum information processing tasks. Quantum circuits are designed with simplified gate-count, cost, and depth for implementing quantum teleportation among various entangled channels. Here, the gate-count/cost/depth of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 10/6/8 to 9/4/6, the two-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 9/4/5 to 6/3/5, the three-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 12/6/7 to 8/4/5, the Brown-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 25/15/17 to 18/8/7, the Borras-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 36/25/20 to 15/8/11, and the entanglement-swapping-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 13/8/8 to 10/5/5. Note that, no feed-forward recover operation is required in the simplified schemes. Moreover, the experimentally demonstrations on IBM quantum computer indicate that the simplified and compressed schemes can be realized with good fidelity.
   Simplified quantum circuits for teleporting arbitrary single-qubit message via GHZ state, two-qubit cluster state, three-qubit cluster state, Brown state, Borras state, and entanglement swapping are presented. The gate-count/cost/depth is dramatically decreased, and no classical feed-forward recover operation is required. image

TI Testing a quantum error-correcting code on various platforms
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Quantum error correction plays an important role in fault-tolerant quantum information processing. It is usually difficult to experimentally realize quantum error correction, as it requires multiple qubits and quantum gates with high fidelity. Here we propose a simple quantum error-correcting code for the detected amplitude damping channel. The code requires only two qubits. We implement the encoding, the channel, and the recovery on an optical platform, the IBM Q System, and a nuclear magnetic resonance system. For all of these systems, the error correction advantage appears when the damping rate exceeds some threshold. We compare the features of these quantum information processing systems used and demonstrate the advantage of quantum error correction on current quantum computing platforms.

TI Field-Deployable Quantum Memory for Quantum Networking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-performance quantum memories are an essential component for regulating temporal events in quantum networks. As a component in quantum repeaters, they have the potential to support the distribu-tion of entanglement beyond the physical limitations of fiber loss. This will enable key applications such as quantum key distribution, network-enhanced quantum sensing, and distributed quantum computing. Here, we present a quantum memory engineered to meet real-world deployment and scaling challenges. The memory technology utilizes a warm rubidium vapor as the storage medium, and operates at room temperature, without the need for vacuum and/or cryogenic support. We demonstrate performance spec-ifications of high-fidelity retrieval (95%) and low operation error (10-2) at a storage time of 160 mu s for single-photon level quantum memory operations. We further show a substantially improved storage time (with classical-level light) of up to 1 ms by suppressing atomic diffusions. The device is housed in an enclosure with a standard 2U rackmount form factor, and can robustly operate on a day scale in a noisy environment. This result marks a step toward implementing quantum networks in the field.

TI Direct Quantum Communications in the Presence of Realistic Noisy
   Entanglement
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB To realize the Quantum Internet, quantum communications require pre-shared entanglement among quantum nodes. However, both the generation and the distribution of the maximally-entangled quantum states are inherently contaminated by quantum decoherence. Conventionally, the quantum decoherence is mitigated by performing the consecutive steps of quantum entanglement distillation followed by quantum teleportation. However, this conventional approach imposes a long delay. To circumvent this impediment, we propose a novel quantum communication scheme relying on realistic noisy pre-shared entanglement, which eliminates the sequential steps imposing delay in the standard approach. More precisely, our proposed scheme can be viewed as a direct quantum communication scheme capable of improving the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of the logical qubits despite relying on realistic noisy pre-shared entanglement. Our performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme offers competitive QBER, yield, and goodput compared to the existing state-of-the-art quantum communication schemes, despite requiring fewer quantum gates.

TI Quantum teleportation in higher dimension and entanglement distribution
   via quantum switches
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB High-dimensional quantum states, or 'qudits', provide significant advantages over traditional qubits in quantum communication, such as increased information capacity, enhanced noise resilience, and reduced information loss. Despite these benefits, their implementation has been constrained by challenges in generation, transmission, and detection. This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for transmitting quantum information using qudit entanglement distribution over a superposition of causal orders in two quantum channels. Using this model, a quantum switch operation for 2-qudit systems is introduced, which facilitates enhanced fidelity of entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation. The results demonstrate that the use of qudits in entanglement distribution achieves a fidelity improvement from 0.5 (for qubit-based systems) to 0.94 for 20-dimensional qudits, even under noisy channel conditions. This enhancement is achieved by exploiting the increased Hilbert space of high-dimensional states and the inherent noise-resilience properties of quantum switches operating in superpositions of causal orders. The findings underscore the potential of qudit-based quantum systems in achieving robust and high-fidelity communication in environments where traditional qubit-based systems face limitations.

AB Long optical storage times are an essential requirement to establish high-rate entanglement distribution over large distances using memory-based quantum repeaters. Rare earth ion-doped crystals are arguably well-suited candidates for building such quantum memories. Toward this end, we investigate the 795.32 nm H-3(6) <-> H-3(4) transition of 1% thulium-doped yttrium gallium garnet crystal (Tm3+:Y3Ga5O12 : Tm3+:YGG). Most essentially, we find that the optical coherence time can reach 1.1 ms, and, using laser pulses, we demonstrate optical storage based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol up to 100 mu s. In addition, we demonstrate multiplexed storage, including feed-forward selection, shifting, and filtering of spectral modes, as well as quantum state storage using members of non-classical photon pairs. Our results show that Tm:YGG can be a potential candidate for creating multiplexed quantum memories with long optical storage times.

TI Multi-Party Quantum Key Distribution Using Variational Quantum
   Eigensolvers
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The research paper introduces a novel approach to multi-party quantum key distribution using variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs). The protocol aims to establish secure communication among multiple parties in a quantum network. The paper outlines a comprehensive framework incorporating quantum state preparation, VQE-based key generation, error correction, and privacy amplification circuits. Mathematical formulations guide the design of quantum gates, variational parameters, and error correction codes. The protocol utilizes quantum entanglement, VQE optimization, and classical operations for error correction and secure key extraction. The paper's experimental focus involves implementing the proposed protocol on a quantum computer, analyzing security metrics such as mutual information and min-entropy, and simulating circuit outcomes.
   The protocol uses variational quantum eigensolvers for multi-party quantum key distribution, offering optimization capabilities for generating shared secret keys. VQEs are scalable, accommodating various multi-party scenarios, and can be implemented on different quantum computing platforms, including gate-based and annealing-based computers.image

TI Integrated spin-wave quantum memory
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Photonic integrated quantum memories are essential for the construction of scalable quantum networks. Spin-wave quantum storage, which can support on-demand retrieval with a long lifetime, is indispensable for practical applications, but has never been demonstrated in an integrated solid-state device. Here, we demonstrate spin-wave quantum storage based on a laser-written waveguide fabricated in a 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal, using both the atomic frequency comb and noiseless photon-echo protocols. Qubits encoded with single-photon-level inputs are stored and retrieved with a fidelity of ${94.9\%\pm 1.2\%}$, which is far beyond the maximal fidelity that can be obtained with any classical device. Our results underline the potential of laser-written integrated devices for practical applications in large-scale quantum networks, such as the construction of multiplexed quantum repeaters in an integrated configuration and high-density transportable quantum memories.
   Single-photon-level light is stored as a spin-wave excitation in a laser-written waveguide, unlocking its practical applications in quantum repeaters and transportable quantum memories.

TI Efficient multiplexed quantum memory with high-dimensional orbital
   angular momentum states in cold atoms
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Quantum memory plays a pivotal role in the construction of quantum repeaters, which are essential devices for establishing long-distance quantum communications and large-scale quantum networks. To boost information capacity and signal processing speed, the implementation of high-efficiency multiplexed quantum memories is essential for the development of multiplexed quantum repeaters. We experimentally demonstrate an efficient multiplexed quantum memory by consolidating photons carrying high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) states from four individual channels into an elongated cold Rb87 atomic ensemble. Benefiting from the cold atomic ensemble with high optical depth, we obtain a storage efficiency exceeding 70% for the four-channel multiplexed beam. The storage fidelities surpass 83% when all channels are operated in a four-dimensional Hilbert space, which is far above the classical benchmark and validates the quantum functionality of our memory system. The achieved high-efficiency OAM multiplexed quantum memory opens up an avenue for efficient quantum information processing over multiple parallel channels, promising significant advances in the field of quantum communication and networking.

TI Long distance multiplexed quantum teleportation from a telecom photon to
   a solid-state qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum teleportation is an essential capability for quantum networks, allowing the transmission of quantum bits (qubits) without a direct exchange of quantum information. Its implementation between distant parties requires teleportation of the quantum information to matter qubits that store it for long enough to allow users to perform further processing. Here we demonstrate long distance quantum teleportation from a photonic qubit at telecom wavelength to a matter qubit, stored as a collective excitation in a solid-state quantum memory. Our system encompasses an active feed-forward scheme, implementing a conditional phase shift on the qubit retrieved from the memory, as required by the protocol. Moreover, our approach is time-multiplexed, allowing for an increase in the teleportation rate, and is directly compatible with the deployed telecommunication networks, two key features for its scalability and practical implementation, that will play a pivotal role in the development of long-distance quantum communication.
   The authors report functional and scalable long-distance quantum teleportation by teleporting a quantum state of light compatible with the telecom network onto a multimode quantum memory separated by 1km of optical fibre.

TI Efficient and Flexible Multi-Qubit Entanglement Transmission in Quantum
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
AB The unprecedented advancements in quantum technology have opened new prospects for the widespread adoption of quantum applications, placing new demands on the information transmission capabilities of large-scale quantum networks. Long-distance and stable entanglements are deemed as the lifeline in quantum network communication. However, some weaknesses, e.g., quantum decoherence, scarce quantum memory, and uneven-quality entanglement, of the quantum entanglement hinder the development. In this paper, we propose Sophon, an online transmission framework for quantum networks, which utilizes high-dimensional entanglements to concurrently transmit multi-qubit data to satisfy the transmission requirements of the real-time request set. We first model the quantum network with multi-qubit entanglement represented by $W$ quantum state and then formulate the Entanglement Routing and Qubit Provisioning (ERQP) problem as a global-local optimization process. To solve the ERQP problem, we distributedly regard each network node as an RL agent for resource provisioning and extend the step-updating of the Markov Decision Process by introducing a centralized controller for entanglement route selection to optimize local and global objectives, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate, on the self-made simulation platform, Sophon achieves a $21.89\%-66.52\%$ decrease in the communication cost, and is more robust on different scales of the network topology and the request set than the baselines.

TI Visually quantifying single-qubit quantum memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB To store quantum information, quantum memory plays a central intermediate ingredient in a network. The minimal criterion for a reliable quantum memory is the maintenance of the entangled state, which can be described by the non-entanglement-breaking (non-EB) channel. In this work, we show that all single-qubit quantum memory can be quantified without trusting input state generation. In other words, we provide a semi-device-independent approach to quantify all single-qubit quantum memory. More specifically, we apply the concept of the two-qubit quantum steering ellipsoids to a single-qubit quantum channel and define the channel ellipsoids. An ellipsoid can be constructed by visualizing finite output states within the Bloch sphere. Since the Choi-Jamio & lstrok;kowski state of a channel can all be reconstructed from geometric data of the channel ellipsoid, a reliable quantum memory can be detected. Finally, we visually quantify the single-qubit quantum memory by observing the volume of the channel ellipsoid.

AB With the current development of quantum computing, some existing cryptographic protocols may be broken in the future, such as RSA with Shor's algorithm. To secure the future secret communications, but also the current ones from retrospective decryption, Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) can be used today, and two types of complementary solutions are currently being studied: Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The objective of this paper is to describe the latest, which relies on the laws of quantum physics to secure the sharing of secret keys. Among the current QKD systems, some are already commercially available. Their distance range is limited, generally around 100 km. To overcome this distance limitation, a first solution is currently being deployed in field trials using trusted nodes, forming the so-called Quantum Communication Infrastructure (QCI). The drawback is that users must trust QCI nodes, in which quantum communication are stopped, going back to classical data processing that can be eavesdropped. To overcome this problem, researchers are investigating solutions to build future quantum networks and Quantum Internet (QI), in which the processing in the networks remains quantum, using quantum buffers and entanglement swapping in quantum repeaters to increase the distance range of QKD. We briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of QKD versus PQC, with the two actually being complementary.

TI Quantum Machine Learning for 6G Network Intelligence and Adversarial
   Threats
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS MAGAZINE
AB Quantum computing has been a major priority for several nations and prominent institutions in their pursuit of a transformative breakthrough in the fields of computation and encryption. By using the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly quantum superposition and entanglement, quantum computing and quantum machine learning (QML) have the potential to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) and achieve quantum supremacy with unprecedented computational power. However, despite its exceptional learning capabilities, QML-based applications face several emerging security threats. Unlike previous studies focused on classical quantum cryptography and secure quantum communications, this work investigates adversarial risks in QML-assisted network functions and digital twin applications. Specifically, we highlight vulnerabilities such as quantum kernel poisoning, backdoor attacks, and adversarial noise. Key findings reveal that adversaries can intercept quantum states in transit, manipulate parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), and exploit variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) through adversarial qubit perturbations. These attacks can mislead QML-based optimization processes, leading to incorrect digital twin predictions, faulty resource allocation, or disruptions in QML-aided network functions. To mitigate these risks, defense strategies such as quantum-safe cryptography, data sanitization, adversarial training, defensive distillation, and gradient masking in quantum circuit design can be employed. However, the key issue is the absence of robust security solutions for real-world deployment. Future research should examine the trade-off between adversarial robustness and generative learning performance. Key areas include quantum state discrimination, secure quantum federated learning, quantum decoherence control, and secure quantum semantic communications for real-world deployment.

TI Optimal quantum transfer from input flying qubit to lossy quantum memory
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In a quantum network, a key challenge is to minimize the direct reflection of flying qubits as they couple to stationary, resonator-based memory qubits, as the reflected amplitude represents state transfer infidelity that cannot be directly recovered. Optimizing the transfer fidelity can be accomplished by dynamically varying the resonator's coupling rate to the flying qubit field. Here, we analytically derive the optimal coupling rate profile in the presence of intrinsic loss of the quantum memory using an open quantum systems method that can account for intrinsic resonator losses. We show that, since the resonator field must be initially empty, an initial amplitude in the resonator must be generated in order to cancel reflections via destructive interference; moreover, we show that this initial amplitude can be made sufficiently small as to allow the net infidelity throughout the complete transfer process to be close to unity. We then derive the time-varying resonator coupling that maximizes the state transfer fidelity as a function of the initial population and intrinsic loss rate, providing a complete protocol for optimal quantum state transfer between the flying qubit and resonator qubit. We present analytical expressions and numerical examples of the fidelities for the complete protocol using exponential and Gaussian profiles. We show that a state transfer fidelity of around 99.9% can be reached momentarily before the quantum information is lost due to the intrinsic loss in practical resonators used as quantum memories.

TI Promoting quantum correlations in deterministic quantum computation with
   a one-qubit model via postselection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1) model is a restricted model of quantum computing able to calculate efficiently the normalized trace of a unitary matrix. In this work, we analyze the quantum correlations called entanglement, Bell's nonlocality, quantum discord, and coherence generated by the DQC1 circuit considering only two qubits (auxiliary and control). For the standard DQC1 model, only quantum discord and coherence appear. By introducing a filter in the circuit we purify the auxiliary qubit, taking it out from the totally mixed state and consequently promoting other quantum correlations between the qubits, such as entanglement and Bell's nonlocality. Through the optimization of the purification process, we conclude that even a small purification is enough to generate entanglement and Bell's nonlocality. We obtain, that by applying the purification process repeatedly an average of 12 times, the auxiliary qubit becomes 99% pure. In this situation, almost maximally entangled states are achieved, which almost maximally violate Bell's inequality. This result suggests that with a simple modification, the DQC1 model can be promoted to a universal model of quantum computing.

TI Optimal teleportation via noisy quantum channels without additional
   qubit resources
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum teleportation exemplifies how the transmission of quantum information starkly differs from that of classical information and serves as a key protocol for quantum communication and quantum computing. While an ideal teleportation protocol requires noiseless quantum channels to share a pure maximally entangled state, the reality is that shared entanglement is often severely degraded due to various decoherence mechanisms. Although the quantum noise induced by the decoherence is indeed a major obstacle to realizing a near-term quantum network or processor with a limited number of qubits, the methodologies considered thus far to address this issue are resource-intensive. Here, we demonstrate a protocol that allows optimal quantum teleportation via noisy quantum channels without additional qubit resources. By analyzing teleportation in the framework of generalized quantum measurement, we optimize the teleportation protocol for noisy quantum channels. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our protocol enables to teleport an unknown qubit even via a single copy of an entangled state under strong decoherence that would otherwise preclude any quantum operation. Our work provides a useful methodology for practically coping with decoherence with a limited number of qubits and paves the way for realizing noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing and quantum communication.

With the current decade witnessing quantum supremacy, quantum technologies are already starting to change the ways information is generated, transmitted, stored and processed. The next major milestone in quantum technology is already rapidly emerging-the quantum internet. Since light is the most logical candidate for quantum communication, quantum photonics is a critical enabling technology. This paper reviews the hardware aspects of the quantum internet, mainly from a photonics perspective. Though a plethora of quantum technologies and devices have emerged in recent years, we are more focused on devices or components that may enable the quantum internet. Our approach is primarily qualitative, providing a broad overview of the necessary technologies for a large-scale quantum internet.

TI Enhancing robustness of noisy qutrit teleportation with Markovian memory
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum teleportation is the fundamental communication unit in quantum communication. Here, a three-level system is selected for storing and transmitting quantum information, due to its unique advantages, such as lower cost than a higher-level system and higher capacity and security than a two-level system. It is known that the key procedure for perfect teleportation is the distribution of entanglement through quantum channel. However, amounts of noise existing in the quantum channel may interfere the entangled state, causing the degradation of quantum entanglement. In the physical implementations of quantum communication schemes, noise acting on the carriers of successive transmissions often exhibits some correlations, which is the so called quantum memory channel. In this paper, a memory channel model during the entanglement distribution phase is constructed and the uniform expression of the evolution of a two-qutrit entangled state under different kinds of correlated noise is derived. Finally, Pauli noise and amplitude damping noise as the typical noise source are considered to analyze the influence of memory effects of noise on qutrit teleportation. It is expected to show that three-level teleportation under these two types of channels can generally enhance the robustness to noise if the Markovian correlations of quantum channel are taken into consideration.

SO INFOCOMMUNICATIONS JOURNAL
AB Quantum repeaters are a key part of long-range free-space quantum key distribution. They allow us to circumvent the negative effects of the no-cloning theorem. Quantum repeaters are also a key point in point-to-point communication since otherwise, a direct line of sight would be necessary. In our simulation, we examined the QKD capabilities of quantum repeaters in a satellite-based network, along with selected types of noises.

TI Research Progress on Computation and Application of Quantum Discord
   (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB One of the most prominent features of quantum physics is the existence of quantum correlations between different quantum systems, which are not equivalent to quantum entanglement. Although quantum entanglement has long been regarded as the primary manifestation of quantum correlations, Ollivier and Zurek introduced the concept of quantum discord in 2002, highlighting that quantum correlations can also exist between subsystems in zero-entanglement systems. Unlike in classical information theory, the overall information of a quantum system cannot be simply described as the sum of the information of its subsystems. In this paper, we review the fundamental theory and calculation methods of quantum discord, with a particular focus on its applications in quantum information processing. In addition, we analyze the role of quantum discord in quantum teleportation, showing that quantum discord exhibits strong robustness against decoherence and noise, providing crucial resources for quantum information processing.

TI QuDiet: A classical simulation platform for qubit-qudit hybrid quantum
   systems
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In recent years, numerous research advancements have extended the limit of classical simulation of quantum algorithms. Although, most of the state-of-the-art classical simulators are only limited to binary quantum systems, which restrict the classical simulation of higher-dimensional quantum computing systems. Through recent developments in higher-dimensional quantum computing systems, it is realised that implementing qudits improves the overall performance of a quantum algorithm by increasing memory space and reducing the asymptotic complexity of a quantum circuit. Hence, in this article, QuDiet, a state-of-the-art user-friendly python-based higher-dimensional quantum computing simulator is introduced. QuDiet offers multi-valued logic operations by utilising generalised quantum gates with an abstraction so that any naive user can simulate qudit systems with ease as compared to the existing ones. Various benchmark quantum circuits is simulated in QuDiet and show the considerable speedup in simulation time as compared to the other simulators without loss in precision. Finally, QuDiet provides a full qubit-qudit hybrid quantum simulator package with quantum circuit templates of well-known quantum algorithms for fast prototyping and simulation. Comprehensive simulation up to 20 qutrits circuit on depth 80 on QuDiet was successfully achieved. The complete code and packages of QuDiet is available at .

TI Telecom quantum photonic interface for a 40Ca+
   single-ion quantum memory
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement-based quantum networks require quantum photonic interfaces between stationary quantum memories and photons, enabling entanglement distribution. Here we present such a photonic interface, designed for connecting a Ca-40(+) single-ion quantum memory to the telecom C-band. The interface combines a memory-resonant, cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion photon pair source with bi-directional polarization-conserving quantum frequency conversion. We demonstrate preservation of high-fidelity entanglement during conversion, fiber transmission over up to 40 km and back-conversion to the memory wavelength. Even for the longest distance and bi-directional conversion the entanglement fidelity remains larger than 95% (98%) without (with) background correction.

TI Decoherence mitigation by embedding a logical qubit in a qudit
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum information stored in a qubit is rapidly lost to the environment. The realization of robust qubits is one of the most important challenges in quantum computing. Herein, we propose to embed a logical qubit within the manifold of a qudit as a scheme to preserve quantum information over extended periods of time. Under identical conditions (e.g., decoherence channels), the submanifold of the logical qubit exhibits extended lifetimes compared to a pure two-level system (qubit). The retention of quantum information further improves with separation between the sublevels of the logical qubit. Lifetime enhancement can be understood in terms of entropy production of the encoding and nonencoding subspaces during evolution under a quantum map for a d-level system. The additional pathways for coherent evolution through intermediate sublevels within a d-level manifold provide an information-preserving mechanism: reversible alternative channels to the irreversible loss of information to the environment characteristic of open quantum systems.

TI Quantum Machine Learning for Distributed Quantum Protocols with Local
   Operations and Noisy Classical Communications
SO ENTROPY
AB Distributed quantum information processing protocols such as quantum entanglement distillation and quantum state discrimination rely on local operations and classical communications (LOCC). Existing LOCC-based protocols typically assume the availability of ideal, noiseless, communication channels. In this paper, we study the case in which classical communication takes place over noisy channels, and we propose to address the design of LOCC protocols in this setting via the use of quantum machine learning tools. We specifically focus on the important tasks of quantum entanglement distillation and quantum state discrimination, and implement local processing through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that are optimized to maximize the average fidelity and average success probability in the respective tasks, while accounting for communication errors. The introduced approach, Noise Aware-LOCCNet (NA-LOCCNet), is shown to have significant advantages over existing protocols designed for noiseless communications.

TI Toward the Device-Independent Certification of a Quantum Memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum memories represent one of the main ingredients of future quantum communication networks. Their certification is therefore a key challenge. Here we develop efficient certification methods for quantum memories. Considering a device-independent approach, where no a priori characterization of sources or measurement devices is required, we develop a robust self-testing method for quantum memories. We then illustrate the practical relevance of our technique in a relaxed scenario by certifying a fidelity of 0.87 in a recent solid-state ensemble quantum memory experiment. More generally, our methods apply for the characterization of any device implementing a qubit identity quantum channel.

TI Heralded entanglement distribution between two absorptive quantum
   memories
SO NATURE
AB Owing to the inevitable loss in communication channels, the distance of entanglement distribution is limited to approximately 100 kilometres on the ground(1). Quantum repeaters can circumvent this problem by using quantum memory and entanglement swapping(2). As the elementary link of a quantum repeater, the heralded distribution of two-party entanglement between two remote nodes has only been realized with built-in-type quantum memories(3-9). These schemes suffer from the trade-off between multiplexing capacity and deterministic properties and hence hinder the development of efficient quantum repeaters. Quantum repeaters based on absorptive quantum memories can overcome such limitations because they separate the quantum memories and the quantum light sources. Here we present an experimental demonstration of heralded entanglement between absorptive quantum memories. We build two nodes separated by 3.5 metres, each containing a polarization-entangled photon-pair source and a solid-state quantum memory with bandwidth up to 1 gigahertz. A joint Bell-state measurement in the middle station heralds the successful distribution of maximally entangled states between the two quantum memories with a fidelity of 80.4 +/- 2.2 per cent (+/- 1 standard deviation). The quantum nodes and channels demonstrated here can serve as an elementary link of a quantum repeater. Moreover, the wideband absorptive quantum memories used in the nodes are compatible with deterministic entanglement sources and can simultaneously support multiplexing, which paves the way for the construction of practical solid-state quantum repeaters and high-speed quantum networks.

TI Towards a spectrally multiplexed quantum repeater
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Extended quantum networks are based on quantum repeaters that often rely on the distribution of entanglement in an efficient and heralded fashion over multiple network nodes. Many repeater architectures require multiplexed sources of entangled photon pairs, multiplexed quantum memories, and photon detection that distinguishes between the multiplexed modes. Here we demonstrate the concurrent employment of (1) spectrally multiplexed cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal; (2) a virtually-imaged phased array that enables mapping of spectral modes onto distinct spatial modes for frequency-selective detection; and (3) a cryogenically-cooled Tm3+:LiNbO3 crystal that allows spectral filtering in an approach that anticipates its use as a spectrally-multiplexed quantum memory. Through coincidence measurements, we demonstrate quantum correlations between energy-correlated photon pairs and a strong reduction of the correlation strength between all other photons. This constitutes an important step towards a frequency-multiplexed quantum repeater.

TI Continuous quantum error correction for evolution under time-dependent
   Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop a protocol for continuous operation of a quantum error correcting code for protection of coherent evolution due to an encoded Hamiltonian against environmental errors, using the three-qubit bit-flip code and bit-flip errors as a canonical example. To detect errors in real time, we filter the output signals from continuous measurement of the error syndrome operators and use a double thresholding protocol for error diagnosis, while correction of errors is done as in the conventional operation. We optimize our continuous operation protocol for evolution under quantum memory and under quantum annealing, by maximizing the fidelity between the target and actual logical states at a specified final time. In the case of quantum memory, we show that our continuous operation protocol yields a logical error rate that is slightly larger than the one obtained from using the optimal Wonham filter for error diagnosis while being simpler to implement. For quantum annealing, we show that our continuous quantum error correction protocol can significantly reduce the final logical state infidelity when the continuous measurements are sufficiently strong relative to the strength of the time-dependent Hamiltonian. We also show that this continuous quantum error correction protocol can reduce the time-to-solution relative to the value obtained from a classical parallelization scheme. These results suggest that a continuous implementation is suitable for quantum error correction in the presence of encoded time-dependent Hamiltonians, opening the possibility of many applications in quantum simulation and quantum annealing.

TI Electromagnetically induced transparency quantum memory for

AB Quantum memory (QM) enables quantum state mapping between flying and stationary quantum states and is the building block of quantum information science, which enables to achieve a plethora of quantum information protocols, such as quantum state transfer across remote quantum nodes, distributed quantum logic gate, and quantum precession measurement network. Great progresses of quantum memories have been achieved, and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is one of the well-understood approaches of QM. Quantum states of light are the essential quantum resources for implementing quantum enhanced task, and thus it is a long-standing goal to store and release non-classical states of light. This paper presents an up-to-date review on recent developments in EIT-based QM: EIT quantum memories have been realized in warm atomic cell, cold atoms and solid system, respectively; and EIT mechanism has been applied to store and release single photon, squeezed state, entangled photon pairs and multipartite entangled states of optical modes.

AB This paper introduces the indigenous Quantum Network Simulator developed to simulate various quantum network protocols on classical machines. The paper specifically focuses on the simulation of entanglement generation between two quantum memories using the Barrett-Kok protocol, as well as the teleportation of a single qubit utilizing the produced entangled states. Additionally, the impact of error manipulation and other factors on the fidelity of the teleported states is analyzed, revealing strategies for enhancing teleported state fidelity. The existing few quantum network simulators, allow the simulation of teleportation protocol, but they do not account for the experimental aspects of entanglement generation and distribution, which are crucial for achieving any practical implementation. This work aims to bridge this gap and provide a realistic fidelity of the teleported states.

TI A quantum-logic gate between distant quantum-network modules
SO SCIENCE
AB The big challenge in quantum computing is to realize scalable multi-qubit systems with cross-talk-free addressability and efficient coupling of arbitrarily selected qubits. Quantum networks promise a solution by integrating smaller qubit modules to a larger computing cluster. Such a distributed architecture, however, requires the capability to execute quantum-logic gates between distant qubits. Here we experimentally realize such a gate over a distance of 60 meters. We employ an ancillary photon that we successively reflect from two remote qubit modules, followed by a heralding photon detection, which triggers a final qubit rotation. We use the gate for remote entanglement creation of all four Bell states, Our nonlocal quantum-logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits and many modules for a tailor-made multi-qubit computing register.

TI Research advances in continuous-variable quantum computation and quantum
   error correction
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum computation presents incomparable advantages over classical computer in solving some complex problems. To realize large-scale quantum computation, it is required to establish a hardware platform that is universal, scalable and fault tolerant. Continuous-variable optical system, which has unique advantages, is a feasible way to realize large-scale quantum computation and has attracted much attention in recent years. Measurement-based continuous-variable quantum computation realizes the computation by performing the measurement and feedforward of measurement results in large-scale Gaussian cluster states, and it provides an efficient method to realize quantum computation. Quantum error correction is an important part in quantum computation and quantum communication to protect quantum information. This review briefly introduces the basic principles and research advances in one-way quantum computation based on cluster states, quantum computation based on optical Schrodinger cat states and quantum error correction with continuous variables, and discusses the problems and challenges that the continuous-variable quantum computation is facing.

TI Broadband quantum memory in a cavity via zero spectral dispersion
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We seek to design experimentally feasible broadband, temporally multiplexed optical quantum memory with near-term applications to telecom bands. Specifically, we devise dispersion compensation (DC) for an impedance-matched narrow-band quantum memory by exploiting Raman processes over two three-level atomic subensembles, one for memory and the other for DC. DC provides impedance matching over more than a full cavity linewidth. Combined with 1 s spin-coherence lifetime the memory could be capable of power efficiency exceeding 90% leading to 10(6) modes for temporal multiplexing. Our design could lead to significant multiplexing enhancement for quantum repeaters to be used for telecom quantum networks.

TI Hybrid quantum repeaters with ensemble-based quantum memories and
   single-spin photon transducers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Reliable quantum communication over hundreds of kilometers is a daunting yet necessary requirement for a quantum internet. To overcome photon loss, the deployment of quantum repeater stations between distant network nodes is necessary. A plethora of different quantum hardware is being developed for this purpose, each platform with its own opportunities and challenges. Here, we propose to combine two promising hardware platforms in a hybrid quantum repeater architecture to lower the cost and boost the performance of long-distance quantum communication. We outline how ensemble-based quantum memories combined with single-spin photon transducers, which can transfer quantum information between a photon and a single spin, can facilitate massive multiplexing, efficient photon generation, and quantum logic for amplifying communication rates. As a specific example, we describe how a single Rubidium (Rb) atom coupled to nanophotonic resonators can function as a high-rate, telecom-visible entangled photon source with the visible photon being compatible with storage in a Thulium-doped crystal memory (Tm-memory) and the telecom photon being compatible with low-loss fiber propagation. We experimentally verify that the Tm and Rb transitions resonate with each other. Our analysis shows that by employing up to nine repeater stations, each equipped with two Tm-memories capable of holding up to 625 storage modes, along with four single Rb atoms, one can reach a quantum communication rate of about 10 secret bits per second across distances of up to 1000 km.

TI A millisecond integrated quantum memory for photonic qubits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum memories for light are essential building blocks for quantum repeaters and quantum networks. Integrated operations of quantum memories could enable scalable application with low-power consumption. However, the photonic quantum storage lifetime in integrated devices has so far been limited to tens of microseconds, falling short of the requirements for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 milliseconds based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151Eu3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides, and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0 +/- 0.5% at 1.021 milliseconds, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.

TI Large teleportation of two-qubit state between non-neighboring nodes
   based on the utilization of multiple cluster states within quantum
   networks
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The transmission of quantum states over extended distances is constrained by photon losses, ruling out direct amplification akin to classical telecommunications due to the non-cloning theorem. Overcoming this challenge involves implementing quantum repeater protocols that leverage entanglement swapping to create long-distance entanglement from shorter distances. A novel multi-hop quantum teleportation scheme, blending concepts from quantum repeaters and teleportation, is under exploration. It aims to transfer arbitrary two-qubit states between two distant parties, even in the absence of a direct quantum channel. Intermediate nodes, connected via a four-qubit entangled cluster state as quantum channels, are introduced based on a more general routing protocol. Bell measurements are independently conducted by the source node (Alice) and all intermediate nodes, with simultaneous transmission of measurement results, significantly reducing time consumption. Determining the quantum state from Bell measurement results requires only the destination node (Bob) for a simple unitary transformation. Moreover, this protocol holds promise for implementation on the IBM Quantum Experience platform once the requisite quantum circuits are designed. This overview encompasses both the theoretical and simulated status of the proposed scheme, with simulated findings incorporated into quantum state tomography to verify the accuracy of the transmitted quantum state.

TI Benchmarking of quantum protocols
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum network protocols offer new functionalities such as enhanced security to communication and computational systems. Despite the rapid progress in quantum hardware, it has not yet reached a level of maturity that enables execution of many quantum protocols in practical settings. To develop quantum protocols in real world, it is necessary to examine their performance considering the imperfections in their practical implementation using simulation platforms. In this paper, we consider several quantum protocols that enable promising functionalities and services in near-future quantum networks. The protocols are chosen from both areas of quantum communication and quantum computation as follows: quantum money, W-state based anonymous transmission, verifiable blind quantum computation, and quantum digital signature. We use NetSquid simulation platform to evaluate the effect of various sources of noise on the performance of these protocols, considering different figures of merit. We find that to enable quantum money protocol, the decoherence time constant of the quantum memory must be at least three times the storage time of qubits. Furthermore, our simulation results for the w-state based anonymous transmission protocol show that to achieve an average fidelity above 0.8 in this protocol, the storage time of sender's and receiver's particles in the quantum memory must be less than half of the decoherence time constant of the quantum memory. We have also investigated the effect of gate imperfections on the performance of verifiable blind quantum computation. We find that with our chosen parameters, if the depolarizing probability of quantum gates is equal to or greater than 0.05, the security of the protocol cannot be guaranteed. Lastly, our simulation results for quantum digital signature protocol show that channel loss has a significant effect on the probability of repudiation.

TI Dynamical subset sampling of quantum error-correcting protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error-correcting (QEC) stabilizer codes enable protection of quantum information against errors during storage and processing. Simulation of noisy QEC codes is used to identify the noise parameters necessary for advantageous operation of logical qubits in realistic quantum computing architectures. Typical quantum error-correction techniques contain intermediate measurements and classical feedback that determine the actual noisy circuit sequence in an instance of performing the protocol. Dynamical subset sampling enables efficient simulation of such nondeterministic quantum error-correcting protocols for any type of quantum circuit and incoherent noise of low strength. As an importance sampling technique, dynamical subset sampling allows one to effectively make use of computational resources to only sample the most relevant sequences of quantum circuits in order to estimate a protocol's logical failure rate with well-defined error bars. We demonstrate the capabilities of dynamical subset sampling with examples from fault-tolerant (FT) QEC. We show that, in a typical stabilizer simulation with incoherent Pauli noise of strength p = 10-3, our method can reach a required sampling accuracy on the logical failure rate with two orders of magnitude fewer samples than direct Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, dynamical subset sampling naturally allows for efficient simulation of realistic multi-parameter noise models describing faulty quantum processors. It can be applied not only for QEC in the circuit model but any noisy quantum computing framework with incoherent fault operators including measurement-based quantum computation and quantum networks.

TI A multifunctional quantum teleportation network
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum teleportation is one of the most basic quantum protocols, which transfers an unknown quantum state from one location to another through local operation and classical communication by using shared quantum entanglement without physical transfer of the information carrier. And it has been widely used in various quantum information protocols such as entanglement swapping, quantum repeaters, quantum gate teleportation, quantum computation based on measurement, and quantum teleportation networks, which have important application value in quantum computation and quantum information. Quantum teleportation is a naturally bipartite process, in which an unknown quantum state can only be transmitted from one node to another. With the further development of quantum information research, it is necessary to transfer quantum states or quantum information among more and more nodes. Multipartite quantum protocols are expected to form fundamental components for larger-scale quantum communication and computation. A bipartite quantum teleportation should be extended to a multipartite protocol known as a quantum teleportation network. In this paper, a multifunctional quantum teleportation network is proposed theoretically. We first propose a special method of constructing four-partite quantum resources in continuous variables (CVs), and based on this, construct two different types of CV quantum teleportation networks. One type of network contains just one quantum teleportation process consisting of a sender, a receiver and two controllers. In this type of network, the unknown quantum state can be recovered at any other node according to the requirement after the measurement in the input node, which enriches the transfer direction and transfer mode of the unknown quantum state. And meanwhile, the two controllers can control the transfer of a quantum state from the sender to the receiver by restricting the sender and receiver's access to their information, which makes the quantum teleportation network controllable. The other type of network has two quantum teleportation processes, each containing only a sender, a receiver and no controllers, which increases the number of quantum states that can be transmitted. Then we analyze the dependence of the fidelity of each quantum teleportation network on different physical parameters, and compare the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages among different types of quantum teleportation networks. The scheme for constructing a multifunctional quantum teleportation network in this paper shows some advantages, such as the greater number of quantum nodes, diversity of types, simple operation procedure. And all these advantages provide a broader application prospect for establishing larger and more complex quantum information networks in the future and quicken the pace of the application of quantum information.

AB This paper proposes an asymmetric tridirectional quantum teleportation (TQT) protocol that uses a seven-qubit cluster states as the quantum channels of each party.

Based on the mathematical modeling of the scheme, the quantum circuit and the appropriate quantum channel is proposed. For examination and implementation, the proposed scheme and circuit were simulated and validated using IBM quantum experience platform, QASM_simulator and Qiskit library.

AB Quantum networks play an extremely important role in quantum information science, with application to quantum communication, computation, metrology, and fundamental tests. One of the key challenges for implementing a quantum network is to distribute entangled flying qubits to spatially separated nodes, at which quantum interfaces or transducers map the entanglement onto stationary qubits. The stationary qubits at the separated nodes constitute quantum memories realized in matter while the flying qubits constitute quantum channels realized in photons. Dedicated efforts around the world for more than 20 years have resulted in both major theoretical and experimental progress toward entangling quantum nodes and ultimately building a global quantum network. Here, the development of quantum networks and the experimental progress over the past two decades leading to the current state of the art for generating entanglement of quantum nodes based on various physical systems such as single atoms, cold atomic ensembles, trapped ions, diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy centers, and solid-state host doped with rare-earth ions are reviewed. Along the way, the merits are discussed and the potential of each of these systems toward realizing a quantum network is compared.

TI Quantum repeaters in space
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Long-distance entanglement is a very precious resource, but its distribution is very difficult due to the exponential losses of light in optical fibres. A possible solution consists in the use of quantum repeaters, based on entanglement swapping (ES) or quantum error correction. Alternatively, satellite-based free-space optical links can be exploited, achieving better loss-distance scaling. We propose to combine these two ingredients, quantum repeaters and satellite-based links, into a scheme that allows to achieve entanglement distribution over global distances with a small number of intermediate untrusted nodes. The entanglement sources, placed on satellites, send quantum states encoded in photons towards orbiting quantum repeater stations, where ES is performed. The performance of this repeater chain is assessed in terms of the secret key rate achievable by the BBM92 cryptographic protocol. We perform a comparison with other repeater chain architectures and show that our scheme, even though more technically demanding, is superior in many situations of interest. Finally, we analyse strengths and weaknesses of the proposed scheme and discuss exemplary orbital configurations. The integration of satellite-based links with ground repeater networks can be envisaged to represent the backbone of the future quantum internet.

TI On-Demand Integrated Quantum Memory for Polarization Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Photonic polarization qubits are widely used in quantum computation and quantum communication due to the robustness in transmission and the easy qubit manipulation. An integrated quantum memory for polarization qubits is a useful building block for large-scale integrated quantum networks. However, ondemand storing polarization qubits in an integrated quantum memory is a long-standing challenge due to the anisotropic absorption of solids and the polarization-dependent features of microstructures. Here we demonstrate a reliable on-demand quantum memory for polarization qubits, using a depressed-cladding waveguide fabricated in a 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal. The site-2 151Eu3+ ions in Y2SiO5 crystal provides a near-uniform absorption for arbitrary polarization states and a new pump sequence is developed to prepare a wideband and enhanced absorption profile. A fidelity of 99.4 1 0.6% is obtained for the qubit storage process with an input of 0.32 photons per pulse, together with a storage bandwidth of 10 MHz. This reliable integrated quantum memory for polarization qubits reveals the potential for use in the construction of integrated quantum networks.

TI Optomechanical interface between telecom photons and spin quantum memory
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum networks enable a broad range of practical and fundamental applications spanning from distributed quantum computing to sensing and metrology. A cornerstone of such networks is an interface between telecom photons and quantum memories, which has proven challenging for the case of spin-mechanical memories. Here we demonstrate a novel approach based on cavity optomechanics that utilizes the susceptibility of spin qubits to strain. We use it to control electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond with photons in the 1,550 nm telecommunication wavelength band. This method does not involve qubit optical transitions and is insensitive to spectral diffusion. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to solid-state qubits in a wide variety of materials, expanding the toolbox for quantum information processing.
   Quantum networks require a connection between quantum memories and optical links, which often operate in different frequency ranges. An optomechanical device exploiting the strain dependence of a colour-centre spin provides such a spin-optics interface at room temperature.

TI Quantum error correction of qudits beyond break-even
SO NATURE
AB Hilbert space dimension is a key resource for quantum information processing(1,2). Not only is a large overall Hilbert space an essential requirement for quantum error correction, but a large local Hilbert space can also be advantageous for realizing gates and algorithms more efficiently(3, 4, 5, 6-7). As a result, there has been considerable experimental effort in recent years to develop quantum computing platforms using qudits (d-dimensional quantum systems with d > 2) as the fundamental unit of quantum information(8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18-19). Just as with qubits, quantum error correction of these qudits will be necessary in the long run, but so far, error correction of logical qudits has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here we report the experimental realization of an error-corrected logical qutrit (d = 3) and ququart (d = 4), which was achieved with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill bosonic code(20). Using a reinforcement learning agent(21,22), we optimized the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qutrit (ququart) as a ternary (quaternary) quantum memory and achieved beyond break-even error correction with a gain of 1.82 +/- 0.03 (1.87 +/- 0.03). This work represents a novel way of leveraging the large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator to realize hardware-efficient quantum error correction.

TI Resource-efficient fault-tolerant one-way quantum repeater with code
   concatenation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One-way quantum repeaters where loss and operational errors are counteracted by quantum error-correcting codes can ensure fast and reliable qubit transmission in quantum networks. It is crucial that the resource requirements of such repeaters, for example, the number of qubits per repeater node and the complexity of the quantum error-correcting operations are kept to a minimum to allow for near-future implementations. To this end, we propose a one-way quantum repeater that targets both the loss and operational error rates in a communication channel in a resource-efficient manner using code concatenation. Specifically, we consider a tree-cluster code as an inner loss-tolerant code concatenated with an outer 5-qubit code for protection against Pauli errors. Adopting flag-based stabilizer measurements, we show that intercontinental distances of up to 10,000 km can be bridged with a minimized resource overhead by interspersing repeater nodes that each specialize in suppressing either loss or operational errors. Our work demonstrates how tailored error-correcting codes can significantly lower the experimental requirements for long-distance quantum communication.

TI Resource Placement for Rate and Fidelity Maximization in Quantum
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Existing classical optical network infrastructure cannot be immediately used for quantum network applications due to photon loss. The first step toward enabling quantum networks is the integration of quantum repeaters into optical networks. However, the expenses and intrinsic noise inherent in quantum hardware underscore the need for an efficient deployment strategy that optimizes the placement of quantum repeaters and memories. In this article, we present a comprehensive framework for network planning, aiming to efficiently distribute quantum repeaters across existing infrastructure, with the objective of maximizing quantum network utility within an entanglement distribution network. We apply our framework to several cases including a preliminary illustration of a dumbbell network topology and real-world cases of the SURFnet and ESnet. We explore the effect of quantum memory multiplexing within quantum repeaters, as well as the influence of memory coherence time on quantum network utility. We further examine the effects of different fairness assumptions on network planning, uncovering their impacts on real-time network performance.

TI Nuclear quantum memory for hard x-ray photon wave packets
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Optical quantum memories are key elements in modern quantum technologies to reliably store and retrieve quantum information. At present, they are conceptually limited to the optical wavelength regime. Recent advancements in x-ray quantum optics render an extension of optical quantum memory protocols to ultrashort wavelengths possible, thereby establishing quantum photonics at x-ray energies. Here, we introduce an x-ray quantum memory protocol that utilizes mechanically driven nuclear resonant Fe-57 absorbers to form a comb structure in the nuclear absorption spectrum by using the Doppler effect. This room-temperature nuclear frequency comb enables us to control the waveform of x-ray photon wave packets to a high level of accuracy and fidelity using solely mechanical motions. This tunable, robust, and highly flexible system offers a versatile platform for a compact solid-state quantum memory at room temperature for hard x-rays.

TI Simulating quantum repeater strategies for multiple satellites
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In scaling to global distances, future quantum networks are expected to make use of satellite-based orbiting quantum memories. In this manuscript, the authors simulate the performance of memory-assisted quantum key distribution (MA-QKD) schemes under a range of operating conditions and network configurations, with encouraging conclusions as to the feasibility of implementing such networks with near-term devices.
   A global quantum repeater network involving satellite-based links is likely to have advantages over fiber-based networks in terms of long-distance communication, since the photon losses in vacuum scale only polynomially with the distance - compared to the exponential losses in optical fibers. To simulate the performance of such networks, we have introduced a scheme of large-scale event-based Monte Carlo simulation of quantum repeaters with multiple memories that can faithfully represent loss and imperfections in these memories. In this work, we identify the quantum key distribution rates achievable in various satellite and ground station geometries for feasible experimental parameters. The power and flexibility of the simulation toolbox allows us to explore various strategies and parameters, some of which only arise in these more complex, multi-satellite repeater scenarios. As a primary result, we conclude that key rates in the kHz range are reasonably attainable for intercontinental quantum communication with three satellites, only one of which carries a quantum memory.

TI Quantum dot technology for quantum repeaters: from entangled photon
   generation toward the integration with quantum memories
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The realization of a functional quantum repeater is one of the major research goals in long-distance quantum communication. Among the different approaches that are being followed, the one relying on quantum memories interfaced with deterministic quantum emitters is considered as one of the most promising solutions. In this work, we focus on the hardware to implement memory-based quantum-repeater schemes that rely on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for the generation of polarization entangled photons. Going through the most relevant figures of merit related to efficiency of the photon source, we select significant developments in fabrication, processing and tuning techniques aimed at combining high degree of entanglement with on-demand pair generation, with a special focus on the progress achieved in the representative case of the GaAs system. We proceed to offer a perspective on integration with quantum memories, both highlighting preliminary works on natural-artificial atomic interfaces and commenting a wide choice of currently available and potentially viable memory solutions in terms of wavelength, bandwidth and noise-requirements. To complete the overview, we also present recent implementations of entanglement-based quantum communication protocols with QDs and highlight the next challenges ahead for the implementation of practical quantum networks.

TI One-way quantum repeater with rare-earth ions doped in solids
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum repeaters are proposed to overcome exponential photon loss over distance in fibers. One-way quantum repeaters eliminate the need for two-way classical communications, which can potentially outperform quantum-memory-based quantum repeaters. I propose that rare-earth ions doped in solids and coupled with nanophotonic cavity can be used to generate photonic cluster state efficiently, which serve as good platforms for one-way quantum repeater nodes. In addition, I propose a multiplexed scheme of photonic tree cluster state generation with multiple quantum emitters. With less than 100 quantum emitters per repeater node, secret key rates can reach the order of 100 kHz for a communication distance of one thousand kilometers, with the assumption of fast and high-fidelity atom-atom and photon-atom gate operations, as well as high photon collection and detection efficiencies. This proposal is especially useful for generating large-scale photonic cluster state, which is essential for cluster state-based quantum repeater schemes and measurement-based quantum computing.

TI Quantum networks using counterfactual quantum communication
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Counterfactual quantum communication is one of the most interesting facets of quantum communication, allowing two parties to communicate without any transmission of quantum or classical particles between the parties involved in the communication process. This aspect of quantum communication originates from the interaction-free measurements where the chained quantum Zeno effect plays an important role. Here, we propose a new counterfactual quantum communication protocol for transmitting an entangled state from a pair of electrons to two independent photons. Interestingly, the protocol proposed here shows that the counterfactual method can be employed to transfer information from house qubits to flying qubits. Following this, we show that the protocol finds uses in building quantum repeaters leading to a counterfactual quantum network, enabling counterfactual communication over a linear quantum network.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical switches and rerouting networks are considered essential in optical quantum computers where they are used for injection and dejection of the necessary quantum states into an optical quantum computer. Practical optical switches and rerouting networks are, however, experimentally challenging as they must have extremely low loss, small switching time, high repetition rate, and minimum optical nonlinearity, requirements that are difficult to achieve simultaneously. In this paper, we present an optical quantum computation platform that does not require such optical switches. Our method is based on continuous-variable measurement-based quantum computation where, instead of the typical cluster states, we modify the structure of the quantum entanglement, so that the quantum teleportation protocol can be employed instead of optical switching and rerouting. The quantum entanglement structure in our architecture has additional modes that allow quantum states to be teleported in or out of the computation along the cluster state, a task that normally requires optical switches. We also outline how to combine our platform with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding, the currently most promising encoding for a continuous-variable system.

TI Entanglement of nanophotonic quantum memory nodes in a telecom network
SO NATURE
AB A key challenge in realizing practical quantum networks for long-distance quantum communication involves robust entanglement between quantum memory nodes connected by fibre optical infrastructure(1-3). Here we demonstrate a two-node quantum network composed of multi-qubit registers based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) centres in nanophotonic diamond cavities integrated with a telecommunication fibre network. Remote entanglement is generated by the cavity-enhanced interactions between the electron spin qubits of the SiVs and optical photons. Serial, heralded spin-photon entangling gate operations with time-bin qubits are used for robust entanglement of separated nodes. Long-lived nuclear spin qubits are used to provide second-long entanglement storage and integrated error detection. By integrating efficient bidirectional quantum frequency conversion of photonic communication qubits to telecommunication frequencies (1,350nm), we demonstrate the entanglement of two nuclear spin memories through 40km spools of low-loss fibre and a 35-km long fibre loop deployed in the Boston area urban environment, representing an enabling step towards practical quantum repeaters and large-scale quantum networks.

TI Emulating Quantum Teleportation of a Majorana Zero Mode Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Topological quantum computation based on anyons is a promising approach to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. The Majorana zero modes in the Kitaev chain are an example of non-Abelian anyons where braiding operations can be used to perform quantum gates. Here we perform a quantum simulation of topological quantum computing, by teleporting a qubit encoded in the Majorana zero modes of a Kitaev chain. The quantum simulation is performed by mapping the Kitaev chain to its equivalent spin version and realizing the ground states in a superconducting quantum processor. The teleportation transfers the quantum state encoded in the spin-mapped version of the Majorana zero mode states between two Kitaev chains. The teleportation circuit is realized using only braiding operations and can be achieved despite being restricted to Clifford gates for the Ising anyons. The Majorana encoding is a quantum error detecting code for phase-flip errors, which is used to improve the average fidelity of the teleportation for six distinct states from 70.76 +/- 0.35% to 84.60 +/- 0.11%, well beyond the classical bound in either case.

TI Hybrid classical-quantum machine learning based on dissipative two-qubit
   channels
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Although the environmental effects, i.e., dissipation and decoherence seem to be the strongest adversaries in the quantum information realm, here, we address how dissipation can be harnessed for quantum state preparation and universal quantum computation. In this line, we propose a realistic scheme for hybrid classical-quantum neural networks based on dissipative two-qubit channels. In particular, we design a variational quantum circuit consisting of a set of universal quantum gates. We encode classical information in the initial states of a two-qubit system interacting with a global environment. This composite system plays the role of a dissipative quantum channel (DQC). A pooling layer concatenates the output states of the DQCs resulting in the outcome of the circuit. Both the DCQs and the pooling layer provide superposition and entanglement which are the key ingredients of any universal quantum computation protocol. Finally, we investigate the capability and adaptability of this model by doing some machine learning tasks. It is reasonable to postulate that a quantum computer based on DQCs may outperform a classical computer because, in contrast to the latter, the former is capable of producing atypical patterns through non-classical phenomena.

Delving into the synergistic relations of quantum technology and satellite communications, we elucidate on continuous variable and discrete variable QKD schemes, and the strategic selection of satellite orbits for optimal QKD. The prospects and possibilities of the integration of software-defined networking into this paradigm showcases a fusion of traditional and quantum communication methods. In the context of continuous variable quantum systems, a comparative discussion on Gaussian and non-Gaussian paradigms is presented, emphasizing their distinct characteristics crucial for satellite-assisted quantum networks. Moreover, we underscore the role of quantum computing in bolstering the security of satellite information networks, emphasizing the importance of delay reduction for the connection of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to satellite networks. Lastly, we propose potential domains ripe for future exploration in this burgeoning field.

TI The Clifford hierarchy for one qubit or qudit
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB The Clifford hierarchy is a nested sequence of sets of quantum gates that can be fault-tolerantly performed using gate teleportation within standard quantum error correction schemes. The groups of Pauli and Clifford gates constitute the first and second 'levels', respectively. Non-Clifford gates from the third level or higher, such as the T gate, are necessary for achieving fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Since it was defined 26 years ago by Gottesman-Chuang, two questions have been studied by numerous researchers. First, precisely which gates constitute the Clifford hierarchy? Second, which subset of the hierarchy gates admit efficient gate teleportation protocols? We completely solve both questions in the practically relevant case of the Clifford hierarchy for gates of one qubit or one qudit of prime dimension. We express every such hierarchy gate uniquely as a product of three simple gates, yielding also a formula for the size of every level. These results are a consequence of our finding that all such hierarchy gates can be expressed in a certain form that guarantees efficient gate teleportation. Our decomposition of Clifford gates as a unique product of three elementary Clifford gates is of broad applicability.

AB For achieving long-distance quantum communication, Quantum Repeaters (QRs) have to be used, with communication range and reliability increased by using intermediate stations. The physical requirements of second generation QRs may be achievable in the near future. They use Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECC) to protect logical qubits against environmental interaction using physical redundancy. In this work, we study the types of errors that can corrupt quantum codewords in intermediate stations. Our studies show that the errors are distance-dependent, and also consist of correlated errors and biased errors. To mitigate this error model, we use non-symmetric CSS codes as well as mirrored structure coding. We show that using non-symmetric CSS codes results in better performance. Also, we prove the logical CZ gate transversality of the mirrored structure coding. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by numerical simulations.

TI Two-way ⇆ quantum communication using four-qubit cluster state: Mutual
   exchange of quantum information
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this study, we have proposed a scheme for two-way quantum communication in which the two legitimate participants mutually exchange their quantum information to each other by using a four-qubit cluster state as the quantum channel. Recently, by utilizing four-qubit cluster state as the quantum channel, Kazemikhah et al. [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 60, 378 (2021)] tried to design a scheme for mutual exchange of quantum information between two legitimate participants. However, in this study, it has been shown that in their scheme, the transmission of quantum information cannot be realized because the two participants are not entangled to each other due to a trivial conceptual mistake made by Kazemikhah et al. in the description of the quantum channel. Here, we have shown that two legitimate participants can teleport quantum information states to each other by using four-qubit cluster state as the quantum channel, provided they co-operate with each other and perform nonlocal controlled phase gate operation. If both participants do not co-operate with each other, then no one can reconstruct the information sent to them, and therefore, the exchange of information is possible only when both participants are honest to each other.

We present the comparison of several qudit transpilation regimes, which differ in decomposition of multicontrolled gates: qubit as ordinary qubit transpilation and execution, qutrit with d=3 levels and single qubit in qudit, and ququart with d=4 levels and 2 qubits per ququart. We provide several examples of transpiling circuits for trapped ion qudit processors, which demonstrate potential advantages of qudits.

TI Demonstration of controlled high-dimensional quantum teleportation
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Controlled quantum teleportation (CQT), which is regarded as the prelude and backbone for a genuine quantum internet, reveals the cooperation, supervision, and control relationship among the sender, receiver, and controller in the quantum network within the simplest unit. Compared with low-dimensional counterparts, high-dimensional CQT can exhibit larger information transmission capacity and higher superiority of the controller's authority. In this article, we report a proof-of-principle experimental realization of three-dimensional (3D) CQT with a fidelity of 97.4% +/- 0.2%. To reduce the complexity of the circuit, we simulate a standard 4-qutrit CQT protocol in a 9x9-dimensional two-photon system with high-quality operations. The corresponding control powers are 48.1% +/- 0.2% for teleporting a qutrit and 52.8% +/- 0.3% for teleporting a qubit in the experiment, which are both higher than the theoretical value of control power in 2-dimensional CQT protocol (33%). The results fully demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional multi-partite entangled networks and provide new avenues for constructing complex quantum networks.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information platforms made great progress in the control of many-body entanglement and the implementation of quantum error correction, but it remains a challenge to realize both in the same setup. Here, we propose a mixture of two ultracold atomic species as a platform for universal quantum computation with long-range entangling gates, while providing a natural candidate for quantum error-correction. In this proposed setup, one atomic species realizes localized collective spins of tunable length, which form the fundamental unit of information. The second atomic species yields phononic excitations, which are used to entangle collective spins. Finally, we discuss a finite-dimensional version of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code to protect quantum information encoded in the collective spins, opening up the possibility to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in ultracold atom systems.

TI Hierarchy of quantum correlations under non-Markovian dynamics
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We investigate the dynamics of quantum correlation (QC) under the effects of reservoir memory, as a resource for quantum information and computation tasks. Quantum correlations of two-qubit systems are used for implementing quantum teleportation successfully, and for investigating how teleportation fidelity, violation of Bell-CHSH inequality, quantum steering and entanglement are connected with each other under the influence of noisy environments. Both Markovian and non-Markovian channels are considered, and it is shown that the decay and revival of correlations follow the hierarchy of quantum correlations in the state space. Noise tolerance of quantum correlations is checked for different types of unital and non-unital quantum channels, with and without memory. The quantum speed limit time (tau QSL) is investigated from the perspective of memory of quantum noise, and the corresponding dynamics is used to analyze the evolution of quantum correlations. We establish the connection between information backflow, quantum speed limit time and dynamics of quantum correlations for non-Markovian quantum channels.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and classical machine learning (ML) techniques have revolutionised numerous fields, including quantum communication. Quantum communication technologies rely heavily on quantum resources, which can be challenging to produce, control, and maintain effectively to ensure optimum performance. ML has recently been applied to quantum communication and networks to mitigate noise-induced errors and analyse quantum protocols. The authors systematically review state-of-the-art ML applications to advance theoretical and experimental central quantum communication protocols, specifically quantum key distribution, quantum teleportation, quantum secret sharing, and quantum networks. Specifically, the authors survey the progress on how ML and, more broadly, AI techniques have been applied to optimise various components of a quantum communication system. This has resulted in ultra-secure quantum communication protocols with optimised key generation rates as well as efficient and robust quantum networks. Integrating AI and ML techniques opens intriguing prospects for securing and facilitating efficient and reliable large-scale communication between multiple parties. Most significantly, large-scale communication networks have the potential to gradually develop the maturity of a future quantum internet.

Despite tremendous experimental efforts in the study of quantum error correction, to date, there has been no demonstration in the realisation of universal quantum error-correcting code, with the subsequent verification of all key features including the identification of an arbitrary physical error, the capability for transversal manipulation of the logical state and state decoding. To address this challenge, we experimentally realise the [5, 1, 3] code, the so-called smallest perfect code that permits corrections of generic single-qubit errors. In the experiment, having optimised the encoding circuit, we employ an array of superconducting qubits to realise the [5, 1, 3] code for several typical logical states including the magic state, an indispensable resource for realising non-Clifford gates. The encoded states are prepared with an average fidelity of 57.1(3)% while with a high fidelity of 98.6(1)% in the code space. Then, the arbitrary single-qubit errors introduced manually are identified by measuring the stabilisers. We further implement logical Pauli operations with a fidelity of 97.2(2)% within the code space. Finally, we realise the decoding circuit and recover the input state with an overall fidelity of 74.5 (6) %, in total with 92 gates. Our work demonstrates each key aspect of the [5, 1, 3] code and verifies the viability of experimental realisation of quantum error-correcting codes with superconducting qubits.

TI Diamond Integrated Quantum Nanophotonics: Spins, Photons and Phonons
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrated photonic devices in diamond have tremendous potential for many quantum applications, including long-distance quantum communication, quantum information processing, and quantum sensing. These devices benefit from diamond's combination of exceptional thermal, optical, and mechanical properties. Its wide electronic bandgap makes diamond an ideal host for a variety of optical active spin qubits that are key building blocks for quantum technologies. In landmark experiments, diamond spin qubits have enabled demonstrations of remote entanglement, memory-enhanced quantum communication, and multi-qubit spin registers with fault-tolerant quantum error correction, leading to the realization of multinode quantum networks. These advances put diamond at the forefront of solid-state material platforms for quantum information processing. Recent developments in diamond nanofabrication techniques provide a promising route to further scaling of these landmark experiments towards real-life quantum technologies. In this paper, we focus on the recent progress in creating integrated diamond quantum photonic devices, with particular emphasis on spin-photon interfaces, cavity optomechanical devices, and spin-phonon transduction. Finally, we discuss prospects and remaining challenges for the use of diamond in scalable quantum technologies.

TI Simple Efficient Decoders for Quantum Key Distribution Over Quantum
   Repeaters with Encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We study the implementation of quantum-key-distribution (QKD) systems over quantum-repeater infrastructures. We particularly consider quantum repeaters with encoding and compare them with probabilistic quantum repeaters. To that end, we propose two decoder structures for encoded repeaters that not only aid system performance but also make the implementation aspects easier by removing two-qubit gates from the QKD decoder. By developing several scalable numerical and analytical techniques, we then identify the resilience of the setup to various sources of error in gates, measurement modules, and initialization of the setup. We apply our techniques to three- and five-qubit repetition codes and obtain the normalized secret key generation rate per memory per second for encoded and probabilistic quantum repeaters. We quantify the regimes of operation, where one class of repeater outperforms the other, and find that there are feasible regimes of operation where encoded repeaters?based on simple three-qubit repetition codes?could offer practical advantages.

TI Satellite-Terrestrial Quantum Networks and the Global Quantum Internet
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB This article will explore the design and implementation of quantum networks in space integrated with quantum networks on Earth. We propose a three-layer approach, involving GEO and LEO satellites integrated with terrestrial ground stations. We first analyze the channel conditions between the three layers, and then highlight the key role of LEO satellites in the integrated space-terrestrial system - namely the source of entanglement distribution between specified terrestrial stations via direct downlink quantum-optical channels. The GEO satellites in the considered system are used primarily as "coordination" stations, managing and directing the LEO satellites regarding the positioning and timing of entanglement distribution. Complexity, in the form of entanglement distillation and quantum-state correction, is concentrated at the terrestrial stations, and teleportation is used as the primary quantum channel in the LEO uplinks and the inter-terrestrial channels. Although our designs are futuristic in that they assume limited quantum memory at the transceivers, we also discuss some near-term uses of our network in which no quantum memory is available.

TI Efficient qudit based scheme for photonic quantum computing
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Linear optics is a promising alternative for the realization of quantum computation protocols due to the recent advancements in integrated photonic technology. In this context, usually qubit based quantum circuits are considered, however, photonic systems naturally allow also for d-ary, i.e., qudit based, algorithms. This work investigates qudits defined by the possible photon number states of a single photon in d > 2 optical modes. We demonstrate how to construct locally optimal non-deterministic many-qudit gates using linear optics and photon number resolving detectors, and explore the use of qudit cluster states in the context of a d-ary optimization problem. We find that the qudit cluster states require less optical modes and are encoded by a fewer number of entangled photons than the qubit cluster states with similar computational capabilities. We illustrate the benefit of our qudit scheme by applying it to the k-coloring problem.

TI Boosted quantum teleportation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum teleportation has proven to be fundamental for many quantum information and communication processes. The core concept can be exploited in many tasks, from the transmission of quantum states, quantum repeaters, to quantum computing. However, for linear-optical systems, the efficiency of teleportation is directly linked to the success probability of the involved Bell-state measurement (BSM). In most implementations, this is realized by linear optics with an intrinsically limited success probability of 50%. Here, we demonstrate quantum teleportation surpassing this limit. We achieve an average fidelity of the teleported states of 0.8677 +/- 0.0024, leading to an overall acceptance rate of the teleportation of 69.71 +/- 0.75%. We obtain this boosted success probability by generating ancillary photonic states that are interfered with the Bell states. Thus, our work demonstrates the boosting BSMs in quantum-technology applications and our scheme could directly be applied to, e.g., quantum repeaters.

TI Qudit-based quantum error-correcting codes from irreducible
   representations of SU(d)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Qudits naturally correspond to multilevel quantum systems, which have the potential to enable more efficient quantum information processing, but their reliability is contingent upon quantum error-correction capabilities. In this paper, we present a general procedure for constructing error-correcting qudit codes through the irreducible representations of SU(d) for any odd integer d 3. Using the Weyl character formula and inner product of characters, we deduce the relevant branching rules, through which we identify the physical Hilbert spaces that contain valid code spaces. We then discuss how two forms of permutation invariance and the Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry of xu(d) can be exploited to simplify the construction of error-correcting codes. Finally, we use our procedure to construct an infinite class of error-correcting codes encoding a logical qudit into (d-1)2 physical qudits.

In this paper, we first introduce a scheme for distinguishing between two specific single-qubit gates. Subsequently, we present a scheme for discriminating between two particular two-qubit gates. Both of these discrimination schemes are exact quantum algorithms.

TI Characterisation of storage efficiency in magnetic field for extending
   coherence time of Pr:YSO quantum memory
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum memory (QM) is vital in enabling the storage and retrieval of photonic quantum states. Quantum repeaters that circumvent transmission losses over long distances can be realised by loading QMs inside. In this study, we implement spin-wave (SW) storage to extend storage time using Pr-based atomic frequency comb (AFC) QM. Furthermore, the generation of an AFC under a static magnetic field was investigated. The AFC QM was prepared with 2.5 mu s of the storage time and the SW storage of 50 mu s was demonstrated with and without a magnetic field. This study provides a basis for improving Pr-based AFC systems.

Key new components include quantum cells, quantum user equipment (QUEs), and hybrid resource allocation spanning classical time-frequency and quantum entanglement domains. Several application scenarios are discussed and illustrated through system design requirements for quantum key distribution, blind quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. A range of unique quantum constraints are identified, including decoherence timing, fidelity requirements, and the interplay between quantum and classical error probabilities. Protocol adaptations extend cellular connection management to incorporate entanglement generation, distribution, and handover procedures, expanding the Quantum Internet to the cellular wireless.

TI Distributing quantum correlations through local operations and classical
   resources
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Distributing quantum correlations to each node of a network is a key aspect of quantum networking. Here, we present a robust, physically motivated protocol by which global quantum correlations, as characterized by the discord, can be distributed to quantum memories using a mixed state of information carriers which possesses only classical correlations. In addition, such distribution is done using only bilocal unitary operations and projective measurements, with the degree of discord being measurement-outcome independent. We explore the scaling of the performance of the proposed protocol with the size of the network and illustrate the structure of quantum correlations that are shared by the nodes, showing its dependence on the local operations performed. Finally, we find the counterintuitive result that even more discord can be generated when the resource state undergoes correlated dephasing noise, allowing high fidelities with mixtures of the Bell basis such as Werner states.

TI Fault-tolerant qubit encoding using a spin-7/2 qudit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The implementation of error correction protocols is a central challenge in the development of practical quantum information technologies. Recently, multilevel quantum resources such as harmonic oscillators and qudits have attracted interest in this context because they offer the possibility of additional Hilbert space dimensions in a spatially compact way. Here, we propose a quantum memory, implemented on a spin -7/2 nucleus hyperfine coupled to an electron spin -1/2 qubit, which provides first -order X, Y, and Z error correction using significantly fewer quantum resources than the equivalently effective qubit-based protocols. Our encoding may be efficiently implemented in existing experimentally realized molecular electron -nuclear quantum spin systems. The strategy can be extended to higher -order error protection on higher -spin nuclei.

Information stored on quantum particles is subject to noise and interference from the environment. Quantum error-correcting codes allow the negation of these effects in order to successfully restore the original quantum information. We briefly describe the necessary quantum-mechanical background to be able to understand how quantum error correction works. We go on to construct quantum codes: firstly qubit sta-bilizer codes, then qubit non-stabilizer codes, and finally codes with a higher local dimension. We will delve into the geometry of these codes. This allows one to deduce the parameters of the code efficiently, deduce the inequivalence between codes that have the same parameters, and presents a useful tool in deducing the feasibility of certain parameters. We also include sections on quantum maximum distance separable codes and the quantum MacWilliams identities.

SO QUANTUM
AB Parallel operations in conventional computing have proven to be an essential tool for efficient and practical computation, and the story is not different for quantum computing. Indeed, there exists a large body of works that study advantages of parallel implementations of quantum gates for efficient quantum circuit implementations. Here, we focus on the recently invented efficient, arbitrary, simultaneously entangling (EASE) gates, available on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Leveraging its flexibility in selecting arbitrary pairs of qubits to be coupled with any degrees of entanglement, all in parallel, we show an n-qubit Clifford circuit can be implemented using 6 log(n) EASE gates, an n-qubit multiply-controlled NOT gate can be implemented using 3n/2 EASE gates, and an n-qubit permutation can be implemented using six EASE gates. We discuss their implications to near-term quantum chemistry simulations and the state of the art pattern matching algorithm. Given Clifford + multiply-controlled NOT gates form a universal gate set for quantum computing, our results imply efficient quantum computation by EASE gates, in general.

However, with the exponential growth of data amount and the increase of model complexity, the processing efficiency of machine learning declines rapidly. Meanwhile, the emergence of quantum computing has given rise to quantum machine learning, which relies on superposition and entanglement, exhibiting exponential optimisation compared to traditional machine learning. Therefore, in the paper, we survey the basic concepts, algorithms, applications and challenges of quantum machine learning. Concretely, we first review the basic concepts of quantum computing including qubit, quantum gates, quantum entanglement, etc.. Secondly, we in-depth discuss 5 quantum machine learning algorithms of quantum support vector machine, quantum neural network, quantum k-nearest neighbour, quantum principal component analysis and quantum k-Means algorithm. Thirdly, we conduct discussions on the applications of quantum machine learning in image recognition, drug efficacy prediction and cybersecurity. Finally, we summarise the challenges of quantum machine learning consisting of algorithm design, hardware limitations, data encoding, quantum landscapes, noise and decoherence.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Teleporting energy to remote locations is new challenge for quantum information science and technology. Developing a method for transferring local energy in laboratory systems to remote locations will enable non-trivial energy flows in quantum networks. From the perspective of quantum information engineering, we propose a method for distributing local energy to a large number of remote nodes using hyperbolic geometry. Hyperbolic networks are suitable for energy allocation in large quantum networks since the number of nodes grows exponentially. To realise long-range quantum energy teleportation (QET), we propose a hybrid method of quantum state telepotation and QET. By transmitting local quantum information through quantum teleportation and performing conditional operations on that information, QET can theoretically be realized independent of geographical distance. The method we present will provide new insights into new applications of future large-scale quantum networks and potential applications of quantum physics to information engineering.

TI One-hour coherent optical storage in an atomic frequency comb memory
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Photon loss in optical fibers prevents long-distance distribution of quantum information on the ground. Quantum repeater is proposed to overcome this problem, but the communication distance is still limited so far because of the system complexity of the quantum repeater scheme. Alternative solutions include transportable quantum memory and quantum-memory-equipped satellites, where long-lived optical quantum memories are the key components to realize global quantum communication. However, the longest storage time of the optical memories demonstrated so far is approximately 1 minute. Here, by employing a zero-first-order-Zeeman magnetic field and dynamical decoupling to protect the spin coherence in a solid, we demonstrate coherent storage of light in an atomic frequency comb memory over 1 hour, leading to a promising future for large-scale quantum communication based on long-lived solid-state quantum memories.
   Quantum memories are key components for quantum communication, but current storage times are still too short. Here, the authors use the atomic frequency comb protocol in a zero-first-order-Zeeman field to coherently store an optical pulse for an hour in a cryogenically cooled rare-earth doped crystal.

TI Shared Quantum Key Distribution Based on Asymmetric Double Quantum
   Teleportation
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum cryptography is a well-stated field within quantum applications where quantum information is used to set secure communications, authentication, and secret keys. Now used in quantum devices with those purposes, particularly Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which proposes a secret key between two parties free of effective eavesdropping, at least at a higher level than classical cryptography. The best-known quantum protocol to securely share a secret key is the BB84 one. Other protocols have been proposed as adaptations of it. Most of them are based on the quantum indeterminacy for non-orthogonal quantum states. Their security is commonly based on the large length of the key. In the current work, a BB84-like procedure for QKD based on double quantum teleportation allows the sharing of the key statement using several parties. Thus, the quantum bits of information are assembled among three parties via entanglement, instead of travelling through a unique quantum channel as in the traditional protocol. Asymmetry in the double teleportation plus post-measurement retains the secrecy in the process. Despite requiring more complex control and resources, the procedure dramatically reduces the probability of success for an eavesdropper under individual attacks, because of the ignorance of the processing times in the procedure. Quantum Bit Error Rate remains in the acceptable threshold and it becomes configurable. The article depicts the double quantum teleportation procedure, the associated control to introduce the QKD scheme, the analysis of individual attacks performed by an eavesdropper, and a brief comparison with other protocols.

TI Qubit teleportation between non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network
SO NATURE
AB Future quantum internet applications will derive their power from the ability to share quantum information across the network(1,2). Quantum teleportation allows for the reliable transfer of quantum information between distant nodes, even in the presence of highly lossy network connections(3). Although many experimental demonstrations have been performed on different quantum network platforms(4-10), moving beyond directly connected nodes has, so far, been hindered by the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint qubit readout and coherence times. Here we realize quantum teleportation between remote, non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network. The network uses three optically connected nodes based on solid-state spin qubits. The teleporter is prepared by establishing remote entanglement on the two links, followed by entanglement swapping on the middle node and storage in a memory qubit. We demonstrate that, once successful preparation of the teleporter is heralded, arbitrary qubit states can be teleported with fidelity above the classical bound, even with unit efficiency. These results are enabled by key innovations in the qubit readout procedure, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation and tailored heralding that reduces remote entanglement infidelities. Our work demonstrates a prime building block for future quantum networks and opens the door to exploring teleportation-based multi-node protocols and applications(2,11-13).

TI The tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation and
   upper bound on shareability of quantum discord
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum discord and quantum uncertainty are two important features of the quantum world. In this work, the relation between entropic uncertainty relation and the shareability of quantum discord is studied. By using tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation, an upper bound for the shareability of quantum discord among different parties of a composite system is obtained. It is also shown that, for a specific class of tripartite states, the obtained relation could be expressed as monogamy of quantum discord. Moreover, it is illustrated that the relation could be generalized and an upper bound for the shareability of quantum discord for multipartite states is derived.

TI 2022 Roadmap on integrated quantum photonics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonics will play a key role in quantum systems as they grow from few-qubit prototypes to tens of thousands of qubits. The underlying optical quantum technologies can only be realized through the integration of these components onto quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) with accompanying electronics. In the last decade, remarkable advances in quantum photonic integration have enabled table-top experiments to be scaled down to prototype chips with improvements in efficiency, robustness, and key performance metrics. These advances have enabled integrated quantum photonic technologies combining up to 650 optical and electrical components onto a single chip that are capable of programmable quantum information processing, chip-to-chip networking, hybrid quantum system integration, and high-speed communications. In this roadmap article, we highlight the status, current and future challenges, and emerging technologies in several key research areas in integrated quantum photonics, including photonic platforms, quantum and classical light sources, quantum frequency conversion, integrated detectors, and applications in computing, communications, and sensing. With advances in materials, photonic design architectures, fabrication and integration processes, packaging, and testing and benchmarking, in the next decade we can expect a transition from single- and few-function prototypes to large-scale integration of multi-functional and reconfigurable devices that will have a transformative impact on quantum information science and engineering.

TI Experimental quantum teleportation of a Toffoli gate across three
   spatially distributed parties in a photonic quantum network
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum computers may offer significant computational advantages over classical counterparts, revolutionizing the technology landscape in the near future. When networked together, the advantage of quantum computing may be further amplified, and there may emerge innovative applications. Among various active explorations on distributed quantum computing, multiqubit quantum gates between distant networked quantum computers are of particular interest because they offer operational advantages of efficiency and fidelity. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation for a Toffoli gate, which is a commonly used multiqubit quantum gate, across three spatially distributed parties within a photonic quantum network. Employing the Hofmann method, we estimate the fidelity of the teleported Toffoli gate to be at least 0.706 +/- 0.131. This successful demonstration of the quantum teleportation of a Toffoli gate constitutes a critical step toward the ultimate realization of distributed quantum computation.

TI Continuous-variable multiplexed quantum repeater networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Continuous-variable (CV) codes and their application in quantum communication have attracted increasing attention. In particular, one typical CV codes, cat-codes, has already been experimentally created using trapped atoms in cavities with relatively high fidelities. However, when these codes are used in a repeater protocol, the secret key rate (SKR) that can be extracted between two remote users is extremely low. Here we propose a quantum repeater protocol based on cat codes with a few quantum memories or graph states as additional resources. This allows us to considerably increase the SKR by several orders of magnitude. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing efficient quantum repeater systems, advancing the feasibility and performance of quantum communication over long distances.

TI Optimal Quantum Circuits for General Multi-Qutrit Quantum Computation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum circuits of a general quantum gate acting on multiple d$d$-level quantum systems play a prominent role in multi-valued quantum computation. A recursive Cartan decomposition of semi-simple unitary Lie group U(3n)$U(3<^>n)$ (arbitrary n$n$-qutrit gate) is first proposed with a rigorous proof, which completely decomposes an n$n$-qutrit gate into local and non-local operations. On this basis, an explicit quantum circuit is designed for implementing arbitrary two-qutrit gates, and the cost of the construction is 21 generalized controlled X$X$ (GCX) and controlled increment (CINC) gates less than the earlier best result of 26 GGXs. Furthermore, the program is extended to the n$n$-qutrit system, and the quantum circuit of generic n$n$-qutrit gates contained 4196 center dot 32n-4 center dot 3n-1-(n22+n4-2932)$\frac{41}{96}\cdot 3<^>{2n}-4\cdot 3<^>{n-1}-(\frac{n<^>2}{2}+\frac{n}{4}-\frac{29}{32})$ GGXs and CINCs is presented. Such asymptotically optimal structure is the best known result so far and its strength becomes more remarkable as n$n$ increases, for example, when n=5$n=5$, the program saves 7146 GCXs compared to the previous best result. In addition, concrete recursive decomposition expressions is given for each non-local operation instead of only quantum circuit diagrams.
   An optimal quantum circuit of generic two-qutrit gates is presented. This circuit requires only at most 21 generalized controlled X gates and controlled increment gates. Moreover, the quantum circuit can be extended to the synthesis of generic multi-qutrit gates, and the number of entanglement gates required for synthesis is the lowest to date. image

TI Towards a realistic model for cavity-enhanced atomic frequency comb
   quantum memories
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memory is a favorable protocol in long distance quantum communication. Putting the AFC inside an asymmetric optical cavity enhances the storage efficiency but makes the measurement of the comb properties challenging. We develop a theoretical model for cavity-enhanced AFC quantum memory that includes the effects of dispersion, and show a close alignment of the model with our own experimental results. Providing semi-quantitative agreement for estimating the efficiency and a good description of how the efficiency changes as a function of detuning, it also captures certain qualitative features of the experimental reflectivity. For comparison, we show that a theoretical model without dispersion fails dramatically to predict the correct efficiencies. Our model is a step forward to accurately estimating the created comb properties, such as the optical depth inside the cavity, and so being able to make precise predictions of the performance of the prepared cavity-enhanced AFC quantum memory.

TI Digital System Design for Quantum Error Correction Codes
SO CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB Quantum computing is a computer development technology that uses quantum mechanics to perform the operations of data and information. It is an advanced technology, yet the quantum channel is used to transmit the quantum information which is sensitive to the environment interaction. Quantum error correction is a hybrid between quantum mechanics and the classical theory of error-correcting codes that are concerned with the fundamental problem of communication, and/or information storage, in the presence of noise. The interruption made by the interaction makes transmission error during the quantum channel qubit. Hence, a quantum error correction code is needed to protect the qubit from errors that can be caused by decoherence and other quantum noise. In this paper, the digital system design of the quantum error correction code is discussed. Three designs used qubit codes, and nine-qubit codes were explained. The systems were designed and configured for encoding and decoding nine-qubit error correction codes. For comparison, a modified circuit is also designed by adding Hadamard gates.

TI Breakthrough of error correction in quantum computing

AB By using a superconducting processor, Google Quantum AI group demonstrated that a logic qubit realized by surface code of quantum error correction performs better when the number of physical qubits increases. Two surface codes to encode logic qubits for scaling are realized experimentally, with multiple cycles of quantum error correcting assisted by ancillary qubits. This result can be considered as an important step toward fault tolerant quantum computers. In this review paper, we introduce briefly the mechanism of quantum error correction. As an example, Shor's nine-qubit error correction code is explained. Then, the new experiments of Google quantum AI group are introduced to show their significance in scaling. The advances in other quantum error correction experiments are also reviewed. Finally, the development of quantum computers is discussed.

SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Whilst quantum computing has recently taken great leaps ahead, the development of quantum memories has decidedly lagged behind. Quantum memories are essential devices in the quantum technology palette and are needed for intermediate storage of quantum bit states and as quantum repeaters in long-distance quantum communication. Current quantum memories operate at cryogenic, mostly sub-Kelvin temperatures and require extensive and costly peripheral hardware. It is demonstrated that ensembles of weakly coupled molecular spins show long coherence times and can be used to store microwave pulses of arbitrary phase. These studies exploit strong coupling of the spin ensemble to special 3D microwave resonators. Most importantly, these systems operate at room temperature.

TI Quantum teleportation with dissimilar quantum dots over a hybrid quantum
   network
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Photonic quantum information processing in metropolitan quantum networks lays the foundation for cloud quantum computing, secure communication, and the realization of a global quantum internet. This paradigm shift requires on-demand and high-rate generation of flying qubits and their quantum state teleportation over long distances. Despite the last decade has witnessed an impressive progress in the performances of deterministic photon sources, the exploitation of distinct quantum emitters to implement a quantum relay among distant parties has remained elusive. Here, we overcome this challenge by using dissimilar quantum dots whose electronic and optical properties are engineered by light-matter interaction, multi-axial strain and magnetic fields so as to make them suitable for the teleportation of polarization qubits. This is demonstrated in a quantum network harnessing both fiber connections and a 270 m free-space optical link connecting two buildings of the Sapienza University campus in Rome. The protocol exploits GPS-assisted synchronization, ultra-fast single photon detectors as well as stabilization systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The achieved teleportation state fidelity reaches up to 82 +/- 1%, above the classical limit by more than 10 standard deviations. Our field demonstration of all-photonic quantum teleportation opens a new route to implement solid-state based quantum relays and builds the foundation for practical quantum networks.

TI Quantum Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Fundamentals, Algorithms,
   Techniques, and Real-World Applications
SO MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
AB Quantum computing, with its foundational principles of superposition and entanglement, has the potential to provide significant quantum advantages, addressing challenges that classical computing may struggle to overcome. As data generation continues to grow exponentially and technological advancements accelerate, classical machine learning algorithms increasingly face difficulties in solving complex real-world problems. The integration of classical machine learning with quantum information processing has led to the emergence of quantum machine learning, a promising interdisciplinary field. This work provides the reader with a bottom-up view of quantum circuits starting from quantum data representation, quantum gates, the fundamental quantum algorithms, and more complex quantum processes. Thoroughly studying the mathematics behind them is a powerful tool to guide scientists entering this domain and exploring their connection to quantum machine learning. Quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, and the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm are discussed in detail. Furthermore, real-world implementations of quantum machine learning and quantum deep learning are presented in fields such as healthcare, bioinformatics and finance. These implementations aim to enhance time efficiency and reduce algorithmic complexity through the development of more effective quantum algorithms. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of these algorithms is crucial.

TI Research progress of measurement-based quantum computation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Compared with the quantum gate circuit model, the measurement-based quantum computing model provides an alternative way to realize universal quantum computation, and relevant contents have been greatly enriched after nearly two decades of research and exploration. In this article, we review the research history and status of the measurement-based quantum computing model. First, we briefly introduce the basic theories of this model, including the concept and working principles of quantum graph states as resource states, the model's computational universality and classical simulation methods, and relevant applications in the field of quantum information processing such as designing quantum algorithms and fault-tolerant error correction schemes. Then, from the perspective of quantum physical properties, which include the specific roles of quantum entanglement, contextuality, quantum correlations, symmetry-protected topological order, and quantum phases of matter as computing resources, the close relationship between measurement-based quantum computing model and quantum many-body system is presented. For example, a type of measurement-based computing model for exploiting quantum correlations can show a quantum advantage over the classical local hidden variable models, or certain symmetry-protected topological order states enable the universal quantum computation to be conducted by using only the measurements of single-qubit Pauli operators. Next, a variety of different technical routes and experimental progress of realizing the measurement-based quantum computing model are summarized, such as photonic systems, ion traps, superconducting circuits, etc. These achievements in various physical areas lay the foundation for future scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computers. Finally, we discuss and prospect the future research directions in this field thereby inspiring readers to further study and explore the relevant subjects.

TI Global Positioning Scheme via Quantum Teleportation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum teleportation scheme is undoubtedly an inspiring theoretical discovery as an amazing application of quantum physics, which was experimentally realized several years later. For the purpose of quantum communication via this scheme, an entangled ancillary pair shared by Alice and Bob is the essential ingredient, and a quantum memory in Bob's system is necessary for him to keep the quantum state until the classical message from Alice arrives. Yet, the quantum memory remains a challenge in both technology and rationale. Here we show that quantum teleportation provides fresh perspectives in terms of an alternative scheme for global positioning system. Referring to fixed locations of Bob and Charlie, Alice can determine her relative position by comparing quantum states before and after teleporting around via Bob and Charlie successively. This may open up a new scene in the stage of the application of quantum physics without quantum memories.

TI Demonstration of Fault-Tolerant Steane Quantum Error Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Encoding information redundantly using quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes allows one to overcome the inherent sensitivity to noise in quantum computers to ultimately achieve large-scale quantum computation. The Steane QEC method involves preparing an auxiliary logical qubit of the same QEC code as used for the data register. The data and auxiliary registers are then coupled with a logical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, enabling a measurement of the auxiliary register to reveal the error syndrome. This study presents the implementation of multiple rounds of fault-tolerant (FT) Steane QEC on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Various QEC codes are employed and the results are compared to a previous experimental approach utilizing flag qubits. Our experimental findings show improved logical fidelities for Steane QEC and accompanying numerical simulations indicate an even larger performance advantage for quantum processors limited by entangling-gate errors. This establishes experimental Steane QEC as a competitive paradigm for FT quantum computing.

TI Multi-party quantum key distribution protocol in quantum network
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This study proposes a measurement property of graph states and applies it to design a mediated multiparty quantum key distribution (M-MQKD) protocol for a repeater-based quantum network in a restricted quantum environment. The protocol enables remote classical users, who cannot directly transmit qubits, to securely distribute a secret key with the assistance of potentially dishonest quantum repeaters. Classical users only require two quantum capabilities, while quantum repeaters handle entanglement transmission through single-photon measurements. The one-way transmission approach eliminates the need for additional defenses against quantum Trojan horse attacks, reducing maintenance costs compared to round-trip or circular transmission methods. As a result, the M-MQKD protocol is lightweight and easy to implement. The study also evaluates the security of the protocol and demonstrates its practicality through quantum network simulations.

TI Targeting molecular quantum memory with embedded error correction
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The implementation of a quantum computer requires both to protect information from environmental noise and to implement quantum operations efficiently. Achieving this by a fully fault-tolerant platform, in which quantum gates are implemented within quantum-error corrected units, poses stringent requirements on the coherence and control of such hardware. A more feasible architecture could consist of connected memories, that support error-correction by enhancing coherence, and processing units, that ensure fast manipulations. We present here a supramolecular {Cr7Ni}-Cu system which could form the elementary unit of this platform, where the electronic spin 1/2 of {Cr7Ni} provides the processor and the naturally isolated nuclear spin 3/2 of the Cu ion is used to encode a logical unit with embedded quantum error-correction. We demonstrate by realistic simulations that microwave pulses allow us to rapidly implement gates on the processor and to swap information between the processor and the quantum memory. By combining the storage into the Cu nuclear spin with quantum error correction, information can be protected for times much longer than the processor coherence.

TI Remote and controlled quantum teleportation network of the polarization
   squeezed state
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum teleportation is a building block in quantum computation and quantum communication. The continuous-variable polarization squeezed state is a key resource in quantum networks, offering advantages for long-distance distribution and direct interfacing of quantum nodes. Although polarization squeezed state has been generated and distributed between remote users, it is a long-standing goal to implement controlled quantum teleportation of the polarization squeezed state with multiple remote users. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to teleport a polarization squeezed state among multiple remote users under control. The polarization state is transferred between different remote quantum networks, and the controlled quantum teleportation of the polarization state can be implemented in one quantum network involving multiple remote users. The results show that such a controlled quantum teleportation can be realized with 36 users through about 6-km free-space or fiber quantum channels, where the fidelity of 0.352 is achieved beyond the classical limit of 0.349 with an input squeezing variance of 0.25. This scheme provides a direct reference for the experimental implementation of remote and controlled quantum teleportation of polarization states, thus enabling more teleportation-based quantum network protocols.

TI Quantum-Memory-Enhanced Preparation of Nonlocal Graph States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Graph states are an important class of multipartite entangled states. Previous experimental generation of graph states and in particular the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states in linear optics quantum information schemes is subjected to an exponential decay in efficiency versus the system size, which limits its large-scale applications in quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate an efficient scheme to prepare graph states with only a polynomial overhead using long-lived atomic quantum memories. We generate atom-photon entangled states in two atomic ensembles asynchronously, retrieve the stored atomic excitations only when both sides succeed, and further project them into a four-photon GHZ state. We measure the fidelity of this GHZ state and further demonstrate its applications in the violation of Bell-type inequalities and in quantum cryptography. Our work demonstrates the prospect of efficient generation of multipartite entangled states in large-scale distributed systems with applications in quantum information processing and metrology.

AB Multi-core quantum computing has been identified as a solution to the scalability problem of quantum computing. However, interconnecting quantum chips is not trivial, as quantum communications have their share of quantum weirdness: quantum decoherence and the no-cloning theorem makes transferring qubits a harsh challenge, where every extra nanosecond counts and retransmission is simply impossible. In this paper, we present our first steps towards thorough modeling of quantum communications for multicore quantum computers, which may be considered as a middle point between the well-known paradigms of Quantum Internet and Network-on-Chip. In particular, we stress the deep entanglement that exists between latency and error rates in quantum computing, and how this affects the quantum network design for this scenario. Moreover, we show the concomitant trade-off between computation and communication resources for a set of parameters out of state-of-the-art experimental research. The observed behavior lets us foresee the potential of multi-core quantum architectures.

TI Universal Quantum Multi-Qubit Entangling Gates with Auxiliary Spaces
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Universal quantum entangling gates are a crucial building block in the large-scale quantum computation and quantum communication, and it is an important task to find simple ways to implement them. Here an effective quantum circuit for the implementation of a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is constructed by introducing a non-computational quantum state in the auxiliary space. Furthermore, the method is extended to the construction of a general n-control-qubit Toffoli gate with (2n-1)$(2n-1)$ qubit-qudit gates and (2n-2)$(2n-2)$ single-qudit gates. Based on the presented quantum circuits, the polarization CNOT and Toffoli gates with linear optics are designed by operating on the spatial-mode degree of freedom of photons. The proposed optical schemes can be achieved with a higher success probability and no extra auxiliary photons are needed.

TI "Quantum memory" quantum computers and noiseless phton echoes*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB One of the most important applications of quantum computing is to crack classical cryptosystem. Previousstudies showed that the number of qubits required to crack the widely used 2048-bit RSA cipher is about 20million, which is far beyond the current technology for quantum computing. Recently, E. Gouzien and N.Sangouard of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission proposed a quantum computingarchitecture based on a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits and a three-dimensional multimodequantum memory. They showed that only 13k qubits are required to crack a 2048-bit RSA integer with the helpof a long-lived quantum memory with 28 million spatial modes and 45 temporal modes. Their results clearlydemonstrate the values of quantum memories in quantum computing and provide an alternative approach forbuilding practically useful quantum computers. Quantum computers require quantum memories to work atmicrowave band, which remains an outstanding challenge. Based on a detailed analysis of atomic radiationsduring the quantum storage process, we recently proposed a noiseless-photon-echo protocol which cansuccessfully eliminate the spontaneous emission noise in photon echoes. This protocol is expected to furtherenable microwave quantum storage and the construction of "quantum memory" quantum computers.

TI Break-even point of the phase-flip error correcting code
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this theoretical study, we explore the use of quantum code-based memories to enhance the lifetime of qubits and exceed the break-even point, which is critical for the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Specifically, we investigate the quantum phase-flip repetition code as a quantum memory and theoretically demonstrate that it can preserve arbitrary quantum information longer than the lifetime of a single idle qubit in a dephasing-time-limited system, e.g. in semiconductor qubits. Our circuit-based analytical calculations show the efficiency of the phase-flip code as a quantum memory in the presence of relaxation, dephasing, and faulty quantum gates. Moreover, we identify the optimal repetition number of quantum error correction cycles required to reach the break-even point by considering the gate error probabilities of current platforms for quantum computing. Our results provide guidelines for developing quantum memories in semiconductor quantum devices.

We demonstrate operation at the single-photon level by storing weak coherent states with an efficiency up to (40 + 2)% and a signal-to-noise ratio of 14 for an input photon number of 0.42 photons per pulse. We also investigated the enhancement of the incoherent noise due to the impedance-matched cavity and characterized the quantum memory performance, showing a two-way transfer from excited to spin states and back of up to 83%. Finally, we confirmed the quantum nature of our memory by storing nonclassical states of light, i.e., a heralded single photon from a nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and achieved nonclassical correlations between the heralding and the stored-and-retrieved photon. These results demonstrate that impedance-matched AFC spin-wave quantum memories with on-demand readout can be used for experiments involving the storage of photonic quantum states. They also open the door to solid-state on-demand quantum memories with very high efficiencies, serving as a key resource for quantum networks and quantum repeaters.

   quantum communication
SO SECURITY AND PRIVACY
AB This research investigates the optimization of quantum key distribution for secure quantum communication. The paper conducts a systematic analysis of quantum error rates, transmission time, error correction rates, and the correlation between distance, time, and noise in quantum communication systems. The results reveal an inverse relationship between transmission time and distance, and demonstrate that quantum error rates are dependent on quantum noise. The research presents improved formulations for calculating the probability of success in quantum systems, taking into account the dynamic nature of success in quantum communication processes. The findings have significant implications for optimizing quantum communication channels and providing insights into strategies for enhancing reliability and mitigating errors.

AB Measurement is a fundamental operation in quantum computing and has many important use cases in quantum algorithms. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the basic measurement operations in quantum computing and represents a selected set of their applications in quantum algorithms. Our goal is to provide one of the first algorithmic overviews of measurement processes in quantum computing. From the quantum information-theoretical perspective, measurements are either a method to access the result of a quantum computation or a technique to modify a quantum state. We also identify measurement-based methods to solve quantum computational challenges, such as error mitigation and circuit cutting. We discuss three main categories of measurements: performing measurements in static quantum circuits, modifying the quantum state in dynamic quantum circuits via measurements, and addressing challenges in quantum computing with measurements. Based on the reviewed topics, the measurement operations are frequently not at the center of the quantum algorithm design. However, the most novel and error-prone quantum algorithms will likely require sophisticated measurement schemes. Thus, the central message of this article is to broaden the view of measurement operations and highlight their importance at every level of quantum algorithm design.

TI Quantum Information Scrambling on a Superconducting Qutrit Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The dynamics of quantum information in strongly interacting systems, known as quantum information scrambling, has recently become a common thread in our understanding of black holes, transport in exotic non-Fermi liquids, and many-body analogs of quantum chaos. To date, verified experimental implementations of scrambling have focused on systems composed of two-level qubits. Higher-dimensional quantum systems, however, may exhibit different scrambling modalities and are predicted to saturate conjectured speed limits on the rate of quantum information scrambling. We take the first steps toward accessing such phenomena, by realizing a quantum processor based on superconducting qutrits (three-level quantum systems). We demonstrate the implementation of universal two-qutrit scrambling operations and embed them in a five-qutrit quantum teleportation protocol. Measured teleportation fidelities F-avg = 0.568 +/- 0.001 confirm the presence of scrambling even in the presence of experimental imperfections and decoherence. Our teleportation protocol, which connects to recent proposals for studying traversable wormholes in the laboratory, demonstrates how quantum technology that encodes information in higher-dimensional systems can exploit a larger and more connected state space to achieve the resource efficient encoding of complex quantum circuits.

TI Massively-multiplexed generation of Bell-type entanglement using a
   quantum memory
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum communications and distributed quantum computing can only be realized by efficient and robust entanglement generation between the communicating parties. The authors present and experimental demonstration of a wavevector multiplexed quantum memory from which Bell-type states are deterministically generated and have potential for use with quantum repeaters.
   High-rate generation of hybrid photon-matter entanglement remains a fundamental building block of quantum network architectures enabling protocols such as quantum secure communication or quantum distributed computing. While a tremendous effort has been made to overcome technological constraints limiting the efficiency and coherence times of current systems, an important complementary approach is to employ parallel and multiplexed architectures. Here we follow this approach experimentally demonstrating the generation of bipartite polarization-entangled photonic states across more than 500 modes, with a programmable delay for the second photon enabled by qubit storage in a wavevector-multiplexed cold-atomic quantum memory. We demonstrate Clauser, Horne, Shimony, Holt inequality violation by over 3 standard deviations, lasting for at least 45 mu s storage time for half of the modes. The ability to shape hybrid entanglement between the polarization and wavevector degrees of freedom provides not only multiplexing capabilities but also brings prospects for novel protocols.

TI Key reconciliation protocol for quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In quantum cryptography, secret communications are delivered through a quantum channel. One of the most important breakthroughs in quantum cryptography has been the quantum key distribution (QKD). This process enables two distant parties to share secure communications based on physical laws. However, eavesdroppers can still interrupt the communication. To overcome this, we propose a different way to detect the presence of Eve through the polynomial interpolation technique. This technique also allows us for key verification. This approach prevents the receiver as well as the intruder from discovering the sender's fundamental basis. To fully utilize IBM quantum computers' quantum computing capabilities, this paper attempts to show % error against alpha (strength of eavesdropping) and the impact of noise on the success probability of the desired key bits. Furthermore, the success probability under depolarizing noise is explained for different qubit counts. In the enhanced QKD protocol, using polynomial interpolation for reconciliation shows a 50% probability of successful key generation. This is even when the noise is increased to the maximum capacity.

TI One-shot quantum error correction of classical and quantum information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is one of the central concepts in quantum information science and also has wide applications in fundamental physics. The capacity theorems provide solid foundations of QEC. We here provide a general and highly applicable form of capacity theorem for both classical and quantum information, i.e., hybrid information, with the assistance of a limited resource of entanglement in a one-shot scenario, which covers broader situations than the existing ones. Harnessing the wide applicability of the theorem, we show that a demonstration of QEC by short random quantum circuits is feasible and that QEC is intrinsic in quantum chaotic systems. Our results bridge the progress in quantum information theory, near-future quantum technology, and fundamental physics.

TI An Evolutionary Pathway for the Quantum Internet Relying on Secure
   Classical Repeaters
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB Until quantum repeaters become mature, quantum networks remain restricted either to limited areas of directly connected nodes or to nodes connected to a common node. We circumvent this limitation by conceiving quantum networks using secure classical repeaters combined with the quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) principle, which is a compelling form of quantum communication that directly transmits information over a quantum channel. The final component of this promising solution is our classical quantum-resistant algorithm. Explicitly, in these networks, the ciphertext gleaned from a quantum-resistant algorithm is transmitted using QSDC along the nodes, where it is read out by one node and then transmitted to the next node. At the repeaters, the information is protected by our quantum-resistant algorithm, which is secure even in the face of a quantum computer. Hence, our solution offers secure end-to-end communication across the entire network, since it is capable of both eavesdropping detection and prevention in the emerging quantum Internet. It is compatible with operational networks, and will enjoy the compelling services of the popular Internet, including authentication. Hence, it smoothens the transition from the classical Internet to the quantum Internet (Qinternet) by following a gradual evolutionary upgrade. It will act as an alternative network in quantum computing networks in the future. We have presented the first experimental demonstration of a secure classical-repeater-based hybrid quantum network constructed by a serial concatenation of an optical fiber and free-space communication link. In conclusion, secure repeater networks may indeed be constructed using existing technology and continue to support a seamless evolutionary pathway to the future Qinternet of quantum computers.

TI Qutrit-based semi-quantum key distribution protocol
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB This article provides the unconditional security of a semi quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocol based on 3-dimensional quantum states. By deriving a lower bound for the key rate, in the asymptotic scenario, as a function of the quantum channel's noise, we find that this protocol has improved secret key rate with much more tolerance for noise compared to the previous 2-dimensional SQKD protocol. Our results highlight that, similar to the fully quantum key distribution protocol, increasing the dimension of the system can increase the noise tolerance in the semi-quantum key distribution, as well.

AB The vacuum beam guide (VBG) presents a completely different solution for quantum channels to overcome the limitations of existing fiber and satellite technologies for long-distance quantum communication. With an array of aligned lenses spaced kilometers apart, the VBG offers ultrahigh transparency over a wide range of optical wavelengths. With realistic parameters, the VBG can outperform the best fiber by 3 orders of magnitude in terms of attenuation rate. Consequently, the VBG can enable long-range quantum communication over thousands of kilometers with quantum channel capacity beyond 1013 qubit/ sec, orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art quantum satellite communication rate. Remarkably, without relying on quantum repeaters, the VBG can provide a ground-based, low-loss, highbandwidth quantum channel that enables novel distributed quantum information applications for computing, communication, and sensing.

TI Quantum Network Security: A Quantum Firewall Approach
SO INFOCOMMUNICATIONS JOURNAL
AB The increasing prominence of quantum networks has necessitated the exploration of their vulnerabilities and the development of effective countermeasures. This paper investigates the potential threats faced by quantum networks, particularly focusing on the exploitation of quantum TCP-three-way handshake connections. To mitigate these attacks, a novel approach involving the implementation of a quantum firewall is proposed. The paper emphasizes that the security of quantum networks is primarily reliant on pre-established agreements for creating quantum entanglement among devices, which inherently limits external attacks. However, it highlights the adverse impact of quantum assaults on network availability due to the consumption of quantum bits required for establishing connections. By leveraging unique node identification and coherence time of quantum memory, the proposed quantum firewall effectively mitigates the effects of attacks while ensuring network availability. Through this security strategy, the paper demonstrates the robustness of the quantum firewall in safeguarding the integrity and operation of quantum networks against potential threats.

By using these multilinear polynomials, we propose a geometric representation for entanglement states. In particular, we show that Bell's states are associated with non-factorable real multilinear polynomial, which can be represented geometrically by three-dimensional surfaces. Furthermore, in this framework, we show that a quantum circuit can be seen as a geometric transformations of plane geometry. This phenomenon is analogous to gravity, where matter curves space-time. In addition, we show an analogy between quantum teleportation and operations involving multilinear polynomials.

Since the operation of quantum systems is prone to the deleterious effects of decoherence, which manifests itself in terms of bit-flips, phase-flips, or both, the pivotal subject of quantum error mitigation is reviewed both in the presence and absence of quantum coding. The state of the art, knowledge gaps, and future evolution of quantum machine learning (QML) are also discussed, followed by a discourse on quantum radar systems and briefly hypothesizing about the feasibility of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in the quantum domain (QD).

TI Quantum Error Correction with Quantum Autoencoders
SO QUANTUM
AB Active quantum error correction is a central ingredient to achieve robust quantum proces-sors. In this paper we investigate the potential of quantum machine learning for quantum er-ror correction in a quantum memory. Specif-ically, we demonstrate how quantum neural networks, in the form of quantum autoen-coders, can be trained to learn optimal strate-gies for active detection and correction of er-rors, including spatially correlated computa-tional errors as well as qubit losses. We high-light that the denoising capabilities of quan-tum autoencoders are not limited to the pro-tection of specific states but extend to the entire logical codespace. We also show that quantum neural networks can be used to dis-cover new logical encodings that are optimally adapted to the underlying noise. Moreover, we find that, even in the presence of moder-ate noise in the quantum autoencoders them-selves, they may still be successfully used to perform beneficial quantum error correction and thereby extend the lifetime of a logical qubit.

TI A programmable qudit-based quantum processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Qudit-based quantum devices can outperform qubit-based ones, but a programmable qudit-based quantum computing device is still missing. Here, the authors fill this gap using a programmable silicon photonic chip employing ququart-based encoding, showing the scaling advantages compared to the qubit counterpart.
   Controlling and programming quantum devices to process quantum information by the unit of quantum dit, i.e., qudit, provides the possibilities for noise-resilient quantum communications, delicate quantum molecular simulations, and efficient quantum computations, showing great potential to enhance the capabilities of qubit-based quantum technologies. Here, we report a programmable qudit-based quantum processor in silicon-photonic integrated circuits and demonstrate its enhancement of quantum computational parallelism. The processor monolithically integrates all the key functionalities and capabilities of initialisation, manipulation, and measurement of the two quantum quart (ququart) states and multi-value quantum-controlled logic gates with high-level fidelities. By reprogramming the configuration of the processor, we implemented the most basic quantum Fourier transform algorithms, all in quaternary, to benchmark the enhancement of quantum parallelism using qudits, which include generalised Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms, quaternary phase estimation and fast factorization algorithms. The monolithic integration and high programmability have allowed the implementations of more than one million high-fidelity preparations, operations and projections of qudit states in the processor. Our work shows an integrated photonic quantum technology for qudit-based quantum computing with enhanced capacity, accuracy, and efficiency, which could lead to the acceleration of building a large-scale quantum computer.

TI Mapping the Patent Landscape of Quantum Technologies: Patenting Trends,
   Innovation and Policy Implications
SO IIC-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMPETITION LAW
AB Recent technical breakthroughs underscore the potential of second generation (2G) quantum technologies including quantum simulation, quantum sensing and metrology, quantum computation, and quantum communication. Patenting trends of such technologies are an indicator of the pace of innovation at the invention stage. Empirical studies looking at the real-world patenting activity can provide valuable evidence to help assess and guide policy proposals related to intellectual property rights (IPRs), innovation and governance of quantum technologies. In this paper, we report the results of a study designed to map the patent landscape of quantum technologies. We evaluate the patenting trends over the last 20 years to determine: (1) the growth of quantum technology patents, (2) the technology breakdown and classification of patenting activity, (3) the choice of priority patent office, (4) the types of patent claims and strategies, (5) the subject matter of recently awarded patents, (6) the top patent owners, (7) the dominant patent portfolios, and (8) the geographical distribution of this patent activity. Based on our patent landscape study, we critically examine if patent protection is posing a problem in the technical field of quantum technologies. We show how quantum patent disclosure is moving us to an emerging quantum information commons, gradually reinforcing the public domain. Additionally, we examine the innovation and policy implications of these results in the broader context of quantum innovation initiatives, market competition, the patent/trade secret interface, and governance of quantum technologies.

TI Efficient Optimization of Cutoffs in Quantum Repeater Chains
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum communication enables the implementation of tasks that are unachievable with classical resources. However, losses on the communication channel preclude the direct long-distance transmission of quantum information in many relevant scenarios. In principle, quantum repeaters allow one to overcome losses. However, realistic hardware parameters make long-distance quantum communication a challenge in practice. For instance, in many protocols an entangled pair is generated that needs to wait in quantum memory until the generation of an additional pair. During this waiting time the first pair decoheres, impacting the quality of the final entanglement produced. At the cost of a lower rate, this effect can be mitigated by imposing a cutoff condition. For instance, a maximum storage time for entanglement after which it is discarded. In this article, we optimize the cutoffs for quantum repeater chains. First, we develop an algorithm for computing the probability distribution of the waiting time and fidelity of entanglement produced by repeater chain protocols which include a cutoff. Then, we use the algorithm to optimize cutoffs in order to maximize the secret-key rate between the end nodes of the repeater chain. In this article, we find that the use of the optimal cutoff extends the parameter regime for which secret key can be generated and, moreover, significantly increases the secret-key rate for a large range of parameters.

TI Optical investigations of coherence and relaxation dynamics of a
   thulium-doped yttrium gallium garnet crystal at sub-kelvin temperatures
   for optical quantum memory
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Rare-earth ion-doped crystals are of great interest for quantum memories, a central component in future quantum repeaters. To assess the promise of 1 % Tm3+-doped yttrium gallium garnet (Tm:YGG), we report measurements of optical coherence and energy-level lifetimes of its 3H 6 <-> 3 H4 transition at a temperature of around 500 mK and various magnetic fields. Using spectral hole burning (SHB), we find hyperfine ground-level (Zeeman level) lifetimes of several minutes at magnetic fields of less than 1000 G. We also measure coherence time exceeding one millisecond using two-pulse photon echoes. Three-pulse photon echo and SHB measurements reveal that due to spectral diffusion, the effective coherence time reduces to a few mu s over a timescale of around two hundred seconds. Finally, temporal and frequency-multiplexed storage of optical pulses using the atomic frequency comb protocol is demonstrated. Our results suggest Tm:YGG to be promising for multiplexed photonic quantum memory for quantum repeaters.

TI Quantum repeater using two-mode squeezed states and atomic noiseless
   amplifiers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We perform a theoretical investigation into how a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, which has undergone photon loss, can be stored and purified using noiseless amplification with a collection of solid-state qubits. The proposed method may be used to probabilistically increase the entanglement between the two parties sharing the state. The proposed amplification step is similar in structure to a set of quantum scissors. However, in this work the amplification step is realized by a state transfer from an optical mode to a set of solid-state qubits, which act as a quantum memory. We explore two different applications, the generation of entangled many-qubit registers and the construction of quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum key distribution.

TI Frequency-Multiplexed Storage and Distribution of Narrowband Telecom
   Photon Pairs over a 10-km Fiber Link with Long-Term System Stability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ability to transmit quantum states over long distances is a fundamental requirement of the quantum internet and is reliant upon quantum repeaters. Quantum repeaters involve entangled photon sources that emit and deliver photonic entangled states at high rates and quantum memories that can temporarily store quantum states. Improvement of the entanglement distribution rate is essential for quantum repeaters, and multiplexing is expected to be a breakthrough. However, limited studies exist on multiplexed photon sources and their coupling with a multiplexed quantum memory. Here, we demonstrate the storing of a frequency-multiplexed two-photon source at telecommunication wavelengths in a quantum memory accepting visible wavelengths via wavelength conversion after 10-km distribution. To achieve this, quantum systems are connected via wavelength conversion with a frequency-stabilization system and a noise-reduction system. The developed system is stably operated for more than 42 h. Therefore, it can be applied to quantum repeater systems comprising various physical systems requiring long-term system stability.

AB Storing quantum information for an extended period of time is essential for running quantum algo-rithms with low errors. Currently, superconducting quantum memories have coherence times of a few milliseconds, and surpassing this performance has remained an outstanding challenge. In this work, we report a single-photon qubit encoded in a novel superconducting cavity with a coherence time of 34 ms, representing an order of magnitude improvement compared to previous demonstrations. We use this long-lived quantum memory to store a Schrodinger cat state with a record size of 1024 photons, indicating the cavity's potential for bosonic quantum error correction.

TI Multiuser Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks Using Multipath
   Routing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum networks facilitate numerous applications including secure communication and distributed quantum computation by performing entanglement distribution. For some multiuser quantum applications, access to a shared multipartite state is required. We consider the problem of designing protocols for distributing such states, at an increased rate. For this, we propose three protocols that leverage multipath routing to increase the distribution rate for multiuser applications. The protocols are evaluated on quantum networks with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) constraints, including limited quantum memories and probabilistic entanglement generation. Simulation results show that the developed protocols achieve an exponential increase in the distribution rate of multipartite states compared to single-path routing techniques, with a maximum increase of four orders of magnitude for the cases studied. Furthermore, the relative increase in the distribution rate was also found to improve for larger sets of users. When the protocols were tested in scaled-down real-world topologies, it was found that a topology had a significant effect on the multipartite state distribution rates achieved by the protocols. Finally, we found that the benefits of multipath routing are maximum for short quantum memory decoherence times and intermediate values of entanglement generation probability. Hence, the protocols developed can benefit NISQ quantum network control and design.

TI Nuclear spin-wave quantum register for a solid-state qubit
SO NATURE
AB Solid-state nuclear spins surrounding individual, optically addressable qubits(1,2) are a crucial resource for quantum networks(3-6), computation(7-11) and simulation(12). Although hosts with sparse nuclear spin baths are typically chosen to mitigate qubit decoherence(13), developing coherent quantum systems in nuclear-spin-rich hosts enables exploration of a much broader range of materials for quantum information applications. The collective modes of these dense nuclear spin ensembles provide a natural basis for quantum storage; however, using them as a resource for single-spin qubits has thus far remained elusive. Here, by using a highly coherent, optically addressed( 171)Yb(3+) qubit doped into a nuclear-spin-rich yttrium orthovanadate crystal(15), we develop a robust quantum control protocol to manipulate the multi-level nuclear spin states of neighbouring(51)V(5+ )lattice ions. Via a dynamically engineered spin-exchange interaction, we polarize this nuclear spin ensemble, generate collective spin excitations, and subsequently use them to implement a quantum memory. We additionally demonstrate preparation and measurement of maximally entangled Yb-171-V-51 Bell states. Unlike conventional, disordered nuclear-spin-based quantum memories(16-24), our platform is deterministic and reproducible, ensuring identical quantum registers for all Yb-171(3+) qubits. Our approach provides a framework for utilizing the complex structure of dense nuclear spin baths, paving the way towards building large-scale quantum networks using single rare-earth ion qubits(15,25-28).

TI Deterministic Bell state measurement with a single quantum memory
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglements serve as a resource for any quantum information system and are deterministically generated or swapped by a joint measurement called complete Bell state measurement (BSM). The determinism arises from a quantum nondemolition measurement of two coupled qubits with the help of readout ancilla, which inevitably requires extra physical qubits. We here demonstrate a deterministic and complete BSM with only a nitrogen atom in a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a quantum memory without relying on any carbon isotopes, which are the extra qubits, by exploiting electron-nitrogen (14N) double qutrits at a zero magnetic field. The degenerate logical qubits within the subspace of qutrits on the electron and nitrogen spins are holonomically controlled by arbitrarily polarized microwave and radiofrequency pulses via zero-field-split states as the ancilla, thus enabling the complete BSM deterministically. Since the system works under an isotope-free and field-free environment, the demonstration paves the way to realize high-fidelity quantum repeaters for long-haul quantum networks and quantum interfaces for large-scale distributed quantum computers.

TI Dark path holonomic qudit computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation is a method used to implement high-speed quantum gates with non-Abelian geometric phases associated with paths in state space. Due to their noise tolerance, these phases can be used to construct error resilient quantum gates. We extend the holonomic dark path qubit scheme in [M.-Z. Ai et al., Fundam. Res. 2, 661 (2022)] to qudits. Specifically, we demonstrate one- and two-qudit universality by using the dark path technique. Explicit qutrit (d = 3) gates are demonstrated and the scaling of the number of loops with the dimension d is addressed. This scaling is linear and we show how any diagonal qudit gate can be implemented efficiently in any dimension.

AB Quantum mechanics with radically novel properties: such as superposition, entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem, has begun to open up Quantum Computation beyond the scope of Classical Computation. In recent years, quantum technology has seen tremendous leaps both in academic research and commercial exploration. Quantum computation has started to find applications in many more new domains every day, from disrupting modern cryptography to enabling unconventional security techniques, from quantum chemistry to physical simulations, and from quantum machine learning to financial optimization. This paper first provides the conceptual groundings of quantum computation and explores blind quantum computation, a one-of-its-kind sub-categorization of quantum computing active research. The use of Blind Quantum Computation in Quantum Cryptography is elaborated in detail. Finally concludes with highlights of the applicability of the subject. The paper is an easy-to-follow guide introducing the research trends and open challenges for the new researcher in follow-up on the field.

TI Generalized Quantum Repeater Graph States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB All-photonic quantum repeaters are essential for establishing long-range quantum entanglement. Within repeater nodes, reliably performing entanglement swapping is a key component of scalable quantum communication. To tackle the challenge of probabilistic Bell state measurement in linear optics, which often leads to information loss, various approaches have been proposed to ensure the loss tolerance of distributing a single ebit. We have generalized previous work regarding repeater graph states with elaborate connectivity, enabling the efficient establishment of exploitable ebits at a finite rate with high probability. We demonstrate that our new scheme significantly outperforms the previous work with much flexibility and discuss the generation overhead of such resource states. These findings offer new insights into the scalability and reliability of loss-tolerant quantum networks.

TI Robust and Scalable Quantum Repeaters Using Machine Learning
SO INFORMATION
AB Quantum repeaters are integral systems to quantum computing and quantum communication as they allow the transfer of information between qubits, particularly over long distances. Because of the "no-cloning theorem," which says that general quantum states cannot be directly copied, one cannot perform signal amplification in the usual way. The standard approach uses entanglement swapping, in which quantum states are teleported from one (short) segment to the next, using at each step a shared entangled pair. This is the job of the repeater. In general, this requires reliable quantum memories and shared entanglement resources, which are vulnerable to noise and decoherence. It is also difficult to manually create and implement the quantum algorithm for the swap circuit as the size of the system increases. Here, we propose a different approach: to use machine learning to train a repeater node. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, the system is simulated in MATLAB 2022a. Training is conducted for a system of 2 qubits. It is then scaled up, with no additional training, to systems of 4, 6, and 8 qubits using transfer learning. Finally, the systems are tested in noisy conditions. The results show that the scale-up is very effective and relatively easy, and the effects of noise and decoherence are reduced as the size of the system increases.

TI Quantum photonics with layered 2D materials
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Quantum photonics offers an integrated and scalable approach to quantum information processing and communication. This article summarizes the state of the art and provides an outlook on future challenges and opportunities for quantum photonics based on 2D materials.
   Solid-state quantum devices use quantum entanglement for various quantum technologies, such as quantum computation, encryption, communication and sensing. Solid-state platforms for quantum photonics include single molecules, individual defects in crystals and semiconductor quantum dots, which have enabled coherent quantum control and readout of single spins (stationary quantum bits) and generation of indistinguishable single photons (flying quantum bits) and their entanglement. In the past 6 years, new opportunities have arisen with the emergence of 2D layered van der Waals materials. These materials offer a highly attractive quantum photonic platform that provides maximum versatility, ultrahigh light-matter interaction efficiency and novel opportunities to engineer quantum states. In this Review, we discuss the recent progress in the field of 2D layered materials towards coherent quantum photonic devices. We focus on the current state of the art and summarize the fundamental properties and current challenges. Finally, we provide an outlook for future prospects in this rapidly advancing field.

TI Entanglement generation in a quantum network with finite quantum memory
   lifetime
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We simulate entanglement sharing between two end-nodes of a linear chain quantum network using SeQUeNCe, an open-source simulation package for quantum networks. Our focus is on the rate of entanglement generation between the end-nodes with many repeaters with a finite quantum memory lifetime. Numerical and analytical simulations show limits of connection performance for a given number of repeaters involved, memory lifetimes, the distance between the end-nodes, and an entanglement management protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the performance of quantum connection depends highly on the entanglement management protocol, which schedules entanglement generation and swapping, resulting in the final end-to-end entanglement.

TI Entangling motional atoms and an optical loop at ambient condition
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The observation of quantum entanglement in macroscopic matters has implications in the fundamental studies of quantum mechanics, as well as the implementations of quantum information technologies, such as quantum communication, enhanced sensing, and distributed quantum computing. Here, we report the creation of the heralded entanglement between two different room-temperature quantum memories: a single-photon entangled state delocalized between motional atoms as a collective excitation and an all-optical loop as a flying qubit. The stored entangled state is subsequently retrieved and verified by measuring the nonclassical correlations, quantum interference, and concurrence of the mapped-out photons. Our results show that quantum entanglement can be sustained in macroscopic matters at ambient condition, which enriches the fundamental researches of the transition boundary between quantum and classical worlds. Also, it highlights the potential cooperation between atomic ensembles and all-optical loop as quantum nodes at ambient condition, bringing a significant step towards practical quantum networks.

TI Quantum computing with time-travelling quantum gates
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum computing can solve problems that are difficult to solve in classical computing, expanding therange of problems that can be effectively computed within the allowable range of classical physical principles,and posing a challenge to the extended Church-Turing thesis in classical computing. Here, we discuss aninteresting question: how to achieve more powerful computers by breaking through the limitations of physicalprinciples, further enhancing the capabilities of quantum computers. To extend quantum computing, noveloperations related to relativistic physics are a crucial candidate. Among them, the concept of closed time-likecurve has aroused widespread interest, and it introduces the ability for time travel. Mathematically, quantumstate along the closed time-like curve is determined through self-consistent equations, which has beendemonstrated in simulations. Here, we consider a novel manipulation capability that allows quantum computingto achieve time-travelling quantum control gate. This is an intuitive extension of the graphical language ofquantum circuits. Explaining quantum circuits as tensor networks, we first explain how to experimentallysimulate the output of such a circuit in a system without time-travel capability. Then, we take an example todemonstrate an extended quantum algorithm that can efficiently solve SAT problems, indicating that with theinvolvement of time-travelling quantum gates, the computational complexity class P = NP. We also anticipatethat the time-travelling quantum gates will play a facilitating role in accomplishing other quantum tasks,including achieving deterministic non-orthogonal quantum state discrimination, and quantum state cloning. Ourresults contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between computation and physicalprinciples

TI Enhancing photon generation rate with broadband room-temperature quantum
   memory
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Photons with high generation rate is one of the essential resources for quantum communication, quantum computing and quantum metrology. Due to the naturally memory-built-in feature, the memory-based photon source is a promising route towards large-scale quantum information processing. However, such photon sources are mostly implemented in extremely low-temperature ensembles or isolated systems, limiting its physical scalability. Here we realize a single-photon source based on a far off-resonance Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum memory at broadband and room-temperature regime. By harnessing high-speed feedback control and repeat-until-success write process, the photon generation rate obtains considerable enhancement up to tenfold. Such a memory-enhanced single-photon source, based on the broadband room-temperature quantum memory, suggests a promising way for establishing large-scale quantum memory-enabled network at ambient condition.

TI Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Networks: Mechanics, Enabling
   Technologies, Challenges, and Research Directions
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in quantum information technology, from theoretical studies to experimental demonstrations. Revolutionary quantum applications are now in the limelight, showcasing the advantages of quantum information technology and becoming a research hotspot in academia and industry. To enable quantum applications to have a more profound impact and wider application, the interconnection of multiple quantum nodes through quantum channels becomes essential. Building an entanglement-assisted quantum network, capable of realizing quantum information transmission between these quantum nodes, is the primary goal. However, entanglement-assisted quantum networks are governed by the unique laws of quantum mechanics, such as the superposition principle, the no-cloning theorem, and quantum entanglement, setting them apart from classical networks. Consequently, fundamental efforts are required to establish entanglement-assisted quantum networks. While some insightful surveys have paved the way for entanglement-assisted quantum networks, most of these studies focus on enabling technologies and quantum applications, neglecting critical network issues. In response, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of entanglement-assisted quantum networks. Alongside reviewing fundamental mechanics and enabling technologies, the paper provides a detailed overview of the network structure, working principles, and development stages, highlighting the differences from classical networks. Additionally, the challenges of building wide-area entanglement-assisted quantum networks are addressed. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes open research directions, including architecture design, entanglement-based network issues, and standardization, to facilitate the implementation of future entanglement-assisted quantum networks.

TI Tensor quantum programming
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Running quantum algorithms often involves implementing complex quantum circuits with such a large number of multi-qubit gates that the challenge of tackling practical applications appears daunting. In this article, we propose a novel approach called Tensor Quantum Programming, which leverages tensor networks (TNs) for hybrid quantum computing. Our key insight is that the primary challenge of algorithms based on TNs lies in their high ranks (bond dimensions). Quantum computing offers a potential solution to this challenge, as an ideal quantum computer can represent tensors with arbitrarily high ranks in contrast to classical counterparts, which indicates the way towards quantum advantage. While tensor-based vector-encoding and state-readout are known procedures, the matrix-encoding required for performing matrix-vector multiplications directly on quantum devices is much less studied. We introduce an algorithm that encodes matrix product operators into quantum circuits with a depth that scales linearly with the number of qubits. We demonstrate the algorithm's performance for matrices commonly encountered in differential equations, optimization problems, and quantum chemistry, for systems involving up to 50 qubits.

TI Efficient quantum memory for photonic polarization qubits generated by
   cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric downconversion
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum memories, for storing then retrieving photonic quantum states on demand, are crucial components for scalable quantum technologies. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) with a nonlinear crystal is the most widely used process for generating entangled photon pairs or heralded single photons. Despite the desirability of efficient quantum memories for SPDC-generated single photons, the storage and retrieval efficiencies achieved with this approach still fall below 50%, a threshold value for practical applications. Here, we report an efficiency of > 70% for the storage of heralded single photons generated by cavity-enhanced SPDC using atomic quantum memories based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In addition, we demonstrate the quantum memory for single-photon polarization qubits with a fidelity of similar to 96%.

TI Empowering a qudit-based quantum processor by traversing the dual
   bosonic ladder
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-dimensional quantum information processing has emerged as a promising avenue to transcend hardware limitations and advance the frontiers of quantum technologies. Harnessing the untapped potential of the so-called qudits necessitates the development of quantum protocols beyond the established qubit methodologies. Here, we present a robust, hardware-efficient, and scalable approach for operating multidimensional solid-state systems using Raman-assisted two-photon interactions. We then utilize them to construct extensible multi-qubit operations, realize highly entangled multidimensional states including atomic squeezed states and Schr & ouml;dinger cat states, and implement programmable entanglement distribution along a qudit array. Our work illuminates the quantum electrodynamics of strongly driven multi-qudit systems and provides the experimental foundation for the future development of high-dimensional quantum applications such as quantum sensing and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
   The full-fledged development of qudits in superconducting circuits is hindered by limited interaction toolkit and stringent requirements on frequencies and anharmonicities. Here, the authors propose and demonstrate an alternative scheme to perform multi-qudit gates in transmon-based devices, which is based on Raman-assisted two-photon interactions.

TI Pursuing the Fundamental Limits for Quantum Communication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel determines the maximal rate at which we can code reliably over asymptotically many uses of the channel, and it characterizes the channel's ultimate ability to transmit quantum information coherently. In this paper, we derive single-letter upper bounds on the quantum and private capacities of quantum channels. The quantum capacity of a quantum channel is always no larger than the quantum capacity of its extended channels, since the extensions of the channel can be considered as assistance from the environment. By optimizing the parametrized extended channels with specific structures such as the flag structure, we obtain new upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the original quantum channel. Furthermore, we extend our approach to estimating the fundamental limits of private communication and one-way entanglement distillation. As notable applications, we establish improved upper bounds to the quantum and private capacities for fundamental quantum channels of interest in quantum information, some of which are also the sources of noise in superconducting quantum computing. In particular, our upper bounds on the quantum capacities of the depolarizing channel and the generalized amplitude damping channel are strictly better than previously best-known bounds for certain regimes.

TI Robust quantum-network memory based on spin qubits in isotopically
   engineered diamond
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum networks can enable quantum communication and modular quantum computation. A powerful approach is to use multi-qubit nodes that provide quantum memory and computational power. Nuclear spins associated with defects in diamond are promising qubits for this role. However, dephasing during optical entanglement distribution hinders scaling to larger systems. Here, we show that a C-13-spin quantum memory in isotopically engineered diamond is robust to the optical link operation of a nitrogen-vacancy centre. The memory lifetime is improved by two orders-of-magnitude upon the state-of-the-art, surpassing reported times for entanglement distribution. Additionally, we demonstrate that the nuclear-spin state can survive ionisation and recapture of the nitrogen-vacancy electron. Finally, we use simulations to show that combining this memory with previously demonstrated entanglement links and gates can enable key network primitives, such as deterministic non-local two-qubit gates, paving the way for test-bed quantum networks capable of investigating complex algorithms and error correction.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The spatial modes of light, carrying a quantized amount of orbital angular momentum (OAM), is one of the excellent candidates that provides access to high-dimensional quantum states, which essentially makes it promising towards building high-dimensional quantum networks. Quantum memory with efficiency above 50% is an essential condition for beating the no-cloning limit or in the one-way quantum computation. However, up till now, the highest storage efficiencies achieved for OAM states are below 30%, which is an obstacle towards practical applications. In this paper, we report the storage and retrieval of photonic qubits encoded with OAM state in an elongated cold rubidium atomic ensemble, achieving a storage efficiency around 65% with an average conditional fidelity above 98%. Our work constitutes an efficient node that is needed towards high dimensional and large scale quantum networks.\/-

TI Development of a Scheme for Correcting Arbitrary Errors and Averaging
   Noise in Quantum Computing
SO CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Intensive research is currently being carried out to develop and create quantum computers and their software. This work is devoted to study of the influence of the environment on the quantum system of qubits. Quantum error correction is a set of methods for protecting quantum information and quantum state from unwanted interactions of the environment (decoherence) and other forms and types of noise. The article discusses the solution to the problem of research and development of corrective codes for rectifying several types of quantum errors that occur during computational processes in quantum algorithms and models of quantum computing devices. The aim of the work is to study existing methods for correcting various types of quantum errors and to create a corrective code for quantum error rectification. The scientific novelty is expressed in the exclusion of one of the shortcomings of the quantum computing process.

TI Offset-locking-based frequency stabilization of external cavity diode
   lasers for long-distance quantum communication
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum repeaters are required for long-distance quantum communication. For efficient coupling of quantum entangled photon sources with narrow-linewidth quantum memories, we performed the frequency stabilization of two lasers at 1514 and 1010 nm. The 1514 nm pump laser of the entangled photon source exhibited a frequency stability of 3.6 x 10(-12) (tau = 1 s). The 1010 nm pump laser of the wavelength conversion system exhibited a frequency stability of 3.4 x 10(-12) (tau = 1 s). The stabilities of both lasers were approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the frequency width of 4 MHz of the Pr:YSO quantum memory. Such frequency-stabilized lasers can realize the remote coupling of a quantum memory and an entangled photon source in quantum repeaters.

TI Implementation and Readout of Maximally Entangled Two-Qubit Gates
   Quantum Circuits in a Superconducting Quantum Processor
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM
AB Besides noticeable challenges in implementing low-error single- and two-qubit quantum gates in superconducting quantum processors, the readout technique and analysis are a key factor in determining the efficiency and performance of quantum processors. Being able to efficiently implement quantum algorithms involving entangling gates and asses their output is mandatory for quantum utility. In a transmon-based 5-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we compared the performance of quantum circuits involving an increasing level of complexity, from single-qubit circuits to maximally entangled Bell circuits. This comparison highlighted the importance of the readout analysis and helped us optimize the protocol for more advanced quantum algorithms. Here, we report the results obtained from the analysis of the outputs of quantum circuits using two readout paradigms, referred to as "multiplied readout probabilities" and "conditional readout probabilities." The first method is suitable for single-qubit circuits, while the second is essential for accurately interpreting the outputs of circuits involving two-qubit gates.

TI Quantum communication with SU(2) invariant separable 2 x N
   level systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Information is encoded in a qubit in the form of its Bloch vector. In this paper, we propose protocols for remote transfers of information in a known and an unknown qubit to qudits using SU(2)-invariant 2 x N-level separable discordant states as quantum channels. These states have been identified as separable equivalents of the two-qubit entangled Werner states in Bharath and Ravishankar (Phys Rev A 89:062110, 2014). Due to SU(2) x SU(2) invariance of these states, the remote qudit can be changed by performing appropriate measurements on the qubit. We also propose a protocol for transferring information of a family of unknown qudits to remote qudits using 2 x N-level states as channels. Finally, we propose a protocol for swapping of quantum discord from 2 x N-level systems to N x N-level systems. All the protocols proposed in this paper involve separable states as quantum channels.

TI Quantum Machine Learning Tensor Network States
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Tensor network algorithms seek to minimize correlations to compress the classical data representing quantum states. Tensor network algorithms and similar tools-called tensor network methods-form the backbone of modern numerical methods used to simulate many-body physics and have a further range of applications in machine learning. Finding and contracting tensor network states is a computational task, which may be accelerated by quantum computing. We present a quantum algorithm that returns a classical description of a rank-r tensor network state satisfying an area law and approximating an eigenvector given black-box access to a unitary matrix. Our work creates a bridge between several contemporary approaches, including tensor networks, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), and quantum computation.

TI Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB As quantum computers become available to the general public, the need has arisen to train a cohort of quantum programmers, many of whom have been developing classical computer programs for most of their careers. While currently available quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, quantum computing hardware is widely expected to grow in terms of qubit count, quality, and connectivity. This review aims at explaining the principles of quantum programming, which are quite different from classical programming, with straightforward algebra that makes understanding of the underlying fascinating quantum mechanical principles optional. We give an introduction to quantum computing algorithms and their implementation on real quantum hardware. We survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a succinct and self-contained fashion. We show how these algorithms can be implemented on IBM's quantum computer, and in each case, we discuss the results of the implementation with respect to differences between the simulator and the actual hardware runs. This article introduces computer scientists, physicists, and engineers to quantum algorithms and provides a blueprint for their implementations.

TI Quantum machine learning via continuous-variable cluster states and
   teleportation
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a new approach for a photonic platform suitable for distributed quantum machine learning and exhibiting memory. This measurement-based quantum reservoir computing takes advantage of continuous variable cluster states as the main quantum resource. Cluster states are key to several photonic quantum technologies, enabling universal quantum computing as well as quantum communication protocols. The proposed measurement-based quantum reservoir computing is based on a neural network of cluster states and local operations, where input data are encoded through measurement, thanks to quantum teleportation. In this design, measurements enable input injections, information processing and continuous monitoring for time series processing. The architecture's power and versatility are tested by performing a set of benchmark tasks showing that the protocol displays internal memory and is suitable for both static and temporal information processing without hardware modifications. This design opens the way to distributed machine learning.

TI Scalable Fault-Tolerant Quantum Technologies with Silicon Color Centers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The scaling barriers currently faced by both quantum networking and quantum computing technologies ultimately amount to the same core challenge of distributing high-quality entanglement at scale. In this Perspective, a novel quantum information-processing architecture based on optically active spins in silicon is proposed that offers a combined single technological platform for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing and networking. The architecture is optimized for overall entanglement distribution and leverages color-center spins in silicon (T centers) for their manufacturability, photonic interface, and high-fidelity information-processing properties. Silicon nanophotonic optical circuits allow for photonic links between T centers, which are networked via telecom-band optical photons in a highly connected graph. This high connectivity unlocks the use of low-overhead quantum error-correcting codes, significantly accelerating the time line for modular scalable fault-tolerant quantum repeaters and quantum processors.

TI Quantum teleportation using Ising anyons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Anyons have been extensively investigated as information carriers in topological quantum computation. However, how to characterize the information flow in quantum networks composed of anyons is less understood, which motivates us to study quantum communication protocols in anyonic systems. Here we propose a general topologically protected protocol for quantum teleportation based on the Ising anyon model and prove that with our protocol an unknown anyonic state of any number of Ising anyons can be teleported from Alice to Bob. Our protocol naturally generalizes quantum state teleportation from systems of locally distinguishable particles to systems of Ising anyons, which may promote our understandings of anyonic quantum entanglement as a quantum resource. In addition, our protocol is expected to be realized with the Majorana zero modes, one of the possible physical realizations for the Ising anyon in experiments.

   Implementation (PLDI)
CY JUN 24-28, 2024
CL Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB Quantum computers are a revolutionary class of computational platforms that are capable of solving computationally hard problems. However, today's quantum hardware is subject to noise and decoherence issues that together limit the scale and complexity of the quantum circuits that can be implemented. Recently, practitioners have developed qutrit-based quantum hardware platforms that compute over |0 >, |1 >, and |2 > states, and have presented circuit depth reduction techniques using qutrits' higher energy |2 > states to temporarily store information. However, thus far, such quantum circuits that use higher order states for temporary storage need to be manually crafted by hardware designers. We present DARE, an optimizing compiler for qutrit circuits that implement qubit computations. DARE deploys a qutrit circuit decomposition algorithm and a rewrite engine to construct and optimize qutrit circuits. We evaluate DARE against hand-optimized qutrit circuits and qubit circuits, and find DARE delivers up to 65% depth improvement over manual qutrit implementations, and 43-75% depth improvement over qubit circuits. We also perform a fidelity analysis and find DARE-optimized qutrit circuits deliver up to 8.9x higher fidelity circuits than their manually implemented counterparts.

TI Telecom Networking with a Diamond Quantum Memory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Practical quantum networks require interfacing quantum memories with existing channels and systems that operate in the telecom band. Here we demonstrate low-noise, bidirectional quantum frequency conversion that enables a solid-state quantum memory to directly interface with telecom-band systems. In particular, we demonstrate conversion of visible-band single photons emitted from a silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond to the telecom O band, maintaining low noise (g(2)(0)<0.1) and high indistinguishability (V = 89 +/- 8 %). We further demonstrate the utility of this system for quantum networking by converting telecom-band time-bin pulses, sent across a lossy and noisy 50-km deployed fiber link, to the visible band and entangling them with a diamond quantum memory with fidelity F >= 87 +/- 2.5%. These results demonstrate the viability of SiV quantum memories integrated with telecom-band systems for scalable quantum networking applications.

TI QHLS: An HLS Framework to Convert High-Level Descriptions to Quantum
   Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB Quantum computing has been shown to provide exponential performance improvements in several tasks, such as cryptography, healthcare, etc. This article presents a new framework for quantum high-level synthesis, called QHLS, that aims to facilitate programmers using quantum computers. Currently, quantum-computer programmers need extensive linear algebra and quantum mechanics knowledge, which can be challenging for traditional software programmers. Additionally, the current quantum programming paradigm is not scalable, and it can be difficult to combine quantum circuits to create a more complex functionality. QHLS addresses these issues by enabling the automatic generation of quantum circuit descriptions directly from high-level behavioral specifications (using languages like C or C++). This simplifies the programming of a quantum computer, making it more accessible to a wider range of programmers. Our experiments show that QHLS can successfully translate high-level software programs containing various types of statements (such as arithmetic, logical, and conditional operations) into functionally equivalent quantum circuits.

TI Hybrid controlled-sum gate with one superconducting qutrit and one
   cat-state qutrit and application in hybrid entangled state preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Compared with a qubit, a qudit (i.e., a d-level or d-state quantum system) provides a larger Hilbert space to store and process information. On the other hand, qudit-based hybrid quantum computing usually requires performing hybrid quantum gates with qudits that are different in their nature or in their encoding format. In this work, we consider the qutrit case, i.e., the case for a qudit with d = 3. We propose a simple method to realize a hybrid quantum controlled-sum gate with one superconducting (SC) qutrit and a cat-state qutrit. This gate plus single-qutrit gates form a universal set of ternary logic gates for quantum computing with qutrits. Our proposal is based on circuit QED and operates essentially by employing a SC ququart (a four-level quantum system) dispersively coupled to a microwave cavity. The gate implementation is quite simple because it only requires a single basic operation. Neither classical pulse nor measurement is needed. The auxiliary higher energy level of the SC ququart is virtually excited during the gate operation, thus decoherence from this level is greatly suppressed. As an application of this gate, we discuss the generation of a hybrid maximally entangled state of one SC qutrit and one cat-state qutrit. We further analyze the experimental feasibility of creating such a hybrid entangled state in circuit QED. This proposal is quite general and can be extended to accomplish the same task in a wide range of physical system, such as a four-level natural or artificial atom coupled to an optical or microwave cavity.

TI Hertz-rate metropolitan quantum teleportation
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum teleportation can transfer an unknown quantum state between distant quantum nodes, which holds great promise in enabling large-scale quantum networks. To advance the full potential of quantum teleportation, quantum states must be faithfully transferred at a high rate over long distance. Despite recent impressive advances, a high-rate quantum teleportation system across metropolitan fiber networks is extremely desired. Here, we demonstrate a quantum teleportation system which transfers quantum states carried by independent photons at a rate of 7.1 +/- 0.4 Hz over 64-km-long fiber channel. An average single-photon fidelity of = 90.6 +/- 2.6% is achieved, which exceeds the maximum fidelity of 2/3 in classical regime. Our result marks an important milestone towards quantum networks and opens the door to exploring quantum entanglement based informatic applications for the future quantum internet.

TI The Platypus of the Quantum Channel Zoo
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Understanding quantum channels and the strange behavior of their capacities is a key objective of quantum information theory. Here we study a remarkably simple, low-dimensional, single-parameter family of quantum channels with exotic quantum information-theoretic features. As the simplest example from this family, we focus on a qutrit-to-qutrit channel that is intuitively obtained by hybridizing together a simple degradable channel and a completely useless qubit channel. Such hybridizing makes this channel's capacities behave in a variety of interesting ways. For instance, the private and classical capacity of this channel coincide and can be explicitly calculated, even though the channel does not belong to any class for which the underlying information quantities are known to be additive. Moreover, the quantum capacity of the channel can be computed explicitly, given a clear and compelling conjecture is true. This "spin alignment conjecture," which may be of independent interest, is proved in certain special cases and additional numerical evidence for its validity is provided. Finally, we generalize the qutrit channel in two ways, and the resulting channels and their capacities display similarly rich behavior. In a companion paper, we further show that the qutrit channel demonstrates superadditivity when transmitting quantum information jointly with a variety of assisting channels, in a manner unknown before.

TI Phase locking and absolute frequency stabilization of laser sources for
   a Pr:YSO quantum memory
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to phase lock a quantum-memory control laser, frequency-conversion pump laser, and two-photon source over three octaves in frequency to operate a quantum memory. The absolute frequencies of the laser sources are determined based on a Doppler-free iodine hyperfine transition. The achieved relative frequency instability and uncertainty were <= 1 x 10-12 and 3 x 10-11, respectively, which are below the requirement for operating a Pr:YSO quantum memory. This scheme simplifies the instrumentation of laser sources in a quantum repeater, and increases the reliability of quantum communication systems.

TI Quantum Switches for Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubit-Based All-Photonic
   Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, being information theoretically near optimal for quantum communication over Gaussian thermal-loss optical channels, is likely to be the encoding of choice for advanced quantum networks of the future. Quantum repeaters based on GKP-encoded light have been shown to support high end-to-end entanglement rates across large distances despite realistic finite squeezing in GKP code preparation and homodyne detection inefficiencies. Here, we introduce a quantum switch for GKP qubit-based quantum networks. Its architecture involves multiplexed GKP qubit-based entanglement link generation with clients and their all-photonic storage, enabled by GKP qubit graph state resources. The switch uses a multiclient generalization of a recently introduced entanglement-ranking-based link matching heuristic for bipartite entanglement distribution between clients via entanglement swapping. Since generating the GKP qubit graph state resource is hardware intensive, given a total resource budget and an arbitrary layout of clients, we address the question of their optimal allocation to the different client-pair connections served by the switch such that the switch's sum throughput is maximized while also being fair in terms of the individual entanglement rates. We illustrate our results for an exemplary data center network, where the data center is a client of a switch, and all of its other clients aim to connect to the data center alone-a scenario that also captures the general case of a gateway router connecting a local area network to a global network. Together with compatible quantum repeaters, our quantum switch provides a way to realize quantum networks of arbitrary topology.

TI SeQUeNCe: a customizable discrete-event simulator of quantum networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent advances in quantum information science enabled the development of quantum communication network prototypes and created an opportunity to study full-stack quantum network architectures. This work develops SeQUeNCe, a comprehensive, customizable quantum network simulator. Our simulator consists of five modules: hardware models, entanglement management protocols, resource management, network management, and application. This framework is suitable for simulation of quantum network prototypes that capture the breadth of current and future hardware technologies and protocols. We implement a comprehensive suite of network protocols and demonstrate the use of SeQUeNCe by simulating a photonic quantum network with nine routers equipped with quantum memories. The simulation capabilities are illustrated in three use cases. We show the dependence of quantum network throughput on several key hardware parameters and study the impact of classical control message latency. We also investigate quantum memory usage efficiency in routers and demonstrate that redistributing memory according to anticipated load increases network capacity by 69.1% and throughput by 6.8%. We design SeQUeNCe to enable comparisons of alternative quantum network technologies, experiment planning, and validation and to aid with new protocol design. We are releasing SeQUeNCe as an open source tool and aim to generate community interest in extending it.

TI Quantum network applications in 6G paradigm
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB Over the past four decades, quantum communication has evolved as a dynamic interdisciplinary field, advancing theoretical concepts and practical implementations. This article provides a concise overview focusing on recent progress in different aspects of secure quantum communication and quantum computation protocols, which can be applied to several real-world applications in quantum networks. These protocols guarantee unconditional security while enhancing communication rates and computation capabilities by harnessing quantum advantages. We also explore the role of non-terrestrial networks in quantum applications, with a focus on quantum technologies such as quantum key distribution and beyond, suitable for satellite-based applications. These technologies can contribute to future extensions of the quantum internet across intercontinental territories, connecting complex quantum network applications. Further, we delve into discussing the integration of quantum communication into 6G technology. The key innovation of this article lies in integrating quantum communication into 6G networks through a novel system-level simulation framework. 6G-enabled quantum networks are expected to meet the high demands on ubiquitous coverage, data rate, latency, and energy consumption. To address these issues, we design and evaluate four traffic demand scenarios using numerical simulation, illustrating how superdense coding doubles the data transmission rate and fulfills the high traffic demands on data rate, while under low traffic demand, entanglement resources can be reserved for future applications. Specifically, our investigation demonstrates how resource utilization adapts to different traffic demands, with adjustments based on available resources and practical constraints, evaluated over an ideal noise-free communication channel. The proof-of-work simulation is implemented using Python and is based on the system model we designed for varying traffic demands to pave the way for efficient quantum networks and gain deeper insights into their feasibility with available resources.

TI Analysis of Parameterized Quantum Circuits: On the Connection Between
   Expressibility and Types of Quantum Gates
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Expressibility is a crucial factor of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). In the context of variational-quantum-algorithm-based quantum machine learning (QML), a QML model composed of a highly expressible PQC and a sufficient number of qubits is theoretically capable of approximating any arbitrary continuous function. While much research has explored the relationship between expressibility and learning performance, as well as the number of layers in PQCs, the connection between expressibility and PQC structure has received comparatively less attention. In this article, we analyze the connection between expressibility and the types of quantum gates within PQCs using a gradient boosting tree model and Shapley additive explanations values. Our analysis is performed on 1615 instances of PQC derived from 19 PQC topologies, each with 2-18 qubits and 1-5 layers. The findings of our analysis provide guidance for designing highly expressible PQCs, suggesting the integration of more X-rotation or Y-rotation gates while maintaining a careful balance with the number of cnot gates . Furthermore, our evaluation offers an additional evidence of expressibility saturation, as observed by previous studies.

TI Fault-tolerant and secure long-distance quantum communication via
   uncorrectable-error-injection
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum networks aim to facilitate the fault-tolerant and secure transmission of quantum states across distant devices. The widely adopted quantum teleportation scheme requires multiple rounds of entanglement swapping and purification, leading to significant resource overhead and operational complexity. In this study, we propose a novel fault-tolerant and secure quantum communication scheme based on uncorrectable error injection. Our method exploits a quantum state encoding scheme based on quantum error correction codes, which strategically introduces uncorrectable errors to enhance security. It eliminates the need for entanglement distribution while reducing resource requirements. The injected errors protect against eavesdropping by preventing unauthorized parties from retrieving meaningful information. Security analysis shows that as the data length and encoded message size increase, information leakage becomes negligible relative to the size of the total message. Comparative performance analysis with existing approaches indicates that our method reduces transmission overhead while maintaining comparable fidelity in low-error regimes. These findings suggest that the proposed method offers a scalable and practical alternative for secure long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and future quantum internet applications.

TI Experimental demonstration of memory-enhanced scaling for entanglement
   connection of quantum repeater segments
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Two quantum repeater segments are connected via on-demand entanglement swapping by using two atomic quantum memories. The efficiency improves from a quadratic scaling to a linear one with the preparation efficiency of the atom-photon entanglement.
   The quantum repeater protocol is a promising approach for implementing long-distance quantum communication and large-scale quantum networks. A key idea of the quantum repeater protocol is to use long-lived quantum memories to achieve an efficient entanglement connection between different repeater segments, with polynomial scaling. Here, we report an experiment that realizes the efficient connection of two quantum repeater segments via on-demand entanglement swapping through the use of two atomic quantum memories with storage times of tens of milliseconds. With the memory enhancement, acceleration in the scaling is demonstrated in the rate for a successful entanglement connection. Experimental realization of the entanglement connection of two quantum repeater segments with an efficient memory-enhanced scaling demonstrates a key advantage of the quantum repeater protocol, creating a cornerstone for the development of future large-scale quantum networks.

TI Research progress of artificial intelligence empowered quantum
   communication and quantum sensing systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum communication and quantum sensing, which leverage the unique characteristics of quantum systems, enable information-theoretically secure communication and high-precision measurement of physical quantities. They have attracted significant attention in recent research. However, they both face numerous challenges on the path to practical application. For instance, device imperfections may lead to security vulnerability, and environmental noise may significantly reduce measurement accuracy. Traditional solutions often involve high computational complexity, long processing time, and substantial hardware resource requirements, posing major obstacles to the large-scale deployment of quantum communication and quantum sensing networks. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a major technological advancement in current scientific landscape, offers powerful data processing and analytical capabilities, providing new ideas and methods for optimizing and enhancing quantum communication and sensing systems. Significant progresses have been made in applying AI to quantum communication and sensing, thus injecting new vitality into these cutting-edge technologies. In quantum communication, AI techniques have greatly improved the performance and security of quantum key distribution, quantum memory, and quantum networks through parameter optimization, real-time feedback control, and attack detection. In quantum sensing, quantum sensing technology enables ultra-high sensitivity detection of physical quantities such as time and magnetic fields. The introduction of AI has opened up new avenues for achieving high-precision and high-sensitivity quantum measurements. With AI, sensor performance is optimized, and measurement accuracy is further enhanced through data analysis. This paper also analyzes the current challenges in using AI to empower quantum communication and sensing systems, such as implementing efficient algorithm deployment and system feedback control under limited computational resources, and addressing complex task environments, dynamically changing scenarios, and multi-task coordination requirements. Finally, this paper discusses and envisions future development prospects in this field.

In the scheme, only Bell-state measurements and two-qubit controlled-NOT gate operations as well as some single-qubit transformed operations are needed. Compared with a rival scheme put forwarded by Tan et al [Int. J. Theor.

TI Proposal for space-borne quantum memories for global quantum networking
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Global-scale quantum communication links will form the backbone of the quantum internet. However, exponential loss in optical fibres precludes any realistic application beyond few hundred kilometres. Quantum repeaters and space-based systems offer solutions to overcome this limitation. Here, we analyse the use of quantum memory (QM)-equipped satellites for quantum communication focussing on global range repeaters and memory-assisted (MA-) QKD, where QMs help increase the key rate by synchronising otherwise probabilistic detection events. We demonstrate that satellites equipped with QMs provide three orders of magnitude faster entanglement distribution rates than existing protocols based on fibre-based repeaters or space systems without QMs. We analyse how entanglement distribution performance depends on memory characteristics, determine benchmarks to assess the performance of different tasks and propose various architectures for light-matter interfaces. Our work provides a roadmap to realise unconditionally secure quantum communications over global distances with near-term technologies.

TI Resilience analysis of quantum network against targeted attacks:
   Recovery via rerouting and purification
SO OPTICAL SWITCHING AND NETWORKING
AB Quantum networks are essential for secure quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. However, their performance is highly vulnerable to targeted attacks that disrupt entanglement distribution, leading to significant network degradation. To address this challenge, we propose two heuristic routing algorithms Quantum Entanglement Distribution Algorithm 1 (QEDA1) and Quantum Entanglement Distribution Algorithm 2 (QEDA2) that minimize loss of fidelity by reducing the number of intermediate nodes while optimizing entanglement swapping and purification strategies. In QEDA1 we only applied purification as a recovery mechanism, while in QEDA2 we utilized a purification-rerouting approach. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, which relied primarily on idealized or small-scale topologies, we evaluated our approach on a real-world network topology (Surfnet), analyzing throughput variations under both normal conditions and targeted attacks. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the algorithm in memory-assisted and memoryless quantum networks, demonstrating the impact of quantum memory on network resilience. In addition, we introduce an attack model based on centrality-driven node failures and propose a recovery mechanism that integrates rerouting and entanglement purification to mitigate the effects of targeted attacks. Our results indicate that QEDA2 is more effective in mitigating the effect of attacks on throughput. Moreover, our findings highlight the trade-offs between network robustness, resource allocation, and fidelity constraints, providing valuable insights for the design of resilient large-scale quantum networks.

TI Quantum Repeaters with Encoding on Nitrogen-Vacancy-Center Platforms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We investigate quantum repeater protocols that rely on three-qubit repetition codes using nitrogen -vacancy (N -V) centers in diamond as quantum memories. N -V centers offer a two-qubit register, corresponding to their electron and nuclear spins, which makes it possible to perform deterministic two-qubit operations within one N -V center. For quantum repeater applications, however, we need to do joint operations on two separate N -V centers. Here, we study two N -V-center-based repeater structures that enable such deterministic joint operations. One structure offers less consumption of classical communica-tion, at the cost of more computation overhead, whereas the other relies on a smaller number of physical resources and operations. We assess and compare their performance for the task of secret-key generation under the influence of noise and decoherence with current and near-term experimental parameters. We quantify the regimes of operation where one structure outperforms the other, and find the regions where encoded quantum repeaters offer practical advantages over their nonencoded counterparts.

TI Probabilistic teleportation of a quantum dot spin qubit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots have been intensively studied for implementing quantum computation and high-fidelity single- and two-qubit operations have recently been achieved. Quantum teleportation is a three-qubit protocol exploiting quantum entanglement and it serves as an essential primitive for more sophisticated quantum algorithms. Here we demonstrate a scheme for quantum teleportation based on direct Bell measurement for a single-electron spin qubit in a triple quantum dot utilizing the Pauli exclusion principle to create and detect maximally entangled states. The single spin polarization is teleported from the input qubit to the output qubit. We find this fidelity is primarily limited by singlet-triplet mixing, which can be improved by optimizing the device parameters. Our results may be extended to quantum algorithms with a larger number of semiconductor spin qubits.

TI End-to-End Entanglement Generation Strategies: Capacity Bounds and
   Impact on Quantum Key Distribution
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB A first quantum revolution has already brought quantum technologies into our everyday life for decades: in fact, electronics and optics are based on the quantum mechanical principles. Today, a second quantum revolution is underway, leveraging the quantum principles of superposition, entanglement and measurement, which were not fully exploited yet. International innovation activities and standardization bodies have identified four main application areas for quantum technologies and services: quantum secure communications, quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum sensing and metrology. This paper focuses on quantum secure communications by addressing the evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks (under early exploitation today) towards the Quantum-ready networks and the Quantum Internet based also on entanglement distribution. Assuming that management and control of quantum nodes is a key challenge under definition, today, a main obstacle in exploiting long-range QKD and Quantum-ready networks concerns the inherent losses due to the optical transmission channels. Currently, it is assumed that a most promising way for overcoming this limitation, while avoiding the presence of costly trusted nodes, it is to distribute entangled states by means of Quantum Repeaters. In this respect, the paper provides an overview of current methods and systems for end-to-end entanglement generation, with some simulations and a discussion of capacity upper bounds and their impact of secret key rate in QKD systems.

TI Research Progress of Multiphoton Interference in Quantum Computing and
   Quantum Machine Learning (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Indistinguishable multiphoton interference in linear optics is a cornerstone phenomenon in quantum optics, revealing both nonclassical effects and the bosonic nature of photons. By generalizing the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, indistinguishable multiphoton interference has become a vital resource for quantum information science. Photonics, with its inherent advantages of long coherence time and high-dimensional degrees of freedom, has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing. Multiphoton states in linear optical circuits, exploiting multiphoton interference and occupying large Hilbert spaces, serve as powerful carriers of quantum information. As a result, many models and oracles in quantum computing have been proposed and realized on multiphoton linear-optical networks. A landmark achievement is the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) scheme, which leverages multiphoton interference to implement quantum logic gates and demonstrates the feasibility of universal quantum computing built on linear optics, single-photon sources, and measurements. Inspired by this approach, numerous photon-based quantum gate designs have been developed. Another key model, Boson sampling, which was introduced by Aaronson and Arkhipov, also exploits multiphoton interference. Boson sampling has been implemented on a variety of photonic platforms and at multiple scales, and its variant, Gaussian Boson sampling, has recently been used to demonstrate quantum advantage. These developments underscore the unique computational power of photonic systems. Quantum machine learning (QML), an emerging frontier in quantum algorithms, leverages quantum computing to process both classical and quantum data, promising performance advantages or computational speedups in machine learning tasks. In view of the computational complexity of multiphoton interference, photonic QML architectures provide a promising route towards quantum advantage on practical problems. Different architectures exploiting multiphoton interference have been proposed and demonstrated, including quantum support vector machines, quantum neural networks and quantum reservoir computing. Notably, quantum optical neural networks introduce essential nonlinearity-via measurement, postselection, and feedforward-to overcome the limitations of linear optics. While their strict quantum advantages remain under further investigation, these photonic QML architectures already exhibit unique capabilities, such as quantum-enhanced feature maps and expressivity, and outperform their classical counterparts in certain scenarios. In recent years, various models and architectures in quantum computing and QML have been developed based on multiphoton interference and Boson sampling, exploring the useful computing power of photonic quantum platforms. With rapid progress across these interconnected fields, a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature is essential to guide and inspire future advancements. Progress The fundamental model and theoretical framework of indistinguishable multiphoton interference are introduced (Fig. 1), together with the computational complexity of Boson sampling (Fig. 2). In the KLM scheme for photonic quantum computing, the quantum nonlinear sign gate and the two-qubit controlled-Z gate are implemented via two-photon and four-photon interference. Furthermore, the destructive two-qubit gates involving only two-photon interference are summarized. Figure 3 presents an overview of several photonic schemes for realizing quantum gates.
   Next, we review experimental progress in Boson sampling as a pivotal computational model (Fig. 4). Jianwei Pan's group at the University of Science and Technology of China has demonstrated the largest-scale implementations of both standard and Gaussian Boson sampling to date. In the field of quantum machine learning, Philip Walther's team has implemented quantum kernel methods on a photonic platform (Fig. 5), showing that kernels exploiting multiphoton interference can outperform their classical counterparts in certain scenarios. Fabio Sciarrino's group has proposed and demonstrated a novel photonic architecture for quantum convolutional neural networks, using state injection to introduce nonlinearity into linear optical circuits. Figure 6 summarizes these and other advances in quantum optical neural networks. Finally, we introduce quantum optical reservoir computing (Fig. 7), a recently proposed architecture that requires no quantum circuit training. Conclusions and Prospects Photonics provides a pivotal platform for quantum computing and quantum machine learning. At the convergence of quantum information science and artificial intelligence, photonic platforms based on multiphoton interference and Boson sampling occupy a leading role, with their theoretical foundations, experimental demonstrations, and prospective applications still demanding systematic, in-depth study. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in multiphoton interference for quantum computing and quantum machine learning, aiming to inspire further exploration and innovation.

TI Optimization of broadband Λ-type quantum memory using Gaussian pulses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical quantum memory, the ability to store photonic quantum states and retrieve them on demand, is an essential resource for emerging quantum technologies and photonic quantum information protocols. Simultaneously achieving high efficiency and high-speed, broadband operation is an important task necessary for enabling these applications. We investigate the optimization of a large class of optical quantum memories based on resonant and near-resonant interaction with ensembles of A-type level systems with the restriction that the temporal envelope of all optical fields must be Gaussian, which reduces experimental complexity. Through this optimization we demonstrate an experimentally simple path to saturation of the protocol-independent storage efficiency bound that is valid for a wide range of memory bandwidths, including those that are broadband and high speed. Examining the resulting optimal Gaussian control field parameters, we find a continuous transformation between three physically distinct resonant quantum memory protocols. We compare this Gaussian optimization scheme with standard shape-based optimization.

TI Classical Coherent States Based Quantum Information Processing and
   Quantum Computing Analogs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB It has been recently demonstrated by Bellini's group that macroscopic states, such as coherent states, can be entangled by the delocalized photon addition. Deymier's group has shown that phase bits (phi-bits) gates implemented by employing the topological acoustics (TA) principles can be used to implement the TA-based quantum computing analogs. This motivates us to revisit our previous papers where we have already described how to implement the universal quantum gates in integrated optics using optical hybrid, directional coupler, Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides, but in a different context. In this paper, we describe how to implement the universal set of quantum gates classical analogs in integrated optics by employing classical polarization states derived from classical coherent states. The main problem for integrated optics implementation on a single photon level has been to implement the controlled-phase gate because the existing optical nonlinear devices where incapable of introducing the ${\pi }$ rad phase shift on a single photon level through the Kerr effect, which is not a problem at all when the classical polarization states are used instead. We also describe how to implement quantum qudit analogs based on orbital angular momentum (OAM) states and corresponding qudit gates. To highlight the importance of the proposed concepts, we experimentally demonstrate the controlled-phase gate analog operation between the classical coherent states.

TI Service differentiation and fair sharing in distributed quantum
   computing
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB In the future, quantum computers will become widespread and a network of quantum repeaters will provide them with end-to-end entanglement of remote quantum bits. As a result, a pervasive quantum computation infrastructure will emerge, which will unlock several novel applications, including distributed quantum computing, that is the pooling of resources on multiple computation nodes to address problem instances that are unattainable by any individual quantum computer. In this paper, we first investigate the issue of service differentiation in this new environment. Then, we define the problem of how to select which computation nodes should participate in each pool, so as to achieve a fair share of the quantum network resources available. The analysis is performed via an open source simulator and the results are fully and readily available.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Protecting a bosonic qubit with autonomous quantum error correction
SO NATURE
AB To build a universal quantum computer from fragile physical qubits, effective implementation of quantum error correction (QEC)(1) is an essential requirement and a central challenge. Existing demonstrations of QEC are based on an active schedule of error-syndrome measurements and adaptive recovery operations(2,3,4,5,6,7) that are hardware intensive and prone to introducing and propagating errors. In principle, QEC can be realized autonomously and continuously by tailoring dissipation within the quantum system(1,8,9,10,11,12,13,14), but so far it has remained challenging to achieve the specific form of dissipation required to counter the most prominent errors in a physical platform. Here we encode a logical qubit in Schrodinger cat-like multiphoton states(15) of a superconducting cavity, and demonstrate a corrective dissipation process that stabilizes an error-syndrome operator: the photon number parity. Implemented with continuous-wave control fields only, this passive protocol protects the quantum information by autonomously correcting single-photon-loss errors and boosts the coherence time of the bosonic qubit by over a factor of two. Notably, QEC is realized in a modest hardware setup with neither high-fidelity readout nor fast digital feedback, in contrast to the technological sophistication required for prior QEC demonstrations. Compatible with additional phase-stabilization and fault-tolerant techniques(16,17,18), our experiment suggests quantum dissipation engineering as a resource-efficient alternative or supplement to active QEC in future quantum computing architectures.
   A logical qubit encoded in multi-photon states of a superconducting cavity is protected with autonomous correction of certain quantum errors by tailoring the dissipation it is exposed to.

TI Extending the computational reach of a superconducting qutrit processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing with qudits is an emerging approach that exploits a larger, more connected computational space, providing advantages for many applications, including quantum simulation and quantum error correction. Nonetheless, qudits are typically afflicted by more complex errors and suffer greater noise sensitivity which renders their scaling difficult. In this work, we introduce techniques to tailor arbitrary qudit Markovian noise to stochastic Weyl-Heisenberg channels and mitigate noise that commutes with our Clifford and universal two-qudit gate in generic qudit circuits. We experimentally demonstrate these methods on a superconducting transmon qutrit processor, and benchmark their effectiveness for multipartite qutrit entanglement and random circuit sampling, obtaining up to 3x improvement in our results. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first-ever error mitigation experiment performed on qutrits. Our work shows that despite the intrinsic complexity of manipulating higher-dimensional quantum systems, noise tailoring and error mitigation can significantly extend the computational reach of today's qudit processors.

TI Candidate for a Passively Protected Quantum Memory in Two Dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB An interesting problem in the field of quantum error correction involves finding a physical system that hosts a "passively protected quantum memory," defined as an encoded qubit coupled to an environment that naturally wants to correct errors. To date, a quantum memory stable against finite-temperature effects is known only in four spatial dimensions or higher. Here, we take a different approach to realize a stable quantum memory by relying on a driven-dissipative environment. We propose a new model, the photonicIsing model, which appears to passively correct against both bit-flip and phase-flip errors in two dimensions: a square lattice composed of photonic "cat qubits" coupled via dissipative terms which tend to fix errors locally. Inspired by the presence of two distinct 7L2-symmetry-broken phases, our scheme relies on Ising-like dissipators to protect against bit flips and on a driven-dissipative photonic environment to protect against phase flips. We also discuss possible ways to realize the photonic-Ising model.

TI Quantum network utility: A framework for benchmarking quantum networks
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

AB The central aim of quantum networks is to facilitate user connectivity via quantum channels, but there is an open need for benchmarking metrics to compare diverse quantum networks. Here, we propose a general framework for quantifying the performance of a quantum network by estimating the value created by connecting users through quantum channels. In this framework, we define the quantum network utility metric U QN to capture the social and economic value of quantum networks. The proposed framework accommodates a variety of applications from secure communications to distributed sensing. As a case study, we investigate the example of distributed quantum computing in detail. We determine the scaling laws of quantum network utility, which suggest that distributed edge quantum computing has more potential for success than its classical equivalent. We believe the proposed utility -based framework will serve as a foundation for guiding and assessing the development of quantum network technologies and designs.

TI Exploiting Dynamic Quantum Circuits in a Quantum Algorithm with
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB To date, quantum computation on real, physical devices has largely been limited to simple, time-ordered sequences of unitary operations followed by a final projective measurement. As hardware platforms for quantum computing continue to mature in size and capability, it is imperative to enable quantum circuits beyond their conventional construction. Here we break into the realm of dynamic quantum circuits on a superconducting-based quantum system. Dynamic quantum circuits not only involve the evolution of the quantum state throughout the computation but also periodic measurements of qubits midcircuit and concurrent processing of the resulting classical information on timescales shorter than the execution times of the circuits. Using noisy quantum hardware, we explore one of the most fundamental quantum algorithms, quantum phase estimation, in its adaptive version, which exploits dynamic circuits, and compare the results to a nonadaptive implementation of the same algorithm. We demonstrate that the version of real-time quantum computing with dynamic circuits can yield results comparable to an approach involving classical asynchronous postprocessing, thus opening the door to a new realm of available algorithms on real quantum systems.

TI Benchmarking universal quantum gates via channel spectrum
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Noise remains the major obstacle to scalable quantum computation. Quantum benchmarking provides key information on noise properties and is an important step for developing more advanced quantum processors. However, current benchmarking methods are either limited to a specific subset of quantum gates or cannot directly describe the performance of the individual target gate. To overcome these limitations, we propose channel spectrum benchmarking (CSB), a method to infer the noise properties of the target gate, including process fidelity, stochastic fidelity, and some unitary parameters, from the eigenvalues of its noisy channel. Our CSB method is insensitive to state-preparation and measurement errors, and importantly, can benchmark universal gates and is scalable to many-qubit systems. Unlike standard randomized schemes, CSB can provide direct noise information for both target native gates and circuit fragments, allowing benchmarking and calibration of global entangling gates and frequently used modules in quantum algorithms like Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution operator in quantum simulation.
   Performing quantum computing in the NISQ era requires reliable information on the gate noise characteristics and their performance benchmarks. Here, the authors show how to estimate the individual noise properties of any quantum process from the noisy eigenvalues of its corresponding quantum channel.

   Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The development of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computers (NISQC) provides for the Quantum Information community new tools to perform quantum experiences from an individual laptop. It facilitates interdisciplinary research in the sense that theoretical descriptions of properties of quantum physics can be translated to experiments easily implementable on a NISCQ. In this note I test large state-independent inequalities for quantum contextuality on finite geometric structures encoding the commutation relations of the generalized N-qubit Pauli group. The bounds predicted by Non-Contextual Hidden Variables theories are strongly violated in all conducted experiences.

TI Colloquium: Cavity-enhanced quantum network nodes
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB A future quantum network will consist of quantum processors that are connected by quantum channels, just like conventional computers are wired up to form the Internet. In contrast to classical devices, however, the entanglement and nonlocal correlations available in a quantum-controlled system facilitate novel fundamental tests of quantum theory. In addition, they enable numerous applications in distributed quantum information processing, quantum communication, and precision measurement. While pioneering experiments have demonstrated the entanglement of two quantum nodes separated by up to 1.3 km, and three nodes in the same laboratory, accessing the full potential of quantum networks requires scaling of these prototypes to many more nodes and global distances. This is an outstanding challenge, posing high demands on qubit control fidelity, qubit coherence time, and coupling efficiency between stationary and flying qubits. This Colloquium describes how optical resonators facilitate quantum network nodes that achieve the aforementioned prerequisites in different physical systems (trapped atoms, defect centers in wide-band-gap semiconductors, and rare-earth dopants) by enabling high-fidelity qubit initialization and readout, efficient generation of qubit-photon and remote qubit-qubit entanglement, and quantum gates between stationary and flying qubits. These advances open a realistic perspective toward the implementation of global-scale quantum networks in the near future.

TI All-optical long-distance quantum communication with
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum repeaters are a promising platform for realizing long-distance quantum communication and thus could form the backbone of a secure quantum internet, a scalable quantum network, or a distributed quantum computer. Repeater protocols that encode information in single- or multiphoton states are limited by transmission losses and the cost of implementing entangling gates or Bell measurements. In this work, we consider implementing a quantum repeater protocol using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits. These qubits are natural elements for quantum repeater protocols, because they allow for deterministic Gaussian entangling operations and Bell measurements, which can be implemented at room temperature. The GKP encoding is also capable of correcting small displacement errors. At the cost of additional Gaussian noise, photon loss can be converted into a random displacement error channel by applying a phase-insensitive amplifier. Here we show that a similar conversion can be achieved in two-way repeater protocols by using phase-sensitive amplification applied in the postprocessing of the measurement data, resulting in less overall Gaussian noise per (sufficiently short) repeater segment. We also investigate concatenating the GKP code with higher-level qubit codes while leveraging analog syndrome data, postselection, and path-selection techniques to boost the rate of communication. We compute the secure key rates and find that GKP repeaters can achieve a comparative performance relative to methods based on photonic qubits while using orders-of-magnitude fewer qubits.

TI Random-Access Quantum Memory Using Chirped Pulse Phase Encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB As in conventional computing, memories for quantum information benefit from high storage density and, crucially, random access, or the ability to read from or write to an arbitrarily chosen register. However, achieving such random access with quantum memories in a dense, hardware-efficient manner remains a challenge. Here we introduce a protocol using chirped pulses to encode qubits within an ensemble of quantum two-level systems, offering both random access and naturally supporting dynamical decoupling to enhance the memory lifetime. We demonstrate the protocol in the microwave regime using donor spins in silicon coupled to a superconducting cavity, storing up to four weak, coherent microwave pulses in distinct memory modes and retrieving them on demand up to 2 ms later. This approach offers the potential for microwave random access quantum memories with lifetimes exceeding seconds, while the chirped pulse phase encoding could also be applied in the optical regime to enhance quantum repeaters and networks.

TI Constrained optimization via quantum Zeno dynamics
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The paper presents an approach for solving optimization problems with multiple arbitrary constraints on quantum computers by combining quantum Zeno dynamics with common quantum optimization algorithms like QAOA. The number of Zeno measurements required is shown to be independent of the problem size in QAOA.
   Constrained optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and industry. Quantum algorithms have shown promise in solving optimization problems, yet none of the current algorithms can effectively handle arbitrary constraints. We introduce a technique that uses quantum Zeno dynamics to solve optimization problems with multiple arbitrary constraints, including inequalities. We show that the dynamics of quantum optimization can be efficiently restricted to the in-constraint subspace on a fault-tolerant quantum computer via repeated projective measurements, requiring only a small number of auxiliary qubits and no post-selection. Our technique has broad applicability, which we demonstrate by incorporating it into the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and variational quantum circuits for optimization. We evaluate our method numerically on portfolio optimization problems with multiple realistic constraints and observe better solution quality and higher in-constraint probability than state-of-the-art techniques. We implement a proof-of-concept demonstration of our method on the Quantinuum H1-2 quantum processor.

TI Single ion qubit with estimated coherence time exceeding one hour
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Realizing a long coherence time quantum memory is a major challenge of current quantum technology. Until now, the longest coherence-time of a single qubit was reported as 660 s in a single Yb-171(+) ion-qubit through the technical developments of sympathetic cooling and dynamical decoupling pulses, which addressed heating-induced detection inefficiency and magnetic field fluctuations. However, it was not clear what prohibited further enhancement. Here, we identify and suppress the limiting factors, which are the remaining magnetic-field fluctuations, frequency instability and leakage of the microwave reference-oscillator. Then, we observe the coherence time of around 5500 s for the Yb-171(+) ion-qubit, which is the time constant of the exponential decay fit from the measurements up to 960 s. We also systematically study the decoherence process of the quantum memory by using quantum process tomography and analyze the results by applying recently developed resource theories of quantum memory and coherence. Our experimental demonstration will accelerate practical applications of quantum memories for various quantum information processing, especially in the noisy-intermediate-scale quantum regime. Extending qubit coherence times represent one of the key challenges for quantum technologies. Here, after properly suppressing magnetic-field fluctuations, frequency instability and leakage of the microwave reference-oscillator, the authors infer coherence times of 5500 s for an Yb ion qubit.

TI Quantum Hardware Devices (QHDs): Opportunities and Challenges
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Hardware Devices (QHDs) have marked a revolutionary leap in computational power, harnessing the principles of superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference to surpass classical processing capabilities. This review focuses on the core building blocks of quantum computing qubits, quantum gates, registers, and chipsets, while emphasizing the pivotal role of advanced architectures, such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), in optimizing quantum information processing. Despite their transformative potential, QHDs face critical hurdles, such as decoherence, Quantum Error Correction (QEC), scalability, and seamless integration with classical computing systems. Overcoming these challenges requires breakthroughs in materials science, cryogenic engineering, and quantum error mitigation. In addition, the development of high-fidelity quantum processors is essential for building robust Quantum Computing Systems (QCS) capable of solving problems beyond the reach of classical computation. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Emerging Quantum Technologies (EQT), examining their profound impact on cryptography, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Quantum Simulation (QS), and Secure Communication (SC). By reviewing state-of-the-art research and engineering innovations, we outline the roadmap for transitioning from experimental prototypes to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum systems, paving the way for the next era of computing.

TI Blind oracular quantum computation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In the standard oracle model, an oracle efficiently evaluates an unknown classical function independent of the quantum algorithm itself. Quantum algorithms have a complex interrelationship to their oracles; for example the possibility of quantum speedup is affected by the manner by which oracles are implemented. Therefore, it is physically meaningful to separate oracles from their quantum algorithms, and we introduce one such separation here. We define the blind oracular quantum computation (BOQC) scheme, in which the oracle is a distinct node in a quantum network. Our work augments the client-server setting of quantum computing, in which a powerful quantum computer server is available on the network for discreet use by clients on the network with low quantum power. In BOQC, an oracle is another client that cooperates with the main client so that an oracular quantum algorithm is run on the server. The cooperation between the main client and the oracle takes place (almost) without communication. We prove BOQC to be blind: the server cannot learn anything about the clients' computation. This proof is performed within the composable security definitions provided by the formalism of abstract cryptography. We enhance the BOQC scheme to be runnable with minimal physical qubits when run on a solid-state quantum network; we prove that this scheme, which we refer to as BOQCo (BOQC-optimized), possesses the same security as BOQC.

We discuss and classify attacks on quantum repeaters, which will serve roles similar to those of classical Internet routers. We have modeled the components for and structure of quantum repeater network nodes. With this model, we point out attack vectors, then analyze attacks in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. While we are reassured about the promises of quantum networks from the confidentiality point of view, integrity and availability present new vulnerabilities not present in classical networks and require care to handle properly. We observe that the requirements on the classical computing/networking elements affect the systems' overall security risks. This component-based analysis establishes a framework for further investigation of network-wide vulnerabilities.

TI Identifying Electronic Transitions of Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
   for Quantum Memories
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB A quantum memory is a crucial keystone for enabling large-scale quantum networks. Applicable to the practical implementation, specific properties, i.e., long storage time, selective efficient coupling with other systems, and a high memory efficiency are desirable. Though many quantum memory systems are developed thus far, none of them can perfectly meet all requirements. This work herein proposes a quantum memory based on color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), where its performance is evaluated based on a simple theoretical model of suitable defects in a cavity. Employing density functional theory calculations, 257 triplet and 211 singlet spin electronic transitions are investigated. Among these defects, it is found that some defects inherit the Lambda electronic structures desirable for a Raman-type quantum memory and optical transitions can couple with other quantum systems. Further, the required quality factor and bandwidth are examined for each defect to achieve a 95% writing efficiency. Both parameters are influenced by the radiative transition rate in the defect state. In addition, inheriting triplet-singlet spin multiplicity indicates the possibility of being a quantum sensing, in particular, optically detected magnetic resonance. This work therefore demonstrates the potential usage of hBN defects as a quantum memory in future quantum networks.

TI Diagrammatic technique for simulation of large-scale quantum repeater

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a detailed description of the diagrammatic technique for a semianalytical description of large-scale quantum repeater networks devised recently by V. V. Kuzmin et al. [npj Quantum Inf. 5, 115 (2019)]. The technique takes into account all essential experimental imperfections, including continuous dissipative Liouville dynamics of the network quantum memories and the classical communication delays. The results obtained with the semianalytic method match the exact Monte Carlo simulations while the required computational resources scale only linearly with the network size, thus allowing for precise comparison and optimization of large-scale quantum networks subjected to relevant realistic imperfections. We illustrate the potential of the method by optimizing the secret key rate in one- and two-dimensional quantum networks for a range of network sizes and memory coherence times. The presented approach opens new possibilities for the development and efficient optimization of future quantum networks.

AB Employing the scattering-Lindblad-Hamiltonian formalism description of quantum network theory, we model the general problem of quantum state transfer between two disparate quantum memory blocks in an open quantum system. We derive an analytical expression for the fidelity of quantum state transfer between the memory blocks under the action of a specific phase space trajectory for each of the relevant classical control fields. We find a set of trajectories that maximize the state transfer fidelity between asymmetric systems. We show that, for the example where the mechanical modes of two optomechanical oscillators act as the quantum memory blocks, their optical modes and a waveguide channel connecting them can be used to achieve a quantum state transfer fidelity of 96% with realistic parameters using our optimal control solution. The effects of the intrinsic losses and the asymmetries in the physical memory parameters are discussed quantitatively.

This can, however, be an overzealous constraint that greatly limits the expressivity of the circuit, especially in the case of continuous symmetries. We propose an alternative paradigm for the symmetry-informed construction of variational quantum circuits, based on homogeneous spaces, relaxing the overly stringent requirement of equivariance. We achieve this by introducing horizontal quantum gates, which only transform the state with respect to the directions orthogonal to those of the symmetry. We show that horizontal quantum gates are much more expressive than equivariant gates, and thus can solve problems that equivariant circuits cannot. For instance, a circuit comprised of horizontal gates can find the ground state of an SU(2 )-symmetric model where the ground state spin sector is unknown-a task where equivariant circuits fall short. Moreover, for a particular subclass of horizontal gates based on symmetric spaces, we can obtain efficient circuit decompositions for our gates through the KAK theorem. Finally, we highlight a particular class of horizontal quantum gates that behave similarly to general SU(4) gates, while achieving a quadratic reduction in the number of parameters for a generic problem.

TI Advances in Continuous⁃Variable Entanglement⁃Assisted Quantum
   Communication (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Quantum communication is an important research direction in quantum technology and is moving toward practical quantum communication systems and quantum networks. Entanglement-assisted quantum communication can complete quantum communication tasks that classical communication systems cannot accomplish and has yielded significant advances in recent years. Continuous-variable quantum communication systems based on quantum optical fields have advantages such as deterministic generation of quantum entanglement and high compatibility with classical optical communication systems, holding important application prospects in quantum communication. We briefly introduce the basic principles and progress of three key communication protocols in continuous-variable entanglement-assisted quantum communication, including quantum key distribution, quantum dense coding, and quantum teleportation, and discuss the problems and challenges facing continuous-variable entanglement-assisted quantum communication. Progress The research team at Shanxi University proposed the two-way quantum key distribution scheme based on continuous-variable entangled states in 2006, and subsequently experimentally realized continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on Einstein?Podolsky?Rosen (EPR) entangled states without signal modulation. Madsen et al. achieved the proof-of-principle verification of continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on modulated entangled states, and the transmission distance was extended over 50 km by Shanxi University's research team. Pirandola et al. extended the continuous-variable two-way quantum key distribution protocol that enhances the security threshold via bidirectional quantum communication. Furthermore, Mele et al. examined the tolerable excess noise limit in continuous-variable two-way quantum key distribution and determined the maximum transmission loss sustainable by continuous-variable quantum key distribution without the utilization of relays. Recently, it has been proven that by relaxing the trust premise on a subset of devices, when one party's device is untrusted, the security of quantum key distribution can still be guaranteed, which is known as one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution. Gehring et al. achieved proof-of-principle verification of continuous-variable one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution based on the EPR entangled state, and Walk et al. compared the performance of six kinds of one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution protocols. The concept of quantum dense coding was first proposed by Bennett and Wiesner. Zhang and Braunstein et al. extended quantum dense coding to the continuous-variable domain. Ralph et al. further studied the unconditional continuous-variable quantum dense coding and established the relationship between the channel capacity of dense coding (when different quantum states are employed) and the average photon number. In the aspect of experimental research, a series of significant progress has been made in continuous-variable quantum dense coding. The research teams at Shanxi University and the University of Tokyo verified the advantage of quantum dense coding in enhancing the channel capacity respectively. To further enhance the channel capacity of continuous-variable quantum dense coding, many teams have conducted experimental studies on multiplexed quantum dense coding. Currently, experimental verification of continuous-variable quantum dense coding based on two-component entangled optical fields has been achieved.
   However, the demonstration of quantum dense coding is limited to the proof-of-principle experiment, and it is urgent to verify the feasibility of quantum dense coding in practical quantum channels. Since the quantum teleportation scheme was first proposed by Bennett et al., it has caught extensive attention. In the theoretical research on continuous-variable quantum teleportation, researchers have established a comprehensive theoretical framework for quantum teleportation. In terms of experimental research, continuous-variable quantum teleportation has achieved a series of breakthroughs. Quantum teleportation of various quantum states, such as coherent states, squeezed states, entangled states, optical cat states, and optical qubits, has all been experimentally realized. In recent years, the fidelity of continuous-variable quantum teleportation has been improved with the advancement of experimental techniques, and it is gradually moving toward practical applications. The research teams at Shanxi University experimentally implemented continuous-variable quantum teleportation over 6 km and 10 km commercial fibers respectively, verifying the feasibility of continuous-variable quantum teleportation in fiber channels. Furthermore, to expand the bandwidth and channel capacity of quantum teleportation, the research team at East China Normal University realized all-optical quantum teleportation. Conclusions and Prospects We briefly introduce the basic principles and research progress of entanglement-assisted quantum communication based on continuous-variable entangled states, including entanglement-assisted continuous-variable quantum key distribution, quantum dense coding, and quantum teleportation. Currently, entanglement-assisted quantum communication is advancing toward quantum networks and practical application. In multi-user quantum communication based on multipartite entanglement, communication parties need the assistance of other users to complete communication tasks. Therefore, quantum communication based on multipartite entanglement usually manifests as controlled quantum communication. Additionally, the development of fiber-channel-based continuous-variable entanglement-assisted quantum communication is a crucial step for continuous-variable quantum communication to move toward practical applications.

TI Distributed quantum computing: A survey
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Nowadays, quantum computing has reached the engineering phase, with fully-functional quantum processors integrating hundreds of noisy qubits. Yet - to fully unveil the potential of quantum computing out of the labs into the business reality - the challenge ahead is to substantially scale the qubit number, reaching orders of magnitude exceeding thousands of fault-tolerant qubits. To this aim, the distributed quantum computing paradigm is recognized as the key solution for scaling the number of qubits. Indeed, accordingly to such a paradigm, multiple small-to-moderate-scale quantum processors communicate and cooperate for executing computational tasks exceeding the computational power of single processing devices. The aim of this survey is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open problems arising with distributed quantum computing from a computer and communications engineering perspective. Furthermore, this survey provides an easy access and guide towards the relevant literature and the prominent results in the field.

TI Normal quantum channels and Markovian correlated two-qubit quantum
   errors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study general 'normally' (Gaussian) distributed random unitary transformations. These distributions can be defined in terms of a diffusive random walk in the respective group manifold. On the one hand, a Gaussian distribution induces a unital quantum channel, which we will call 'normal'. On the other hand, the diffusive random walk defines a unital quantum process, generated by a Lindblad master equation. In the single qubit case, we show different distributions may induce the same quantum channel. In the case of two qubits, we study normal quantum channels, induced by Gaussian distributions in SU ( 2 ) circle times SU ( 2 ) . They provide an appropriate framework for modeling quantum errors with classical correlations. In contrast to correlated Pauli errors, for instance, they conserve their Markovianity, and they lead to very different results in error correcting codes. This is illustrated with an application to entanglement distillation.

TI Robustness of noisy quantum networks
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum networks are the equivalent of classical ones but the links and nodes obey the laws of quantum physics. Using a modified version of Bernoulli-percolation theory, the authors investigate the robustness of quantum networks for the purpose of entanglement distribution over large network structures, and establish the critical quantum-repeater efficiency necessary to avoid abrupt loss of connectivity.
   Quantum networks allow us to harness networked quantum technologies and to develop a quantum internet. But how robust is a quantum network when its links and nodes start failing? We show that quantum complex networks based on typical noisy quantum-repeater nodes are prone to discontinuous phase transitions with respect to the random loss of operating links and nodes, abruptly compromising the connectivity of the network, and thus significantly limiting the reach of its operation. Furthermore, we determine the critical quantum-repeater efficiency necessary to avoid this catastrophic loss of connectivity as a function of the network topology, the network size, and the distribution of entanglement in the network. From all the network topologies tested, a scale-free network topology shows the best promise for a robust large-scale quantum internet.

TI Simulation of satellite and optical link dynamics in a quantum repeater
   constellation
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum repeaters and satellite-based optical links are complementary technological approaches to overcome the exponential photon loss in optical fibers and thus allow quantum communication on a global scale. We analyze architectures which combine these approaches and use satellites as quantum repeater nodes to distribute entanglement to distant optical ground stations. Here we simulate dynamic, three-dimensional ground station passes, going beyond previous studies that typically consider static satellite links. For this, we numerically solve the equations of motion of the dynamic system consisting of three satellites in low Earth orbit. The model of the optical link takes into account atmospheric attenuation, single-mode fiber coupling, beam wandering and broadening, as well as adaptive optics effects. We derive analytical expressions for the Bell state measurement and associated error rates for quantum memory assisted communications, including retrieval efficiency and state coherence. We consider downlink and uplink architectures for continental and intercontinental connections and evaluate the impact of satellite altitude and inter-satellite distance on the expected entanglement swapping rate. Our simulation model enables us to design different orbital configurations for the satellite constellation and analyze the annual performance of the quantum repeater under realistic conditions.

TI Local available quantum correlations of non-symmetric X-states
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B
AB Local available quantum correlations (LAQC), as defined by Mundarain et al., are analyzed for nonsymmetric 2-qubit X states, that is, X states that are not invariant under the exchange of subsystems and therefore have local Bloch vectors whose norms are different. A simple analytic expression for their LAQC quantifier is obtained. As an example, we analyze the local application of the amplitude damping channel for Werner states and general X states. Although this local quantum channel can create quantum discord in some cases, no such outcome is possible for LAQC, which hints toward their monotonicity under LOCC operations. This work, along with our previous result for the so-called symmetric and anti-symmetric X states, completes the pursuit of exact analytical expressions for the LAQC quantifier for 2-qubit X states.

TI Bidirectional multi-nodes quantum teleportation using discrete-time
   quantum walk
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We suggest a new technique for bidirectional quantum teleportation (BQT) that combines coherent-state encoding with discrete-time quantum walks to allow two users to communicate quantum information simultaneously. Our method enables Alice and Bob to simultaneously teleport quantum states to one another within a single protocol, as compared to unidirectional teleportation, which only transmits quantum states in one direction. To allow for a qubit-like representation and fidelity analysis using Bloch vector formalism, the quantum information is encoded using non-orthogonal coherent states that are converted into an orthonormal basis of even and odd Schr & ouml;dinger cat states. Four different quantum walk steps, each acting on a three-part quantum system made up of position and coin spaces, drive the teleportation process. We use density matrix overlaps in the even-odd basis to derive closed-form formulas for teleportation fidelity in both directions analytically. Using the SeQUeNCe discrete-event simulator, we simulate large-scale quantum network settings with realistic limitations, including photon loss, memory decoherence, entanglement swapping degradation, and various channel capacities in order to evaluate the potential of our approach. We evaluate quantum memory utilization, throughput, and end-to-end fidelity in various network topologies and scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that BQT allows symmetric communication with strong fidelity, particularly in high-capacity and large-scale network situations, but requires a greater resource overhead than unidirectional protocols. The hybrid framework developed in this study offers a scalable and analytically simple solution for next-generation quantum communication systems by combining discrete-time quantum evolution with continuous-variable state encoding.

TI Hierarchical qubit maps and hierarchically implemented quantum error
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider hierarchically implemented quantum error correction (HI-QEC), in which the fidelities of logical qubits are differentially optimized to enhance the capabilities of quantum devices in scientific applications. By employing qubit representations that propagate hierarchies in simulated systems to those in logical qubit noise sensitivities, heterogeneity in the distribution of physical-to-logical qubits can be systematically structured. For concreteness, we estimate HI-QEC's impact on surface code resources in computing low-energy observables to fixed precision, finding up to approximately 60% reductions in qubit requirements plausible in early error-corrected simulations. Hierarchical qubit maps are also possible without error correction in qubit and qudit systems where fidelities are nonuniform, either unintentionally or by design. Hierarchical optimizations are another element in the codesign process of quantum computations, including quantum simulations for nuclear and particle physics.

TI Improving quantum simulation efficiency of final state radiation with
   dynamic quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB B. Nachman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 062001 (2021)] recently introduced an algorithm (QPS) for simulating parton showers with intermediate flavor states using polynomial resources on a digital quantum computer. We make use of a new quantum hardware capability called dynamical quantum computing to improve the scaling of this algorithm, which significantly improves the method precision. In particular, we modify the quantum parton shower circuit to incorporate midcircuit qubit measurements, resets, and quantum operations conditioned on classical information. This reduces the computational depth from O(N-5 log(2)(N)(2)) to O(N-3 log(2)(N)(2)) and the qubit requirements from O(N log(2)(N)) to O(N). Using "matrix product state" state vector simulators, we demonstrate that the improved algorithm yields expected results for 2, 3, 4, and 5-steps of the algorithm. We compare absolute costs with the original QPS algorithm, and show that dynamical quantum computing can significantly reduce costs in the class of digital quantum algorithms representing quantum walks (which includes the QPS). Python code that implements QPS, both with and without dynamic gates, is publicly available on Github.

TI A prototype of quantum von Neumann architecture
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB A modern computer system, based on the von Neumann architecture, is a complicated system with several interactive modular parts. It requires a thorough understanding of the physics of information storage, processing, protection, readout, etc. Quantum computing, as the most generic usage of quantum information, follows a hybrid architecture so far, namely, quantum algorithms are stored and controlled classically, and mainly the executions of them are quantum, leading to the so-called quantum processing units. Such a quantum-classical hybrid is constrained by its classical ingredients, and cannot reveal the computational power of a fully quantum computer system as conceived from the beginning of the field. Recently, the nature of quantum information has been further recognized, such as the no-programming and no-control theorems, and the unifying understandings of quantum algorithms and computing models. As a result, in this work, we propose a model of a universal quantum computer system, the quantum version of the von Neumann architecture. It uses ebits (i.e. Bell states) as elements of the quantum memory unit, and qubits as elements of the quantum control unit and processing unit. As a digital quantum system, its global configurations can be viewed as tensor-network states. Its universality is proved by the capability to execute quantum algorithms based on a program composition scheme via a universal quantum gate teleportation. It is also protected by the uncertainty principle, the fundamental law of quantum information, making it quantum-secure and distinct from the classical case. In particular, we introduce a few variants of quantum circuits, including the tailed, nested, and topological ones, to characterize the roles of quantum memory and control, which could also be of independent interest in other contexts. In all, our primary study demonstrates the manifold power of quantum information and paves the way for the creation of quantum computer systems in the near future.

TI Applicability of measurement-based quantum computation towards
   physically-driven variational quantum eigensolver
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Variational quantum algorithms are considered one of the most promising methods for obtaining near-term quantum advantages; however, most of these algorithms are only expressed in the conventional quantum circuit scheme. The roadblock to developing quantum algorithms with the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) scheme is resource cost. Recently, we discovered that the realization of multi-qubit rotation operations only requires a constant number of single-qubit measurements with the MBQC scheme, providing a potential advantage in terms of resource cost. The structure of the Hamiltonian variational ansatz aligns well with this characteristic. Thus, we propose an efficient measurement-based quantum algorithm for quantum many-body system simulation tasks, called measurement-based Hamiltonian variational ansatz (MBHVA). We then demonstrate its effectiveness, efficiency, and advantages with the two-dimensional Heisenberg model and the Fermi-Hubbard chain. Numerical experiments show that MBHVA can have similar performance as circuit-based ansatz, and is expected to reduce operation counts during execution compared to quantum circuits, bringing the advantage of running time. We conclude that the MBQC scheme is potentially feasible for achieving near-term quantum advantages in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, especially in the presence of large multi-qubit rotation operations.

TI A perspective on the pathway to a scalable quantum internet using
   rare-earth ions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The ultimate realization of a global quantum internet will require advances in scalable technologies capable of generating, storing, and manipulating quantum information. The essential devices that will perform these tasks in a quantum network are quantum repeaters, which will enable the long-range distribution of entanglement between distant network nodes. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the primary functions of a quantum repeater and discuss progress that has been made toward the development of repeaters with rare-earth ion doped materials while noting challenges that are being faced as the technologies mature. We give particular attention to erbium, which is well suited for networking applications. Finally, we provide a discussion of near-term benchmarks that can further guide rare-earth ion platforms for impact in near-term quantum networks.

TI Fault-Tolerant Coding for Quantum Communication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Designing encoding and decoding circuits to reliably send messages over many uses of a noisy channel is a central problem in communication theory. When studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented using noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term future for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum gates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of quantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the study of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum capacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits are affected by gate errors with small probability. Our main results are threshold theorems for the classical and quantum capacity: For every quantum channel T and every is an element of > 0 there exists a threshold p(is an element of, T) for the gate error probability below which rates larger than C-is an element of are fault-tolerantly achievable with vanishing overall communication error, where C denotes the usual capacity. Our results are not only relevant in communication over large distances, but also on-chip, where distant parts of a quantum computer might need to communicate under higher levels of noise than affecting the local gates.

TI Quantum machine learning: from physics to software engineering
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB Quantum machine learning is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of quantum technology and artificial intelligence. This review provides a two-fold overview of several key approaches that can offer advancements in both the development of quantum technologies and the power of artificial intelligence. Among these approaches are quantum-enhanced algorithms, which apply quantum software engineering to classical information processing to improve keystone machine learning solutions. In this context, we explore the capability of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to improve model generalization and increase accuracy while reducing computational resources. We also illustrate how machine learning can be used both to mitigate the effects of errors on presently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, and to understand quantum advantage via an automatic study of quantum walk processes on graphs. In addition, we review how quantum hardware can be enhanced by applying machine learning to fundamental and applied physics problems as well as quantum tomography and photonics. We aim to demonstrate how concepts in physics can be translated into practical engineering of machine learning solutions using quantum software.

TI Networking quantum networks with minimum cost aggregation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A quantum version of an internet, called a quantum internet, holds promise for achieving distributed quantum sensing and large-scale quantum computer networks, as well as quantum communication among arbitrary clients all over the globe. The main building block is efficient distribution of entanglement-entangled bits (ebits)-between arbitrary clients in a quantum network with error bounded by a constant, irrespective of their distance. In practice, this should be accomplished across multiple self-organising quantum networks, analogously to what the current internet does in conventional communication. Here we present a practical recipe on how to efficiently give arbitrary clients ebits with error bounded by a constant, regardless of their distance, across multiple quantum networks. This recipe is composed of two new concepts, minimum cost aggregation and network concatenation. Our recipe forms the necessary basis of designing a quantum internet protocol for networking self-organising quantum networks to make a global-scale quantum internet.

TI Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in quantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.

AB While scalable, fully error corrected quantum computing is years or even decades away, there is considerable interest in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing (NISQ). In this paper, we introduce the ArsoNISQ framework that determines the tolerable error rate of a given quantum algorithm computation, i.e. quantum circuits, and the success probability of the computation given a success criterion and a NISQ computer. ArsoNISQ is based on simulations of quantum circuits subject to errors according to the Pauli error model.
   ArsoNISQ was evaluated on a set of quantum algorithms that can incur a quantum speedup or are otherwise relevant to NISQ computing. Despite optimistic expectations in recent literature, we did not observe quantum algorithms with intrinsic robustness, i.e. algorithms that tolerate one error on average, in this evaluation. The evaluation demonstrated, however, that the quantum circuit size sets an upper bound for its tolerable error rate and quantified the difference in tolerate error rates for quantum circuits of similar sizes. Thus, the framework can assist quantum algorithm developers in improving their implementation and selecting a suitable NISQ computing platform. Extrapolating the results into the quantum advantage regime suggests that the error rate of larger quantum computers must decrease substantially or active quantum error correction will need to be deployed for most of the evaluated algorithms.

TI An L-band emitter with quantum memory in silicon
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Fluorescent centres in silicon have recently attracted great interest, owing to their remarkable properties for quantum technology. Here, we demonstrate that the C-centre in silicon can realise an optically readable quantum register in the L-band wavelength region where the transmission losses in commercial optical fibres are minimal. Our in-depth theoretical characterisation confirms the assignment of the C-centre to the carbon-oxygen interstitial pair defect. We further explore its magneto-optical properties, such as hyperfine and spin-orbit coupling constants from first principles calculations, which are crucial for tight control of the quantum states of the triplet electron spin. Based on this data, we set up quantum optics protocols to initialise and read out the quantum states of the electron spin, and realise a quantum memory by transferring quantum information from the electron spin to proximate Si-29 nuclear spins. Our findings establish an optically readable long-living quantum memory in silicon where the scalability of qubits may be achieved by CMOS-compatible technology.

TI Hungarian Qubit Assignment for Optimized Mapping of Quantum Circuits on
   Multi-Core Architectures
SO IEEE COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE LETTERS
AB Modular quantum computing architectures offer a promising alternative to monolithic designs for overcoming the scaling limitations of current quantum computers. To achieve scalability beyond small prototypes, quantum architectures are expected to adopt a modular approach, featuring clusters of tightly connected quantum bits with sparser connections between these clusters. Efficiently distributing qubits across multiple processing cores is critical for improving quantum computing systems' performance and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose the Hungarian Qubit Assignment (HQA) algorithm, which leverages the Hungarian algorithm to improve qubit-to-core assignment. The HQA algorithm considers the interactions between qubits over the entire circuit, enabling fine-grained partitioning and enhanced qubit utilization. We compare the HQA algorithm with state-of-the-art alternatives through comprehensive experiments using both real-world quantum algorithms and random quantum circuits. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach, outperforming existing methods, with an average improvement of 1.28x.

However, VQAs suffer from inefficient training methods. Here, we propose a pretraining strategy named near Clifford circuits warm start (NCC-WS) to find the initialization for parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in VQAs. We explored the expressibility of NCCs and the correlation between the expressibility and acceleration. The achieved results suggest that NCC-WS can find the correct initialization for the training of VQAs to achieve acceleration.

   sneakernet networks using neutral atom qLDPC memories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum entanglement is a vital phenomenon required for realizing secure quantum networks, so much that distributed entanglement can be reimagined as a commodity which can be traded to enable and maintain these networks. We explore the idea of commercializing entanglement-based cryptography and future applications where advanced quantum memory systems support less advanced users. We design a sneakernet-based quantum communication network with a central party connecting the users through delayed choice quantum entanglement swapping, using quantum low-density-parity-check (qLDPC) encoded qubits on neutral atoms. Our analysis compares this approach with traditional surface codes, demonstrating that qLDPC codes offer superior scaling in terms of resource efficiency and logical qubit count. We show that with near-term attainable patch sizes, one can attain medium- to high-fidelity correlations, motivating further research towards the long-term realization of large-scale commercial quantum networks.

AB Quantum state transfer is crucial for quantum information processing and quantum computation. Here, we propose a hybrid optomechanical system capable of coupling a qubit, an optical mode and a mechanical oscillator. The displacement of the mechanical oscillator, due to radiation pressure, induces spatial variation in the cavity field, which in turn couples the qubit with phonon mode. This allows state transfer between the cavity mode and the qubit without an actual interaction between them. We present a scheme for the transitionless quantum state transfer based on the transitionless quantum driving algorithm allowing us to achieve perfect state transfer. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum Computing: Foundations, Architecture and Applications
SO ENGINEERING REPORTS
AB Quantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to address computational problems that are intractable to classical systems. This study examines the evolution, architecture, and applications of the field, with a focus on foundational principles, hardware advancements, and algorithmic progress. Recent quantum processors, such as Google's Willow and IBM's Heron, represent significant advancements in qubit count and gate fidelity; however, they remain constrained by qubit instability, environmental noise, and limitations of current error correction techniques. Quantum algorithms, including Shor's, Grover's, and HHL algorithms, have demonstrated substantial speedups in cryptography, optimization, and machine learning. Nevertheless, the realization of this potential in real-world problems encounters major bottlenecks related to low qubit counts and error correction. Applications span domains such as cryptography, drug discovery, precision medicine, financial modeling, and materials science, in which quantum computation offers potential breakthroughs. However, the development of practical quantum systems presents a substantial challenge. Key programming languages, such as Q#, Qiskit, and Cirq, facilitate algorithmic development and deployment; however, the efficiency of current quantum algorithms is limited by hardware constraints. The future of quantum computing lies in interdisciplinary collaboration, the development of resource-efficient error-correction techniques, and continued hardware development. This study underscores the potential of quantum computing, while emphasizing the research and development required to fully harness its capabilities to address major scientific and technological challenges.

AB Qudits with a large Hilbert space to host quantum information are widely utilized in various applications, such as quantum simulation and quantum computation, but the manipulation and scalability of qudits still face challenges. Here, we propose a scheme to directly and locally transfer quantum information from multiple atomic qubits to a single qudit and vice versa in an optical cavity. With the qubit-qudit interaction induced by the cavity, our scheme can transfer quantum states efficiently and measurement-independently. In addition, this scheme can robustly generate a high-dimensional maximal entangled state with asymmetric particle numbers, showing its potential in realizing an entanglement channel. Such an information interface for qubits and qudit may have enlightening significance for future research on quantum systems in hybrid dimensions.

TI Experimental determination of tripartite quantum discord
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum discord is a measure of nonclassical correlations in quantum systems. While the bipartite version of quantum discord is experimentally well-studied, the multipartite version has never been convincingly measured. In this study, we experimentally investigate tripartite quantum discord using an NMR quantum information processor. Building on a theoretical framework for conditional projective measurements and quantum conditional mutual information, we quantify the tripartite quantum discord and its contributions in different three-qubit states such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and Werner (W) states as well as classical mixtures of biseparable Bell states, and classical mixtures of product states. The experiments employed full quantum state tomography and temporal averaging to prepare mixed states, achieving fidelities exceeding 95%. Our results confirm that quantum discord persists even in the absence of entanglement, highlighting its utility as a broader indicator of quantum correlations. Furthermore, we validate the nonconvexity of discord, confirming that classical mixtures of zero-discord states can exhibit nonzero discord. This experimentally confirms that quantum discord does not fit into the framework of resource theory. This work establishes a robust methodology for measuring quantum discord, illuminating the structure and distribution of quantum correlations in multipartite systems.

TI High-threshold and low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory
SO NATURE
AB The accumulation of physical errors 1-3 prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction 4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm 5 . We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes 6 . Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7% for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code 7-10 that for 20 years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1 million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000 physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.

TI Distributed Quantum Computing with Photons and Atomic Memories
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The promise of universal quantum computing requires scalable single- and inter-qubit control interactions. Currently, three of the leading candidate platforms for quantum computing are based on superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and neutral atom arrays. However, these systems have strong interaction with environmental and control noises that introduce decoherence of qubit states and gate operations. Alternatively, photons are well decoupled from the environment and have advantages of speed and timing for quantum computing. Photonic systems have already demonstrated capability for solving specific intractable problems like Boson sampling, but face challenges for practically scalable universal quantum computing solutions because it is extremely difficult for a single photon to "talk" to another deterministically. Here, a universal distributed quantum computing scheme based on photons and atomic-ensemble-based quantum memories is proposed. Taking the established photonic advantages, two-qubit nonlinear interaction is mediated by converting photonic qubits into quantum memory states and employing Rydberg blockade for the controlled gate operation. Spatial and temporal scalability of this scheme is demonstrated further. These results show photon-atom network hybrid approach can be a potential solution to universal distributed quantum computing.

TI Benchmarking quantum error-correcting codes on quasi-linear and
   central-spin processors
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We evaluate the performance of small error-correcting codes, which we tailor to hardware platforms of very different connectivity and coherence: on a superconducting processor based on transmon qubits and a spintronic quantum register consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Taking the hardware-specific errors and connectivity into account, we investigate the dependence of the resulting logical error rate on the platform features such as the native gates, native connectivity, gate times, and coherence times. Using a standard error model parameterized for the given hardware, we simulate the performance and benchmark these predictions with experimental results when running the code on the superconducting quantum device. The results indicate that for small codes, the quasi-linear layout of the superconducting device is advantageous. Yet, for codes involving multi-qubit controlled operations, the central-spin connectivity of the color centers enables lower error rates.

TI Monolithic Silicon Photonic Transceiver for 160 km Multi-Channel Quantum
   Entanglement Distribution in Fiber Network
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum entanglement transceivers (QETs) are essential enablers for scalable photonic quantum networks, supporting applications such as secure communication, distributed quantum sensing, and quantum computing. However, conventional QET implementations rely on bulk optics, consume high power, and suffer fidelity degradation over long-distance fiber links. Here, a silicon photonic integrated QET is proposed and demonstrated to distribute multi-channel quantum entanglement over standard single-mode fibers across a span from 0 to 160 km, without requiring dispersion compensation modules and extra off-chip spectral filters. This advancement is achieved through monolithic integration of interferometers, wavelength multiplexers, notch filters, and a tunable-linewidth micro-resonator photon source, which collectively minimize aggregate loss and optimize photon correlation time. The implemented system supports both time-bin and energy-time entanglement across three channels, exhibiting maximum Bell-state fidelities of 95.55%, 97.63%, and 95.08%, and energy-time interference visibilities of 99.17%, 99.40%, and 98.50%. Long-haul transmission experiments demonstrate a 91% time-bin entanglement fidelity over 80 km and a 95% energy-time interference raw visibility over 160 km. Furthermore, a 24-h stability test reveals an average visibility of 87.5%, even in the presence of polarization fluctuations. This work presents a scalable and cost-effective QET solution for large-scale photonic quantum networks, advancing the development of integrated quantum communication infrastructures.

TI Quantum error correction below the surface code threshold
SO NATURE
AB Quantum error correction(1-4) provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, in which the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of Lambda=2.14 +/- 0.02 when increasing the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143%+/- 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 +/- 0.3. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately once every hour or 3x10(9) cycles. Our results indicate device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.

TI Resource analysis of quantum computing with noisy qubits for Shor's
   factoring algorithms
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We decompose two implementations of Shor's algorithm for prime factorization into universal gate units at the logical level and predict the number of physical qubits and execution time when surface codes are used. Logical qubit encoding using a rotated surface code and logical qubits with all-to-all connectivity are assumed. We express the number of physical qubits and execution time in terms of the bit length of the number to be factorized and error rate of the physical quantum gate. We confirm the relationship between the number of qubits and the execution time by analyzing two algorithms using various bit lengths and physical gate error rates .

TI Faithfully Simulating Near-Term Quantum Repeaters
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum repeaters have long been established to be essential for distributing entanglement over long distances. Consequently, their experimental realization constitutes a core challenge of quantum communication. However, there are numerous open questions about implementation details for realistic near-term experimental setups. In order to assess the performance of realistic repeater protocols, here we present ReQuSim, a comprehensive Monte Carlo-based simulation platform for quantum repeaters that faithfully includes loss and models a wide range of imperfections such as memories with time-dependent noise. Our platform allows us to perform an analysis for quantum repeater setups and strategies that go far beyond known analytical results: This refers to being able to both capture more realistic noise models and analyze more complex repeater strategies. We present a number of findings centered around the combination of strategies for improving performance, such as entanglement purification and the use of multiple repeater stations, and demonstrate that there exist complex relationships between them. We stress that numerical tools such as ours are essential to model complex quantum communication protocols aimed at contributing to the quantum Internet.

TI On-Chip Quantum Memory Based on Rare-Earth-Ion-Doped Solid-State
   Materials (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB On-chip quantum memory is essential for the development of large-scale quantum networks. To date, such memories have been demonstrated in a variety of solid-state systems, including color centers, quantum dots, optomechanical devices, and rare-earth-ion-doped solid-state materials. Among these, rare-earth-doped materials are considered one of the most promising candidates for on-chip quantum memories, offering the potential for long storage times, high storage efficiency, large bandwidth, and large multimode capacity. Furthermore, they can be connected with other on-chip photonic quantum components to realize an integrated multifunctional quantum architecture. This article reviews various on-chip quantum memory systems, with a particular focus on recent advances in rare-earth-doped on-chip quantum memories, categorized by different device fabrication approaches.

TI Qutrit circuits and algebraic relations: A pathway to efficient spin-1
   Hamiltonian simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum information processing has witnessed significant advancements through the application of qubitbased techniques within universal gate sets. Recently, exploration beyond the qubit paradigm to d-dimensional quantum units or qudits has opened new avenues for improving computational efficiency. This paper delves into the qudit-based approach, particularly addressing the challenges presented in the high-fidelity implementation of qudit-based circuits due to increased complexity. As an innovative approach towards enhancing qudit circuit fidelity, we explore algebraic relations, such as the Yang-Baxter-like turnover equation, which may enable circuit compression and optimization. The paper introduces the turnover relation for the three-qutrit time propagator and its potential use in reducing circuit depth. We further investigate whether this relation can be generalized for higher-dimensional quantum circuits, including a focused study on the one-dimensional spin-1 Heisenberg model. Our paper outlines both rigorous and numerically efficient approaches to potentially achieve this generalization, providing a foundation for further explorations in the field of qudit-based quantum computing.

TI Field programmable spin arrays for scalable quantum repeaters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Applications of solid-state qubits in large-scale quantum networks are limited by power and density constraints associated with microwave driving. Here the authors propose a programmable architecture based on diamond color centers driven by electric or strain fields for reduced cross-talk and power consumption.
   The large scale control over thousands of quantum emitters desired by quantum network technology is limited by the power consumption and cross-talk inherent in current microwave techniques. Here we propose a quantum repeater architecture based on densely-packed diamond color centers (CCs) in a programmable electrode array, with quantum gates driven by electric or strain fields. This 'field programmable spin array' (FPSA) enables high-speed spin control of individual CCs with low cross-talk and power dissipation. Integrated in a slow-light waveguide for efficient optical coupling, the FPSA serves as a quantum interface for optically-mediated entanglement. We evaluate the performance of the FPSA architecture in comparison to a routing-tree design and show an increased entanglement generation rate scaling into the thousand-qubit regime. Our results enable high fidelity control of dense quantum emitter arrays for scalable networking.

SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB As the world prepares for the advent of 6G networks, quantum technologies are becoming critical enablers of the next generation of communication systems. This survey paper investigates the convergence of quantum technologies and 6G networks, focusing on their applications, opportunities and challenges. We begin with an examination of the motivations for integrating quantum technologies into 6G, investigating the potential to overcome the limits of classical computing and cryptography. We then highlight key research gaps, particularly in quantum communication, quantum computing integration and security enhancement. A comprehensive overview of quantum technologies relevant to 6G, including quantum communication devices, quantum computing paradigms, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches is provided. A particular focus is on the role of quantum technologies in enhancing 6G Radio Access Networks (RAN), 6G core and edge network optimization, and 6G security. The survey paper also explores the application of quantum cryptography with a focus on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) and quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms and assesses their implementation challenges and potential impact on 6G networks. We also discuss the significant challenges associated with integrating quantum technologies into existing communications infrastructures, including issues of technological maturity, standardization, and economic considerations. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from current research and outline future research directions to guide the ongoing development of quantum-enabled 6G networks.

TI Quantum Internet-Applications, Functionalities, Enabling Technologies,
   Challenges, and Research Directions
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB The advanced notebooks, mobile phones, and Internet applications in today's world that we use are all entrenched in classical communication bits of zeros and ones. Classical Internet has laid its foundation originating from the amalgamation of mathematics and Claude Shannon's theory of information. However, today's Internet technology is a playground for eavesdroppers. This poses a serious challenge to various applications that rely on classical Internet technology, and it has motivated the researchers to switch to new technologies that are fundamentally more secure. By exploring the quantum effects, researchers paved the way into quantum networks that provide security, privacy, and range of capabilities such as quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The realization of Quantum Internet (QI) requires quantum communication between various remote nodes through quantum channels guarded by quantum cryptographic protocols. Such networks rely upon quantum bits (qubits) that can simultaneously take the value of zeros and ones. Due to the extraordinary properties of qubits such as superposition, entanglement, and teleportation, it gives an edge to quantum networks over traditional networks in many ways. At the same time, transmitting qubits over long distances is a formidable task and extensive research is going on satellite-based quantum communication, which will deliver breakthroughs for physically realizing QI in near future. In this paper, QI functionalities, technologies, applications and open challenges have been extensively surveyed to help readers gain a basic understanding of the infrastructure required for the development of the global QI.

TI Simulating noisy quantum channels via quantum state preparation

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB In Xin et al (2017 Phys. Rev. A 96 062303) and Wei et al (2018 Sci. China Phys. Mech. Astron. 61 70311), the authors reported an algorithm to simulate, in a circuit-based quantum computer, a general quantum channel (QC). However, the application of their algorithm is limited because it entails the solution of intricate non-linear systems of equations in order to obtain the quantum circuit to be implemented for the simulation. Motivated by this issue, in this article we identify and discuss a simple way to implement the simulation of QCs on any d-level quantum system through quantum state preparation algorithms, that have received much attention in the quantum information science literature lately. We exemplify the versatility of our protocol applying it to most well known qubit QCs, to some qudit QCs, and to simulate the effect of Lorentz transformations on spin states. We also regard the application of our protocol for initial mixed states. Most of the given application examples are demonstrated using IBM's quantum computers.

TI Provable optimality of the square-tooth atomic frequency comb quantum
   memory
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memories are a promising technology for quantum repeater networks because they enable multi-mode, long-time, and high-fidelity storage of photons with on-demand retrieval. The optimization of the retrieval efficiency of an AFC memory is important because it strongly impacts the entanglement distribution rate in quantum networks. Despite initial theoretical analyses and recent experimental demonstrations, a rigorous proof of the universally optimal configuration for the highest AFC retrieval efficiency has not been presented. In this paper we present a simple analytical proof which shows that the optimized square tooth offers the highest retrieval efficiency among all tooth shapes, under the physical constraint of finite optical depth of an atomic ensemble. The optimality still holds when the non-zero background absorption and the finite optical linewidth of atoms are considered. We further compare square, Lorentzian and Gaussian tooth shapes to reinforce the practical advantage of the square-tooth AFC in retrieval efficiency. Our proof lays rigorous foundation for the recipe of creating optimal AFC under realistic experimental conditions.

TI Explaining quantum circuits with Shapley values: towards explainable
   quantum machine learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Methods of artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) have been growing ever more complex, and at the same time have more and more impact on people's lives. This leads to explainable AI (XAI) manifesting itself as an important research field that helps humans to better comprehend ML systems. In parallel, quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging with the ongoing improvement of quantum computing hardware combined with its increasing availability via cloud services. QML enables quantum-enhanced ML in which quantum mechanics is exploited to facilitate ML tasks, typically in the form of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources. Quantum gates constitute the building blocks of gate-based quantum hardware and form circuits that can be used for quantum computations. For QML applications, quantum circuits are typically parameterized and their parameters are optimized classically such that a suitably defined objective function is minimized. Inspired by XAI, we raise the question of the explainability of such circuits by quantifying the importance of (groups of) gates for specific goals. To this end, we apply the well-established concept of Shapley values. The resulting attributions can be interpreted as explanations for why a specific circuit works well for a given task, improving the understanding of how to construct parameterized (or variational) quantum circuits, and fostering their human interpretability in general. An experimental evaluation on simulators and two superconducting quantum hardware devices demonstrates the benefits of the proposed framework for classification, generative modeling, transpilation, and optimization. Furthermore, our results shed some light on the role of specific gates in popular QML approaches.

TI The role of localizable concurrence in quantum teleportation protocols
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Teleporting an unknown qubit state is a paradigmatic quantum information processing task revealing the advantage of quantum communication protocols over their classical counterpart. For a teleportation protocol using a Bell state as quantum channel, the resource has been identified to be the concurrence. However, for mixed multipartite states the lack of computable entanglement measures has made the identification of the quantum resource responsible for this advantage more challenging. Here, by building on previous results showing that localizable concurrence is the necessary resource for controlled quantum teleportation, we show that any teleportation protocol using an arbitrary multipartite state, that includes a Bell measurement, requires a nonvanishing localizable concurrence between two of its parties to perform better than the classical protocol. By first analyzing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) channel and GHZ measurement teleportation protocol, in the presence of GHZ-symmetric-preserving noise, we compare different multipartite entanglement measures with the fidelity of teleportation, and we find that the protocol performs better than the classical protocol when all multipartite entanglement measures vanish, except for the localizable concurrence. Finally, we extend our proof to an arbitrary teleportation protocol with an arbitrary multipartite entangled channel.

TI REDiP: Ranked Entanglement Distribution Protocol for the Quantum
   Internet
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB The distribution of entangled qubit pairs to end nodes is the key requirement of a quantum network to enable qubit state transmission through quantum teleportation. Existing protocols for entanglement distribution fix a specific swapping order on the involved quantum repeaters and delegate entanglement purification to upper-layer protocols. This limitation is problematic because entangled states tend to degrade due to quantum noise, and they cannot be purified if their fidelity (i.e., quality) falls below a certain threshold. It is therefore of the utmost importance to co-plan entanglement swapping and purification to achieve a target end-to-end fidelity. In this work, we present the Ranked Entanglement Distribution Protocol (REDiP), which overcomes the aforementioned limits by including the "ranks" mechanism to configure the ordering of both purification and entanglement swapping steps. We show how REDiP can easily be configured to implement custom entanglement swapping and purification strategies, including (but not restricted to) those adopted in two recent works. We also propose an algorithm to estimate the bandwidth to allocate on every link of the REDiP path, and we provide a set of guidelines on how REDiP ranks can be configured depending on user requirements and hardware configuration. Such guidelines are driven by original insights into purification performance. We conduct simulations to verify our results and assess the impact of different REDiP configurations on the performance of a repeater network, in terms of throughput and fidelity.

TI Secure Quantum Teleportation of Squeezed Thermal States
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum teleportation is a fundamental protocol in quantum information science. It represents a critical resource for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. We derive an analytical expression of the fidelity of teleportation of an input squeezed thermal state using for teleportation a bipartite Gaussian resource state shared between Alice and Bob. Each mode of the resource state is susceptible to the influence of the environment. We employ the characteristic function approach in conjunction with the covariance matrix formalism. The fidelity of teleportation is expressed in terms of input and resource state covariance matrices. We investigate, as an example, the feasibility of secure quantum teleportation of a squeezed thermal state using a two-mode resource state whose modes are placed in separate thermal baths. A successful quantum teleportation requires meeting two criteria: the presence of two-way quantum steering and a teleportation fidelity exceeding the classical threshold. The quantum steering is by nature asymmetric and has found applications in quantum cryptography and secure quantum teleportation. Weak squeezing and a high number of average thermal photons in the input states lead to an increase in the fidelity of teleportation. Generally, steering disappears much faster than the fidelity of teleportation decreases below its classical limit.

TI Quantum machine learning in high energy physics
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine learning has been used in high energy physics (HEP) for a long time, primarily at the analysis level with supervised classification. Quantum computing was postulated in the early 1980s as way to perform computations that would not be tractable with a classical computer. With the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing devices, more quantum algorithms are being developed with the aim at exploiting the capacity of the hardware for machine learning applications. An interesting question is whether there are ways to apply quantum machine learning to HEP. This paper reviews the first generation of ideas that use quantum machine learning on problems in HEP and provide an outlook on future applications.

TI Quantum memory assisted observable estimation
SO QUANTUM
AB The estimation of many-qubit observables is an essential task of quantum information processing. The generally applicable approach is to decompose the observables into weighted sums of multiqubit Pauli strings, i.e., tensor products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, which can readily be measured with low-depth Clifford circuits. The accumulation of shot noise in this approach, however, severely limits the achievable variance for a finite number of measurements. We introduce a novel method, dubbed coherent Pauli summation (CPS), that circumvents this limitation by exploiting access to a singlequbit quantum memory in which measurement information can be stored and accumulated. CPS offers a reduction in the required number of measurements for a given variance that scales linearly with the number of Pauli strings in the decomposed observable. Our work demonstrates how assist the operation of many-qubit quantum devices in a cardinal task.

TI Adaptive and Efficient Qubit Allocation Using Reinforcement Learning in
   Quantum Networks
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB Quantum entanglement brings high-speed and inherently privacy-preserving transmission for information communication in quantum networks. The qubit scarcity is an important issue that cannot be ignored in quantum networks due to the limited storage capacity of quantum devices, the short lifespan of qubits, and so on. In this article, we first formulate the qubit competition problem as the Cooperative-Qubit-Allocation-Problem (CQAP) by taking into account both the waiting time and the fidelity of end-to-end entanglement with the given transmission link set. We then model the CQAP as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to self-adaptively and cooperatively allocate qubits among quantum repeaters. Further, we introduce an Active Learning (AL) algorithm to improve the efficiency of the RL algorithm by reducing its trial-error times. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms, with 23.5 ms reduction on the average waiting time and 19.2 improvement on the average path maturity degree, respectively.

TI Multi-hop joint remote state preparation of general hybrid entangled
   multi-qudit states via distinct Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Joint Remote State Preparation provides a useful way to securely transfer the known quantum states to the distant nodes. However, the limitation of resources often leads to the quantum channels constructed by distributed entangled pairs being incompatible with the transmitted states. In order to overcome this problem, a novel Joint Remote State Preparation protocol was proposed for transmitting general multi-qudit states over quantum networks, providing a promising pathway to utilise the available Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) channels with different levels. Several scenarios under noisy environments were discussed and some properties of the fidelity when transmitting the multi-qudit state were demonstrated. It was demonstrated that both the prepared state and the kind of the noises could restrict the number of the participant nodes. Our scheme leverages the existing quantum resources, which addresses the issue of insufficient entanglement resources. This approach is easily adaptable to other quantum network structures, offering a potential solution for constructing a universal quantum network.
   We propose a novel JRSP protocol for transmitting general multi-qudit states over quantum networks, providing a promising pathway to utilize the available Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) channels with different levels. Firstly, we investigate the joint remote state preparation scheme with the same-level EPR pairs. Next, we generalize our scheme to the scenario where the prepared qudit states are incompatible with the EPR channels.image

TI Prospects for Legal Regulation of Quantum Communication
SO BRICS LAW JOURNAL
AB The leading countries across the world have entered the race to develop quantum technologies that will enable them to ensure their continued economic prosperity. Among these technologies, a special place is occupied by quantum communication, which is designed to ensure information security in an era where a quantum computer is capable of compromising a number of cryptography algorithms. In this article, this new digital technology includes quantum key distribution and encryption methods that are cryptographically resistant to a quantum computer. The study does not consider the regulation of the quantum communication sub-technology, the so-called "quantum internet," due to the technical limitations of the existing equipment. The authors note that their predictions about the cryptographic strength of encryption algorithms are based solely on modern knowledge about the capabilities of quantum computing and do not take into account its hidden potential, for example, in terms of cryptanalysis information systems based on a machine learning model generated by a quantum computer. Currently, the only data protection system that is not subject to quantum threats is the technology of quantum key distribution. In today's information and digital age, information security systems are an important element of critical infrastructure. Given the importance of these technologies, different states use different methods to regulate this field. This article puts forward and substantiates the hypothesis that the implementation of a combination of regulatory legal acts could have a greater positive impact on the development of quantum communication and ensure an acceptable level of information security in the post-quantum era. The analysis showed that a significant number of states and interstate associations are conducting research in this area, relying only on investment growth. This strategy has prevented any country from achieving the competencies of the People's Republic of China. The authors also analyzed the methods of legal support used by China, Russia, and other countries in the field of quantum communication, which made it possible to identify a model of legal regulation of quantum communication that stimulates this technology's development.

TI Enhanced quantum state transfer by circumventing quantum chaotic
   behavior
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The ability to realize high-fidelity quantum communication is one of the many facets required to build generic quantum computing devices. In addition to quantum processing, sensing, and storage, transferring the resulting quantum states demands a careful design that finds no parallel in classical communication. Existing experimental demonstrations of quantum information transfer in solid-state quantum systems are largely confined to small chains with few qubits, often relying upon non-generic schemes. Here, by using a superconducting quantum circuit featuring thirty-six tunable qubits, accompanied by general optimization procedures deeply rooted in overcoming quantum chaotic behavior, we demonstrate a scalable protocol for transferring few-particle quantum states in a two-dimensional quantum network. These include single-qubit excitation, two-qubit entangled states, and two excitations for which many-body effects are present. Our approach, combined with the quantum circuit's versatility, paves the way to short-distance quantum communication for connecting distributed quantum processors or registers, even if hampered by inherent imperfections in actual quantum devices.
   Faithful transfer of quantum states between different parts of a single complex quantum circuit will become more and more important as quantum computing devices grow in size. Here, the authors transfer single-qubit excitations, two-qubit entangled states, and two excitations across a 6 x 6 superconducting qubit device.

TI Fuzzy C-Means and Explainable AI for Quantum Entanglement Classification
   and Noise Analysis
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum entanglement plays a fundamental role in quantum mechanics, with applications in quantum computing. This study introduces a new approach that integrates quantum simulations, noise analysis, and fuzzy clustering to classify and evaluate the stability of quantum entangled states under noisy conditions. The Fuzzy C-Means clustering model (FCM) is applied to identify different categories of quantum states based on fidelity and entropy trends, allowing for a structured assessment of the impact of noise. The presented methodology follows five key phases: a simulation of the Bell state, the introduction of the noise channel (depolarization and phase damping), noise suppression using corrective operators, clustering-based state classification, and interpretability analysis using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. The results indicate that while moderate noise levels allow for partial state recovery, strong decoherence, particularly under depolarization, remains a major challenge. Rather than relying solely on noise suppression, a classification-based strategy is proposed to identify states that retain computational feasibility despite the effects of noise. This hybrid approach combining quantum-state classification with AI-based interpretability offers a new framework for assessing the resilience of quantum systems. The results have practical implications in quantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and the optimization of quantum technologies under realistic conditions.

TI Holographic limitations and corrections to quantum information protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We discuss the limitations imposed on entanglement distribution, quantum teleportation, and quantum communication by holographic bounds, such as the Bekenstein bound and Susskind's spherical entropy bound. For continuous-variable (CV) quantum information, we show how the naive application of holographic corrections disrupts well-established results. These corrections render perfect CV teleportation impossible, preclude uniform convergence in the teleportation simulation of lossy quantum channels, and impose a revised PirandolaLaurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bound for quantum communication. While these mathematical corrections do not immediately impact practical quantum technologies, they are critical for a deeper theoretical understanding of quantum information theory.

TI Effective implementation of nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates of
   cat-state qubits using an auxiliary qutrit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose an effective protocol for the implementation of nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates of cat-state qubits in Kerr-nonlinear resonators driven by two-photon squeezing drives. Coupling the Kerr-nonlinear resonators with an auxiliary qutrit with proper coupling strengths, the selective transition of the auxiliary qutrit is realized. The selective transition can be exploited in the implementation of a set of useful quantum gates, including the phase gates, the NOT gates, the controlled-phase gates, the controlled NOT gates, and the Toffoli gates. Numerical simulations show the implementations of different types of gates are robust against systematic errors, random noise, and decoherence. Therefore, the protocol may be helpful for robust and scalable quantum computation based on cat-state qubits.

TI Using Quantum Nodes Connected via the Quantum Cloud to Perform IoT
   Quantum Network
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB Computer networks consist of millions of nodes that need constant protection because of their continued vulnerability to attacks. Classical security methods for protecting such networks will not be effective enough if quantum computers become widespread. On the other hand, we can exploit the capabilities of quantum computing and communications to build a new quantum communication network. In this paper, we focused on enhancing the performance of the classical client-server Internet application. For this sake, we introduced a novel Internet of Things (IoT) quantum network that provides high security and Quality of Service (QoS) compared with the traditional IoT network. This can be achieved by adding quantum components to the traditional IoT network. Quantum counterpart nodes, channels, and servers are used. In order to establish a secure communication between the quantum nodes and the quantum server, we defined a new Communication Procedure (CP) for the suggested IoT quantum network. The currently available quantum computer has a small qubit size (from 50 to 433 qubits). The proposed IoT quantum network allows us to overcome this problem by concatenating the computation efforts of multiple quantum nodes (quantum processors).

TI Verifiable blind quantum computation over collective-noise
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Blind quantum computation(BQC) is a new type of secure quantum computation. In the natural environment, the qubits used in BQC will inevitably be affected by the noise, and the client cannot guarantee the correctness of computational results when the server is dishonest. This paper proposes a verifiable BQC over collective-noise based on quantum error correction to solve these two problems. Furthermore, the proposed protocol needs to expand Alice's quantum capabilities. The client makes single-qubit measurements on the qubits, encoded and transmitted by the server. As a result, they protect qubits used to compute and utilize single-qubits to verify.

TI Asymmetric Bidirectional Controlled Quantum Teleportation of Three- and
   Four-Qubit States
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we theoretically realize bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation by using ten-qubit entangled state method. This paper uses a case to introduce the specific process of realizing quantum teleportation: Alice sends an unknown four-qubit GHZ state to Bob, and Bob sends an arbitrary three-qubit GHZ state to Alice. In addition, Charlie controls the transfer to ensure the integrity of the protocol. A ten-qubit quantum channel is constructed and used in this paper. Then, the unitary matrix transformation is used to complete the communication protocol. The research results show that the communication protocol constructed in this paper is more efficient than most communication protocols.

TI Toward a Scalable Linear-Cavity Enhanced Warm-Vapor Photonic Quantum
   Memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The coherent storage, buffering and retrieval of photons in a quantum memory enables the scalable creation of photonic entangled states via linear optics and repeat-until success, unlocking applications in quantum communications and photonic quantum computing. Quantum memories based on off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA) in atomic vapors allow this storage to be broadband, noise free, and high efficiency. Here, we implement a cavity-enhanced ORCA memory with reduced footprint and reduced power requirements compared to conventional single-pass schemes. By combining a strong magnetic field with polarization control, we maintain a Doppler-free interaction and eliminate the need for optical pumping. Our design establishes the feasibility of large arrays of ultracompact, low-power, near-unit efficiency, noiseless quantum memories running at GHz bandwidth, without the need for atom trapping or cryogenics.

TI Enhancing quantum memories with light-matter interference
SO OPTICA
AB Future optical quantum technologies, such as quantum networks, distributed quantum computing and sensing, demand efficient, broadband quantum memories. However, achieving high efficiency without introducing noise, reducing bandwidth, or limiting scalability remains a challenge. Here, we present an approach to enhance quantum memory protocols by leveraging constructive light-matter interference, leading to an increase in memory efficiency without increasing atomic density or laser intensity. We implement this method in a Raman quantum memory in warm cesium vapor and achieve more than a threefold improvement in total efficiency, reaching (34.3 +/- 8.4)%, while retaining GHz-bandwidth operation and low noise levels. Numerical simulations predict that this approach can boost efficiencies in systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic ensembles, from 65% to beyond 96%, while in warm atomic vapors, it could reduce the laser intensity needed to reach a given efficiency by over an order-of-magnitude, exceeding 95% total efficiency. Furthermore, our method preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at high efficiencies. This protocol is applicable to various memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The generation and control of quantum correlations in high-dimensional systems is a major challenge in the present landscape of quantum technologies. Achieving such non-classical high-dimensional resources will potentially unlock enhanced capabilities for quantum cryptography, communication and computation. We propose a protocol that is able to attain entangled states of d-dimensional systems through a quantum-walk (QW)-based transfer & accumulate mechanism involving coin and walker degrees of freedom. The choice of investigating QW is motivated by their generality and versatility, complemented by their successful implementation in several physical systems. Hence, given the cross-cutting role of QW across quantum information, our protocol potentially represents a versatile general tool to control high-dimensional entanglement generation in various experimental platforms. In particular, we illustrate a possible photonic implementation where the information is encoded in the orbital angular momentum and polarization degrees of freedom of single photons.

TI Quantum Storage of Qubits in an Array of Independently Controllable
   Solid-State Quantum Memories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Random-access quantum memories may offer computational advantages for quantum computers and networks. In this paper, we advance arrays of solid-state quantum memories toward their usage as randomaccess quantum memory. We perform quantum storage of path and time-bin qubits implemented with weak coherent states at the single-photon level, in an array of ten temporally multiplexed memory cells with controllable addressing. The qubits can be stored in arbitrary combinations of memory cells, from which they are read out on demand. We find average fidelities of 95 & thorn;2-2 % for path qubits and 91 & thorn;2 qubits. The measured fidelities violate the classical bounds for both encodings and for all ten cells. We also sequentially store a time-bin qubit in two different memory cells, maintain both qubits simultaneously in the array, and perform a collective readout. The individual control paired with high storage fidelity represents a significant advance toward a solid-state random-access quantum memory for quantum repeaters and photonic quantum processors.

TI Subexponential rate versus distance with time-multiplexed quantum
   repeaters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum communications capacity using direct transmission over length-L optical fiber scales as R ti e-alpha L, where alpha is the fiber's loss coefficient. The rate achieved using a linear chain of quantum repeaters equipped with quantum memories, probabilistic Bell state measurements (BSMs), and switches used for spatial multiplexing, but no quantum error correction, was shown to surpass the direct-transmission capacity. However, this rate still decays exponentially with the end-to-end distance, viz., R ti e-s alpha L, with s < 1. We show that the introduction of temporal multiplexing-i.e., the ability to perform BSMs among qubits at a repeater node that were successfully entangled with qubits at distinct neighboring nodes at different time steps-leads to a subexponential rate-vs-distance scaling, i.e., R ti e-t root alpha L, which is not attainable with just spatial or spectral multiplexing. We evaluate analytical upper and lower bounds to this rate and obtain the exact rate by numerically optimizing the time-multiplexing block length and the number of repeater nodes. We further demonstrate that incorporating losses in the optical switches used to implement time multiplexing degrades the rate-vs-distance performance, eventually falling back to exponential scaling for very lossy switches. We also examine models for quantum memory decoherence and describe optimal regimes of operation to preserve the desired boost from temporal multiplexing. Quantum memory decoherence is seen to be more detrimental to the repeater's performance over switching losses.

TI Crosstalk Suppression for Fault-tolerant Quantum Error Correction with
   Trapped Ions
SO QUANTUM
AB Physical qubits in experimental quantum information processors are inevitably exposed to different sources of noise and imperfections, which lead to errors that typically accumulate hindering our ability to perform long computations reliably. Progress towards scalable and robust quantum computation relies on exploiting quantum error correction (QEC) to actively battle these undesired effects. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of crosstalk errors in a quantum-computing architecture based on a single string of ions confined by a radio-frequency trap, and manipulated by individually-addressed laser beams. This type of errors affects spectator qubits that, ideally, should remain unaltered during the application of single- and two-qubit quantum gates addressed at a different set of active qubits. We microscopically model crosstalk errors from first principles and present a detailed study showing the importance of using a coherent vs incoherent error modelling and, moreover, discuss strategies to actively suppress this crosstalk at the gate level. Finally, we study the impact of residual crosstalk errors on the performance of fault-tolerant QEC numerically, identifying the experimental target values that need to be achieved in near-term trapped-ion experiments to reach the break-even point for beneficial QEC with low-distance topological codes.

TI Quantum error correction near the coding theoretical bound
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits1. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits2, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes3 can approach channel capacity efficiently4. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound-a fundamental limit on quantum capacity-despite decades of research5, 6-7. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.

TI Routing in quantum networks with end-to-end knowledge
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Given the diverse array of physical systems available for quantum computing and the absence of a well-defined quantum Internet protocol stack, the design and optimisation of quantum networking protocols remain largely unexplored. To address this, the authors introduce an approach that facilitates the establishment of paths capable of delivering end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold, without requiring detailed knowledge of the quantum network's properties. In this study, the authors define algorithms that are specific instances of this approach and evaluate them in comparison to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and a fully knowledge-aware algorithm through simulations. The authors' results demonstrate that one of the proposed algorithms consistently outperforms the other methods in delivering paths above the fidelity threshold, across various network topologies and the number of source-destination pairs involved, while maintaining significant levels of fairness among the users and being robust to inaccurate estimations of the expected end-to-end fidelity.

TI Photonic variational quantum eigensolver for NISQ-compatible quantum
   technology
SO NANO CONVERGENCE
AB Quantum computers have the potential to deliver speed-ups for solving certain important problems that are intractable for classical counterparts, making them a promising avenue for advancing modern computation. However, many quantum algorithms require deep quantum circuits, which are challenging to implement on current noisy devices. To address this limitation, variational quantum algorithms have been actively developed, enabling practical quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Among them, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a leading approach for solving problems in quantum chemistry, many-body physics, and even integer factorization. The VQE algorithm can be implemented on various quantum hardware platforms, including photonic systems, quantum dots, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and superconducting circuits. In particular, photonic platforms offer several advantages: they operate at room temperature, exhibit low decoherence, and support multiple degrees of freedom, making them suitable for scalable, high-dimensional quantum computation. Here we present methodologies for realizing VQE on photonic systems, highlighting their potential for practical quantum computing. We first provide a theoretical overview of the VQE framework, focusing on the procedure for variationally estimating ground state energies. We then explore how photonic systems can implement these processes, showing that a wide variety of problems can be addressed using either multiple qubit states or a single qudit state.

TI AI-assisted hyper-dimensional broadband quantum memory with efficiency
   above 90% in warm atoms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-dimensional broadband quantum memory significantly expands quantum information processing capabilities, but the memory efficiency becomes insufficient when extended to high dimensions. We demonstrate an efficient quantum memory for hyper-dimensional photons encoded with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM). OAM information is encoded from -5 to +5, combined with SAM encoding, enabling up to 22 dimensions. To ensure high memory efficiency, an artificial intelligence algorithm, a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm using Chebyshev sampling, is developed to obtain a perfect signal-control waveform matching. Memory efficiency is experimentally achieved at 92% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 91% for information dimension of 6 and 80% for dimensional number to 22. The fidelity is achieved up to 99% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 95.5% for OAM information, 97.4% for SAM information, and 92% for whole hyper-dimensional signal, which is far beyond no-cloning limitation. Our results demonstrate superior performance and potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing. This achievement provides a crucial foundation for future quantum communication and quantum computing.

TI Qubit teleportation between a memory-compatible photonic time-bin qubit
   and a solid-state quantum network node
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We report on a quantum interface linking a diamond NV center quantum network node and 795nm photonic time-bin qubits compatible with Thulium and Rubidium quantum memories. The interface makes use of two-stage low-noise quantum frequency conversion and waveform shaping to match temporal and spectral photon profiles. Two-photon quantum interference shows high indistinguishability between converted 795nm photons and the native NV center photons. We use the interface to demonstrate quantum teleportation including real-time feedforward from an unbiased set of 795nm photonic qubit input states to the NV center spin qubit, achieving a teleportation fidelity well above the classical bound. This proof-of-concept experiment shows the feasibility of interconnecting different quantum network hardware.

TI Quantum walks-based simple authenticated quantum cryptography protocols
   for secure wireless sensor networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a crucial role in various applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to industrial automation that require high levels of security. With the development of quantum technologies, many security mechanisms may be hacked due to the promising capabilities of quantum computation. To address this challenge, quantum protocols have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the security of wireless sensor communications. One of the common types of quantum protocols is quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, which are investigated to allow two participants with fully quantum capabilities to share a random secret key, while semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols are designed to perform the same task using fewer quantum resources to make quantum communications more realizable and practical. Quantum walk (QW) plays an essential role in quantum computing, which is a universal quantum computational paradigm. In this work, we utilize the advantages of QW to design three authenticated quantum cryptographic protocols to establish secure channels for data transmission between sensor nodes: the first one is authenticated quantum key distribution (AQKD), the second one is authenticated semi-quantum key distribution (ASQKD) with one of the two participants having limited quantum capabilities, and the last one is ASQKD but both legitimate users possess limited quantum resources. The advantages of the proposed protocols are that the partners can exchange several different keys with the same exchanged qubits, and the presented protocols depend on a one-way quantum communication channel. In contrast, all previously designed SQKD protocols rely on two-way quantum communication. Security analyses prove that the presented protocols are secure against various well-known attacks and highly efficient. The utilization of the presented protocols in wireless sensor communications opens up new avenues for secure and trustworthy data transmission, enabling the deployment of resilient WSNs in critical applications. This work also paves the way for future exploration of quantum-based security protocols and their integration into WSNs for enhanced data protection.

TI Quantum machine learning of large datasets using randomized measurements
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computers promise to enhance machine learning for practical applications. Quantum machine learning for real-world data has to handle extensive amounts of high-dimensional data. However, conventional methods for measuring quantum kernels are impractical for large datasets as they scale with the square of the dataset size. Here, we measure quantum kernels using randomized measurements. The quantum computation time scales linearly with dataset size and quadratic for classical post-processing. While our method scales in general exponentially in qubit number, we gain a substantial speed-up when running on intermediate-sized quantum computers. Further, we efficiently encode high-dimensional data into quantum computers with the number of features scaling linearly with the circuit depth. The encoding is characterized by the quantum Fisher information metric and is related to the radial basis function kernel. Our approach is robust to noise via a cost-free error mitigation scheme. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods for noisy quantum computers by classifying images with the IBM quantum computer. To achieve further speedups we distribute the quantum computational tasks between different quantum computers. Our method enables benchmarking of quantum machine learning algorithms with large datasets on currently available quantum computers.

TI Performance of Rotation-Symmetric Bosonic Codes in a Quantum Repeater
   Network
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum error correction codes based on continuous variables play an important role for the implementation of quantum communication systems. A natural application of such codes occurs within quantum repeater systems which are used to combat severe channel losses and local gate errors. In particular, channel loss drastically reduces the distance of communication between remote users. Here, a cavity-quantum electrodynamics (QED) based repeater scheme is considered to address the losses in the quantum channel. This repeater scheme relies on the transmission of a specific class of rotationally invariant error-correcting codes. Several rotation-symmetric bosonic codes (RSBCs) are compared for encoding the initial states of two remote users connected by a quantum repeater network against the convention of the cat codes and the performance of the system is quantified by using the secret key rate. In particular, the number of stations required to exchange a secret key over a fixed distance is determined and establish the resource overhead. For higher-loss codes, the results show that a secret key rate (SKR) value of 0.01 bit per channel use can be achieved at a distance of 10000 km, with an elementary distance of 1.3 km.
   This work shows the performance of a quantum repeater protocol embedded with the rotation-symmetric bosonic codes in a quantum key distribution scenario. The secret key rate greatly outperforms the bound of direct channel transmission, as well as the rate of the cat codes. Furthermore, this protocol can be implemented with the current technology, such as trapped atoms in cavities. image

TI Nonlocal photonic quantum gates over 7.0 km
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum networks provide a prospective paradigm to connect separated quantum nodes, which relies on the distribution of long-distance entanglement and active feedforward control of qubits between remote nodes. Such approaches can be utilized to construct nonlocal quantum gates, forming building blocks for distributed quantum computing and other novel quantum applications. However, these gates have only been realized within single nodes or between nodes separated by a few tens of meters, limiting the ability to harness computing resources in large-scale quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal photonic quantum gates between two nodes spatially separated by 7.0 km using stationary qubits based on multiplexed quantum memories, flying qubits at telecom wavelengths, and active feedforward control based on field-deployed fibers. Furthermore, we illustrate quantum parallelism by implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum phase estimation algorithm between the two remote nodes. These results represent a proof-of-principle demonstration of quantum gates over metropolitan-scale distances and lay the foundation for the construction of large-scale distributed quantum networks relying on existing fiber channels.
   Full-fledged quantum communication networks would allow distributed quantum computing across multiple remote nodes, but typical implementations are stuck at meters-scale distances. Here the authors demonstrate teleportation-based nonlocal CNOT gates, distributed Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and quantum phase estimation across 7 km space separation.

In this paper, we insert an additional advantage distillation (AD) step after quantum communication to improve the performance of PM-QKD.

TI Advancements in MultiMode Quantum Entanglement Networks
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance Quantum entanglement, a crucial resource in quantum information science, describes a unique type of quantum correlation system. When two or more subsystems are entangled, their states are inseparable. The measurement results of this entangled system exhibit correlations that are fundamentally different from classical statistics, reflecting the non- local nature of quantum entanglement. In recent years, the rapid advancement of quantum information science has deepened our understanding of the interplay between quantum systems and information science. The concept of a quantum network has emerged in academic circles. A quantum network typically consists of multiple interconnected qubits. Nodes within the quantum network are responsible for generating, processing, and storing quantum information. These nodes are connected through quantum correlation or entanglement channels, enabling high- fidelity quantum state transmission and distributing entanglement across the network. Quantum entanglement is a key resource for constructing quantum networks and realizing quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum precision measurement. To meet the demands of complex quantum information processing and quantum network construction, generating and regulating large-scale quantum entangled states across multimode of light, i.e., multimode quantum entanglement, has become a significant research challenge in quantum information science. Progress This review will focus on theoretical and experimental research regarding the preparation of quantum entangled networks, with a particular emphasis on continuous variable quantum optical systems. We provide an overview of three primary technical pathways for preparing the squeezed states in continuous variable quantum optics including optical parametric oscillator, parametric four- wave mixing, and related integrated quantum optical platforms. One of the most used approaches for preparing multimode entangled states involves using the optical beam splitter network to couple multiple squeezed sources. However, this technical pathway imposes high requirements for loss and coupling control among the multiple quantum sources and linear optical networks, making it challenging to prepare large-scale entangled states. As a result, researchers have shifted their focus to other multimode methods to prepare large-scale entangled states. The main preparation schemes are based on spatial, temporal, and frequency degree of freedom of light. Among the schemes based on various spatial modes, typical approaches include combinations of the spatial pixels, orbital angular momentum multiplexing, and cascading non-linear processes, with their quantum correlation characteristics primarily manifested in the spatial dimension. As to temporal modes, the time- domain multiplexing scheme is predominantly used to generate large scale entanglement with the correlation of time series. For frequency modes, optical frequency comb technology is primarily utilized to prepare multimode entanglement associated with the frequency domain. Conclusions and Prospects With the significant development of the field of quantum information and the ongoing progress in experimental technology, the quantum network composed of multimode entangled states has emerged as a crucial quantum resource in the fields of quantum precision measurement and quantum information processing. Such entanglement- based quantum network has demonstrated quantum superiority in numerous experiments and applications, underscoring its growing significance.
   Therefore, it is imperative to further advance the construction and application of versatile quantum networks.

TI Flying-cat parity checks for quantum error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Long range, multiqubit parity checks have applications in both quantum error correction and measurementbased entanglement generation. Such parity checks could be performed using qubit-state-dependent phase shifts on propagating pulses of light described by coherent states vertical bar alpha > of the electromagnetic field. We consider "flying-cat" parity checks based on an entangling operation that is quantum nondemolition for Schrodinger's cat states vertical bar alpha > +/- vertical bar-alpha > . This operation encodes parity information in the phase of maximally distinguishable coherent states vertical bar +/-alpha > , which can be read out using a phase-sensitive measurement of the electromagnetic field. In contrast to many implementations, where single-qubit errors and measurement errors can be treated as independent, photon loss during flying-cat parity checks introduces errors on physical qubits at a rate that is anticorrelated with the probability for measurement errors. We analyze this trade-off for three-qubit parity checks, which are a requirement for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with the subsystem surface code. We further show how a six-qubit entangled "tetrahedron" state can be prepared using these three-qubit parity checks. The tetrahedron state can be used as a resource for controlled quantum teleportation of a two-qubit state or as a source of shared randomness with potential applications in three-party quantum key distribution. Finally, we provide conditions for performing high-quality flying-cat parity checks in a state-of-the-art circuit QED architecture, accounting for qubit decoherence, internal cavity losses, and finite-duration pulses, in addition to transmission losses.

TI Quantum state transfer between two photons with polarization and orbital
   angular momentum via quantum teleportation technology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum teleportation is a useful quantum information technology to transmit quantum states between different degrees of freedom. Here we report a quantum state transfer experiment in the linear optical system, transferring a single-photon state in the polarization degree of freedom (DoF) to another photon in the orbital angular momentum (OAM) quantum state via a biphoton OAM entangled channel. Our experimental method is based on quantum teleportation technology. The differences between ours and the original teleportation scheme is that the transfer state is known in ours, and our method is for different particles with different DoFs, while the original one is for different particles with the same DoF. In addition, our present experiment is implemented with a high Bell efficiency since each of the four hybrid-entangled Bell states can be discriminated. We use six states of poles of the Bloch sphere to test our experiment, and the fidelity of the quantum state transfer is 91.8 +/- 1.3%.

TI The future of quantum computing with superconducting qubits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB For the first time in history, we are seeing a branching point in computing paradigms with the emergence of quantum processing units (QPUs). Extracting the full potential of computation and realizing quantum algorithms with a super-polynomial speedup will most likely require major advances in quantum error correction technology. Meanwhile, achieving a computational advantage in the near term may be possible by combining multiple QPUs through circuit knitting techniques, improving the quality of solutions through error suppression and mitigation, and focusing on heuristic versions of quantum algorithms with asymptotic speedups. For this to happen, the performance of quantum computing hardware needs to improve and software needs to seamlessly integrate quantum and classical processors together to form a new architecture that we are calling quantum-centric supercomputing. In the long term, we see hardware that exploits qubit connectivity in higher than 2D topologies to realize more efficient quantum error correcting codes, modular architectures for scaling QPUs and parallelizing workloads, and software that evolves to make the intricacies of the technology invisible to the users and realize the goal of ubiquitous, frictionless quantum computing.

TI Multiplexed quantum repeaters based on single-photon interference with
   mild stabilization
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum repeaters are pivotal in the physical layer of the quantum internet, and quantum repeaters capable of efficient entanglement distribution are necessary for its development. Quantum repeater schemes based on single-photon interference are promising because of their potential efficiency. However, schemes involving first-order interference with photon sources at distant nodes require stringent phase stability of the components, which pose challenges for long-distance implementation. In this paper, we present a quantum repeater scheme that leverages single-photon interference and reduces the difficulty of achieving phase stabilization. Additionally, under specific conditions, our scheme achieves a higher entanglement distribution rate between end nodes compared with the existing schemes. Thus, the proposed approach could lead to improved rates with technologies that are currently unavailable but possible in the future and will ultimately facilitate the development of multimode quantum repeaters.
   Single-photon interference based quantum repeater schemes are promising due to their potential efficiency. Here, the authors offer a theoretical quantum repeater scheme with reduced complexity of phase stabilization and scope for higher entanglement rates between the end nodes.

TI Controlled coherent dynamics of [VO(TPP)], a prototype molecular nuclear
   qudit with an electronic ancilla
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We show that [VO(TPP)] (vanadyl tetraphenylporphyrinate) is a promising system to implement quantum computation algorithms based on encoding information in multi-level (qudit) units. Indeed, it embeds a nuclear spin 7/2 coupled to an electronic spin 1/2 by hyperfine interaction. This qubit-qudit unit can be exploited to implement quantum error correction and quantum simulation algorithms. Through a combined theoretical and broadband nuclear magnetic resonance study, we demonstrate that the elementary operations of such algorithms can be efficiently implemented on the nuclear spin qudit. Manipulation of the nuclear qudit can be achieved by resonant radio-frequency pulses, thanks to the remarkably long coherence times and the effective quadrupolar coupling induced by the strong hyperfine interaction. This approach may open new perspectives for developing new molecular qubit-qudit systems.

TI Universal quantum simulation of single-qubit nonunitary operators using
   duality quantum algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum information processing enhances human's power to simulate nature in quantum level and solve complex problem efficiently. During the process, a series of operators is performed to evolve the system or undertake a computing task. In recent year, research interest in non-Hermitian quantum systems, dissipative-quantum systems and new quantum algorithms has greatly increased, which nonunitary operators take an important role in. In this work, we utilize the linear combination of unitaries technique for nonunitary dynamics on a single qubit to give explicit decompositions of the necessary unitaries, and simulate arbitrary time-dependent single-qubit nonunitary operator F(t) using duality quantum algorithm. We find that the successful probability is not only decided by F(t) and the initial state, but also is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the used ancillary Hilbert subspace. In a general case, the simulation can be achieved in both eight- and six-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In phase matching conditions, F(t) can be simulated by only two qubits. We illustrate our method by simulating typical non-Hermitian systems and single-qubit measurements. Our method can be extended to high-dimensional case, such as Abrams-Lloyd's two-qubit gate. By discussing the practicability, we expect applications and experimental implementations in the near future.

TI Multipath Inter-Domain Routing Protocols for Quantum Networks With
   Online Path Selection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
AB Quantum entanglement routing presents a significant challenge in the development of large-scale quantum networks. While intra-domain quantum entanglement routing has been extensively studied, the quantum Internet, like the classical Internet, will likely be serviced by multiple quantum Internet Service Providers (qISPs), necessitating topology-oblivious routing protocols. This paper focuses on the inter-domain scenario, where the network consists of multiple subnetworks owned by mutually untrusted parties without centralized control. In this context, previously proposed entanglement routing strategies, which rely on knowledge of network topology, are no longer applicable. We propose the Quantum Border Gateway Protocol (QBGP) for efficiently routing quantum entanglement across qISP boundaries, with built-in multipath load balancing support to enhance network performance. To further ensure high-quality information transmission, we design QPSEL, an online learning algorithm that identifies high-fidelity paths in a topology-oblivious manner. This algorithm utilizes a novel information gain metric, introduced in this paper, to adaptively adjust measurement parameters and minimize resource usage. We implement a quantum network simulator and evaluate both QBGP and QPSEL. Our results show that QBGP effectively distributes entanglements across qISP boundaries and balances traffic through multipath load balancing. Moreover, QPSEL significantly improves network performance by selecting high-fidelity paths with much lower resource consumption compared to existing methods.

One promising approach for scaling them up is to use a modular or multi-core architecture, in which different quantum processors (cores) are connected via quantum and classical links. This new architectural design poses new challenges such as the expensive inter-core communication. To reduce these movements when executing a quantum algorithm, an efficient mapping technique is required. In this paper, a detailed critical discussion of the quantum circuit mapping problem for multi-core quantum computing architectures is provided. In addition, we further explore the performance of a mapping method, which is formulated as a partitioning over time graph problem, by performing an architectural scalability analysis.

TI Molecular nanomagnets: a viable path toward quantum information
   processing?
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Molecular nanomagnets (MNMs), molecules containing interacting spins, have been a playground for quantum mechanics. They are characterized by many accessible low-energy levels that can be exploited to store and process quantum information. This naturally opens the possibility of using them as qudits, thus enlarging the tools of quantum logic with respect to qubit-based architectures. These additional degrees of freedom recently prompted the proposal for encoding qubits with embedded quantum error correction (QEC) in single molecules. QEC is the holy grail of quantum computing and this qudit approach could circumvent the large overhead of physical qubits typical of standard multi-qubit codes. Another important strength of the molecular approach is the extremely high degree of control achieved in preparing complex supramolecular structures where individual qudits are linked preserving their individual properties and coherence. This is particularly relevant for building quantum simulators, controllable systems able to mimic the dynamics of other quantum objects. The use of MNMs for quantum information processing is a rapidly evolving field which still requires to be fully experimentally explored. The key issues to be settled are related to scaling up the number of qudits/qubits and their individual addressing. Several promising possibilities are being intensively explored, ranging from the use of single-molecule transistors or superconducting devices to optical readout techniques. Moreover, new tools from chemistry could be also at hand, like the chiral-induced spin selectivity. In this paper, we will review the present status of this interdisciplinary research field, discuss the open challenges and envisioned solution paths which could finally unleash the very large potential of molecular spins for quantum technologies.

AB A numerical model of a quantum repeater operating with Schrodinger cat states is constructed. The model describes the performance of such a system in the presence of decoherence effects, namely, noise in the quantum channel and the efficiency of the photon-number-resolving detector. In the framework of the numerical model, a theoretical analysis of the system functioning is carried out for the elementary link by calculating its performance characteristics. Namely, we calculate photodetector click probabilities and fidelity for various sets of decoherence parameters. These estimates are necessary in the context of further experimental research at the junction with other branches of quantum communications, so that to use the entanglement distribution when it comes to operating quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution protocols based on entanglement. The model will be developed further as a versatile drag-and-drop software simulating the full-fledged entanglement swapping protocol operation.

TI Efficient realization of quantum algorithms with qudits
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The development of a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve efficiently various difficult computational problems is an outstanding challenge for science and technology. In this work, we propose a technique for an efficient implementation of quantum algorithms with multilevel quantum systems (qudits). Our method uses a transpilation of a circuit in the standard qubit form, which depends on the characteristics of a qudit-based processor, such as the number of available qudits and the number of accessible levels. This approach provides a qubit-to-qudit mapping and comparison to a standard realization of quantum algorithms highlighting potential advantages of qudits. We provide an explicit scheme of transpiling qubit circuits into sequences of single-qudit and two-qudit gates taken from a particular universal set. We then illustrate our method by considering an example of an efficient implementation of a 6-qubit quantum algorithm with qudits. In this particular example, we demonstrate how using qudits allows a decreasing amount of two-body interactions in the qubit circuit implementation. We expect that our findings are of relevance for ongoing experiments with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices that operate with information carriers allowing qudit encodings, such as trapped ions and neutral atoms, as well as optical and solid-state systems.

TI Universal high-fidelity quantum gates for spin qubits in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Spins associated to solid-state color centers are a promising platform for investigating quantum computation and quantum networks. Recent experiments have demonstrated multiqubit quantum processors, optical interconnects, and basic quantum error-correction protocols. One of the key open challenges towards larger-scale systems is to realize high-fidelity universal quantum gates. In this work, we design and demonstrate a complete high-fidelity gate set for the two-qubit system formed by the electron and nuclear spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We use gate set tomography (GST) to systematically optimize the gates and demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities of up to 99.999(1)% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.93(5)%. Our gates are designed to decouple unwanted interactions and can be extended to other electron-nuclear spin systems. The high fidelities demonstrated provide opportunities towards larger-scale quantum processing with color-center qubits.

TI The quantum internet: an efficient stabilizer states distribution scheme
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum networks are a fundamental component of quantum technologies, playing a pivotal role in advancing distributed quantum computing and laying the groundwork for the future quantum internet. They offer a scalable modular architecture for quantum chips and support infrastructure for measurement-based quantum computing. Furthermore, quantum networks serve as the backbone of the quantum internet, ensuring high levels of security. Notably, the advantages of quantum networks in communication are contingent upon entanglement distribution, which faces challenges such as high latency in protocols relying on Bell pair distribution and bipartite entanglement swapping. Additionally, algorithms designed for multipartite entanglement routing encounter intractability issues, rendering them unsolvable within polynomial time. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to distribute graph states in quantum networks, leveraging local quantum coding (LQC) isometries and multipartite states transfer. We also present single-use bounds for stabilizer states distribution. Analogous to network coding, these bounds are attainable when appropriate isometries and stabilizer codes are selected for relay nodes, resulting in reduced latency in entanglement distribution. We further demonstrate the protocol's advantages across various network performance metrics.

TI Quantum error correction with bosonic encoding
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Recently, the achievement, entitled "lifetime enhancement for a logic qubit by bosonic encoding error correction", has been selected as one of "The Ten Major Advances in Chinese Science 2023". Here, we will introduce briefly the importance of this work. It is known that quantum states are fragile due to decoherence induced by environment. Error will happen on a qubit, resulting in continuously changes of the parameters for this qubit, such as amplitude and phase parameters. The aim of quantum error correction is to amend those errors by using various quantum error correction codes, in which a logic qubit can be represented by several physical qubits. It should be noted that the quantum error correction can be realized by correcting a discrete set of errors, such as bit-flip error, phase-flip error or both of them.
   On the other hand, types of errors occurred depend on specific platforms of quantum computation. For example, photon loss is more inclined to occur in photonic systems. In this case, the approach of bosonic encoding of quantum error correction is more efficient. The work "lifetime enhancement for a logic qubit by bosonic encoding error correction" is for such a scenario. The challenge of quantum error correction is that operation itself is not perfect which may incur new errors. So it is actually difficult to demonstrate that we can benefit from quantum error correction. The achievement of lifetime enhancement by bosonic encoding error correction succeeds in beating this break-even point. The experiments are performed by circuit quantum electrodynamics on a superconducting processor with a qubit and a coupled resonate cavity. The logic qubit is realized by the bosonic mode of the cavity, while the superconducting qubit plays the role of the ancillary qubit in error correction. The initial states are prepared by the superconducting qubit, and are transferred to the logic qubit in the cavity. Then the error correction can be performed based on detection of photon loss by the superconducting qubit. The results show that the lifetime of the logic qubit increases from 694 mu s to 805 mu s with 16% enhancement. Besides high quality devices, the success of this experiment depends on the feedback control to detect and correct the error of photon loss in a short time.
   The result of beating the break-even point of bosonic encoding error correction is for one logic qubit. In the near future, it is hopeful to implement logic gates, such as single-qubit rotation gate and two-qubit gate, on a couple of logic qubits by bosonic encoding. The importance of the results will depend on whether higher fidelity can be achieved compared with those of gates with physical qubits. In this way, the advantage of the logic qubits for quantum computation is presented. It will be significant that the approach of bosonic encoding with a superconducting processor is scalable to hundreds of logic qubits, which may take a few years to realize. Our aim is to realize a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer based on a large quantity of high-precision logic qubits. The work "lifetime enhancement for a logic qubit by bosonic encoding error correction" is an important step toward this aim.

TI Can Molecular Quantum Computing Bridge Quantum Biology and Cognitive
   Science?
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Recently, quantum biology and molecular quantum computation have attracted substantial attention. Quantum biology applies quantum mechanics to biological systems at the molecular scale. Molecular quantum computing explores the degrees of freedom of molecules that can be used to produce quantum coherence, such as charge, orbital, opto-spin (interplay between optical excitation and spin), vibration, and rotation, to process quantum information. Cognitive science focuses on understanding how learning processes are realized, particularly within the human brain. The most common topic among these three is the computational process, which can exploit different levels of representation, either classical or quantum. Here, we review progress in quantum biology, molecular quantum computing, and quantum theory in cognitive science. Based on our critical analysis and review, we highlight that molecular quantum computing could be an important bridging research area between quantum biology and a deeper understanding of neuronal cells in cognitive science. Thus, these three areas can be the core to understanding how the classical world emerges from the quantum world and human intelligence. To answer these questions, we may gain insight by studying the quantum processes that underlie biological systems, such as photosynthesis and enzyme catalysis. An unprecedented opportunity for molecular quantum computing is to perform functionalities similar to those of the human brain. In this manner, we could not only expand the boundaries for quantum computing but also gain a better understanding of cognitive processes.

TI Memoryless Quantum Repeaters Based on Cavity-QED and Coherent States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A quantum repeater scheme based on cavity-quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum error correction of channel loss via rotation-symmetric bosonic codes (RSBCs) is proposed to distribute atomic entangled states over long distances without memories and at high clock rates. In this scheme, controlled rotation gates, i.e., phase shifts of the propagating light modes conditioned upon the state of an atom placed in a cavity, provide a mechanism both for the entangled-state preparations and for the error syndrome identifications. In order to assess the performance of this repeater protocol, an explicit instance of RSBCs-multicomponent cat codes-are studied quantitatively. It is found that the total fidelity and the success probability for quantum communication over a long distance (such as 1000 km) both can almost approach unity provided a small enough elementary distance between stations (smaller than 0.1 or 0.01 km) and rather low local losses (up to 0.1%) are considered. In a quantum key distribution application, secret key rates can become correspondingly high, both per channel use, beating the repeaterless bound, and per second thanks to the relatively high clock rates of the memoryless scheme. Based upon the cavity-QED setting, this scheme can be realized at room temperature and at optical frequencies.

TI Quantum tomography of an entangled three-qubit state in silicon
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property of coherent quantum states and an essential resource for quantum computing'. In large-scale quantum systems, the error accumulation requires concepts for quantum error correction. A first step toward error correction is the creation of genuinely multipartite entanglement, which has served as a performance benchmark for quantum computing platforms such as superconducting circuits(2,3), trapped ions(4) and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamonds. Among the candidates for large-scale quantum computing devices, silicon-based spin qubits offer an outstanding nanofabrication capability for scaling-up. Recent studies demonstrated improved coherence times(6-8), high-fidelity all-electrical control(9-13), high-temperature operation(14,15) and quantum entanglement of two spin qubits(9,11,12). Here we generated a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state using a low-disorder, fully controllable array of three spin qubits in silicon. We performed quantum state tomography(16) and obtained a state fidelity of 88.0%. The measurements witness a genuine Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger class quantum entanglement that cannot be separated into any biseparable state. Our results showcase the potential of silicon-based spin qubit platforms for multiqubit quantum algorithms.

TI Stark control of solid-state quantum memory with spin-wave storage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum memories for quantum communication need to be able to store photons for an extended time and then to release them on demand. This can be achieved in atomic frequency comb ensemble-based quantum memories by control pulses that transfer the excitation to and from long-lived spin states. However, such pulses can give rise to coherent and incoherent noise due to their interaction with the memory ensemble. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the ability to switch off the coherent noise from such control pulses during the echo emission in a spin-wave quantum memory, using the linear Stark effect in rare-earth-ion doped crystals. By applying an electric-field pulse, the echo emission was coherently switched off prior to the first spin transfer pulse, and the stored data pulse was restored only when both an optical recall pulse and a rephasing electrical pulse were applied, giving a high degree of control of both desired and undesired emissions. We estimate the effectiveness of this technique by turning off the free-induction decay of a narrow ensemble of ions. This technique can thus improve the noise performance of spin-wave storage at the single-photon level by quenching coherent optical radiation created by strong control pulses. The method demonstrated here represents a proof of principle that the spin-wave storage scheme can be combined with Stark control. The combined scheme serves as an addition to the toolbox of techniques that can be used to realize a full version of a quantum repeater.

TI Variational Circuit Compiler for Quantum Error Correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum error correction is vital for implementing universal quantum computing. A key component is the encoding circuit that maps a product state of physical qubits into the encoded multipartite entangled logical state. Known methods are typically not "optimal" either in terms of the circuit depth (and therefore the error burden) or the specifics of the target platform, i.e., the native gates and topology of a system. This work introduces a variational compiler for efficiently finding the encoding circuit of general quantum errorcorrecting codes with given quantum hardware. Focusing on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum regime, we show how to systematically compile the circuit following an optimizing process seeking to minimize the number of noisy operations that are allowed by the noisy quantum hardware or to obtain the highest fidelity of the encoded state with noisy gates. We demonstrate our method by deriving efficient encoders for logic states of the five-qubit code and the seven-qubit Steane code. We describe ways to augment the discovered circuits with error detection. Our method is applicable quite generally for compiling the encoding circuits of quantum error-correcting codes.

TI Advances in Silicon Quantum Photonics
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for computing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of quantum information-they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily protected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of near-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. To be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one with in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits, and a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and component performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a strong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a progress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the past five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic component and the challenges in the field, summarise the current state-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as promising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the definition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum photonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across different platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform, to which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon quantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.

TI Practical quantum tokens without quantum memories and experimental tests
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Unforgeable quantum money tokens were the first invention of quantum information science, but remain technologically challenging as they require quantum memories and/or long-distance quantum communication. More recently, virtual "S-money" tokens were introduced. These are generated by quantum cryptography, do not require quantum memories or long-distance quantum communication, and yet in principle guarantee many of the security advantages of quantum money. Here, we describe implementations of S-money schemes with off-the-shelf quantum key distribution technology, and analyse security in the presence of noise, losses, and experimental imperfection. Our schemes satisfy near-instant validation without cross-checking. We show that, given standard assumptions in mistrustful quantum cryptographic implementations, unforgeability and user privacy could be guaranteed with attainable refinements of our off-the-shelf setup. We discuss the possibilities for unconditionally secure (assumption-free) implementations.

TI Telecom-heralded entanglement between multimode solid-state quantum
   memories
SO NATURE
AB Future quantum networks will enable the distribution of entanglement between distant locations and allow applications in quantum communication, quantum sensing and distributed quantum computation(1). At the core of this network lies the ability to generate and store entanglement at remote, interconnected quantum nodes(2). Although various remote physical systems have been successfully entangled(3-12), none of these realizations encompassed all of the requirements for network operation, such as compatibility with telecommunication (telecom) wavelengths and multimode operation. Here we report the demonstration of heralded entanglement between two spatially separated quantum nodes, where the entanglement is stored in multimode solid-state quantum memories. At each node a praseodymium-doped crystal(13,14) stores a photon of a correlated pair(15), with the second photon at telecom wavelengths. Entanglement between quantum memories placed in different laboratories is heralded by the detection of a telecom photon at a rate up to 1.4 kilohertz, and the entanglement is stored in the crystals for a pre-determined storage time up to 25 microseconds. We also show that the generated entanglement is robust against loss in the heralding path, and demonstrate temporally multiplexed operation, with 62 temporal modes. Our realization is extendable to entanglement over longer distances and provides a viable route towards field-deployed, multiplexed quantum repeaters based on solid-state resources.

TI A Review on Models and Applications of Quantum Computing
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB This manuscript is intended for readers who have a general interest in the subject of quantum computation and provides an overview of the most significant developments in the field. It begins by introducing foundational concepts from quantum mechanics-such as superposition, entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem-that underpin quantum computation. The primary computational models are discussed, including gate-based (circuit) quantum computing, adiabatic quantum computing, measurement-based quantum computing and the quantum Turing machine. A selection of significant quantum algorithms are reviewed, notably Grover's search algorithm, Shor's factoring algorithm, and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), which enables efficient solutions to linear algebra problems on quantum devices. To assess practical performance, we compare quantum and classical implementations of support vector machines (SVMs) using several synthetic datasets. These experiments offer insight into the capabilities and limitations of near-term quantum classifiers relative to classical counterparts. Finally, we review leading quantum programming platforms-including Qiskit, PennyLane, and Cirq-and discuss their roles in bridging theoretical models with real-world quantum hardware. The paper aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive guide for those looking to understand both the theoretical foundations and applied aspects of quantum computing.

TI Integrated nanophotonics for the development of fully functional quantum
   circuits based on on-demand single-photon emitters
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB In recent years, research on integrated quantum circuits has developed rapidly and exciting results have been achieved. The overarching goal of this emerging research direction in the field of modern quantum technology is the scalable integration of quantum functionality on robust chips. Such chips can work independently of one another, but it is even more interesting to develop them modularly for integration into larger quantum networks, thereby linking quantum computation and quantum communication in the same framework. In this context, the ongoing development and further optimization of integrated quantum circuits aim, inter alia, to achieve a quantum advantage in the area of quantum computing and to pave the way for multipartite quantum networks. The functionality of such chips is essentially based on single-photon operations, such as interference at beam splitters in combination with phase shifters in the field of linear optical quantum computing and Bell-state measurements for entanglement swapping in long-distance quantum networks. While individual functionalities such as CNOT gates and more complex quantum computing operations such as boson sampling in a combination of waveguide chips and external photon sources and detectors were successfully demonstrated, the field is currently facing the major challenge of integrating all necessary components monolithically on chip in order to exploit the full potential of integrated quantum nanophotonics. The present Perspective discusses the status and the present challenges of integrated quantum nanophotonics based on on-demand single-photon emitters and gives an outlook on required developments to enter the next level of fully functional quantum circuits for photonic quantum technology.

TI Hybrid CV-DV Quantum Communications and Quantum Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum information processing (QIP) opens new opportunities for high-performance computing, high-precision sensing, and secure communications. Among various QIP features, the entanglement is a unique one. To take full advantage of quantum resources, it will be necessary to interface quantum systems based on different encodings of information both discrete and continuous. The goal of this paper is to lay the groundwork for the development of a robust and efficient hybrid continuous variable-discrete variable (CV-DV) quantum network, enabling the distribution of a large number of entangled states over hybrid DV-CV multi-hop nodes in an arbitrary topology. The proposed hybrid quantum communication network (QCN) can serve as the backbone for a future quantum Internet, thus providing extensive long-term impacts on the economy and national security through QIP, distributed quantum computing, quantum networking, and distributed quantum sensing. By employing the photon addition and photon subtraction modules we describe how to generate the hybrid DV-CV entangled states and how to implement their teleportation and entanglement swapping through entangling measurements. We then describe how to extend the transmission distance between nodes in hybrid QCN by employing macroscopic light states, noiseless amplification, and reconfigurable quantum LDPC coding. We further describe how to enable quantum networking and distributed quantum computing by employing the deterministic cluster state concept introduced here. Finally, we describe how the proposed hybrid CV-DV states can be used in an entanglement-based hybrid QKD.

TI Efficient high-dimensional cyclic quantum teleportation via a
   3-dimensional GHZ state in a noisy environment
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB This paper studies the novel efficient protocol for teleporting two-qutrit states using a quantum system operating in a noisy environment. A novel Cyclic Quantum Teleportation (CYQT) protocol facilitates the exchange of unknown two-qutrit states among three users, using the quantum channel of a nine-qutrits entangled state. The specialty of the proposed protocol is that the users can only apply a few three-dimensional GHZ-state measurements on their particles and can transmit more quantum information. After that, we analyze the protocol's performance in the presence of a noisy environment, including trit-flip noise, phase-flip noise, and amplitudedamping noise on the teleported state between users where they share an entangled quantum channel. We found that the protocol's fidelity is influenced by the initial state of the amplitude coefficient and the noise intensity. Further, we subjected the protocol to various attacks to ensure its security. This evaluation clearly shows that CYQT is robust in ensuring secure communication.

TI Characterizing quantum circuits with qubit functional configurations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We develop a systematic framework for characterizing all quantum circuits with qubit functional configurations. The qubit functional configuration is a mathematical structure that can classify the properties and behaviors of quantum circuits collectively. Major benefits of classifying quantum circuits in this way include: 1. All quantum circuits can be classified into corresponding types; 2. Each type characterizes important properties (such as circuit complexity) of the quantum circuits belonging to it; 3. Each type contains a huge collection of possible quantum circuits allowing systematic investigation of their common properties. We demonstrate the theory's application to analyzing the hardware-efficient ansatzes of variational quantum algorithms. For potential applications, the functional configuration theory may allow systematic understanding and development of quantum algorithms based on their functional configuration types.

TI Chip-to-chip photonic quantum teleportation over optical fibers of 12.3
   km
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum teleportation is a crucial function in quantum networks. The implementation of photonic quantum teleportation could be highly simplified by quantum photonic circuits. To extend chip-to-chip teleportation distance, more effort is needed on both chip design and system implementation. In this work, we demonstrate a time-bin-based chip-to-chip photonic quantum teleportation over optical fibers under the scenario of a star-topology quantum network. Three quantum photonic circuits are designed and fabricated on a single chip, each serving specific functions: heralded single-photon generation at the user node, entangled photon pair generation and BSM at the relay node, and projective measurement of the teleported photons at the central node. The unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers (UMZI) for time-bin encoding in these quantum photonic circuits are optimized to reduce insertion losses and suppress noise photons generated on the chip. Besides, an active feedback system is employed to suppress the impact of fiber length fluctuation between the circuits, achieving a stable quantum interference for the BSM in the relay node. As a result, a photonic quantum teleportation over optical fibers of 12.3 km is achieved based on these quantum photonic circuits, showing the potential of chip integration for the development of quantum networks.

   future prospects
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing provides a revolution in computational competences, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to process data in fundamentally novel ways. This paper explores the profound implications of quantum computing on cryptography, focusing on the vulnerabilities it introduces to classical encryption methods such as RSA and ECC, and the emergence of quantum-resistant algorithms. We review the core principles of quantum mechanics, including superposition and entanglement, which underpin quantum computing and cryptography. Additionally, we examine quantum encryption algorithms, particularly Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols and post-quantum cryptographic methods, highlighting their potential to secure communications in the quantum era. This analysis emphasizes the urgent need for developing robust quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions to safeguard sensitive information against the imminent threats posed by advancing quantum technologies.

TI Digital Quantum Simulation and Circuit Learning for the Generation of
   Coherent States
SO ENTROPY
AB Coherent states, known as displaced vacuum states, play an important role in quantum information processing, quantum machine learning, and quantum optics. In this article, two ways to digitally prepare coherent states in quantum circuits are introduced. First, we construct the displacement operator by decomposing it into Pauli matrices via ladder operators, i.e., creation and annihilation operators. The high fidelity of the digitally generated coherent states is verified compared with the Poissonian distribution in Fock space. Secondly, by using Variational Quantum Algorithms, we choose different ansatzes to generate coherent states. The quantum resources-such as numbers of quantum gates, layers and iterations-are analyzed for quantum circuit learning. The simulation results show that quantum circuit learning can provide high fidelity on learning coherent states by choosing appropriate ansatzes.

TI Resource requirements for efficient quantum communication using
   all-photonic graph states generated from a few matter qubits
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum communication technologies show great promise for applications ranging from the secure transmission of secret messages to distributed quantum computing. Due to fiber losses, long-distance quantum communication requires the use of quantum repeaters, for which there exist quantum memory-based schemes and all-photonic schemes. While all-photonic approaches based on graph states generated from linear optics avoid coherence time issues associated with memories, they outperform repeater-less protocols only at the expense of a prohibitively large overhead in resources. Here, we consider using matter qubits to produce the photonic graph states and analyze in detail the trade-off between resources and performance, as characterized by the achievable secret key rate per matter qubit. We show that fast two-qubit entangling gates between matter qubits and high photon collection and detection efficiencies are the main ingredients needed for the all-photonic protocol to outperform both repeater-less and memory-based schemes.

TI Efficiently computing logical noise in quantum error-correcting codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction protocols have been developed to offset the high sensitivity to noise inherent in quantum systems. However, much is still unknown about the behavior of a quantum error-correcting code under general noise, including noisy measurements. This lack of knowledge is largely due to the computational cost of simulating quantum systems large enough to perform nontrivial encodings. In this paper, we develop general methods for incorporating noisy measurement operations into simulations of quantum error-correcting codes and show that measurement errors on readout qubits manifest as a renormalization on the effective logical noise. We also derive general methods for reducing the computational complexity of calculating the exact effective logical noise by many orders of magnitude. This reduction is achieved by determining when different recovery operations produce equivalent logical noise. These methods could also be used to better approximate soft decoding schemes for concatenated codes or to reduce the size of a lookup table to speed up the error correction step in implementations of quantum error-correcting codes. We give examples of such reductions for the three-qubit, five-qubit, Steane, concatenated, and toric codes.

TI The efficiency of quantum teleportation with three-qubit entangled state
   in a noisy environment
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum teleportation plays a significant role in the field of quantum communication. This paper investigates quantum teleportation through a noisy environment by using GHZ state and non-standard W state as quantum channels. We analyze the efficiency of quantum teleportation by solving analytically a master equation in Lindblad form. Following the quantum teleportation protocol, we obtain the fidelity of quantum teleportation as a function of evolution time. The calculation results show that the teleportation fidelity using non-standard W is higher in comparison to GHZ state at the same evolution time. Moreover, we consider the efficiency of teleportation with weak measurements and reverse quantum measurement under amplitude damping noise. Our analysis suggests that the teleportation fidelity using non-standard W is also more robust to noise than GHZ state in the same conditions. Interestingly, we found that weak measurement and its reverse operation have no positive effect on the efficiency of quantum teleportation by using GHZ and non-standard W state in the amplitude damping noise environment. In addition, we also demonstrate the efficiency of quantum teleportation can be improved by making minor modifications to the protocol.

TI High-performance cavity-enhanced quantum memory with warm atomic cell
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum memories usually suffer from a trade-off between efficiency and excess noise. Here, by exploiting the time-reversal approach for improving modes matching, the authors show a warm-atomic-cell-based cavity-enhanced memory with 67% efficiency and noise level close to quantum noise limit.
   High-performance quantum memory for quantized states of light is a prerequisite building block of quantum information technology. Despite great progresses of optical quantum memories based on interactions of light and atoms, physical features of these memories still cannot satisfy requirements for applications in practical quantum information systems, since all of them suffer from trade-off between memory efficiency and excess noise. Here, we report a high-performance cavity-enhanced electromagnetically-induced-transparency memory with warm atomic cell in which a scheme of optimizing the spatial and temporal modes based on the time-reversal approach is applied. The memory efficiency up to 67 +/- 1% is directly measured and a noise level close to quantum noise limit is simultaneously reached. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the average fidelities for a set of input coherent states with different phases and amplitudes within a Gaussian distribution have exceeded the classical benchmark fidelities. Thus the realized quantum memory platform has been capable of preserving quantized optical states, and is ready to be applied in quantum information systems, such as distributed quantum logic gates and quantum-enhanced atomic magnetometry.

TI The Duan-Kimble cavity-atom quantum memory loading scheme revisited
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We reexamine the well-known Duan-Kimble entanglement scheme, wherein the state of a single-photon qubit is entangled with a quantum memory consisting of a single-atom qubit in a strongly coupled optical cavity, providing the capability to load the photon's state into the memory. We correct a common error appearing in some subsequent papers regarding the validity of the single-photon reflectivity function that characterizes the essential phase shift at the heart of the protocol. Using the validated analytical solution, we introduce an improved scheme-the push-pull configuration-where the photon and cavity are tuned at the midpoint between atomic resonances and show that it can outperform the original on-off configuration in which the photon and cavity are tuned exactly to one of the atomic resonances. The performance metric used is the final memory-state fidelity versus the heralding probability, which determines the memory- loading rate. The results should play a role in optimizing future quantum repeater schemes based on the Duan-Kimble protocol.

TI A Secure and Privacy-Preserving Signature Protocol Using Quantum
   Teleportation in Metaverse Environment
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The burgeoning concept of the metaverse as an interconnected virtual space represents the forefront of the next-generation internet. Quantum teleportation, known for its prowess in ensuring secure and reliable communications, stands poised to revolutionize interactions within this immersive digital realm. In this context, we propose a comprehensive interaction protocol tailored for the metaverse environment. The designed protocol entails two fundamental components: first, the interaction between a user and their avatar, facilitated by a secure seven-qubit entangled state; and second, the interaction between two avatars, enabled through an efficient two-qubit entangled state. To fortify the protocol's resilience, quantum key distribution (QKD) is employed for secure key sharing, while a trusted certificate authority serves as an essential entity for signature verification. Through rigorous safety and efficiency analysis, we demonstrate the protocol's robustness and performance, ensuring adherence to fundamental security properties such as unforgeability, undeniability, verifiability and traceability. By seamlessly integrating quantum teleportation principles with the metaverse environment, our protocol not only enhances security but also unlocks novel avenues for interaction and exploration within this digital frontier.

TI Analysis of Imperfect Rephasing in Photon Echo-Based Quantum Memories
SO ENTROPY
AB Over the last two decades, quantum memories have been intensively studied for potential applications of quantum repeaters in quantum networks. Various protocols have also been developed. To satisfy no noise echoes caused by spontaneous emission processes, a conventional two-pulse photon-echo scheme has been modified. The resulting methods include double-rephasing, ac Stark, dc Stark, controlled echo, and atomic frequency comb methods. In these methods, the main purpose of modification is to remove any chance of a population residual on the excited state during the rephasing process. Here, we investigate a typical Gaussian rephasing pulse-based double-rephasing photon-echo scheme. For a complete understanding of the coherence leakage by the Gaussian pulse itself, ensemble atoms are thoroughly investigated for all temporal components of the Gaussian pulse, whose maximum echo efficiency is 26% in amplitude, which is unacceptable for quantum memory applications.

The channels studied are the dit-flip noise, phase flip noise, dit-phase flip noise, depolarizing noise, non-Markovian Amplitude Damping Channel (ADC), dephasing noise, and depolarization noise. To gauge the effect of noise, the fidelity between the original and the final states is studied. The change of coherence under the action of noisy channels is also studied, both analytically and numerically. Our approach is advantageous as it has an explicit relation to the original approach to the multi-qubit hypergraph states.

TI Quantum Teleportation of Photon-Photon Diagonal Block Operations
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Teleportation of an unknown quantum operation, implementing a nonlocal gate on two distant particles, constitutes a fundamental component in quantum networks and distributed large-scale quantum computers. In this study, it is realized that the experimental demonstration of teleporting photon-photon diagonal block operations. Assisted by two previously shared entangled photons, a local photon-photon diagonal block operation is transferred to its corresponding nonlocal gate and the protocol is able to realize a nonlocal photon-photon operation with diagonal block forms containing two unknown single-qubit unitary operations. In experiment, two nonlocal diagonal block operations are successfully implemented on two separated independent single photons: the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and the controlled-Z (CZ) gate. To characterize the performance of the nonlocal photon-photon operations, the quantum teleported process fidelity is estimated. Additionally, the entangling capability of teleported photon-photon CNOT gate is verified. These results provide an approach to implement a unknown nonlocal photon-photon diagonal block gate and may have broad applications in distributed quantum information processing including quantum communication and quantum computation.

TI Quantum-machine-learning channel discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the problem of quantum channel discrimination, one distinguishes between a given number of quantum channels, which is done by sending an input state through a channel and measuring the output state. This work studies applications of variational quantum circuits and machine-learning techniques for discriminating such channels. In particular, we explore (i) the practical implementation of embedding this task into the framework of variational quantum computing, (ii) training a quantum classifier based on variational quantum circuits, and (iii) applying the quantum kernel estimation technique. For testing these three channel discrimination approaches, we considered a pair of entanglement-breaking channels and the depolarizing channel with two different depolarization factors. For the approach (i), we address solving the quantum channel discrimination problem using widely discussed parallel and sequential strategies. We show the advantage of the latter in terms of better convergence with less quantum resources. Quantum channel discrimination with a variational quantum classifier (ii) allows one to operate even with random and mixed input states and simple variational circuits. The kernel-based classification approach (iii) is also found effective as it allows one to discriminate depolarizing channels associated not with just fixed values of the depolarization factor, but with ranges of it. Additionally, we discovered that a simple modification of one of the commonly used kernels significantly increases the efficiency of this approach. Finally, our numerical findings reveal that the performance of variational methods of channel discrimination depends on the trace of the product of the output states. These findings demonstrate that quantum machine learning can be used to discriminate channels, such as those representing physical noise processes.

TI Asymmetric Cyclic Controlled Quantum Teleportation via Multiple-Qubit
   Entangled State in a Noisy Environment
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, by using eleven entangled quantum states as a quantum channel, we propose a cyclic and asymmetric novel protocol for four participants in which both Alice and Bob can transmit two-qubit states, and Charlie can transmit three-qubit states with the assistance of the supervisor David, who provides a guarantee for communication security. This protocol is based on GHZ state measurement (GHZ), single-qubit measurement (SM), and unitary operations (UO) to implement the communication task. The analysis demonstrates that the success probability of the proposed protocol can reach 100%. Furthermore, considering that in actual production environments, it is difficult to avoid the occurrence of noise in quantum channels, this paper also analyzes the changes in fidelity in four types of noisy scenarios: bit-flip noise, phase-flip noise, bit-phase-flip noise, and depolarizing noise. Showing that communication quality only depends on the amplitude parameters of the initial state and decoherence rate. Additionally, we give a comparison with previous similar schemes in terms of achieved method and intrinsic efficiency, which illustrates the superiority of our protocol. Finally, in response to the vulnerability of quantum channels to external attacks, a security analysis was conducted, and corresponding defensive measures were proposed.

TI Non-adiabatic holonomies for photonic quantum computing
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum computation faces a major challenge: the need for stable quantum gates. Holonomies offer a way to increase the stability of quantum gates on a fundamental level, as their functionality directly arises from the geometry of the underlying Hilbert space. We present the quantum optical realization of holonomies as single-qubit quantum gates. Specifically, we implement them in a non-adiabatic scheme, which paves the way for unprecedented miniaturization. To demonstrate their versatility, we realize the Hadamard and Pauli-X gates, experimentally show their non-Abelian nature, and combine them into a single-qubit quantum algorithm, the PQ penny flipover. The planar geometry of our designs enables them to substitute directional couplers currently in widespread use in photonic quantum architectures across all platforms.

TI Emulating two qubits with a four-level transmon qudit for variational
   quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Using quantum systems with more than two levels, or qudits, can scale the computational space of quantum processors more efficiently than using qubits, which may offer an easier physical implementation for larger Hilbert spaces. However, individual qudits may exhibit larger noise, and algorithms designed for qubits require to be recompiled to qudit algorithms for execution. In this work, we implemented a two-qubit emulator using a 4-level superconducting transmon qudit for variational quantum algorithm applications and analyzed its noise model. The major source of error for the variational algorithm was readout misclassification error and amplitude damping. To improve the accuracy of the results, we applied error-mitigation techniques to reduce the effects of the misclassification and qudit decay event. The final predicted energy value is within the range of chemical accuracy.

TI Variational Estimation of Optimal Signal States for Quantum Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article explores the performance of quantum communication systems in the presence of noise and focuses on finding the optimal encoding for maximizing the classical communication rate, approaching the classical capacity in some scenarios. Instead of theoretically bounding the ultimate capacity of the channel, we adopt a signal processing perspective to estimate the achievable performance of a physically available but otherwise unknown quantum channel. By employing a variational algorithm to estimate the trace distance between quantum states, we numerically determine the optimal encoding protocol for the amplitude damping and Pauli channels. Our simulations demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the method with a few iterations, confirming that optimal conditions for binary quantum communication systems can be variationally determined with minimal computation. Furthermore, since the channel knowledge is not required at the transmitter or at the receiver, these results can be employed in arbitrary quantum communication systems, including satellite-based communication systems, a particularly relevant platform for the quantum Internet.

TI A Linear Algebraic Framework for Dynamic Scheduling Over Memory-Equipped
   Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum internetworking is a recent field that promises numerous interesting applications, many of which require the distribution of entanglement between arbitrary pairs of users. This article deals with the problem of scheduling in an arbitrary entanglement swapping quantum network-often called first-generation quantum network-in its general topology, multicommodity, loss-aware formulation. We introduce a linear algebraic framework that exploits quantum memory through the creation of intermediate entangled links. The framework is then employed to apply Lyapunov drift minimization (a standard technique in classical network science) to mathematically derive a natural class of scheduling policies for quantum networks minimizing the square norm of the user demand backlog. Moreover, an additional class of Max-Weight-inspired policies is proposed and benchmarked, reducing significantly the computation cost at the price of a slight performance degradation. The policies are compared in terms of information availability, localization, and overall network performance through an ad hoc simulator that admits user-provided network topologies and scheduling policies in order to showcase the potential application of the provided tools to quantum network design.

TI Secure Quantum Communication With Multi-Users in Quantum Networks
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and encryption protocols are central to secure user-to-user communication in quantum networks. However, the detection of eavesdropping, security vulnerabilities, and performance degradation at high traffic levels are some of the challenges faced by inefficient multi-user communication. Current approaches do not adequately overcome these challenges. This paper suggests a holistic framework that integrates QKD, classical-quantum multiple access techniques, and advanced security protocols for overcoming these issues. This framework uses the QKD-SCM for communication security across several nodes and makes use of classical-quantum multiple accesses for greater speed and scalability in communication. Security is then further optimized with the MUQQ-ESTMP GHZ based on Multi-User Quantum Protocol, (MUQPQ), where it optimizes queries across several users. Lattice-based cryptography is deployed to protect against quantum computing attacks, and for detecting eavesdropper attacks, the Reverse Reconciliation Algorithm for binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (RRA-BIAWGNC) is used. Furthermore, QPQB has been integrated as a searchable symmetric encryption protocol to safeguard the data in cloud storage. The performance of the system has been analyzed with metrics like detection accuracy of eavesdrop attack (97%), communication complexity (95%), effective key rate (590 b/s), communication efficiency (96%), and computational overhead (98%). Simulation has been carried out using ns-3.30.1 and Python. Simulation results indicate a considerable reduction in communication complexity up to 40% and enhanced detection accuracy that surpassed the existing stateof- the-art benchmarks. Through the integration of multiple advanced techniques for security, this research contributes to the development of scalable and quantum communication networks with security.

TI Autonomous quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum
   computation with squeezed cat qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose an autonomous quantum error correction scheme using squeezed cat (SC) code against excitation loss in continuous-variable systems. Through reservoir engineering, we show that a structured dissipation can stabilize a two-component SC while autonomously correcting the errors. The implementation of such dissipation only requires low-order nonlinear couplings among three bosonic modes or between a bosonic mode and a qutrit. While our proposed scheme is device independent, it is readily implementable with current experimental platforms such as superconducting circuits and trapped-ion systems. Compared to the stabilized cat, the stabilized SC has a much lower dominant error rate and a significantly enhanced noise bias. Furthermore, the bias-preserving operations for the SC have much lower error rates. In combination, the stabilized SC leads to substantially better logical performance when concatenating with an outer discrete-variable code. The surface-SC scheme achieves more than one order of magnitude increase in the threshold ratio between the loss rate & kappa;(1) and the engineered dissipation rate & kappa;(2). Under a practical noise ratio & kappa;(1)/& kappa;(2) = 10(-3), the repetition-SC scheme can reach a 10(-15) logical error rate even with a small mean excitation number of 4, which already suffices for practically useful quantum algorithms.

TI Image Transmission Over Quantum Communication Systems With Three-Qubit
   Error Correction
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB Quantum communication offers unparalleled reliability and efficiency, making it a promising solution for high-quality media transmission. To explore this potential, we propose a quantum communication system for image transmission, addressing the challenges of transmitting high-quality image data over error-prone channels. A crucial aspect of advancing this field is quantum channel coding, specific to quantum systems. Therefore, this research evaluates the performance of low-complex three-qubit quantum error correction code for image transmission over noisy channels. JPEG and HEIF images are encoded using three-qubit error correction method and compared to 1/3 rate polar codes with equivalent bandwidth. Results show that the three-qubit error correction code significantly outperforms advanced classical polar codes in both classical and quantum domains, achieving a maximum PSNR of 64.5 dB (SSIM = 0.9997) in HEIF and 58.3 dB (SSIM = 0.9994) in JPEG. These findings underscore its potential as a robust solution for quantum communication in media transmission.

TI Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by
   non-Gaussian distillation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here, we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed, and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.

TI Implementation of Quantum Machine Learning for Electronic Structure
   Calculations of Periodic Systems on Quantum Computing Devices
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Quantum machine learning algorithms, the extensions of machine learning to quantum regimes, are believed to be more powerful as they leverage the power of quantum properties. Quantum machine learning methods have been employed to solve quantum many-body systems and have demonstrated accurate electronic structure calculations of lattice models, molecular systems, and recently periodic systems. A hybrid approach using restricted Boltzmann machines and a quantum algorithm to obtain the probability distribution that can be optimized classically is a promising method due to its efficiency and ease of implementation. Here, we implement the benchmark test of the hybrid quantum machine learning on the IBM-Q quantum computer to calculate the electronic structure of typical two-dimensional crystal structures: hexagonal-boron nitride and graphene. The band structures of these systems calculated using the hybrid quantum machine learning approach are in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional electronic structure calculations. This benchmark result implies that the hybrid quantum machine learning method, empowered by quantum computers, could provide a new way of calculating the electronic structures of quantum many-body systems.

TI Quantum Computer Architecture for Quantum Error Correction With
   Distributing Process to Multiple Temperature Layers
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Quantum computers are capable of performing large-scale calculations in a shorter time than conventional classical computers. Because quantum computers are realized in microscopic physical systems, unintended change in the quantum state is unavoidable due to interaction between environment, and it would lead to error in computation. Therefore, quantum error correction is needed to detect and correct errors that have occurred. In this paper, we propose quantum computer architecture for quantum error correction by taking account that the components of a quantum computer with quantum dots in silicon are divided into multiple temperature layers inside and outside the dilution refrigerator. Based on the required performance and possible processing capacity, each component was distributed in various temperature layers: the chip with qubits and the chip for generation of precise analog signals to control qubits are placed on 100 mK and 4 K stages inside the dilution refrigerator, respectively, while real-time digital processing is performed outside the dilution refrigerator. We then experimentally demonstrate the digital control sequence for quantum error correction combined with a simulator which simulates quantum states based on control commands from the digital processing system. The simulator enables the proof-of-principle experiment of system architecture independent of the development of the chips. The real time processing including determination of feed-forward operation and transmission of feed-forward operation commands is carried out by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) outside the dilution refrigerator within 0.01 ms for bit-flip or phase-flip error corrections. This is a sufficiently short time compared to the assumed relaxation time, which is the approximate time that the quantum state can be preserved, meaning that our proposed architecture is applicable to quantum error correction.

TI Experimental Verifiable Multiclient Blind Quantum Computing on a Qline
   Architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The exploitation of certification tools by end users represents a fundamental aspect of the development of quantum technologies as the hardware scales up beyond the regime of classical simulability. Certifying quantum networks becomes even more crucial when the privacy of their users is exposed to malicious quantum nodes or servers as in the case of multiclient distributed blind quantum computing, where several clients delegate a joint private computation to remote quantum servers, such as federated quantum machine learning. In such protocols, security must be provided not only by keeping data hidden but also by verifying that the server is correctly performing the requested computation while minimizing the hardware assumptions on the employed devices. Notably, standard verification techniques fail in scenarios where the clients receive quantum states from untrusted sources such as in a recently demonstrated linear quantum network performing multiclient blind quantum computation. However, recent theoretical results provide techniques to verify blind quantum computations even in the case of untrusted state preparation. Equipped with such theoretical tools, in this Letter we provide the first experimental implementation of a multiclient verifiable blind quantum computing protocol in a distributed architecture. Our results represent novel perspectives for the verification of multitenant distributed quantum computation in large-scale networks.

TI Hierarchical Controlled Hybrid Quantum Communication Based on Six-Qubit
   Entangled States in IoT
SO SENSORS
AB The rapid development and extensive application of the Internet of Things (IoT) have brought new challenges and opportunities to the field of communication. By integrating quantum secure communication with the IoT, we can provide a higher level of security and privacy protection to counteract security threats in the IoT. In this paper, a hybrid quantum communication scheme using six-qubit entangled states as a channel is proposed for specific IoT application scenarios. This scheme achieves hierarchical control of communication protocols on a single quantum channel. In the proposed scheme, device A transmits data to device B through quantum teleportation, while device B issues control commands to device A through remote quantum state preparation technology. These two tasks are controlled by control nodes C and D, respectively. The transmission of information from device A to device B is a relatively less important task, which can be solely controlled by control node C. On the other hand, issuing control commands from device B to device A is a more crucial task requiring joint control from control nodes C and D. This paper describes the proposed scheme and conducts simulation experiments using IBM's Qiskit Aer quantum computing simulator. The results demonstrate that the fidelity of the quantum teleportation protocol (QTP) and the remote state preparation protocol (RSP) reach an impressive value of 0.999, fully validating the scheme's feasibility. Furthermore, the factors affecting the fidelity of the hybrid communication protocol in an IoT environment with specific quantum noise are analyzed. By combining the security of quantum communication with the application scenarios of the IoT, this paper presents a new possibility for IoT communication.

TI Quantum steering and quantum discord under noisy channels and
   entanglement swapping
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Quantum entanglement, quantum discord, and EPR-steering are properties which are considered as valuable resources for fuelling quantum information-theoretic protocols. EPR-steering is a correlation weaker than nonlocality (in the Bell's sense) and yet stronger than entanglement. Quantum discord on the other hand, captures non-classical behaviour beyond that of entanglement, and its study has remained of active research interest during the past two decades. Exploring the behaviour of these quantum correlations in different physical scenarios, like those simulated by open quantum systems, is therefore of crucial importance for understanding their viability for quantum technologies. In this work, we analyse the behaviour of EPR-steering, entanglement, and quantum discord, for partially entangled two-qubit states with coloured noise, introduced by Ameida et al. [1], under various quantum processes. First, we consider the three noisy channel scenarios of; phase damping, generalised amplitude damping and stochastic dephasing channel. Second, we explore their behaviour in an entanglement swapping scenario. We quantify EPR-steering by means of an inequality with three-input two-output measurement settings, and address quantum discord as the interferometric power of quantum states. We discuss the sudden death of steering and entanglement induced by the noisy processes. Additionally, in the case of generalised amplitude damping, a death and revival behaviour can be interpreted in terms of one of the noise's parameters. Second, we contrast the fact that noisy channels in general reduce the amount of correlations present in the system, with the swapping protocol, which displays scenarios where these quantum correlations can be enhanced with respect to the correlations at the initial stage of the protocol. In particular, we present a trade-off between the post-swap amount of correlations and their probability of occurrence. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Heralded fidelity-robust high-dimensional quantum computing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In high-dimensional quantum systems, qudits offer a richer resource than traditional two-dimensional qubits, increasing the capacity of quantum channels and enhancing the efficiency of fault-tolerant quantum computation. These advantages can be utilized to solve complex problems across various fields. In the paper, we propose a 2-qudit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate in a 4x4-dimensional space and a 3-qudit controlled-controlled-NOT (Toffoli) gate in a 4x4x4-dimensional space, both equipped with error-heralded units. Our designs do not require auxiliary photons or extra negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) center, resulting in saving resources. Moreover, since the imperfect NV--cavity interaction processes are predicted in real-time by sensitive single-photon detectors, both high-dimensional CNOT and Toffoli gates boast robust fidelities using existing technology. Furthermore, our protocols simplify circuits with error-heralded units, significantly contributing to the effectiveness of quantum information technology and paving the way for advanced high-dimensional quantum computing.

TI Building a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer Using Concatenated Cat Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a comprehensive architectural analysis for a proposed fault-tolerant quantum computer based on cat codes concatenated with outer quantum error-correcting codes. For the physical hardware, we propose a system of acoustic resonators coupled to superconducting circuits with a two-dimensional layout. Using estimated physical parameters for the hardware, we perform a detailed error analysis of measurements and gates, including CNOT and Toffoli gates. Having built a realistic noise model, we numerically simulate quantum error correction when the outer code is either a repetition code or a thin rectangular surface code. Our next step toward universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a protocol for fault-tolerant Toffoli magic state preparation that significantly improves upon the fidelity of physical Toffoli gates at very low qubit cost. To achieve even lower overheads, we devise a new magic state distillation protocol for Toffoli states. Combining these results together, we obtain realistic full-resource estimates of the physical error rates and overheads needed to run useful fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. We find that with around 1000 superconducting circuit components, one could construct a fault-tolerant quantum computer that can run circuits, which are currently intractable for classical computers. Hardware with 18 000 superconducting circuit components, in turn, could simulate the Hubbard model in a regime beyond the reach of classical computing.

TI Universal quantum computation and quantum error correction using
   discrete holonomies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Holonomic quantum computation exploits a quantum state's nontrivial, matrix-valued geometric phase (holonomy) to perform fault-tolerant computation. Holonomies arising from systems where the Hamiltonian traces a continuous path through parameter space have been well researched. Discrete holonomies, on the other hand, where the state jumps from point to point in state space, have had little prior investigation. Using a sequence of incomplete projective measurements of the spin operator, we build an explicit approach to universal quantum computation. We show that quantum error correction codes integrate naturally in our scheme, providing a model for measurement-based quantum computation that combines the passive error resilience of holonomic quantum computation and active error correction techniques. In the limit of dense measurements we recover known continuous-path holonomies.

TI A didactic approach to quantum machine learning with a single qubit
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This paper presents, via an explicit example with a real-world dataset, a hands-on introduction to the field of quantum machine learning (QML). We focus on the case of learning with a single qubit, using data re-uploading techniques. After a discussion of the relevant background in quantum computing and machine learning we provide a thorough explanation of the data re-uploading models that we consider, and implement the different proposed formulations in toy and real-world datasets using the qiskit quantum computing SDK. We find that, as in the case of classical neural networks, the number of layers is a determining factor in the final accuracy of the models. Moreover, and interestingly, the results show that single-qubit classifiers can achieve a performance that is on-par with classical counterparts under the same set of training conditions. While this cannot be understood as a proof of the advantage of quantum machine learning, it points to a promising research direction, and raises a series of questions that we outline.

TI Novel qutrit circuit design for multiplexer, De-multiplexer, and decoder
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Designing conventional circuits present many challenges, including minimizing internal power dissipation. An approach to overcoming this problem is utilizing quantum technology, which has attracted significant attention as an alternative to Nanoscale CMOS technology. The reduction of energy dissipation makes quantum circuits an up-and-coming emerging technology. Ternary logic can potentially diminish the quantum circuit width, which is currently a limitation in quantum technologies. Using qutrit instead of qubit could play an essential role in the future of quantum computing. First, we propose two approaches for quantum ternary decoder circuit in this context. Then, we propose a quantum ternary multiplexer and quantum ternary demultiplexer to exploit the constructed quantum ternary decoder circuit. Techniques to achieve lower quantum cost are of importance. We considered two types of circuits, one in which the output states are always restored to the initial input states and the other in which the states of the output are irrelevant. We compare the proposed quantum ternary circuits with their existing counterparts and present the improvements. It is possible to realize the proposed designs using macro-level ternary gates that are based on the ion-trap realizable ternary 2-qutrit Muthukrishnan-Stroud and 1-qutrit permutation gates.

TI Quantum error correction with molecular spin qudits
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Thanks to the large number of levels which can be coherently manipulated, molecular spin systems constitute a very promising platform for quantum computing. Indeed, they can embed quantum error correction within single molecular objects, thus greatly simplifying its actual realization in the short term. We consider a recent proposal, which exploits a spin qudit to encode the protected unit, and is tailored to fight pure dephasing. Here we compare the implementation of this code on different molecules, in which the qudit is provided by either an electronic or a nuclear spin (S, I > 1), coupled to a spin-1/2 electronic ancilla for error detection. By thorough numerical simulations we show that a significant gain in the effective phase memory time can be achieved. This is further enhanced by exploiting pulse-shaping techniques to reduce the leakage and/or the impact of decoherence during correction. Moreover, we simulate the implementation of single-qubit operations on the encoded states.

SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB With its significant security potential, the quantum internet is poised to revolutionize technologies like cryptography and communications. Although it boasts enhanced security over traditional networks, the quantum internet still encounters unique security challenges essential for safeguarding its Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). This study explores these challenges by analyzing the vulnerabilities and the corresponding mitigation strategies across different layers of the quantum internet, including physical, link, network, and application layers. We assess the severity of potential attacks, evaluate the expected effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and identify vulnerabilities within diverse network configurations, integrating both classical and quantum approaches. Our research highlights the dynamic nature of these security issues and emphasizes the necessity for adaptive security measures. The findings underline the need for ongoing research into the security dimension of the quantum internet to ensure its robustness, encourage its adoption, and maximize its impact on society.

TI Single-shot and measurement-based quantum error correction via fault
   complexes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Photonics provides a viable path to a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer. The natural framework for this platform is measurement-based quantum computation, where fault-tolerant graph states supersede traditional quantum error-correcting codes. However, the existing formalism for foliation-the construction of fault-tolerant graph states-does not reveal how certain properties, such as single-shot error correction, manifest in the measurement-based setting. We introduce the fault complex, a representation of dynamic quantum errorcorrection protocols particularly well suited to describe foliation. Our approach enables precise computation of fault tolerance properties of foliated codes and provides insights into circuit-based quantum computation. Analyzing the fault complex yields improved thresholds for three- and four-dimensional toric codes, a generalization of stability experiments, and the existence of single-shot lattice surgery with higher-dimensional topological codes.

Toreliably generate, store, process, and transmit quantum information, diverse systems have been studied. While for specific tasks some of these systems are more suitable than others, no single system can meet all envisioned demands. Erbium doped crystal has optical transition at 1.5 mu m and possesses long optical coherence time and spin coherence time, and thus is one of the best candidates in building several essential blocks for quantum information applications. In this review, we summarize the applications of erbium doped crystals in quantum memories, quantum transducers, quantum sources, and quantum manipulations based on erbium-erbium interactions.

TI Quantum discord is not extremalized by Gaussian states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum discord is an important measure of quantum correlations that goes beyond the paradigm of quantum entanglement. However, calculating quantum discord involves optimization over measurements, which is computationally challenging and often infeasible. This raises the intriguing question of Gaussian extremality-whether the quantum discord of a reference Gaussian state can provide a meaningful bound to the quantum discord of the original state. In this paper, we investigate this question by comparing the Gaussian discord of a reference Gaussian state with the quantum discord.

TI Generalized number-phase lattice encoding of a bosonic mode for quantum
   error correction
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bosonic systems offer unique advantages for quantum error correction, as a single bosonic mode provides a large Hilbert space to redundantly encode quantum information. However, previous studies have been limited to exploiting symmetries in the quadrature phase space. Here we introduce a unified framework for encoding a qubit utilizing the symmetries in the phase space of number and phase variables of a bosonic mode. The logical codewords form lattice structures in the number-phase space, resulting in rectangular, oblique, and diamond-shaped lattice codes. Notably, oblique and diamond codes exhibit a number-phase vortex effect, where number-shift errors induce discrete phase rotations as syndromes, enabling efficient correction via phase measurements. These codes show significant performance advantages over conventional quadrature codes against dephasing noise in the potential one-way quantum communication applications. Our generalized number-phase codes open up new possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum computation and extending the quantum communication range with bosonic systems.

TI Rydberg Wire Gates for Universal Quantum Computation
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Rydberg atom arrays offer flexible geometries of strongly interacting neutral atoms, which are useful for many quantum applications such as quantum simulation and quantum computation. Here, we consider an all-optical gate-based quantum computing scheme for the Rydberg atom arrays, in which auxiliary atoms (wire atoms) are used as a mean of quantum-mechanical remote-couplings among data-qubit atoms, and optical individual-atom addressing of the data and wire atoms is used to construct universal quantum gates of the data atoms. The working principle of our gates is to use the wire atoms for coupling mediation only, while leaving them in noncoupling ground states before and after each gate operation, which allows the double-excited states of data qubits to be accessible by a sequence of pi or pi/2 pulses addressing the data and wire atoms. Optical pulse sequences are constructed for standard one-, two-, and multi-qubit gates, and the arbitrary two-qubit state preparation is considered for universal computation prospects. We further provide a detailed resource estimate for an experimental implementation of this scheme in a Rydberg quantum simulator.

TI Quantum error correction with silicon spin qubits
SO NATURE
AB Future large-scale quantum computers will rely on quantum error correction (QEC) to protect the fragile quantum information during computation(1,)(2). Among the possible candidate platforms for realizing quantum computing devices, the compatibility with mature nanofabrication technologies of silicon-based spin qubits offers promise to overcome the challenges in scaling up device sizes from the prototypes of today to large-scale computers(3-5). Recent advances in silicon-based qubits have enabled the implementations of high-quality one-qubit and two-qubit systems(6-)(8). However, the demonstration of QEC, which requires three or more coupled qubits', and involves a three-qubit gate(9-)(11) or measurement-based feedback, remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate a three-qubit phase-correcting code in silicon, in which an encoded three-qubit state is protected against any phase-flip error on one of the three qubits. The correction to this encoded state is performed by a three-qubit conditional rotation, which we implement by an efficient single-step resonantly driven iToffoli gate. As expected, the error correction mitigates the errors owing to one-qubit phase-flip, as well as the intrinsic dephasing mainly owing to quasi-static phase noise. These results show successful implementation of QEC and the potential of a silicon-based platform for large-scale quantum computing.

AB Quantum computing, along with quantum metrology and quantum communication, are disruptive technologies that promise, in the near future, to impact different sectors of academic research and industry. Among the computational challenges with great interest in science and industry are the inversion problems. These kinds of numerical procedures can be described as the process of determining the cause of an event from measurements of its effects. In this paper, we apply a recursive quantum algorithm to a D-Wave quantum annealer to solve a small scale seismic inversions problem. We compare the obtained results from the quantum computer to those derived from a classical algorithm. The accuracy achieved by the quantum computer is at least as good as that of the classical computer.

TI Scrambling and quantum teleportation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Scrambling is a concept introduced from information loss problem arising in black hole. In this paper we discuss the effect of scrambling from a perspective of pure quantum information theory regardless of the information loss problem. We introduce 7-qubit quantum circuit for a quantum teleportation. It is shown that the teleportation can be perfect if a maximal scrambling unitary is used. From this fact we conjecture that "the quantity of scrambling is proportional to the fidelity of teleportation". In order to confirm the conjecture, we introduce 0-dependent partially scrambling unitary, which reduces to no scrambling and maximal scrambling at 0 = 0 and 0 = p /2, respectively. Then, we compute the average fidelity analytically, and numerically by making use of qiskit (version 0.36.2) and 7-qubit real quantum computer ibm_oslo. Finally, we show that our conjecture can be true or false depending on the choice of qubits for Bell measurement.

The concurrent realization of these features is challenging due to inherent limitations of matter platforms and light-matter interaction protocols. Here, we propose an approach to overcome this obstacle, based on the implementation of the Autler-Townes-splitting (ATS) quantum-memory protocol on Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) platform. We demonstrate a proof-of-principle of this approach by storing short pulses of single-photon-level light as a collective spin-excitation in a rubidium-BEC. For 20 ns long-pulses, we achieve an ultra-low-noise memory with an efficiency of 30% and lifetime of 15 mu s. The non-adiabatic character of the ATS protocol (leading to high-speed and low-noise operation) in combination with the intrinsically large atomic densities and ultra-low temperatures of the BEC platform (offering highly efficient and long-lived storage) opens up a new avenue toward high-performance quantum memories.

TI Coexistent Quantum Channel Characterization Using Spectrally Resolved
   Bayesian Quantum Process Tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The coexistence of quantum and classical signals over the same optical fiber with minimal degrada-tion of the transmitted quantum information is critical for operating large-scale quantum networks over the existing communications infrastructure. Here, we systematically characterize the quantum channel that results from simultaneously distributing approximate single-photon polarization-encoded qubits and classical light of varying intensities through fiber-optic channels of up to 15 km. Using spectrally resolved quantum process tomography with a Bayesian reconstruction method that we develop, we estimate the full quantum channel from experimental photon counting data, both with and without classical background. Furthermore, although we find the exact channel description to be a weak function of the pump polariza-tion, we nevertheless show that the coexistent fiber-based quantum channel has high process fidelity with an ideal depolarizing channel when the noise is dominated by Raman scattering. These results provide a basis for the future development of quantum repeater designs and quantum error-correcting codes for real-world channels and inform models used in the analysis and simulation of quantum networks.

TI Fidelity-Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in
   Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multipath routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multipath routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimized the tradeoff between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multipath protocols can achieve up to an 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multipath routing both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.

TI A general protocol for distributed quantum gates
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In distributed quantum computation, quantum remote-controlled gates are used frequently and applied on separate nodes or subsystems of a network. One of the universal and well-known controlled gates is the n-qubit controlled-NOT gate, especially Toffoli gate for the case of three qubits, which are frequently used to synthesize quantum circuits. In this paper, we considered a more general case, an n-qubit controlled-U gate, and present a general protocol for implementing these gates remotely with minimum required resources. Then, the proposed method is applied to implement a Toffoli gate in bipartite and tripartite systems. In this method, we considered cases in which a group of qubits belongs to one subsystem of the network. Then, we improved its consumption resources.

TI Enhancing quantum memory lifetime with measurement-free local error
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Reliable quantum computation requires systematic identification and correction of errors that occur and accumulate in quantum hardware. To diagnose and correct such errors, standard quantum error-correcting protocols utilize global error information across the system obtained by mid-circuit readout of ancillary qubits. We investigate circuit-level error-correcting protocols that are measurement-free and based on local error information. Such a local error correction (LEC) circuit consists of faulty multi-qubit gates to perform both syndrome extraction and ancilla-controlled error removal. We develop and implement a reinforcement learning framework that takes a fixed set of faulty gates as inputs and outputs an optimized LEC circuit. To evaluate this approach, we quantitatively characterize an extension of logical qubit lifetime by a noisy LEC circuit. For the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and four-dimensional toric code, our optimized LEC circuit performs better at extending a memory lifetime compared with a conventional LEC circuit based on Toom's rule in a subthreshold gate error regime. We further show that such circuits can be used to reduce the rate of mid-circuit readouts to preserve a 2D toric code memory. Finally, we discuss the application of the LEC protocol on dissipative preparation of quantum states with topological phases.

TI Single-Qubit Fidelity Assessment of Quantum Annealing Hardware
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As a wide variety of quantum computing platforms become available, methods for assessing and comparing the performance of these devices are of increasing interest and importance. Inspired by the success of single-qubit error rate computations for tracking the progress of gate-based quantum computers, thiswork proposes a quantum annealing single-qubit assessment (QASA) protocol for quantifying the performance of individual qubits in quantum annealing computers. The proposed protocol scales to large quantum annealers with thousands of qubits and provides unique insights into the distribution of qubit properties within a particular hardware device. The efficacy of the QASA protocol is demonstrated by analyzing the properties of a D-Wave 2000Q system, revealing unanticipated correlations in the qubit performance of that device. A study repeating the QASA protocol at different annealing times highlights how the method can be utilized to understand the impact of annealing parameters on qubit performance. Overall, the proposed QASA protocol provides a useful tool for assessing the performance of current and emerging quantum annealing devices.

TI Hybrid classical-quantum communication networks
SO PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Over the past several decades, the proliferation of global classical communication networks has transformed various facets of human society. Concurrently, quantum networking has emerged as a dynamic field of research, driven by its potential applications in distributed quantum computing, quantum sensor networks, and secure communications. This prompts a fundamental question: rather than constructing quantum networks from scratch, can we harness the widely available classical fiber-optic infrastructure to establish hybrid quantum-classical networks? This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of ongoing research endeavors aimed at integrating quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution, into existing lightwave networks. This approach offers the substantial advantage of reducing implementation costs by allowing classical and quantum communication protocols to share optical fibers, communication hardware, and other network control resources-arguably the most pragmatic solution in the near term. In the long run, classical communication will also reap the rewards of innovative quantum communication technologies, such as quantum memories and repeaters. Accordingly, our vision for the future of the Internet is that of heterogeneous communication networks thoughtfully designed for the seamless support of both classical and quantum communications.

TI Automated Discovery of Autonomous Quantum Error Correction Schemes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We can encode a qubit in the energy levels of a quantum system. Relaxation and other dissipation processes lead to decay of the fidelity of this stored information. Is it possible to preserve the quantum information for a longer time by introducing additional drives and dissipation? The existence of autonomous quantum error correcting codes answers this question in the positive. Nonetheless, discovering these codes for a real physical system, i.e., finding the encoding and the associated driving fields and bath couplings, remains a challenge that has required intuition and inspiration to overcome. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a computational approach based on adjoint optimization for discovering autonomous quantum error correcting codes given a Hamiltonian description of a physical system. We implement an optimizer that searches for a logical subspace and control parameters to better preserve quantum information. We demonstrate our method on a system of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a lossy qubit, and find that varying the Hamiltonian distance in Fock space a proxy for the control hardware complexity leads to discovery of different and new error correcting schemes. We discover what we call the root 3 code, realizable with a Hamiltonian distance d = 2, and propose a hardware-efficient implementation based on superconducting circuits.

AB Quantum noise is the key challenge in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Previous work for mitigating noise has primarily focused on gate-level or pulse-level noise-adaptive compilation. However, limited research has explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum circuits themselves resilient to noise.
   In this paper, we propose QuantumNAS, a comprehensive framework for noise-adaptive co-search of the variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural networks for machine learning and variational ansatzes for quantum simulation. However, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to decouple the circuit search from parameter training by introducing a novel SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of pre-defined parameterized gates (e.g., U3 and CU3) and trained by iteratively sampling and updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates in a fine-grained manner.
   Extensively evaluated with 12 quantum machine learning (QML) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) benchmarks on 14 quantum computers, QuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware search, human, random, and existing noise-adaptive qubit mapping baselines. For QML tasks, QuantumNAS is the first to demonstrate over 95% 2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class classification accuracy on real quantum computers. It also achieves the lowest eigenvalue for VQE tasks on H-2, H2O, LiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD baselines. We also open-source the TorchQuantum library for fast training of parameterized quantum circuits to facilitate future research.

TI Verification of continuous-variable quantum memories
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A proper quantum memory is argued to consist in a quantum channel which cannot be simulated with a measurement followed by classical information storage and a final state preparation, i.e. with an entanglement breaking (EB) channel. The verification of quantum memories (non-EB channels) is a task in which an honest user wants to test the quantum memory of an untrusted, remote provider. This task is inherently suited for the class of protocols with trusted quantum inputs, sometimes called measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocols. Here, we study the MDI certification of non-EB channels in continuous variable (CV) systems. We provide a simple witness based on adversarial metrology, and describe an experimentally friendly protocol that can be used to verify all non Gaussian incompatibility breaking quantum memories. Our results can be tested with current technology and can be applied to test other devices resulting in non-EB channels, such as CV quantum transducers and transmission lines.

TI Fault-tolerant computing with single-qudit encoding in a molecular spin
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB We show that molecular spins represent ideal materials to realize a fault-tolerant quantum computer, in which all quantum operations include protection against leading (dephasing) errors. This is achieved by pursuing a qudit approach, in which logical error-corrected qubits are encoded in a single multi-level molecule (a qudit) and not in a large collection of two-level systems, as in standard codes. By preventing such an explosion of resources, this emerging way of thinking about quantum error correction makes its actual implementation using molecular spins much closer. We show how to perform all quantum computing operations (logical gates, corrections and measurements) without propagating errors. We achieve a quasi-exponential error correction with only linear qudit size growth, i.e. a higher efficiency than the standard approach based on stabilizer codes and concatenation.
   We show how to perform fault-tolerant quantum computing by using a simple d-level molecular spin qudit. We demonstrate a nearly exponential error reduction with linear growth in the number of single-qudit levels and loose coherence requirements.

TI Quantum photonic gates with two-dimensional random walkers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum gates are crucial for processing quantum information, but implementing them in a photonic platform poses unique challenges due to the peculiar way photons propagate and interfere. Here, we propose quantum photonic gates that utilize continuous time two-dimensional random walking photons. These gates can be implemented using the inverse design method, where photons randomly walk in a two-dimensional silicon host medium embedded with silicon dioxide scatterers. We propose a C-NOT gate as a multiqubit gate and an X-gate as a single qubit gate. In addition, we provide gate fidelity and study the non-trivial spatial correlations of random walking photons by utilizing the quantum correlation function. The results demonstrate high-fidelity probabilistic quantum gates. Further work is required to address error correction. This work advances the practical implementation of photonic elements in linear optics quantum computation schemes.

TI Memory-corrected quantum repeaters with adaptive syndrome identification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We address the challenge of incorporating encoded quantum memories into an exact secret key rate analysis for small and intermediate-scale quantum repeaters. To this end, we introduce the check matrix model and quantify the resilience of stabilizer codes of up to eleven qubits against Pauli noise, obtaining analytical expressions for effective logical error probabilities. Generally, we find that the five-qubit and Steane codes either outperform more complex, larger codes in the experimentally relevant parameter regimes or have a lower resource overhead. Subsequently, we apply our results to calculate lower bounds on the asymptotic secret key rate in memory-corrected quantum repeaters when using the five-qubit or Steane codes on the memory qubits. The five-qubit code drastically increases the effective memory coherence time, reducing a phase flip probability of 1% to 0.001% when employing an error syndrome identification adapted to the quantum noise channel. Furthermore, it mitigates the impact of faulty Bell state measurements and imperfect state preparation, lowering the minimally required depolarization parameter for nonzero secret key rates in an eight-segment repeater from 98.4% to 96.4%. As a result, the memory-corrected quantum repeater can often generate secret keys in experimental parameter regimes where the unencoded repeater fails to produce a secret key. In an eight-segment repeater, one can even achieve nonvanishing secret key rates up to distances of 2000 km for memory coherence times of tc = 10 s or less using multiplexing. Assuming a zero-distance link-coupling efficiency p0 = 0.7, a depolarization parameter mu = 0.99, tc = 10 s, and an 800 km total repeater length, we obtain a secret key rate of 4.85 Hz, beating both the unencoded repeater that provides 1.25 Hz and ideal twin-field quantum key distribution with 0.71 Hz at GHz clock rates.

TI Optimal Entanglement Swapping in Quantum Repeaters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We formulate the problem of finding the optimal entanglement swapping scheme in a quantum repeater chain as a Markov decision process and present its solution for different repeaters' sizes. Based on this, we are able to demonstrate that the commonly used "doubling" scheme for performing probabilistic entanglement swapping of probabilistically distributed entangled qubit pairs in quantum repeaters does not always produce the best possible raw rate. Focusing on this figure of merit, without considering additional probabilistic elements for error suppression such as entanglement distillation on higher "nesting levels," our approach reveals that a power-of-two number of segments has no privileged position in quantum repeater theory; the best scheme can be constructed for any number of segments. Moreover, classical commu-nication can be included into our scheme, and we show how this influences the raw waiting time for different numbers of segments, confirming again the optimality of "nondoubling" in some relevant parameter regimes. Thus, our approach provides the minimal possible waiting time of quantum repeaters in a fairly general physical setting.

TI Overcoming leakage in quantum error correction
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The leakage of quantum information out of the two computational states of a qubit into other energy states represents a major challenge for quantum error correction. During the operation of an error-corrected algorithm, leakage builds over time and spreads through multi-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the exponential suppression of the logical error with scale, thus challenging the feasibility of quantum error correction as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we demonstrate a distance-3 surface code and distance-21 bit-flip code on a quantum processor for which leakage is removed from all qubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its ability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a tenfold reduction in the steady-state leakage population of the data qubits encoding the logical state and an average leakage population of less than 1x10(-3) throughout the entire device. Our leakage removal process efficiently returns the system back to the computational basis. Adding it to a code circuit would prevent leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles. With this demonstration that leakage can be contained, we have resolved a key challenge for practical quantum error correction at scale.

TI Gate-Based Protocol Simulations for Quantum Repeaters using Quantum-Dot
   Molecules in Switchable Electric Fields
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Electrically controllable quantum-dot molecules (QDMs) are a promising platform for deterministic entanglement generation and, as such, a resource for quantum-repeater networks. A microscopic open-quantum-systems approach based on a time-dependent Bloch-Redfield equation is developed to model the generation of entangled spin states with high fidelity. The state preparation is a crucial step in a protocol for deterministic entangled-photon-pair generation that is proposed for quantum repeater applications. The theory takes into account the quantum-dot molecules' electronic properties that are controlled by time-dependent electric fields as well as dissipation due to electron-phonon interaction. The transition between adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes is quantified, which provides insights into the dynamics of adiabatic control of QDM charge states in the presence of dissipative processes. From this, the maximum speed of entangled-state preparation is inferred under different experimental conditions, which serves as a first step toward simulation of attainable entangled photon-pair generation rates. The developed formalism opens the possibility for device-realistic descriptions of repeater protocol implementations.
   Entanglement generation is crucial for many quantum technology applications, including quantum repeaters. In the context of quantum repeater protocols, an open-quantum systems formalism is developed to simulate gate operations performed on quantum-dot molecules in switchable electric fields. From this, the maximum speed of entangled-state preparation under different experimental conditions can be obtained.image

TI Bilateral fault-tolerant qudit teleportation in multi-hop quantum
   networks
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this paper, we present one general fault-tolerant multi-hop teleportation scheme for arbitrary unknown qudit system, exploring a strategy for distilling high-dimensional EPR pairs within the operational errors channel, where the introduced auxiliary pairs don't have to be in high-fidelity. These errors can be detectable and traceable in quantum networks, promising that the accumulation of the operational errors can be rectified by the final receiver during the teleportation, avoiding the error correction implemented by the intermediate nodes. Moreover, we extend the strategy to the non-maximally entangled EPR channels. In the end, we discuss the potential strategy to improve our scheme including eliminating the encoding step for the error correction codes. Even through the operational errors may occur at the repeater nodes, the performance analysis demonstrates that the scheme significantly preserves the valuable entangled resources and reduces the operational complexity, illustrating the robustness to against the operational errors in repeater nodes.

TI Fitting a collider in a quantum computer: tackling the challenges of
   quantum machine learning for big datasets
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Current quantum systems have significant limitations affecting the processing of large datasets with high dimensionality, typical of high energy physics. In the present paper, feature and data prototype selection techniques were studied to tackle this challenge. A grid search was performed and quantum machine learning models were trained and benchmarked against classical shallow machine learning methods, trained both in the reduced and the complete datasets. The performance of the quantum algorithms was found to be comparable to the classical ones, even when using large datasets. Sequential Backward Selection and Principal Component Analysis techniques were used for feature's selection and while the former can produce the better quantum machine learning models in specific cases, it is more unstable. Additionally, we show that such variability in the results is caused by the use of discrete variables, highlighting the suitability of Principal Component analysis transformed data for quantum machine learning applications in the high energy physics context.

TI Multi-hop teleportation of arbitrary multi-qudit states based on
   d-level GHZ channels
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The combination of quantum communication technology and wireless networks brings a flexible and secure communication method that adapts to a more complex and open network environment. A new multi-hop teleportation scheme is investigated for transferring arbitrary unknown multi-qudit states between two distant parties. Based on a more general quantum routing protocol, intermediate nodes are introduced and linked with each other via d-level entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states as quantum channels. In this multi-hop teleportation protocol, the source node and all the intermediate nodes can perform the entanglement measurement and transmit the measurement results simultaneously, thus reducing the time consumption largely. Furthermore, a general matrix formula is derived between the measurement results and the receiver's state, which enables the receiver to restore the unknown state efficiently. Compared with previous multi-hop teleportation protocols, the teleportation protocol of arbitrary unknown multi-qudit states of the authors can transfer more information, and it demonstrates lower computational complexity and higher flexibility.

TI Quantum Repeater for W States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB W states are a valuable resource for various quantum information tasks, and several protocols to generate them have been proposed and implemented. We introduce a quantum repeater protocol to efficiently distribute three-qubit W states over arbitrary distances in a two-dimensional triangular quantum network with polylogarithmic overhead, thereby enabling these applications between remote parties. The repeater protocol combines two ingredients that we establish: probabilistic entanglement swapping with three copies of three-qubit W states to a single long-distance three-qubit W state, and an improved entanglement purification protocol. The latter not only shows a better performance, but also an enlarged purification regime as compared to previous approaches. We show that the repeater protocol allows one to deal with errors resulting from imperfect channels or state preparation, and noisy operations, and we analyze error thresholds, achievable fidelities, and overheads.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Entanglement-assisted quantum key distribution (QKD) has attracted significant attention for its ability to provide highly secure wireless systems. This work explores the employment of quantum teleportation and the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) in entanglement-assisted QKD to enhance security. By integrating the concepts of entanglement, teleportation, and QFT, the key distribution strategy is significantly improved, leading to more secure communication. The system has been thoroughly tested for quantum bit error rate, secure key rate, and reconciliation efficiency. The results show that this technique outperforms the standard BB84 protocol. Based on their simulations, this protocol appears to be a promising technique for providing quantum-level security to next-generation wireless communication systems.
   A quantum entanglement-aided and teleportation-based quantum key distribution system is proposed. The proposed protocol uses quantum Fourier transform for its implementation. The proposed protocol can provide enhanced security to wireless systems measured in terms of quantum bit error rate, secure key rate, and reconciliation efficiency. image

TI Qutrit toric code and parafermions in trapped ions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The development of programmable quantum devices can be measured by the complexity of many-body states that they are able to prepare. Among the most significant are topologically ordered states of matter, which enable robust quantum information storage and processing. While topological orders are more readily accessible with qudits, experimental realizations have thus far been limited to lattice models of qubits. Here, we prepare and measure a ground state of the Z(3) toric code state on 24 qutrits (obtained by encoding one qutrit into two qubits) in a trapped ion quantum processor with fidelity per qutrit exceeding 96.5(3)%. We manipulate two types of defects which go beyond the conventional qubit toric code: a parafermion, and its bound state which is related to charge conjugation symmetry. We further demonstrate defect fusion and the transfer of entanglement between anyons and defects, which we use to control topological qutrits. Our work opens up the space of long-range entangled states with qudit degrees of freedom for use in quantum simulation and universal error-correcting codes.

TI Closed-Loop CBRAM Crossbar System Toward Hardware Acceleration of
   Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB Quantum computing is a compelling new technology that is becoming increasingly practical as time progresses. Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems of great complexity and magnitude across many different industries, utilizing appropriate quantum algorithms. Given the evolving stage of quantum computing, characterized by a limited number of operational quantum computers that demand extensive cooling, face decoherence issues, and incur significant fabrication costs, there exists a pronounced need for quantum computer simulators. In this work, a reconfigurable closed-loop CBRAM crossbar system has been developed for the execution and acceleration of quantum algorithm simulation, leveraging analog in-memory computing. The circuit supports a universal set of quantum gates representation, and through its reprogramming capabilities and feedback loop, can compute any quantum algorithm. To demonstrate its functionality, the 3-qubit Grover algorithm is executed on the proposed circuit. Building on the extensive circuit simulation, a comparative analysis of power and speed between the proposed nanoelectronic circuit and conventional hardware has been conducted, demonstrating the high efficiency and performance gains, followed by a scalability analysis. Furthermore, a framework has been developed that supports the design of custom closed-loop memristive crossbars through a graphical user interface (GUI), providing the user with the capability to execute quantum algorithms and examine the programming and computations of the circuit, assisting with the realization of a hardware prototype.

TI Quantum Repeater Node Demonstrating Unconditionally Secure Key

AB Long-distance quantum communication requires quantum repeaters to overcome photon loss in optical fibers. Here we demonstrate a repeater node with two memory atoms in an optical cavity. Both atoms are individually and repeatedly entangled with photons that are distributed until each communication partner has independently received one of them. An atomic Bell-state measurement followed by classical communication serves to establish a key. We demonstrate scaling advantage of the key rate, increase the effective attenuation length by a factor of 2, and beat the error-rate threshold of 11% for unconditionally secure communication, the corner stones for repeater-based quantum networks.

TI Efficient and reversible optical-to-spin conversion for solid-state
   quantum memories
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Long-duration and efficient quantum memories for photons are key components of quantum repeater and network applications. To achieve long-duration storage in atomic systems, a short-lived optical coherence can be mapped into a long-lived spin coherence, which forms the basis for many quantum memory schemes. In this work, we present modeling and measurements of the back-and-forth, i.e. reversible, optical-to-spin conversion for an atomic frequency comb (AFC) memory. The AFC memory is implemented in 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 with an applied magnetic field of 231 mT, to suppress time-domain interference effects in the conversion efficiency. By optimizing the conversion using the developed simulation tool, experimentally we achieve a total efficiency of up to 96%, including the spin echo sequence and spin dephasing, for a storage time of 500 mu s. Our methods and results pave the way for long-duration storage of single photon states in 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 with high signal-to-noise, at the millisecond timescale.

TI Efficient simulation of leakage errors in quantum error correcting codes
   using tensor network methods
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Leakage errors, in which a qubit is excited to a level outside the qubit subspace, represent a significant obstacle in the development of robust quantum computers. We present a computationally efficient simulation methodology for studying leakage errors in quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) using tensor network methods, specifically matrix product states. Our approach enables the simulation of various leakage processes, including thermal noise and coherent errors, without approximations (such as the Pauli twirling approximation) that can lead to errors in the estimation of the logical error rate. We apply our method to two QECCs: the one-dimensional repetition code and a thin 3xd surface code. By leveraging the small amount of entanglement generated during the error correction process, we are able to study large systems, up to a few hundred qudits, over many code cycles. We consider a realistic noise model of leakage relevant to superconducting qubits to evaluate code performance and a variety of leakage removal strategies. Our numerical results suggest that appropriate leakage removal is crucial, especially when the code distance is large.

TI Enhancing quantum teleportation efficacy with noiseless linear
   amplification
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Continuous-variable quantum networks are easier to implement than discrete-variable ones, but suffer from a lower teleportation fidelity. Here, the authors demonstrate a CV teleportation protocol exploiting heralded noiseless amplification to increase the fidelity, at the expense of probabilistic operation.
   Quantum teleportation constitutes a fundamental tool for various applications in quantum communication and computation. However, state-of-the-art continuous-variable quantum teleportation is restricted to moderate fidelities and short-distance configurations. This is due to unavoidable experimental imperfections resulting in thermal decoherence during the teleportation process. Here we present a heralded quantum teleporter able to overcome these limitations through noiseless linear amplification. As a result, we report a high fidelity of 92% for teleporting coherent states using a modest level of quantum entanglement. Our teleporter in principle allows nearly complete removal of loss induced onto the input states being transmitted through imperfect quantum channels. We further demonstrate the purification of a displaced thermal state, impossible via conventional deterministic amplification or teleportation approaches. The combination of high-fidelity coherent state teleportation alongside the purification of thermalized input states permits the transmission of quantum states over significantly long distances. These results are of both practical and fundamental significance; overcoming long-standing hurdles en route to highly-efficient continuous-variable quantum teleportation, while also shining new light on applying teleportation to purify quantum systems from thermal noise.

TI Adiabatic quantum state transfer in a semiconductor quantum-dot spin
   chain
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Semiconductor quantum-dot spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation, because they are scalable and possess long coherence times. In order to realize this full potential, however, high-fidelity information transfer mechanisms are required for quantum error correction and efficient algorithms. Here, we present evidence of adiabatic quantum-state transfer in a chain of semiconductor quantum-dot electron spins. By adiabatically modifying exchange couplings, we transfer single- and two-spin states between distant electrons in less than 127ns. We also show that this method can be cascaded for spin-state transfer in long spin chains. Based on simulations, we estimate that the probability to correctly transfer single-spin eigenstates and two-spin singlet states can exceed 0.95 for the experimental parameters studied here. In the future, state and process tomography will be required to verify the transfer of arbitrary single qubit states with a fidelity exceeding the classical bound. Adiabatic quantum-state transfer is robust to noise and pulse-timing errors. This method will be useful for initialization, state distribution, and readout in large spin-qubit arrays for gate-based quantum computing. It also opens up the possibility of universal adiabatic quantum computing in semiconductor quantum-dot spin qubits. Previous demonstrations of spin state transfer in quantum dot chains relied on physical motion of electrons or sequences of SWAP operations. Here, the authors implement an alternative method based on adiabatic evolution, offering advantages in terms of implementation and robustness to noise and errors.

TI Near-term distributed quantum computation using mean-field corrections
   and auxiliary qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Distributed quantum computation is often proposed to increase the scalability of quantum hardware, as it reduces cooperative noise and requisite connectivity by sharing quantum information between distant quantum devices. However, such exchange of quantum information itself poses unique engineering challenges, requiring high gate fidelity and costly non-local operations. To mitigate this, we propose near-term distributed quantum computing, focusing on approximate approaches that involve limited information transfer and conservative entanglement production. We first devise an approximate distributed computing scheme for the time evolution of quantum systems split across any combination of classical and quantum devices. Our procedure harnesses mean-field corrections and auxiliary qubits to link two or more devices classically, optimally encoding the auxiliary qubits to both minimize short-time evolution error and extend the approximate scheme's performance to longer evolution times. We then expand the scheme to include limited quantum information transfer through selective qubit shuffling or teleportation, broadening our method's applicability and boosting its performance. Finally, we build upon these concepts to produce an approximate circuit-cutting technique for the fragmented pre-training of variational quantum algorithms. To characterize our technique, we introduce a non-linear perturbation theory that discerns the critical role of our mean-field corrections in optimization and may be suitable for analyzing other non-linear quantum techniques. This fragmented pre-training is remarkably successful, reducing algorithmic error by orders of magnitude while requiring fewer iterations.

TI Quantum Machine Learning: Towards Hybrid Quantum-Classical Vision Models
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The emergence of deep vision models such as convolutional neural networks and vision transformers has revolutionized computer vision, enabling significant advancements in image classification, object detection, and segmentation. In parallel, the rapid development of quantum computing has spurred interest in quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates the strengths of quantum computation with the representational power of deep learning. In QML, parameterized quantum circuits offer the potential to capture complex image features, define complex decision boundaries, and provide other computational advantages. This paper investigates hybrid quantum-classical vision architectures, with a focus on hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks and hybrid quantum-classical vision transformers. These hybrid models explore both quantum pre-processing and post-processing of data, respectively, where quantum circuits are strategically integrated into the data pipeline to enhance model performance. Our results suggest that these hybrid models can enhance accuracy and computational efficiency in vision-related tasks, even with the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

AB Satellite quantum communication is a promising way to build long distance quantum links, making it an essential complement to optical fiber for quantum internetworking beyond metropolitan scales. A satellite point to point optical link differs from the more common fiber links in many ways, both quantitative (higher latency, strong losses) and qualitative (nonconstant parameter values during satellite passage, intermittency of the link, impossibility to set repeaters between the satellite and the ground station). We study here the performance of a quantum link between two ground stations, using a quantum-memory-equipped satellite as a quantum repeater. In contrast with quantum key distribution satellite links, the number of available quantum memory slots m, together with the unavoidable round-trip communication latency t of at least a few milliseconds, severely reduces the effective average repetition rate to m/t - at most a few kilohertz for foreseeable quantum memories. Our study uses two approaches, which validate each other: 1) a simple analytical model of the effective rate of the quantum link; 2) an event-based simulation using the open source Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP). The important differences between satellite and fiber links led us to modify QuISP itself. This work paves the way to the study of hybrid satellite- and fiber-based quantum repeater networks interconnecting different metropolitan areas.

TI Variational Quantum Algorithms for Differential Equations on a Noisy
   Quantum Computer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The role of differential equations (DEs) in science and engineering is of paramount importance, as they provide the mathematical framework for a multitude of natural phenomena. Since quantum computers promise significant advantages over classical computers, quantum algorithms for the solution of DEs have received a lot of attention. Particularly interesting are algorithms that offer advantages in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, characterized by small and error-prone systems. We consider a framework of variational quantum algorithms, quantum circuit learning (QCL), in conjunction with derivation methods, in particular the parameter shift rule, to solve DEs. As these algorithms were specifically designed for NISQ computers, we analyze their applicability on NISQ devices by implementing QCL on an IBM quantum computer. Our analysis of QCL without the parameter shift rule shows that we can successfully learn different functions with three-qubit circuits. However, the hardware errors accumulate with increasing number of qubits, and thus, only a fraction of the qubits available on the current quantum systems can be effectively used. We further show that it is possible to determine derivatives of the learned functions using the parameter shift rule on the IBM hardware. The parameter shift rule results in higher errors, which limits its execution to low-order derivatives. Despite these limitations, we solve a first-order DE on the IBM quantum computer. We further explore the advantages of using multiple qubits in QCL by learning different functions simultaneously and demonstrate the solution of a coupled DE on a simulator.

   Encryption of the Error Correction Data
SO ENTROPY
AB Security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols rely solely on quantum physics laws, namely, on the impossibility to distinguish between non-orthogonal quantum states with absolute certainty. Due to this, a potential eavesdropper cannot extract full information from the states stored in their quantum memory after an attack despite knowing all the information disclosed during classical post-processing stages of QKD. Here, we introduce the idea of encrypting classical communication related to error-correction in order to decrease the amount of information available to the eavesdropper and hence improve the performance of quantum key distribution protocols. We analyze the applicability of the method in the context of additional assumptions concerning the eavesdropper's quantum memory coherence time and discuss the similarity of our proposition and the quantum data locking (QDL) technique.

TI Quantum-dot-based deterministic photon-emitter interfaces for scalable
   photonic quantum technology
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The scale-up of quantum hardware is fundamental to realize the full potential of quantum technology. Among a plethora of hardware platforms, photonics stands out: it provides a modular approach where the main challenges lie in the construction of high-quality building blocks and in the development of methods to interface the modules. The subsequent scale-up could exploit mature integrated photonics foundry technology to produce small-footprint quantum processors of immense complexity. Solid-state quantum emitters can realize a deterministic photon-emitter interface and enable key quantum photonic resources and functionalities, including on-demand single- and multi-photon-entanglement sources, as well as photon-photon nonlinear quantum gates. In this Review, we use the example of quantum dot devices to present the physics of deterministic photon-emitter interfaces, including the main photonic building blocks required to scale up, and discuss quantitative performance benchmarks. While our focus is on quantum dot devices, the presented methods also apply to other quantum-emitter platforms such as atoms, vacancy centres, molecules and superconducting qubits. We also identify applications within quantum communication and computing, presenting a route towards photonics with a genuine quantum advantage.
   Quantum photonics offers a scalable approach to advanced quantum-information processing. Based on deterministic photon-emitter interfaces, this Review presents a road ahead for resource-efficient hardware architectures towards applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.

TI Optimizing Parameterized Quantum Circuits With Free-Axis Single-Qubit
   Gates
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Variational quantum algorithms, which utilize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), are promising tools to achieve quantum advantage for optimization problems on near-term quantum devices. Their PQCs have been conventionally constructed from parameterized rotational angles of single-qubit gates around a predetermined set of axes and two-qubit entangling gates, such as cnot gates. We propose a method to construct a PQC by continuous parameterization of both the angles and the axes of its single-qubit rotation gates. The method is based on the observation that when rotational angles are fixed, optimal axes of rotations can be computed by solving a system of linear equations whose coefficients can be determined from the PQC with small computational overhead. The method can be further simplified to select axes freely from continuous parameters with rotational angles fixed to $\pi$. We show the simplified free-axis selection method has better expressibility against other structural optimization methods when measured with Kullback-Leibler divergence. We also demonstrate PQCs with free-axis selection are more effective to search the ground states of Hamiltonians for condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Because free-axis selection allows designing PQCs without specifying their single-qubit rotational axes, it may significantly improve the handiness of PQCs.

TI The unitary dependence theory for characterizing quantum circuits and
   states
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Most existing quantum algorithms are discovered accidentally or adapted from classical algorithms, and there is the need for a systematic theory to understand and design quantum circuits. Here we develop a unitary dependence theory to characterize the behaviors of quantum circuits and states in terms of how quantum gates manipulate qubits and determine their measurement probabilities. Compared to the conventional entanglement description of quantum circuits and states, the unitary dependence picture offers more practical information on the measurement and manipulation of qubits, easier generalization to many-qubit systems, and better robustness upon partitioning of the system. The unitary dependence theory can be applied to systematically understand existing quantum circuits and design new quantum algorithms.
   Using mathematical structures to characterize quantum circuits and states may lead to systematic development of quantum algorithms. Here, the authors propose a "unitary dependence theory" to characterize the behaviours of quantum circuits and states in terms of how quantum gates manipulate qubits and determine their measurement probabilities.

TI Optimized Quantum Circuit Partitioning Across Multiple Quantum
   Processors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article addresses the challenge of scaling quantum computing by employing distributed quantum algorithms across multiple processors. As quantum circuits grow in complexity, efficiently managing the entanglement resources required for communication between quantum processing units (QPUs) becomes increasingly critical. We propose novel methods to optimize entanglement consumption while accounting for network constraints. Our approach leverages graph partitioning techniques to optimize both qubit teleportation and gate teleportation, minimizing the number of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs required to execute general quantum circuits. In addition, we formulate an integer linear program to further reduce entanglement requirements by mapping the logical resources of partitioned circuits to the physical constraints of the underlying quantum network. Finally, we analyze the entanglement cost for implementing the quantum Fourier transform across multiple QPUs, employing an approach that exploits the circuit's structure to minimize total entanglement consumption. These contributions provide a pathway to scalable and resource-efficient distributed quantum computing.

TI On-chip high-dimensional entangled photon sources
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB High-dimensional quantum entanglement is an important resource for emerging quantum technologies such as quantum communication and quantum computation. The scalability of metres-long experimental setups limits high-dimensional entanglement in bulk optics. Advancements in quantum technology hinge on reproducible, and reconfigurable quantum devices-including photon sources, which are challenging to achieve in a scalable manner using bulk optics. Advances in nanotechnology and CMOS-compatible integration techniques have enabled the generation of entangled photons on millimeter-scale chips, significantly enhancing scalability, stability, replicability, and miniaturization for real-world quantum applications. In recent years we have seen several chip-scale demonstrations with different discrete degrees of freedom including path, frequency-bin, time-bin, and transverse modes, on many material platforms. A complete quantum photonic integrated circuit requires the generation, manipulation, and detection of quantum states, involving various active and passive quantum photonic components which further increase the degree of complexity. Here, we focus on the high-dimensional versions of qubits-qudits-and review the nonlinear optical processes that facilitate on-chip high-dimensional entangled photon sources, and the currently used material platforms. We discuss a range of current implementations of on-chip high-dimensional entangled photon sources and demonstrated applications. We comment on the current challenges due to the limitations of individual material platforms and present future opportunities in hybrid and heterogeneous integration strategies for the next generation of integrated quantum photonic chips.

AB Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of classical systems, particularly in fields such as cryptography and optimization. However, current quantum programming languages often require low-level implementation, posing significant barriers for many developers due to their steep learning curve and limited abstraction. In response, we introduce Qutes, a high-level quantum programming language designed to simplify quantum algorithm development while maintaining the flexibility required for advanced applications. By abstracting complex quantum operations and allowing intuitive expressions through high-level constructs, Qutes enables users to write efficient quantum programs without extensive knowledge of quantum mechanics or circuit design. Built upon Qiskit, Qutes translates its syntax directly into executable quantum code, facilitating seamless integration with quantum hardware. This paper provides an overview of the language's architecture, core functionalities, and its ability to unify classical and quantum operations within a single framework. Additionally, we demonstrate Qutes' application in key quantum algorithms, showcasing its potential to make quantum programming more accessible and practical for a wider range of developers and researchers.

TI Optimizing repeater schemes for the quantum internet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The rate at which quantum communication tasks can be performed using direct transmission is fundamentally hindered by the channel loss. Quantum repeaters allow one, in principle, to overcome these limitations, but their introduction necessarily adds an additional layer of complexity to the distribution of entanglement. This additional complexity-along with the stochastic nature of processes such as entanglement generation, Bell swaps, and entanglement distillation-makes finding good quantum repeater schemes nontrivial. We develop an algorithm that can efficiently perform a heuristic optimization over a subset of quantum repeater schemes for general repeater platforms. We find a strong improvement in the generation rate in comparison to an optimization over a simpler class of repeater schemes based on BDCZ (Briegel, Dur, Cirac, Zoller) repeater schemes. We use the algorithm to study three different experimental quantum repeater implementations on their ability to distribute entanglement, which we dub information processing implementations, multiplexed elementary pair generation implementations, and combinations of the two. We perform this heuristic optimization of repeater schemes for each of these implementations for a wide range of parameters and different experimental settings. This allows us to make estimates on what are the most critical parameters to improve for entanglement generation, how many repeaters to use, and which implementations perform best in their ability to generate entanglement.

SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Space science and technology are among the most challenging and strategic fields in which quantum computing promises to have a pervasive and long-lasting impact. We provide an overview of selected published works reporting the application of quantum computing to space science and technology. Our systematic analysis identifies three major classes of problems that have been approached with quantum computing. The first category includes optimization tasks, often cast into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization and solved using quantum annealing, with scheduling problems serving as a notable example. A second class comprises learning tasks, such as image classification in Earth Observation, often tackled with gate-based hybrid quantum-classical computation, namely with Quantum Machine Learning concepts and tools. Finally, integrating quantum computing with other quantum technologies may lead to new disruptive technologies, for instance, the creation of a quantum satellite internet constellation and distributed quantum computing. We organize our exposition by providing a critical analysis of the main challenges and methods at the core of different quantum computing paradigms and algorithms, which are often fundamentally similar across different domains of application in the space sector and beyond.

EVOVAQ seamlessly integrates evolutionary computation with quantum libraries such as Qiskit, making it easy to use for both quantum computing and EAs communities. Furthermore, EVOVAQ's scalability enables the development of customized solutions, promoting innovation in the quantum computing field.

TI High-fidelity three-qubit iToffoli gate for fixed-frequency
   superconducting qubits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The development of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices has extended the scope of executable quantum circuits with high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. Equipping these devices with three-qubit gates will enable the realization of more complex quantum algorithms and efficient quantum error correction protocols with reduced circuit depth. Several three-qubit gates have been implemented for superconducting qubits, but their use in gate synthesis has been limited owing to their low fidelity. Here, using fixed-frequency superconducting qubits, we demonstrate a high-fidelity iToffoli gate based on two-qubit interactions, the so-called cross-resonance effect. As with the Toffoli gate, this three-qubit gate can be used to perform universal quantum computation. The iToffoli gate is implemented by simultaneously applying microwave pulses to a linear chain of three qubits, revealing a process fidelity as high as 98.26(2)%. Moreover, we numerically show that our gate scheme can produce additional three-qubit gates that provide more efficient gate synthesis than the Toffoli and iToffoli gates. Our work not only brings a high-fidelity iToffoli gate to current superconducting quantum processors but also opens a pathway for developing multi-qubit gates based on two-qubit interactions.
   The efficiency of running quantum algorithms can be improved by expanding the hardware operations that a quantum computer can perform. A high-fidelity three-qubit iToffoli gate has now been demonstrated using superconducting qubits.

For strongly long-range interacting systems such as a fully-connected quantum computer, such a speed limit is still unknown. Here we develop a new quantum brachistochrone method that can incorporate inequality constraints on the Hamiltonian. This method allows us to prove an exactly tight bound on the speed of QST on a subclass of Hamiltonians experimentally realizable by a fully-connected quantum computer.

TI Universal quantum computation via quantum controlled classical
   operations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A universal set of gates for (classical or quantum) computation is a set of gates that can be used to approximate any other operation. It is well known that a universal set for classical computation augmented with the Hadamard gate results in universal quantum computing. Motivated by the latter, we pose the following question: can one perform universal quantum computation by supplementing a set of classical gates with a quantum control, and a set of quantum gates operating solely on the latter? In this work we provide an affirmative answer to this question by considering a computational model that consists of 2n target bits together with a set of classical gates controlled by log (2n + 1) ancillary qubits. We show that this model is equivalent to a quantum computer operating on n qubits. Furthermore, we show that even a primitive computer that is capable of implementing only SWAP gates, can be lifted to universal quantum computing, if aided with an appropriate quantum control of logarithmic size. Our results thus exemplify the information processing power brought forth by the quantum control system.

TI Fault-Tolerant Qubit from a Constant Number of Components
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB With gate error rates in multiple technologies now below the threshold required for fault-tolerant quantum computation, the major remaining obstacle to useful quantum computation is scaling, a challenge greatly amplified by the huge overhead imposed by quantum error correction itself. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computing scheme that can nonetheless be assembled from a small number of experimental components, potentially dramatically reducing the engineering challenges associated with building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our scheme has a threshold of 0.39% for depolarizing noise, assuming that memory errors are negligible. In the presence of memory errors, the logical error rate decays exponentially with root T/tau, where T is the memory coherence time and tau is the timescale for elementary gates. Our approach is based on a novel procedure for fault-tolerantly preparing three-dimensional cluster states using a single actively controlled qubit and a pair of delay lines. Although a circuit-level error may propagate to a high-weight error, the effect of this error on the prepared state is always equivalent to that of a constant-weight error. We describe how the requisite gates can be implemented using existing technologies in quantum photonic and phononic systems. With continued improvements in only a few components, we expect these systems to be promising candidates for demonstrating fault-tolerant quantum computation with a comparatively modest experimental effort.

TI Nonadiabatic Holonomic Quantum Computation Based on Rydberg Ground State
   Blockade
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum gates are crucial for quantum computation and quantum information processing. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by systematic errors and decoherence. Therefore, achieving resilient quantum gates to these factors is of great significance. We present a method to construct nonadiabatic holonomic single- and two-qubit gates in a Rydberg ground-state-blockade regime. Our approach utilizes a far-off-resonant technique for the single-qubit gate and a modified Rydberg antiblockade for the two-qubit gate. The reduction of the population of single- and two-excitation Rydberg states and the nonadiabatic holonomic process during the construction of the gates ensure robustness to decoherence and systematic errors, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate the fidelity and robustness of our scheme. The proposed scheme holds promise for future applications in quantum computation and quantum information processing tasks.

TI An optimizing method for performance and resource utilization in quantum
   machine learning circuits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing is a new and advanced topic that refers to calculations based on the principles of quantum mechanics. It makes certain kinds of problems be solved easier compared to classical computers. This advantage of quantum computing can be used to implement many existing problems in different fields incredibly effectively. One important field that quantum computing has shown great results in machine learning. Until now, many different quantum algorithms have been presented to perform different machine learning approaches. In some special cases, the execution time of these quantum algorithms will be reduced exponentially compared to the classical ones. But at the same time, with increasing data volume and computation time, taking care of systems to prevent unwanted interactions with the environment can be a daunting task and since these algorithms work on machine learning problems, which usually includes big data, their implementation is very costly in terms of quantum resources. Here, in this paper, we have proposed an approach to reduce the cost of quantum circuits and to optimize quantum machine learning circuits in particular. To reduce the number of resources used, in this paper an approach including different optimization algorithms is considered. Our approach is used to optimize quantum machine learning algorithms for big data. In this case, the optimized circuits run quantum machine learning algorithms in less time than the original ones and by preserving the original functionality. Our approach improves the number of quantum gates by 10.7% and 14.9% in different circuits respectively. This is the amount of reduction for one iteration of a given sub-circuit U in the main circuit. For cases where this sub-circuit is repeated more times in the main circuit, the optimization rate is increased. Therefore, by applying the proposed method to circuits with big data, both cost and performance are improved.

TI Quantum Advantage Seeker with Kernels (QuASK): a software framework to
   speed up the research in quantum machine learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Exploiting the properties of quantum information to the benefit of machine learning models is perhaps the most active field of research in quantum computation. This interest has supported the development of a multitude of software frameworks (e.g. Qiskit, Pennylane, Braket) to implement, simulate, and execute quantum algorithms. Most of them allow us to define quantum circuits, run basic quantum algorithms, and access low-level primitives depending on the hardware such software is supposed to run. For most experiments, these frameworks have to be manually integrated within a larger machine learning software pipeline. The researcher is in charge of knowing different software packages, integrating them through the development of long code scripts, analyzing the results, and generating the plots. Long code often leads to erroneous applications, due to the average number of bugs growing proportional with respect to the program length. Moreover, other researchers will struggle to understand and reproduce the experiment, due to the need to be familiar with all the different software frameworks involved in the code script. We propose QuASK, an open-source quantum machine learning framework written in Python that aids the researcher in performing their experiments, with particular attention to quantum kernel techniques. QuASK can be used as a command-line tool to download datasets, pre-process them, quantum machine learning routines, analyze and visualize the results. QuASK implements most state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze the data through quantum kernels, with the possibility to use projected kernels, (gradient-descent) trainable quantum kernels, and structure-optimized quantum kernels. Our framework can also be used as a library and integrated into pre-existing software, maximizing code reuse.

TI A many-body quantum register for a spin qubit
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum networks require quantum nodes with coherent optical interfaces and several stationary qubits. In terms of optical properties, semiconductor quantum dots are highly compelling, but their adoption as quantum nodes has been impaired by the lack of auxiliary qubits. Here we demonstrate that the dense, always-present, nuclear spin ensemble surrounding a gallium arsenide quantum dot can be used as a functional quantum register. We prepared 13,000 host nuclear spins in a single many-body dark state that acts as a logical state of the register. A second logical state is defined as a single nuclear-magnon excitation, enabling controlled quantum-state transfer between an electron spin qubit in the quantum dot and the nuclear magnonic register. Using SWAP gates, we implemented a full write-store-retrieve-read-out protocol with 68.6(4)% raw overall fidelity and a storage time of 130(16) mu s, which could be extended to 20 ms or beyond using dynamical decoupling techniques. Our work establishes how many-body physics can add functionality to quantum devices, in this case transforming quantum dots into multi-qubit quantum nodes with deterministic registers.

TI Distributing Multipartite Entanglement over Noisy Quantum Networks
SO QUANTUM
AB A quantum internet aims at harnessing networked quantum technologies, namely by distributing bipartite entanglement be-tween distant nodes. However, multipar-tite entanglement between the nodes may empower the quantum internet for addi-tional or better applications for commu-nications, sensing, and computation. In this work, we present an algorithm for generating multipartite entanglement be-tween different nodes of a quantum net-work with noisy quantum repeaters and imperfect quantum memories, where the links are entangled pairs. Our algorithm is optimal for GHZ states with 3 qubits, maximising simultaneously the final state fidelity and the rate of entanglement dis-tribution. Furthermore, we determine the conditions yielding this simultaneous opti-mality for GHZ states with a higher num-ber of qubits, and for other types of mul-tipartite entanglement. Our algorithm is general also in the sense that it can op-timize simultaneously arbitrary parame-ters. This work opens the way to opti-mally generate multipartite quantum cor-relations over noisy quantum networks, an important resource for distributed quan-tum technologies.

TI Epsilon-Nets, Unitary Designs, and Random Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Epsilon-nets and approximate unitary t-designs are natural notions that capture properties of unitary operations relevant for numerous applications in quantum information and quantum computing. In this work we study quantitative connections between these two notions. Specifically, we prove that, for d dimensional Hilbert space, unitaries constituting delta-approximate t-expanders form epsilon-nets for t similar or equal to d(5/2)/epsilon and delta similar or equal to (epsilon(3/2)/d)(d2). We also show that for arbitrary t, epsilon-nets can be used to construct delta-approximate unitary t-designs for delta similar or equal to epsilon t, where the notion of approximation is based on the diamond norm. Finally, we prove that the degree of an exact unitary t design necessary to obtain an epsilon-net must grow at least as fast as 1/epsilon (for fixed dimension) and not slower than d(2) (for fixed epsilon). This shows near optimality of our result connecting t-designs and epsilon-nets. We apply our findings in the context of quantum computing. First, we show that that approximate t-designs can be generated by shallow random circuits formed from a set of universal two-qudit gates in the parallel and sequential local architectures considered in (Brandao et al., 2016). Importantly, our gate sets need not to be symmetric (i.e., contains gates together with their inverses) or consist of gates with algebraic entries. Second, we consider compilation of quantum gates and prove a non-constructive Solovay-Kitaev theorem for general universal gate sets. Our main technical contribution is a new construction of efficient polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta in the space of quantum channels, which can be of independent interest.

TI Hierarchical Quantum Information Splitting of an Arbitrary Two-Qubit
   State Based on a Decision Tree
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum informatics is a new subject formed by the intersection of quantum mechanics and informatics. Quantum communication is a new way to transmit quantum states through quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and quantum information splitting. Based on the research of multiparticle state quantum information splitting, this paper innovatively combines the decision tree algorithm of machine learning with quantum communication to solve the problem of channel particle allocation in quantum communication, and experiments showed that the algorithm can make the optimal allocation scheme. Based on this scheme, we propose a two-particle state hierarchical quantum information splitting scheme based on the multi-particle state. First, Alice measures the Bell states of the particles she owns and tells the result to the receiver through the classical channel. If the receiver is a high-level communicator, he only needs the help of one of the low-level communicators and all the high-level communicators. After performing a single particle measurement on the z-basis, they send the result to the receiver through the classical channel. When the receiver is a low-level communicator, all communicators need to measure the particles they own and tell the receiver the results. Finally, the receiver performs the corresponding unitary operation according to the received results. In this regard, a complete hierarchical quantum information splitting operation is completed. On the basis of theoretical research, we also carried out experimental verification, security analysis, and comparative analysis, which shows that our scheme is reliable and has high security and efficiency.

A superconducting multiresonator system which is composed of a set of frequency-tunable coplanar waveguide resonators is implemented as the quantum memory. By dynamically tuning the resonant frequencies of the resonators, we achieve tunable memory bandwidth from 10 to 55 MHz, with well preserved phase coherence. We further demonstrate on-demand storage and retrieval of a time-bin flying qubit. This result opens up a prospect to integrate our chip-based quantum memory with the state-ofthe-art superconducting quantum circuit technology for quantum information processing.

TI On-Chip Quantum Communication Devices
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB We present here results of the Quantum Technology Flagship project UNIQORN in the area of integrated photonics for quantum communication applications. Three distinct integration platforms, namely indium phosphide based monolithic integration, polymer-based hybrid integration and the CMOS-compatible silicon platform, have been employed to manufacture components and sub-systems on chip for quantum communication devices. The choice of different platforms was made to exploit the best characteristics of each platform for the intended quantum communication device. The indium phosphide platform was employed to manufacture a transmitter chip for quantum key distribution featuring laser, modulators, and attenuators. The transmitter chip was evaluated in a QKD experiment achieving a secure rate of 1 kbit/s. The polymer platform was investigated for engineering non-classical light sources. Entangled and heralded single-photon sources, based on non-linear optics, were assembled on the polymer in a hybrid fashion together with waveguides and other passive micro-optical elements. A quantum random number generator, featuring a 70% randomness extraction efficiency, was also fabricated using the polymer integration technique. An array of 32 individual single-photon avalanche diodes, operating at room temperature and featuring an onboard coincidence logic, was coupled to the chip to demonstrate direct detection of photons on the polymer. Finally, a transimpedance amplifier based on gallium arsenide high electron mobility transistors was produced with an exceptional large electrical noise clearance of 28 dB at 100 MHz.

TI Classification of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids Using Supervised
   Quantum Machine Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML) are emerging technologies with the potential to revolutionize the way we approach complex problems in mathematics, physics, and other fields. The increasing availability of data and computing power has led to a rise in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve real-time problems. In space science, employing AI-based approaches to address various challenges, including the potential risks posed by asteroids, is becoming increasingly necessary. Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) can cause significant harm to humans and biodiversity through wind blasts, overpressure shock, thermal radiation, cratering, seismic shaking, ejecta deposition, and even tsunamis. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been employed to detect hazardous asteroids based on their parameters. Still, there are limitations to the current techniques, and the results have reached a saturation point. To address this issue, we propose a Quantum Machine Learning (QML)-based approach for asteroid hazard prediction, employing Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) and PegasosQSVC algorithms. The proposed work aims to leverage the quantum properties of the data to improve the accuracy and precision of asteroid classification. Our study focuses on the impact of PHAs, and the proposed supervised QML-based method aims to detect whether an asteroid with specific parameters is hazardous or not. We compared several classification algorithms and found that the proposed QML-based approach employing VQC and PegasosQSVC outperformed the other methods, with an accuracy of 98.11% and an average F1-score of 92.69%.

TI A comparative study of LQU and LQFI in general qubit-qutrit axially
   symmetric states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We derive the compact closed forms of local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) for hybrid qubit-qutrit axially symmetric (AS) states. This allows us to study the quantum correlations in detail and present some essentially novel results for spin-(1/2, 1) systems, the Hamiltonian of which contains ten independent types of physically important parameters. As an application of the derived formulas, we study the behavior of these two quantum correlation measures at thermal equilibrium. New features are observed in their behavior that are important for quantum information processing. Specifically, cascades of sudden changes in the behavior of LQU and LQFI are found with a smooth change in temperature or interaction parameters. Interestingly, in some cases, sudden transitions are observed in the behavior of LQU but not in LQFI, and vice versa. Moreover, our compact formulas open a way to apply them to other problems, for instance, when investigating the environmental effects on quantum correlations in open systems.

TI Error correlations in photonic qudit-mediated entanglement generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Generating entanglement between distributed network nodes is a prerequisite for the quantum internet. Entanglement distribution protocols based on high-dimensional photonic qudits enable the simultaneous generation of multiple entangled pairs, which can significantly reduce the required coherence time of the qubit registers. However, current schemes require fast optical switching, which is experimentally challenging. In addition, the higher degree of error correlation between the generated entangled pairs in qudit protocols compared to qubit protocols has not been widely studied in detail. We propose a qudit-mediated entangling protocol that completely circumvents the need for optical switches at the expense of a lower success probability of the scheme. Furthermore, we quantify the amount of error correlation between the simultaneously generated entangled pairs and analyze the effect on entanglement purification algorithms and teleportation-based quantum error correction. We find that optimized purification schemes can efficiently correct the correlated errors, while the quantum error correction codes studied here perform worse than for uncorrelated error models.

TI Enhancing Quantum Information Distribution Through Noisy Channels Using
   Quantum Communication Architectures
SO INFORMATION
AB Quantum information transmission is subject to imperfections in communication processes and systems. These phenomena alter the original content due to decoherence and noise. However, suitable communication architectures incorporating quantum and classical redundancy can selectively remove these errors, boosting destructive interference. In this work, a selection of architectures based on path superposition or indefinite causal order were analyzed under appropriate configurations, alongside traditional methods such as classical redundancy, thus enhancing transmission. For that purpose, we examined a broad family of decoherent channels associated with the qubit chain transmission by passing through tailored arrangements or composite architectures of imperfect channels. The outcomes demonstrated that, when combined with traditional redundancy, these configurations could significantly improve the transmission across a substantial subset of the channels. For quantum key distribution purposes, two alternative bases were considered to encode the information chain. Because a control system must be introduced in the proposed architectures, two strategies for its disposal at the end of the communication process were compared: tracing and measurement. In addition, eavesdropping was also explored under a representative scenario, to quantify its impact on the most promising architecture analyzed. Thus, in terms of transmission quality and security, the analysis revealed significant advantages over direct transmission schemes.

TI Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error
   correction without a quantum-limited amplifier
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-fidelity and rapid readout of a qubit state is key to quantum computing and communication, and it is a prerequisite for quantum error correction. We present a readout scheme for superconducting qubits that combines two microwave techniques: applying a shelving technique to the qubit that reduces the contribution of decay error during readout, and a two-tone excitation of the readout resonator to distinguish among qubit populations in higher energy levels. Using a machine-learning algorithm to post-process the two-tone measurement results further improves the qubit-state assignment fidelity. We perform single-shot frequency-multiplexed qubit readout, with a 140 ns readout time, and demonstrate 99.5% assignment fidelity for two-state readout and 96.9% for three-state readout-without using a quantum-limited amplifier.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Fidelity Estimation

In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that solves this problem in ${\mathrm{ poly}}(\log (N), r, 1/\varepsilon) time, where r is the lower rank of rho and sigma , and $\varepsilon $ is the desired precision, provided that the purifications of rho and sigma are prepared by quantum oracles. This algorithm exhibits an exponential speedup over the best known algorithm (based on quantum state tomography) which has time complexity polynomial in N.

TI Addressable Quantum Gates
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We extend the circuit model of quantum computation so that the wiring between gates is soft-coded within registers inside the gates. The addresses in these registers can be manipulated and put into superpositions. This aims at capturing indefinite causal orders and making their geometrical layout explicit: we express the quantum switch and the polarizing beam-splitter within the model. In this context, our main contribution is a full characterization of the anonymity constraints. Indeed, the names used as addresses should not matter beyond the wiring they describe; i.e., quantum evolutions should commute with "renamings." We show that these quantum evolutions can still act non-trivially upon the names. We specify the structure of "nameblind" matrices.

TI Deterministic entangling gates with nonlinear quantum photonic
   interferometers
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The single-photon quantum computing paradigm currently relies on the multi-port interference in linear optical devices, which is intrinsically based on probabilistic measurements outcome, and thus non-deterministic. Devising a fully deterministic, universal, and practically achievable quantum computing platform based on single-photon encoding and integrated photonic circuits is still an open challenge. Here we propose to exploit the interplay of distributed self-Kerr nonlinearity and localized hopping in quantum photonic interferometers to implement deterministic entangling quantum gates with dual rail photonic qubits. It is shown that a universal set of single- and two-qubit gates can be designed by a suitable concatenation of few optical interferometric elements, reaching optimal fidelities arbitrarily close to 100% that are theoretically demonstrated through a bound constrained optimization algorithm. The actual realization would require the concatenation of a few tens of elementary operations, as well as on-chip optical nonlinearities that are compatible with some of the existing quantum photonic platforms, as it is finally discussed.
   Realizing deterministic two-qubit quantum gates in Photonics is currently an open challenge, and no experimental demonstrations exist to date. Here, the authors propose deterministic entangling quantum gates with dual rail single-photon qubits in a photonic interferometer displaying distributed Kerr-type nonlinearities over the whole circuit length.

We have shown that three sets of three-qubit GHZ states can be used to realize the splitting of an arbitrary three-qubit state securely. We propose a scheme by a new quantum circuit and simulate them on the IBM quantum experience platform and conclude that an arbitrary three-qubit state can be split up experimentally by using three GHZ states. In a way, the presented protocol is deterministic and secure against eavesdropping attacks.

TI Breaking universal limitations on quantum conference key agreement
   without quantum memory
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum conference key agreement is an important cryptographic primitive for future quantum network. Realizing this primitive requires high-brightness and robust multiphoton entanglement sources, which is challenging in experiment and unpractical in application because of limited transmission distance caused by channel loss. Here we report a measurement-device-independent quantum conference key agreement protocol with enhanced transmission efficiency over lossy channel. With spatial multiplexing nature and adaptive operation, our protocol can break key rate bounds on quantum communication over quantum network without quantum memory. Compared with previous work, our protocol shows superiority in key rate and transmission distance within the state-of-the-art technology. Furthermore, we analyse the security of our protocol in the composable framework and evaluate its performance in the finite-size regime to show practicality. Based on our results, we anticipate that our protocol will play an important role in constructing multipartite quantum network.

TI Reliable Quantum Communications Based on Asymmetry in Distillation and
   Coding
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The reliable provision of entangled qubits is an essential precondition in a variety of schemes for distributed quantum computing. This is challenged by multiple nuisances, such as errors during the transmission over quantum links, but also due to degradation of the entanglement over time due to decoherence. The latter can be seen as a constraint on the latency of the quantum protocol, which brings the problem of quantum protocol design into the context of latency-reliability constraints. We address the problem through hybrid schemes that combine: indirect transmission based on teleportation and distillation, and direct transmission, based on quantum error correction (QEC). The intuition is that, at present, the quantum hardware offers low fidelity, which demands distillation; on the other hand, low latency can be obtained by QEC techniques. It is shown that, in the proposed framework, the distillation protocol gives rise to asymmetries that can be exploited by asymmetric quantum error correcting code, which sets the basis for unique hybrid distillation and coding design. Our results show that ad hoc asymmetric codes give, compared with conventional QEC, a performance boost and codeword size reduction both in a single-link and in a quantum network scenario.

Using the concepts of fidelity threshold and average fidelity in classical and quantum, we reveal the effectiveness of the current channel to remain in the quantum limits. In addition, we investigate the quantum estimation of the encoded phase in single and two-qubit scenarios at the teleportation destination. By using different variables of the system, the average fidelity of the quantum teleportation and the quantum estimation of the encoded phase in one and two teleported qubit(s) can be improved.

TI Quantum Secure Image Transmission: A Chaos-Assisted Quantum Key
   Distribution Approach Using Entanglement
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The emergence of quantum computing has introduced unprecedented security challenges to conventional cryptographic systems, particularly in the domain of classical communications. Our research addresses these challenges by creatively combining quantum key distribution (QKD), specifically the E91 protocol, with logistic chaotic maps to establish a secure image transmission scheme. Our approach utilises the pseudo-randomness of chaotic systems alongside the security mechanisms inherent in quantum entanglement-based protocols. This framework leverages the E91 protocol for secure quantum key distribution to generate identical key pairs at both ends, followed by chaos encryption using the key as a basis for the parameters. This framework utilises the E91 protocol for secure quantum key distribution, leveraging maximally entangled pairs and CHSH inequality tests to detect eavesdropping and potential double-agent attacks by identifying nonentangled qubits, therefore maintaining key confidentiality. Furthermore, through quantitative simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme through key space and key sensitivity analysis, histogram analysis, information entropy analysis, execution time analysis, and differential attack analysis in end-to-end encryption. The results indicate a significant improvement in encryption and decryption efficiency, showcasing the scheme's potential as a viable solution against the vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing advancements. Our research offers a novel perspective on a critical aspect of cybersecurity applications across healthcare, defence, finance, and beyond in the realm of secure quantum communication.

TI Relating EPR steering with the fidelity of quantum teleportation for
   two- and three-qubit states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an important quantum resource in quantum information and computation. The relationships between EPR steering and the fidelity of quantum teleportation for two- and three-qubit states are investigated in this paper. For two-qubit states, the upper bound of the average teleportation fidelity based on the EPR steering is derived. When the receiver can only perform the identity or the Pauli rotation operations, the two-qubit X-type states which violate the three-setting measurements steering inequality could be used for teleportation. In the end, the steering observables and the average teleportation fidelities of two-qubit reduced states for three-qubit pure states maintain the same ordering. The complementary relations between the steering observables and the average teleportation fidelities for three-qubit pure states are also established.

TI Entanglement distribution based on quantum walk in arbitrary quantum
   networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In large-scale quantum networks, quantum repeaters provide an efficient method to distribute entangled states among selected nodes for realizing long-distance and complicated quantum communications. However, extending quantum repeater protocols to high-dimensional quantum states in existing experiments faces great challenges. Owing to the feasible physical implementations of quantum walks, we proposed various basic modules applicable to quantum repeaters for distributing high-dimensional entangled states via quantum walks, including d-dimensional Bell states and multi-particle d-dimensional GHZ states. Furthermore, based on the above schemes, we provided a high-dimensional entanglement distribution scheme for arbitrary quantum tree networks. By searching for a Steiner tree in a quantum network, we can achieve high-dimensional entanglement distributions over an arbitrary quantum network. We constructed a quantum fractal network based on d-dimensional GHZ states and analyzed the quantum transport properties of continuous quantum walks in the network. Compared with the continuous quantum walk on the Sierpinski gasket, the quantum walk on the new fractal network spreads more widely within the same time frame. Finally, we conducted five experiments to implement various basic modules of 2-party or 3-party entanglement distribution schemes in a superconducting quantum processor. Our study can serve as a building block for constructing large and complex quantum networks.

TI Robustness of Bell violation of graph states to qubit loss
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Graph states are special entangled states advantageous for many quantum technologies, including quantum error correction, multiparty quantum communication, and measurement-based quantum computation. Yet, their fidelity is often disrupted by various errors, most notably qubit loss. In general, given an entangled state, Bell inequalities can be used to certify whether quantum entanglement remains despite errors. Here, we study the robustness of graph states to loss in terms of their Bell violation. Considering the recently proposed linearly scalable Bell operators by Baccari et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 020402 (2020)], we use the stabilizer formalism to derive a formula for the extent by which the Bell violation of a given graph state is decreased with qubit loss. Our analysis allows one to determine which graph topologies are tolerable to qubit loss as well as pinpointing the Achilles' heel of each graph, namely the sets of qubits whose loss jeopardizes the Bell violation. Our results serve as an analytical tool for optimizing experiments and protocols involving graph states in realistically lossy systems. An experimental demonstration of a Bell violation in our noise-tolerant graphs is within reach using state of the art technology.

TI Quantum teleportation in Heisenberg chain with magnetic-field gradient
   under intrinsic decoherence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB One of the most appealing quantum communication protocols is quantum teleportation, which involves sharing entanglement between the sender and receiver of the quantum state. We address the two-qubit quantum teleportation based on the Heisenberg XYZ chain with a magnetic-field gradient affected by intrinsic decoherence. An atomic spin chain is primarily coupled to the linear gradient of the magnetic field in the x-direction, with the assumption that the magnetic field varies linearly with the position of the atom. By using the concepts of fidelity and average fidelity in the presence of the magnetic field gradient and under the effect of intrinsic decoherence in the current model, and considering the variables of the system, an improved quantum teleportation can be achieved. In addition, using the concept of remote quantum estimation, we examine remote quantum sensing in this article, which is very useful in quantum communication.

TI SWAP Gate between a Majorana Qubit and a Parity-Protected
   Superconducting Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB High fidelity quantum information processing requires a combination of fast gates and long-lived quantum memories. In this Letter, we propose a hybrid architecture, where a parity-protected super-conducting qubit is directly coupled to a Majorana qubit, which plays the role of a quantum memory. The superconducting qubit is based upon a N-periodic Josephson junction realized with gate-tunable semi-conducting wires, where the tunneling of individual Cooper pairs is suppressed. One of the wires additionally contains four Majorana zero modes that define a qubit. We demonstrate that this enables the implementation of a SWAP gate, allowing for the transduction of quantum information between the topological and conventional qubit. This architecture combines fast gates, which can be realized with the superconducting qubit, with a topologically protected Majorana memory.

AB Realizing a large-scale quantum computer requires hardware platforms that can simultaneously achieve universality, scalability, and fault tolerance. As a viable pathway to meeting these requirements, quantum computation (QC) based on continuous-variable optical systems has recently gained more attention due to its unique advantages and approaches. This review introduces several topics of recent experimental and theoretical progress in the optical continuous-variable QC that we believe are promising. In particular, we focus on scaling-up technologies enabled by time multiplexing, bandwidth broadening, and integrated optics, as well as hardware-efficient and robust bosonic quantum error-correction schemes.

TI Quantum machine learning: A comprehensive review of integrating AI with
   quantum computing for computational advancements
SO METHODSX
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is the emerging confluence of quantum computing and artificial intelligence that promises to solve computational problems inaccessible to classical systems. Using quantum principles such as superposition, entanglement, and interference, QML promises exponential speed-ups and new paradigms for data processing in machine learning tasks. This review gives an overview of QML, from advancements in quantum-enhanced classical ML to native quantum algorithms and hybrid quantum-classical frameworks. It varies from applications in optimization, drug discovery, and quantum-secured communications, showcasing how QML can change healthcare, finance, and logistics industries. Even though this approach holds so much promise, significant challenges remain to be addressed-noisy qubits, error correction, and limitations in data encoding-that must be overcome by interdisciplinary research soon. The paper tries to collate the state of the art of QML in theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and directions into the future.

TI Distribution of fidelity in quantum state transfer protocols
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Quantum state transfer protocols are a major toolkit in many quantum information processing tasks, from quantum key distribution to quantum computation. To assess the performance of such a protocol, one often relies on the average fidelity between the input and the output states. Going beyond this scheme, we analyze the entire probability distribution of fidelity, providing a general framework to derive it for the transfer of single- and two-qubit states. Starting from the delta-like shape of the fidelity distribution, characteristic of perfect transfer, we analyze its broadening and deformation due to realistic features of the process, including non-perfect read-out timing. Different models of quantum transfer, sharing the same value of the average fidelity, display different distributions of fidelity, providing thus additional information on the protocol, including the minimum fidelity.

Finally we comment on topological quantum error correcting codes and supersymmetric quantum field theory within this framework.

TI Entanglement between a Telecom Photon and an On-Demand Multimode
   Solid-State Quantum Memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement between photons at telecommunication wavelengths and long-lived quantum memories is one of the fundamental requirements of long-distance quantum communication. Quantum memories featuring on-demand readout and multimode operation are additional precious assets that will benefit the communication rate. In this Letter, we report the first demonstration of entanglement between a telecom photon and a collective spin excitation in a multimode solid-state quantum memory. Photon pairs are generated through widely nondegenerate parametric down-conversion, featuring energy-time entanglement between the telecom-wavelength idler and a visible signal photon. The latter is stored in a Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal as a spin wave using the full atomic frequency comb scheme. We then recall the stored signal photon and analyze the entanglement using the Franson scheme. We measure conditional fidelities of 92(2)% for excited-state storage, enough to violate a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, and 77(2)% for spin-wave storage. Taking advantage of the on-demand readout from the spin state, we extend the entanglement storage in the quantum memory for up to 47.7 mu s, which could allow for the distribution of entanglement between quantum nodes separated by distances of up to 10 km.

TI Advances in quantum error correction based on superconducting quantum
   systems*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Information processing technology based on the basic principle of quantum mechanics shows great potential applications in computing, sensing and other fields, and is far superior to classical technology. With the advance of experimental technology, quantum control technology develops rapidly. Compared with other quantum information processing platforms, the superconducting system based on solid materials has the advantages of accurate quantum controllability, excellent quantum coherence and the potential for large-scale integration. Therefore, superconducting quantum system is one of the most promising platforms for quantum information processing. The existing superconducting circuits, which can integrate about one hundred qubits, have already demonstrated the advantages of quantum systems, but further development is limited by system noise. In order to break through this bottleneck, quantum error correction technology, which is developed from the classical error correction technology, has attracted extensive attention. Here, we mainly summarize the research progress of quantum error correction in superconducting quantum systems including the basic principles of superconducting quantum systems, the quantum error correction codes, the related control techniques and the recent applications. At the end of the article, we summarize seven key problems in this field.

TI Quantum error correction in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum regime
   for sequential quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We use density-matrix simulations to study the performance of three distance three quantum error correction (QEC) codes in the context of the rare-earth (RE) ion-doped crystal platform for quantum computing. We analyze pseudothresholds for these codes when parallel operations are not available, and examine the behavior both with and without resting errors. In RE systems, resting errors can be mitigated by extending the system???s ground-state coherence time. For the codes we study, we find that if the ground-state coherence time is roughly 100 times larger than the excited-state coherence time, resting errors become small enough to be negligible compared to other error sources. This leads us to the conclusion that beneficial QEC could be achieved in the RE system with the expected gate fidelities available in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum regime. However, for codes using more qubits and operations, a factor of more than 100 would be required. Furthermore, we investigate how often QEC should be performed in a circuit. We find that for early experiments in RE systems, the minimal Q5, 1, 31 would be most suitable as it has a high threshold error and uses few qubits. However, when more qubits are available the Q9, 1, 31 surface code might be a better option due to its higher circuit performance. Our findings are important for steering experiments to an efficient path for realizing beneficial quantum error correcting codes in early RE systems where resources are limited.

TI Qutrit and qubit circuits for three-flavor collective neutrino

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four, and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.

On-chip quantum memories can possess the essential functionalities inbuilding a quantum network, including synchronizing a large number of quantum computers and implementinglong-distance quantum communication. However, owning mainly to the constraints imposed by the micro-photonic structures themselves, on-chip quantum memories cannot satisfy the requirement for constructing thefull quantum network for the incompatibility of their memory property and integration property. We herepropose to build an on-chip quantum memory by using spatial-phase-mismatching effect in photonic crystalcavities. In this scenario, not only is the large orbital angular momentum of photonic crystal cavities utilized torealize photon-echo type memory, but also the light-matter enhancement of a photonic cavity is used to achievea high-efficiency quantum storage

TI Experimental realization of nonadiabatic holonomic single -qubit quantum
   gates with two dark paths in a trapped ion
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB For circuit-based quantum computation, experimental implementation of a universal set of quantum logic gates with high-fidelity and strong robustness is essential and central. Quantum gates induced by geometric phases, which depend only on global properties of the evolution paths, have built-in noise-resilience features. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate nonadiabatic holonomic single-qubit quantum gates on two dark paths in a trapped 171????????????????????????????????????+ ion based on four-level systems with resonant drives. We confirm the implementation with measured gate fidelity through both quantum process tomography and randomized benchmarking methods. Meanwhile, we find that nontrivial holonomic two-qubit quantum gates can also be realized within current experimental technologies. Compared with previous implementations, our experiments share both the advantages of fast nonadiabatic evolution and robustness against systematic errors. Therefore, our experiments confirm a promising method for fast and robust holonomic quantum computation.

TI Quantum Teleportation, Entanglement, and Bell Nonlocality in Unruh
   Channel
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION A-SCIENCE
AB Decoherence is an unavoidable phenomenon that results from the interaction of the system with its surroundings. The study of decoherence due to the relativistic effects has the fundamental importance. The Unruh effect is observed by the relativistically accelerator observer. The unruh effect can be considered as a quantum channel called Unruh channel. The Unruh channel can be characterized by its Kraus representation. We consider the bipartite scheme in which the quantum information is shared between an inertial observer (Alice) and an accelerated observer (Rob) in the case of Dirac field. We will show that this channel reduces the common quantum information between the two observers. In this work we will study the effects of the Unruh channel on various facets of quantum correlations, such as the quantum teleportation, entanglement, and Bell inequality violations for a Dirac field mode.

TI The Qubit Fidelity Under Different Error Mechanisms Based on Error
   Correction Threshold
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum error correction is a crucial step to realize large-scale universal quantum computing, and the condition for realizing quantum error correction is that the error probability of each operation step must below some threshold. This requires that the qubits' quality and the quantum gates precision can reach a certain level experimentally. We firstly discuss the mechanism of quantum errors: the precision of quantum gates corresponds to unitary operator errors, and the quality of qubits is attributed to decoherence. Then, according to the threshold of the surface code error correction, we proved the minimum of quantum gate fidelity should not be less than 1 - p with the error probability p, and found the natural decoherence time of qubits that can be used for error correction. This provides some kind of theoretical supports for qubits preparation and performing quantum operations experimentally.

TI Quantum gates with oscillating exchange interaction
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Two-qubit gates between spin qubits are often performed using a rectangular or an adiabatic exchange interaction pulse resulting in a CZ gate. An oscillating exchange pulse not only performs a CZ gate, but also enables the iSWAP gate, which offers more flexibility to perform quantum algorithms. We provide a detailed description for two-qubit gates using resonant and off-resonant exchange pulses, give conditions for performing the respective gates, and compare their performance to the state-of-the-art static counterpart. We find that for relatively low charge noise the gates still perform reliably and compare to the conventional CZ gate.

Toward such a network with large capacity, an integrated multimode photonic quantum memory at telecom band has yet been demonstrated. Here, we report a fiber-integrated multimode quantum storage of single photon at telecom band on a laser-written chip. The storage device is a fiber-pigtailed Er3+:LiNbO3 waveguide and allows a storage of up to 330 temporal modes of heralded single photon with 4-GHz-wide bandwidth at 1532 nm and a 167-fold increasing of coincidence detection rate with respect to single mode. Our memory system with all-fiber addressing is performed using telecom-band fiber-integrated and on-chip components. The results represent an important step for the future quantum networks using integrated photonics devices.

TI Long-Distance Entanglement Purification for Quantum Communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB High-quality long-distance entanglement is essential for both quantum communication and scalable quantum networks. Entanglement purification is to distill high-quality entanglement from low-quality entanglement in a noisy environment and it plays a key role in quantum repeaters. The previous significant entanglement purification experiments require two pairs of low-quality entangled states and were demonstrated in tabletop. Here we propose and report a high-efficiency and long-distance entanglement purification using only one pair of hyperentangled state. We also demonstrate its practical application in entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD). One pair of polarization spatial-mode hyperentanglement was distributed over 11 km multicore fiber (noisy channel). After purification, the fidelity of polarization entanglement arises from 0.771 to 0.887 and the effective key rate in entanglement-based QKD increases from 0 to 0.332. The values of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality of polarization entanglement arises from 1.829 to 2.128. Moreover, by using one pair of hyperentanglement and deterministic controlled-NOT gates, the total purification efficiency can be estimated as 6.6 x 10(3) times than the experiment using two pairs of entangled states with spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources. Our results offer the potential to be implemented as part of a full quantum repeater and large-scale quantum network.

TI Simplified entanglement swapping protocol for the quantum Internet
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this study, a simplified version of the entanglement-swapping protocol, commonly used in the deployment of quantum networks, is presented. Quantum repeaters are essential in extending the range of quantum networks, especially when they are implemented through the laying of optical fiber. The simplified version of the entanglement-swapping protocol does not require the use of unitary transforms to finish characterizing the shared Bell state at both ends to be connected, as happens in the traditional version of the protocol, facilitating and reducing costs in quantum repeater implementations. Both a theoretical demonstration and an experimental one on an optical table, based on two revealing experiments, show the excellent performance of the presented protocol.

TI Disentangling quantum autoencoder
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Entangled quantum states are highly sensitive to noise, which makes it difficult to transfer them over noisy quantum channels or to store them in quantum memory. Here, we propose the disentangling quantum autoencoder (DQAE) to encode entangled states into single-qubit product states. The DQAE provides an exponential improvement in the number of copies needed to transport entangled states across qubit-loss or leakage channels compared to unencoded states. The DQAE can be trained in an unsupervised manner from entangled quantum data. For general states, we train via variational quantum algorithms based on gradient descent with purity-based cost functions, while stabilizer states can be trained via a Metropolis algorithm. For particular classes of states, the number of training data needed to generalize is surprisingly low: for stabilizer states, DQAE generalizes by learning from a number of training data that scales linearly with the number of qubits, while only 1 training sample is sufficient for states evolved with the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Our work provides practical applications for enhancing near-term quantum computers.

TI Quantum computation with charge-and-color-permuting twists in qudit
   color codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Twists are defects in the lattice which can be utilized to perform computations on encoded data. Twists have been studied in various classes of topological codes like qubit and qudit surface codes, qubit color codes, and qubit subsystem color codes. They are known to exhibit projective non-Abelian statistics, which is exploited to perform encoded gates. In this paper, we initiate the study of twists in qudit color codes over the odd prime alphabet. Specifically, we present a systematic construction of twists in qudit color codes that permute both charge and color of the excitations. We also present a mapping between generalized Pauli operators and strings in the lattice. Making use of the construction, we give protocols to implement generalized Clifford gates using charge-and-color-permuting twists.

TI A Computation-Strengthened High-Dimensional Three-Qudit Toffoli Gate
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A high-dimensional quantum gate not only enables the processing of more information through parallel quantum channels but also enhances fault tolerance in a higher Hilbert space. In this paper, a protocol is presented for implementing a three-qudit 4x4x4$4\times 4\times 4$-Dimensional (D) Toffoli gate for a hybrid system, where the first control qudit, the second control qudit, and the target qudit of four dimension are encoded in the spatial-polarization state of a flying photon, the electron-spin state of the first two quantum dots (QDs), and the one of the remaining two QDs, respectively. Besides, the high-dimensional Toffoli gate does not require any assistance. Moreover, the gate operates deterministically in principle, as the photon is easy to manipulate feasibly using simple optical elements, and four QDs have a long electron-spin coherent time used for storage and manipulation. Furthermore, the success probability and fidelity of the high-dimensional Toffoli gate, in alignment with current technological capabilities, demonstrate satisfactory results. This indicates that it is feasible in experimental settings and promises a quantum computing paradigm that excels in speed, error resilience, and scalability for intricate quantum operations.

TI Quantum Communication Using Semiconductor Quantum Dots
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Worldwide, enormous efforts are directed toward the development of the so-called quantum internet. Turning this long-sought-after dream into reality is a great challenge that will require breakthroughs in quantum communication and computing. To establish a global, quantum-secured communication infrastructure, photonic quantum technologies will doubtlessly play a major role, by providing and interfacing essential quantum resources, for example, flying- and stationary qubits or quantum memories. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in the engineering of on-demand quantum light sources based on semiconductor quantum dots, which enable the generation of close-to-ideal single- and entangled-photon states, useful for applications in quantum information processing. This review focuses on implementations of, and building blocks for, quantum communication using quantum-light sources based on epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots. After reviewing the main notions of quantum communication and introducing the devices used for single-photon and entangled-photon generation, an overview of experimental implementations of quantum key distribution protocols using quantum dot based quantum light sources is provided. Furthermore, recent progress toward quantum-secured communication networks as well as building blocks thereof is summarized. The article closes with an outlook, discussing future perspectives in the field and identifying the main challenges to be solved.

TI Loss-tolerant all-photonic quantum repeater with generalized Shor code
SO OPTICA
AB The all-photonic quantum repeater (APQR) is a promising repeater scheme to realize long-distance quantum communication. For a practical APQR, an indispensable requirement is the robustness of the repeater graph state (RGS) against photon loss. We propose a new loss-tolerant scheme by applying the generalized Shor code to RGS, which can be experimentally demonstrated with current technology. Experimentally, we first prepare and verify the nine-qubit Shor code. Then, by applying the generalized Shor code to APQR and preparing a simplified encoded RGS with the structure of 1 x 2 based on the Shor code state, the effectiveness of our loss-tolerant scheme and the loss tolerance of the encoded RGS are respectively verified. Our results make an essential step toward a practical APQR and enrich the research of quantum error correction code.

TI Evaluation of Parameterized Quantum Circuits With Cross-Resonance
   Pulse-Driven Entanglers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a powerful class of algorithms that is highly suitable for noisy quantum devices. Therefore, investigating their design has become key in quantum computing research. Previous works have shown that choosing an effective parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) or ansatz for a VQA is crucial to its overall performance, especially on near-term devices. In this article, we utilize pulse-level access to quantum machines, our understanding of their two-qubit interactions, and, more importantly, our knowledge of VQAs, to customize the design of two-qubit entanglers. Our analysis shows that utilizing customized pulse gates for ansatze reduces state preparation times by more than half, maintains expressibility relative to standard ansatze, and produces PQCs that are more trainable through local cost function analysis. Our algorithm performance results show that in three cases, our PQC configuration outperforms the base implementation. Experiments using IBM Quantum hardware demonstrate that our pulse-based PQC configurations are more capable of solving MaxCut and chemistry problems compared to a standard configuration.

TI Demonstrating Experimentally the Encoding and Dynamics of an
   Error-Correctable Logical Qubit on a Hyperfine-Coupled Nuclear Spin
   Qudit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The realization of effective quantum error correction protocols remains a central challenge in the development of scalable quantum computers. Employing high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) can offer more hardware-efficient protocols than qubit-based approaches. Using electron-nuclear double resonance, we implement a logical qubit encoded on the four states of a I = 3=2 nuclear spin hyperfine-coupled to an S = 1=2 electron spin qubit; the encoding protects against the dominant decoherence mechanism in such systems, i.e., fluctuations of the quantizing magnetic field. We explore the dynamics of the encoded state both under a controlled application of the fluctuation and under natural decoherence processes. Our results confirm the potential of these proposals for practical, implementable, fault-tolerant quantum memories.

   missions in Canada
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present the white paper developed during the QEYSSat 2.0 study, which was undertaken between June 2021 and March 2022. The study objective was to establish a technology road-map for a Canada-wide quantum network enabled by satellites. We survey the state-of-art in quantum communication technologies, identify the main applications and architectures, review the technical readiness levels and technology bottlenecks and identify a future mission scenario. We report the findings of a dedicated one-day workshop that included Canadian stakeholders from government, industry and academia to gather inputs and insights for the applications and technical road-map. We also provide an overview of the Quantum EncrYption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission expected to launch in 2024-2025 and its anticipated outcomes. One of the main outcomes of this study is that developing the main elements for a Canada-wide quantum internet will have the highest level of impact, which includes Canada-wide entanglement distribution and teleportation. We present and analyze a possible future mission ("QEYSSat 2.0") that would enable long-range quantum teleportation across Canada as an important step towards this vision.

TI Universal variational quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms dominate contemporary gate-based quantum enhanced optimization, eigenvalue estimation, and machine learning. Here we establish the quantum computational universality of variational quantum computation by developing two objective functions which minimize to prepare outputs of arbitrary quantum circuits. The fleeting resource of variational quantum computation is the number of expected values which must be iteratively minimized using classical-to-quantum outer loop optimization. An efficient solution to this optimization problem is given by the quantum circuit being simulated itself. The first construction is efficient in the number of expected values for n-qubit circuits containing O(poly ln n) non-Clifford gates-the number of expected values has no dependence on Clifford gates appearing in the simulated circuit. The second approach yields O(L-2) expected values whereas introducing not more than O(ln L) slack qubits for a quantum circuit partitioned into L gates. Hence, the utilitarian variational quantum programming procedure-based on the classical evaluation of objective functions and iterated feedback-is, in principle, as powerful as any other model of quantum computation. This result elevates the formal standing of the variational approach whereas establishing a universal model of quantum computation.

TI Graph-theoretic approach to quantum error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate a class of quantum error-correcting codes to correct errors on both qubits and higher-state quantum systems represented as qudits. These codes arise from an original graph-theoretic representation of sets of quantum errors. In this framework, we represent the algebraic conditions for error correction in terms of edge avoidance between graphs providing a visual representation of the interplay between errors and error-correcting codes. Most importantly, this framework supports the development of quantum codes that correct against a predetermined set of errors, in contrast to current methods. A heuristic algorithm is presented, providing steps to develop codes that correct against an arbitrary noisy channel. We benchmark the correction capability of reflexive stabilizer codes for the case of single-qubit errors by comparison to existing stabilizer codes that are widely used. In addition, we present two instances of optimal encodings: an optimal encoding for fully correlated noise, which achieves a higher encoding rate than previously known, and a minimal encoding for single-qudit errors on a four-state system..

TI Quantum teleportation of shared quantum secret in amplitude-damping
   channel
SO PLOS ONE
AB We give the detailed processes for sharing a four-qubit pure entangled state as quantum channel in amplitude damping (AD) network channel via entanglement compensation.We propose a secure (2,2)-type quantum teleportation (QT) scheme based on this AD network channel, which allows 2-dimensional quantum information shared by 2 senders to be teleported to 2 receivers in such a way that after performing two Bell-state measurements by two senders, the original target state can be probabilistically reconstructed through introducing an auxiliary qubit and executing appropriate local unitary operations provided that all the receivers collaborate. We then extend it to the transmission of a 2-dimensional quantum secret state shared by n senders to m receivers (i.e., (n,m)-type QT of shared 2-dimensional quantum secret) from the perspectives of projective measurement, positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) and generalized Bell-state measurement. Furthermore, we generalize the above (n,m)-type QT to the case of transmitting a shared d-dimensional quantum secret state. Our approach enables efficient and distributed quantum information relay, eliminating the need for a fully trusted central or intermediary node. The results show that our schemes achieve unit fidelity, though the success probabilities are less than 1. More interestingly, the QT protocol for high-dimensional quantum states exhibits a higher success probability than low-dimensional states under equivalent AD conditions.

TI Experimental Simulation of Topological Quantum Computing with Classical
   Circuits
SO ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB The key obstacle to the realization of a scalable quantum computer is overcoming environmental and control errors. Topological quantum computation attracts great attention because it emerges as one of the most promising approaches to solving these problems. Various theoretical schemes for building topological quantum computation have been proposed. However, experimental implementation has always been a great challenge because it has proved to be extremely difficult to create and manipulate topological qubits in real systems. Therefore, topological quantum computation has not been realized in experiments yet. Herein, the first experimental simulation of topological quantum computation with classical circuits is reported. Based on the proposed new scheme with circuits, not only Majorana-like edge states are simulated experimentally, but also T junctions are constructed for simulating the braiding process. Furthermore, the feasibility of simulated topological quantum computing through a set of one- and two-qubit unitary operations is demonstrated. Finally, the simulation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that simulated topological quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks. The developed circuit-based topological quantum-computing simulator can provide important references for developing future topological quantum circuits.

TI Symmetry-enhanced counterdiabatic quantum algorithm for qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Qubit-based variational quantum algorithms have undergone rapid development in recent years but still face several challenges. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based enhancement to digitized counterdiabatic quantum algorithms, applicable for qudits of any dimension. This approach offers three types of compression compared to conventional variational circuits. First, compression in the circuit depth is achieved by counterdiabatic protocols. Second, information about the problem is compressed by replacing qubits with qudits, allowing for a more efficient representation of the problem. Finally, the number of parameters is reduced by employing the symmetries of the system. We illustrate this approach by tackling a graph-based optimization problem MAX-3-CUT, a highly entangled state preparation, the qutrit W state, and a two-body only antiferromagnetic Ising problem. As our numerical results show, we achieve a better convergence with a lower circuit depth and less measurement overhead, albeit with some identified limitations for which we propose a work-around. This work leads to a better design of shallow variational quantum circuits, improving the feasibility of their implementation on near-term qudit devices.

AB Quantum entanglement is an essential resource for quantum networks. However, the generation of entanglement between physical devices at remote network nodes is a challenging task towards practical implementation of quantum networks. In this work, we use the open-source Simulator of QUantum Network Communication (SeQUeNCe), developed by our team, to simulate entanglement generation between two atomic frequency comb (AFC) absorptive quantum memories to be deployed on the Argonne-Chicago quantum network. We realize the representation of photonic quantum states within truncated Fock spaces in SeQUeNCe and build models for a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source, AFC absorptive quantum memories, and measurement devices with non-number-resolving photon detectors. Based on these developments, we observe varying fidelity with SPDC source mean photon number, and varying entanglement generation rate with both mean photon number and memory mode number. We also simulate tomographic reconstruction of the effective density matrix for the bipartite photonic states retrieved from quantum memories. Our work extends the usability of the SeQUeNCe simulator with new hardware modules and Fock state representation that will improve the simulation of near term quantum network hardware and protocols.

TI Measurement-based Quantum Repeater Network Coding
SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Quantum network coding can effectively improve the aggregate throughput of quantum networks and alleviate bottlenecks caused by topological constraints. Most of previous schemes are dedicated to the efficient teleportation of unknown quantum states in a quantum network. Herein a proposal for transmission of deterministic known states over quantum repeater network based on quantum measurements. We show that the new protocol offers advantages over three aspects. Firstly, the senders in our protocol obtain the knowledge of the quantum state to be transmitted, which enables the autonomy of quantum network transmission. Secondly, we study the quantum repeater network coding for longdistance deterministic quantum state communication. Quantum repeater network initialization requires entanglement distribution only among neighboring nodes, greatly saving entanglement resources, channel overhead and storage costs. Thirdly, based on Pauli measurements and local complementation, new protocol realizes parallel coding operations to mitigate latency issues sufficiently. Combining quantum network coding and quantum remote state preparation technology, our protocol provides an important solution for deterministic known states transmission over large-scale quantum network in the future.

TI Simulating adiabatic quantum computing with parameterized quantum
   circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Adiabatic quantum computing is a universal model for quantum computing whose implementation using a gate-based quantum computer requires depths that are unreachable in the early fault-tolerant era. To mitigate the limitations of near-term devices, a number of hybrid approaches have been pursued in which a parameterized quantum circuit prepares and measures quantum states and a classical optimization algorithm minimizes an objective function that encompasses the solution to the problem of interest. In this work, we propose a different approach starting by analyzing how a small perturbation of a Hamiltonian affects the parameters that minimize the energy within a family of parameterized quantum states. We derive a set of equations that allow us to compute the new minimum by solving a constrained linear system of equations that is obtained from measuring a series of observables on the unperturbed system. We then propose a discrete version of adiabatic quantum computing that can be implemented in a near-term device while at the same time is insensitive to the initialization of the parameters and to other limitations hindered in the optimization part of variational quantum algorithms. We compare our proposed algorithm with the variational quantum eigensolver on two classical optimization problems, namely MaxCut and number partitioning, and on a quantum-spin configuration problem, the transverse-field ising chain model, and confirm that our approach demonstrates superior performance.

TI Quantum NETwork: from theory to practice
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The quantum internet is envisioned as the ultimate stage of the quantum revolution, which surpasses its classical counterpart in various aspects, such as the efficiency of data transmission, the security of network services, and the capability of information processing. Given its disruptive impact on the national security and the digital economy, a global race to build scalable quantum networks has already begun. With the joint effort of national governments, industrial participants, and research institutes, the development of quantum networks has advanced rapidly in recent years, bringing the first primitive quantum networks within reach. In this work, we aim to provide an up-to-date review of the field of quantum networks from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, contributing to a better understanding of the building blocks required for the establishment of a global quantum internet. We also introduce a newly developed quantum network toolkit to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of innovative ideas. Particularly, it provides dual quantum computing engines, supporting simulations in both the quantum circuit and measurement-based models. It also includes a compilation scheme for mapping quantum network protocols onto quantum circuits, enabling their emulations on real-world quantum hardware devices. We showcase the power of this toolkit with several featured demonstrations, including a simulation of the Micius quantum satellite experiment, a testing of a four-layer quantum network architecture with resource management, and a quantum emulation of the CHSH game. We hope this work can give a better understanding of the state-of-the-art development of quantum networks and provide the necessary tools to make further contributions along the way.

TI Machine Learning for Integrated Quantum Photonics
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Realization of integrated quantum photonics is a key step toward scalable quantum applications such as quantum computing, sensing, information processing, and quantum material metrology. To enable practical quantum photonic systems, several challenges should be addressed, including (i) the realization of deterministic, bright, and stable single-photon emission operating at THz rates and at room temperatures, (ii) on-chip integration of efficient single-photon sources, and (iii) the development of deterministic and scalable nanoassembly of quantum circuitry elements. In this Perspective, we focus on the emerging field of physics-informed machine learning (ML) quantum photonics that is envisioned to play a decisive role in addressing the above challenges. Specifically, three directions of ML-assisted quantum research are discussed: (i) rapid preselection of single single-photon sources via ML-assisted quantum measurements, (ii) hybrid ML-optimization approach for developing efficient quantum circuits elements, and (iii) ML-based frameworks for developing novel deterministic assembly of on-chip quantum emitters.

TI Quantum memory assisted entangled state verification with local
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider the quantum memory assisted quantum state verification task, where an adversary prepares independent multipartite entangled states and sends them to the local verifiers, who then store several copies in the quantum memory and measure them collectively to make a decision. We establish an exact analytic formula for optimizing two-copy state verification, where the verifiers store two copies, and give a globally optimal two-copy strategy for multiqubit graph states involving only Bell measurements. When the verifiers can store arbitrarily many copies, we present a dimension expansion technique that designs efficient verification strategies for this case, showcasing its application to efficiently verifying Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states. These strategies become increasingly advantageous with growing memory resources, ultimately approaching the theoretical limit of efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that quantum memories enhance state verification efficiency, shedding light on error-resistant strategies and practical applications of large-scale quantum memory assisted verification.

TI Observation of a full hierarchy of temporal quantum correlations with a
   superconducting qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Temporal quantum correlations provide an intriguing way of testing quantumness at the macroscopic level, with a logical hierarchy present among the quantum correlations associated with nonmacrorealism, temporal steering, and temporal inseparability. By manipulating the dynamics of a superconducting qubit, we observe the full hierarchy of temporal quantum correlations. Moreover, we show that the rich dynamics of the temporal quantum correlations, such as sudden death or revival of temporal steering, provides a useful and unique measure for benchmarking qubits on a realistic circuit. Our work finds applications in identifying the casual structure in a quantum network, the non-Markovianity of open quantum systems, and the security bounds of quantum key distribution. As an example, we demonstrate the non-Markovianity of a single superconducting qubit on the quantum circuit.

TI Low-density parity-check representation of fault-tolerant quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In fault-tolerant quantum computing, quantum algorithms are implemented through quantum circuits capable of error correction. These circuits are typically constructed based on specific quantum error correction codes, with consideration given to the characteristics of the underlying physical platforms. Optimizing these circuits within the constraints of today's quantum computing technologies, particularly in terms of error rates, qubit counts, and network topologies, holds substantial implications for the feasibility of quantum applications in the near future. This paper presents a toolkit for designing and analyzing fault-tolerant quantum circuits. We introduce a framework for representing stabilizer circuits using classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Each codeword in the representation corresponds to a quantum-mechanical equation regarding the circuit, formalizing the correlations utilized in parity checks and delineating logical operations within the circuit. Consequently, the LDPC code provides a means of quantifying fault tolerance and verifying logical operations. We outline the procedure for generating LDPC codes from circuits using the Tanner graph notation, alongside proposing graph-theory tools for constructing fault-tolerant quantum circuits from classical LDPC codes. These findings offer a systematic approach to applying classical error correction techniques in optimizing existing fault-tolerant protocols and developing new ones. As an example, we develop a resource-efficient scheme for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing on hypergraph product codes based on the LDPC representation.

TI External control of qubit-photon interaction and multi-qubit reset in a
   dissipative quantum network
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB A quantum network is a promising quantum many-body system because of its tailored geometry and controllable interaction. Here, we propose an external control scheme for the qubit-photon interaction and multiqubit reset in a dissipative quantum network, which comprises superconducting circuit chains with microwave drives and filter-filter couplings. The traditional multiqubit reset of the quantum network requires physically disconnected qubits to prevent their entanglement. However, we use an original effect of dissipation, i.e., consuming the entanglement generated by qubits' interaction, to achieve an external control of the multiqubit reset in an always-connected superconducting circuit. The reset time is independent of the number of qubits in the quantum network. Our proposal can tolerate considerable fluctuations in the system parameters and can be applicable to higher-dimensional quantum networks.

SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Harnessing the frequency dimension in integrated photonics offers key advantages in terms of scalability, noise resilience, parallelization, and compatibility with telecom multiplexing techniques. Integrated ring resonators have been used to generate frequency-entangled states through spontaneous four-wave mixing. However, state-of-the-art integrated resonators are limited by trade-offs among size, spectral separation, and efficient photon pair generation. We have developed silicon ring resonators with a footprint below 0.05mm2 providing more than 70 frequency channels separated by 21 GHz. We exploit the narrow frequency separation to parallelize and independently control 34 single qubit-gates with a single set of three off-the-shelf electro-optic devices. We fully characterize 17 frequency-bin maximally entangled qubit pairs by performing quantum state tomography. We demonstrate for the first time, we believe, a fully connected five-user quantum network in the frequency domain. These results are a step towards a generation of quantum circuits implemented with scalable silicon photonics technology, for applications in quantum computing and secure communications.

TI Experimental Evaluation of Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Machine learning and quantum computing are both areas with considerable progress in recent years. The combination of these disciplines holds great promise for both research and practical applications. Recently there have also been many theoretical contributions of quantum machine learning algorithms with experiments performed on quantum simulators. However, most questions concerning the potential of machine learning on quantum computers are still unanswered such as How well do current quantum machine learning algorithms work in practice? How do they compare with classical approaches? Moreover, most experiments use different datasets and hence it is currently not possible to systematically compare different approaches. In this paper we analyze how quantum machine learning can be used for solving small, yet practical problems. In particular, we perform an experimental analysis of kernel-based quantum support vector machines and quantum neural networks. We evaluate these algorithm on 5 different datasets using different combinations of quantum feature maps. Our experimental results show that quantum support vector machines outperform their classical counterparts on average by 3 to 4% in accuracy both on a quantum simulator as well as on a real quantum computer. Moreover, quantum neural networks executed on a quantum computer further outperform quantum support vector machines on average by up to 5% and classical neural networks by 7%.

TI Quantum Algorithms for the Physical Layer: Potential Applications to

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The field of quantum technologies has garnered considerable interest and witnessed noteworthy progress in recent years. It is also anticipated that these technologies will continue to flourish and exert a considerable influence on society, i.e., a plethora of real-world problems that cannot be solved by classical algorithms are believed to benefit from the implementation of quantum algorithms. Meanwhile, as an alternative to cryptographic methods, physical layer security (PLS) has been extensively studied as a means to realize secure wireless communication that is resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, i.e., quantum-safe. While the prevailing approach to PLS has been based on classical algorithms, this could potentially be accelerated by the application of quantum algorithms. This paper examines the potential applications of various quantum algorithms, including quantum annealing, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, and Grover-based algorithms, to the the PLS problems. In particular, we begin with a concise overview of their applications to physical layer techniques and then proceed to discuss their use in addressing the challenges of secret message transmission and secret key generation from wireless channels.

We show that specific quantum control problems, e.g., finding the switching time for bang-bang control or the digital quantum annealing schedule, can already be studied in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. We foresee that these algorithms will contribute even more to quantum control of high precision if the hardware for experimental implementation is developed to the next level.

TI Noise-robust optimization of quantum machine learning models for polymer
   properties using a simulator and validated on the IonQ quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum machine learning for predicting the physical properties of polymer materials based on the molecular descriptors of monomers was investigated. Under the stochastic variation of the expected predicted values obtained from quantum circuits due to finite sampling, the methods proposed in previous works did not make sufficient progress in optimizing the parameters. To enable parameter optimization despite the presence of stochastic variations in the expected values, quantum circuits that improve prediction accuracy without increasing the number of parameters and parameter optimization methods that are robust to stochastic variations in the expected predicted values, were investigated. The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz circuit improved the prediction accuracy without increasing the number of parameters. The stochastic gradient descent method using the parameter-shift rule for gradient calculation was shown to be robust to sampling variability in the expected value. Finally, the quantum machine learning model was trained on an actual ion-trap quantum computer. At each optimization step, the coefficient of determination R-2 improved equally on the actual machine and simulator, indicating that our findings enable the training of quantum circuits on the actual quantum computer to the same extent as on the simulator.

TI Quantum protocol for decision making and verifying truthfulness among
   N-quantum parties: Solution and extension of the quantum coin
   flipping game
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The authors devised a protocol that allows two parties, who may malfunction or intentionally convey incorrect information in communication through a quantum channel, to verify each other's measurements and agree on each other's results. This has particular relevance in a modified version of the quantum coin flipping game. The key innovation of the authors' work includes the new design of a quantum coin that excludes any advantage of cheating, by which the long-standing problem of the fair design of the game is, affirmatively, solved. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to N-parties communicating with each other, where multiple solutions for the verification of each player's measurement is proposed. The results in the N-party scenario could have particular relevance for the implementation of future quantum networks, where verification of quantum information is a necessity.

TI Hybrid Hamiltonian Simulation Approach for the Analysis of Quantum Error
   Correction Protocol Robustness
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The development of future full-scale quantum computers (QCs) not only comprises the design of good quality qubits, but also entails the design of classical complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) control circuitry and optimized operation protocols. The construction and implementation of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, necessary for correcting the errors that inevitably occur in the physical qubit layer, form a crucial step in this design process. The steadily rising numbers of qubits in a single system make the development of small-scale quantum architectures that are able to execute such protocols a pressing challenge. Similar to classical systems, optimized simulation tools can greatly improve the efficiency of the design process. We propose an automated simulation framework for the development of qubit microarchitectures, in which the effects of design choices in the physical qubit layer on the performance of QEC protocols can be evaluated, whereas the focus in the current state-of-the-art design tools only lies on the simulation of the individual quantum gates. The hybrid Hamiltonian framework introduces the innovative combination of a hybrid nature that allows to incorporate several levels throughout the QC stack, with optimized embedded solvers. This provides the level of detail required for an in-depth analysis of the QEC protocol's stability.

TI Entanglement-breaking channels are a quantum memory resource
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement-breaking channels (equivalently, measure-and-prepare channels) are quantum operations noted for their ability to destroy multipartite spatial quantum correlations. Inspired by this property, they have also been widely employed in defining notions of "classical memory," under the assumption that such channels effectively act as a classical resource. In this paper, we show that this assumption is false. By means of multitime correlations, we conclusively show that entanglement-breaking channels are still a quantum resource: A qudit going through an entanglement-breaking channel can generate genuinely nonclassical temporal correlations, i.e., that cannot be simulated by a classical system of same dimension. Our results imply that entanglement-breaking channels cannot generally be employed to characterize classical memory effects without additional assumptions.

TI Quantum simulation of fermionic systems using hybrid digital-analog
   quantum computing approach
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We consider a hybrid digital-analog quantum computing approach, which allows implementing any quantum algorithm without standard two-qubit gates. This approach is based on the always-on interaction between qubits, which can provide an alternative to such gates. We show how digital-analog approach can be applied to simulate the dynamics of fermionic systems, in particular, the Fermi-Hubbard model, using fermionic SWAP network and refocusing technique. We concentrate on the effects of connectivity topology, the spread of interaction constants as well as on errors of entangling operations. We find that an optimal connectivity topology of qubits for the digital-analog simulation of fermionic systems of arbitrary dimensionality is a chain for spinless fermions and a ladder for spin 1/2 particles. Such a simple connectivity topology makes digital-analog approach attractive for the simulation of quantum materials and molecules.

TI Control Power in Continuous Variable Controlled Quantum Teleportation
SO ENTROPY
AB Controlled quantum teleportation is an important extension of multipartite quantum teleportation, which plays an indispensable role in building quantum networks. Compared with discrete variable counterparts, continuous variable controlled quantum teleportation can generate entanglement deterministically and exhibit higher superiority of the supervisor's authority. Here, we define a measure to quantify the control power in continuous variable controlled quantum teleportation via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type entangled coherent state channels. Our results show that control power in continuous variable controlled quantum teleportation increases with the mean photon number of coherent states. Its upper bound is 1/2, which exceeds the upper bound in discrete variable controlled quantum teleportation (1/3). The robustness of the protocol is analyzed with photon absorption. The results show that the improving ability of the control power will descend by the increasing photon loss, with the upper bound unchanged and robust. Our results illuminate the role of control power in multipartite continuous variable quantum information processing and provide a criterion for evaluating the quality of quantum communication networks.

TI Noise effects on purity and quantum entanglement in terms of physical
   implementability
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum decoherence due to imperfect manipulation of quantum devices is a key issue in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Standard analyses in quantum information and quantum computation use error rates to parameterize quantum noise channels. However, there is no explicit relation between the decoherence effect induced by a noise channel and its error rate. In this work, we propose to characterize the decoherence effect of a noise channel by the physical implementability of its inverse, which is a universal parameter quantifying the difficulty to simulate the noise inverse with accessible quantum channels. We establish two concise inequalities connecting the decrease of the state purity and logarithmic negativity after a noise channel to the physical implementability of the noise inverse, which is required to be decomposed as mutually orthogonal unitaries or product channels respectively. Our results are numerically demonstrated on several commonly adopted two-qubit noise models. We believe that these relations contribute to the theoretical research on the entanglement properties of noise channels and provide guiding principles for quantum circuit design.

TI Quantum repeaters based on concatenated bosonic and discrete-variable
   quantum codes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose an architecture of quantum-error-correction-based quantum repeaters that combines techniques used in discrete- and continuous-variable quantum information. Specifically, we propose to encode the transmitted qubits in a concatenated code consisting of two levels. On the first level we use a continuous-variable GKP code encoding the qubit in a single bosonic mode. On the second level we use a small discrete-variable code. Such an architecture has two important features. Firstly, errors on each of the two levels are corrected in repeaters of two different types. This enables for achieving performance needed in practical scenarios with a reduced cost with respect to an architecture for which all repeaters are the same. Secondly, the use of continuous-variable GKP code on the lower level generates additional analog information which enhances the error-correcting capabilities of the second-level code such that long-distance communication becomes possible with encodings consisting of only four or seven optical modes.

TI Generation of non-classical states of light and their application in
   deterministic quantum teleportation
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Non-classical states of light, which include squeezed and entangled states of light, are the cornerstone of quantum mechanics and quantum information sciences. To date, non-classical states of light with much higher quality than before are required to develop high-fidelity quantum information processing and high-precision quantum metrology. Squeezed and entangled states with approximately 10 dB noise below the corresponding shot noise limit have been generated using a series of methods, which means that the noise variance reaches a few percent of the vacuum noise. Quantum teleportation, which means transferring an unknown quantum state from a sending station to a distant receiving station supported by entangled states, is the foundation of quantum computation and quantum communication networks. Quantum teleportation in continuous variable regions is unconditional because the entangled states used are always deterministic. The quantum teleportation distance was recently extended to the order of kilometers, which paves the way for constructing a practical quantum information network.

TI Qudit-based variational quantum eigensolver using photonic orbital
   angular momentum states
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Solving the electronic structure problem is a notorious challenge in quantum chemistry and material science. Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for finding the lowest-energy configuration of a molecular system. However, it typically requires many qubits and quantum gates with substantial quantum circuit depth to accurately represent the electronic wave function of complex structures. Here, we propose an alternative approach to solve the electronic structure problem using VQE with a single qudit. Our approach exploits a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum state of a heralded single photon and notably reduces the required quantum resources compared to conventional multi-qubit-based VQE. We experimentally demonstrate that our single-qudit-based VQE can efficiently estimate the ground state energy of hydrogen (H2) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecular systems corresponding to two- and four-qubit systems, respectively. We believe that our scheme opens a pathway to perform a large-scale quantum simulation for solving more complex problems in quantum chemistry and material science.

TI Sequential optimal selections of single-qubit gates in parameterized
   quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In variational quantum algorithms, it is important to balance conflicting requirements of expressibility and trainability of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). However, appropriate PQC designs are not necessarily trivial. Here, we propose an algorithm for optimizing the PQC structure, where single-qubit gates are sequentially replaced by the optimal ones via diagonalization of a matrix whose elements are evaluated on slightly modified circuits. This replacement leads to a better approximation of target states with limited circuit depth. Furthermore, we clarify the existence of a barren plateau in the sequential optimization in terms of the spectrum concentration of the matrix, which defines the cost landscape with respect to changes in the target gate. Then, we rigorously show the concentration is no faster than polynomials in the number of qubits when an n-qubit PQC depth is O (log n) using local observables. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to show the convergence of our method which is faster than classical optimizers on both simulators and a real device. Our results provide evidences for sequential optimizers as better alternatives to optimize PQCs on near-term quantum devices.

TI Quantum computation with machine-learning-controlled quantum stuff
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We formulate the control over quantum matter, so as to perform arbitrary quantum computation, as an optimization problem. We then provide a schematic machine learning algorithm for its solution. Imagine a long strip of 'quantum stuff', endowed with certain assumed physical properties, and equipped with regularly spaced wires to provide input settings and to read off outcomes. After showing how the corresponding map from settings to outcomes can be construed as a quantum circuit, we provide a machine learning framework to tomographically 'learn' which settings implement the members of a universal gate set. To that end, we devise a loss function measuring how badly a proposed encoding has failed to implement a given circuit, and prove the existence of 'tomographically complete' circuit sets: should a given encoding minimize the loss function for each member of such a set, it also will for an arbitrary circuit. At optimum, arbitrary quantum gates, and thus arbitrary quantum programs, can be implemented using the stuff.

It makes the following contributions: 1) a repeater and routing based quantum network simulator (QNSim) is developed, 2) repeaters with and without quantum memories are respectively simulated in QNSim, 3) different routing scenarios in QNetGrid are investigated, 4) a real-time QNetGrid software testbed is built in RTDS incorporating QNSim and real SDN switches, and 5) various test cases are designed, and experimental results produced with the QNetGrid testbed provide valuable insights for building quantum networks in power grids.

In this study, we derive bounds for noise and detection efficiency-two critical parameters for experimental implementations-beyond qubit-based protocols. Our results show that while lower bounds indicate no improvement in noise resilience with increased dimensionality, upper bounds reveal marginal, albeit insignificant, enhancements. Given the experimental challenges associated with the development of qudit-based systems, our findings prompts a debate on their practical utility for DIQKD.

TI Packet switching in quantum networks: A path to the quantum Internet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Large-scale quantum networks with thousands of nodes require scalable network protocols and physical hardware to realize. In this paper, we introduce packet switching as a paradigm for quantum data transmission in both future and near-term quantum networks. We propose a classical-quantum data frame structure and explore methods of frame generation and processing. Further, we present conceptual designs for a quantum reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer to realize the proposed transmission scheme. Packet switching allows for a universal design for a next-generation Internet where classical and quantum data share the same network protocols and infrastructure. In this quantum networking paradigm, entanglement distribution, as with quantum key distribution, is an application built on top of the quantum network rather than as a network designed especially for those purposes. For analysis of the network model, we simulate the feasibility of quantum packet switching for some preliminary models of quantum key and entanglement distribution. Finally, we discuss how our model can be integrated with other network models toward a realization of the quantum Internet.

TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Using Large Spin-Cat Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We construct a fault -tolerant quantum error -correcting protocol based on a qubit encoded in a large spin qudit using a spin -cat code, analogous to the continuous -variable cat encoding. With this, we can correct the dominant error sources, namely processes that can be expressed as error operators that are linear or quadratic in the components of angular momentum. Such codes tailored to dominant error sources can exhibit superior thresholds and lower resource overheads when compared to those designed for unstructured noise models. A key component is the CNOT gate that preserves the rank of spherical tensor operators. Categorizing the dominant errors as phase and amplitude errors, we demonstrate how phase errors, analogous to phase -flip errors for qubits, can be effectively corrected. Furthermore, we propose a measurement -free error -correction scheme to address amplitude errors without relying on syndrome measurements. Through an in-depth analysis of logical CNOT gate errors, we establish that the fault -tolerant threshold for error correction in the spin -cat encoding surpasses that of standard qubit-based encodings. We consider a specific implementation based on neutral -atom quantum computing, with qudits encoded in the nuclear spin of 87 Sr, and show how to generate the universal gate set, including the rank -preserving CNOT gate, using quantum control and the Rydberg blockade. These findings pave the way for encoding a qubit in a large spin with the potential to achieve fault tolerance, high threshold, and reduced resource overhead in quantum information processing.

TI Fully heterogeneous prepare-and-measure quantum network for the next
   stage of quantum internet
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The quantum internet promises unparalleled capabilities that are provably impossible with the classical internet. However, current quantum networks are often designed with dedicated systems for specified tasks, which hinders the openness and diversity of future quantum internet. To address these limitations, this work proposes a fully heterogeneous quantum network accompanied with several techniques. Our proposal allows users to access the network using any mainstream systems or even partial systems. The network also enables the execution of multiple distinct quantum tasks and provides opportunities for global optimization and cost-efficient design. A five-node quantum network featuring heterogeneous nodes has been implemented, demonstrating the superiority of our proposal through tasks such as quantum key distribution, quantum digital signature, quantum Byzantine agreement, and quantum conference. Notably, the experiment represents the first demonstration of multi-malicious node quantum Byzantine agreement in a quantum network.

TI Experimental realization of a three-photon asymmetric maximally
   entangled state and its application to quantum state transfer
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing, prominently used in quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Recent studies have shifted toward high-dimensional entangled states, offering greater information capacity and enabling more complex applications. Here, we experimentally prepared a three-photon asymmetric maximally entangled state, comprising two two-dimensional photons and one four-dimensional photon. Using this state, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment, successfully transferring a four-dimensional quantum state from two photons to another photon with fidelities ranging from 0.78 to 0.86. These results exceed theoretical limits, demonstrating genuine four-dimensional quantum state transfer. The asymmetric entangled state demonstrated here holds promise for future quantum networks as a quantum interface facilitating information transfer across quantum systems with different dimensions.

   support vector machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB While quantum machine learning (ML) has been proposed to be one of the most promising applications of quantum computing, how to build quantum ML models that outperform classical ML remains a major open question. Here, we demonstrate a Bayesian algorithm for constructing quantum kernels for support vector machines that adapts quantum gate sequences to data. The algorithm increases the complexity of quantum circuits incrementally by appending quantum gates selected with Bayesian information criterion as circuit selection metric and Bayesian optimization of the parameters of the locally optimal quantum circuits identified. The performance of the resulting quantum models for the classification problems considered here significantly exceeds that of optimized classical models with conventional kernels.

TI Noncommutative graphs based on finite-infinite system couplings: Quantum
   error correction for a qubit coupled to a coherent field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction plays a key role for quantum information transmission and quantum computing. In this work, we develop and apply the theory of noncommutative operator graphs to study error correction in the case of a finite-dimensional quantum system coupled to an infinite-dimensional system. We consider as an explicit example a qubit coupled via the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian with a bosonic coherent field. We extend the theory of noncommutative graphs to this situation and construct, using Gazeau-Klauder coherent states, the corresponding noncommutative graph. As the result, we find the quantum anticlique, which is the projector on the error-correcting subspace, and analyze it as a function of the frequencies of the qubit and the bosonic field. The general treatment is also applied to the analysis of the error-correcting subspace for certain experimental values of the parameters of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. The proposed scheme can be applied to any system that possess the same decomposition of spectrum of the Hamiltonian into a direct sum as in JC model, where eigenenergies in the two direct summands form strictly increasing sequences.

TI Suppression of Crosstalk in Quantum Circuit Based on Instruction
   Exchange Rules and Duration
SO ENTROPY
AB Crosstalk is the primary source of noise in quantum computing equipment. The parallel execution of multiple instructions in quantum computation causes crosstalk, which causes coupling between signal lines and mutual inductance and capacitance between signal lines, destroying the quantum state and causing the program to fail to execute correctly. Overcoming crosstalk is a critical prerequisite for quantum error correction and large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper provides an approach for suppressing crosstalk in quantum computers based on multiple instruction exchange rules and duration. Firstly, for the majority of the quantum gates that can be executed on quantum computing devices, a multiple instruction exchange rule is proposed. The multiple instruction exchange rule reorders quantum gates in quantum circuits and separates double quantum gates with high crosstalk on quantum circuits. Then, time stakes are inserted based on the duration of different quantum gates, and quantum gates with high crosstalk are carefully separated in the process of quantum circuit execution by quantum computing equipment to reduce the influence of crosstalk on circuit fidelity. Several benchmark experiments verify the proposed method's effectiveness. In comparison to previous techniques, the proposed method improves fidelity by 15.97% on average.

TI A Hybrid Noise Approach to Modeling of Free-Space Satellite Quantum
   Communication Channel for Continuous-Variable QKD
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB This research advances the application of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) in Free-Space Optics (FSO) satellite-based quantum communication. It proposes an innovative satellite quantum channel model and derives the secret quantum key distribution rate achievable through this channel. Unlike existing models that approximate the noise in quantum channels as merely Gaussian distributed, this model incorporates a hybrid quantum noise analysis, accounting for both quantum Poissonian noise and classical Additive-White-Gaussian Noise (AWGN). This hybrid approach acknowledges the dual vulnerability of continuous variables (CV) Gaussian quantum channels to both quantum and classical noise under collective attack with reverse-reconciliation (RR) setting, thereby offering a more realistic assessment of the quantum Secret Key Rate (SKR). This work delves into the variation of asymptotic SKR with the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and satellite altitudes under various influencing parameters. We identify and analyze critical factors such as reconciliation efficiency, electrical noise, transmission coefficient, detection efficiency, transmission efficiency, excess noise, and the quantum Poissonian noise parameter impacting the SKR. These parameters are pivotal in determining the asymptotic SKR in FSO satellite quantum channels, highlighting the challenges of satellite-based quantum communication. A comparative study has been provided based on the finite-size and asymptotic SKR. It provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and optimizing asymptotic SKR in satellite-based QKD systems, paving the way for more efficient and secure quantum communication networks.

TI Privacy-preserving quantum federated learning via gradient hiding
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Distributed quantum computing, particularly distributed quantum machine learning, has gained substantial prominence for its capacity to harness the collective power of distributed quantum resources, transcending the limitations of individual quantum nodes. Meanwhile, the critical concern of privacy within distributed computing protocols remains a significant challenge, particularly in standard classical federated learning (FL) scenarios where data of participating clients is susceptible to leakage via gradient inversion attacks by the server. This paper presents innovative quantum protocols with quantum communication designed to address the FL problem, strengthen privacy measures, and optimize communication efficiency. In contrast to previous works that leverage expressive variational quantum circuits or differential privacy techniques, we consider gradient information concealment using quantum states and propose two distinct FL protocols, one based on private inner-product estimation and the other on incremental learning. These protocols offer substantial advancements in privacy preservation with low communication resources, forging a path toward efficient quantum communication-assisted FL protocols and contributing to the development of secure distributed quantum machine learning, thus addressing critical privacy concerns in the quantum computing era.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB While recent breakthroughs in quantum computing promise the nascence of the quantum information age, quantum states remain delicate to control. Moreover, the required energy budget for large scale quantum applications has only sparely been considered. Addressing either of these issues necessitates a careful study of the most energetically efficient implementation of elementary quantum operations. In the present analysis, we show that this optimal control problem can be solved within the powerful framework of quantum speed limits. To this end, we derive state-independent lower bounds on the energetic cost, from which we find the universally optimal implementation of unitary quantum gates, for both single and N-qubit operations.

TI End-To-End Capacities of Hybrid Quantum Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Future quantum networks will be hybrid structures, constructed from complex architectures of quantum repeaters interconnected by quantum channels that describe a variety of physical domains; predominantly optical-fiber and free-space links. In this hybrid setting, the interplay between the channel quality within network substructures must be carefully considered, and is pivotal for ensuring high-rate end-to-end quan-tum communication. In this work, we combine recent advances in the theory of point-to-point free-space channel capacities and end-to-end quantum network capacities in order to develop critical tools for the study of hybrid, free-space quantum networks. We present a general formalism for studying the capacities of arbitrary, hybrid quantum networks, before specifying to the regime of atmospheric and space-based quantum channels. We then introduce a class of modular quantum network architectures, which offer a realistic and readily analyzable framework for hybrid quantum networks. By considering a physically motivated, highly connected modular structure we are able to idealize network performance and derive channel conditions for which optimal performance is guaranteed. This allows us to reveal vital properties for which distance-independent rates are achieved, so that the end-to-end capacity has no dependence on the physical separation between users. Our analytical method elucidates key infrastructure demands for a future satellite-based global quantum internet, and for hybrid wired and wireless metropolitan quantum networks.

TI Quantum machine learning beyond kernel methods
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Machine learning algorithms based on parametrized quantum circuits are prime candidates for near-term applications on noisy quantum computers. In this direction, various types of quantum machine learning models have been introduced and studied extensively. Yet, our understanding of how these models compare, both mutually and to classical models, remains limited. In this work, we identify a constructive framework that captures all standard models based on parametrized quantum circuits: that of linear quantum models. In particular, we show using tools from quantum information theory how data re-uploading circuits, an apparent outlier of this framework, can be efficiently mapped into the simpler picture of linear models in quantum Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we analyze the experimentally-relevant resource requirements of these models in terms of qubit number and amount of data needed to learn. Based on recent results from classical machine learning, we prove that linear quantum models must utilize exponentially more qubits than data re-uploading models in order to solve certain learning tasks, while kernel methods additionally require exponentially more data points. Our results provide a more comprehensive view of quantum machine learning models as well as insights on the compatibility of different models with NISQ constraints. Comparing the capabilities of different quantum machine learning protocols is difficult. Here, the authors show that different learning models based on parametrized quantum circuits can all be seen as quantum linear models, thus driving general conclusions on their resource requirements and capabilities.

TI Realising and compressing quantum circuits with quantum reservoir
   computing
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers require precise control over parameters and careful engineering of the underlying physical system. In contrast, neural networks have evolved to tolerate imprecision and inhomogeneity. Here, using a reservoir computing architecture we show how a random network of quantum nodes can be used as a robust hardware for quantum computing. Our network architecture induces quantum operations by optimising only a single layer of quantum nodes, a key advantage over the traditional neural networks where many layers of neurons have to be optimised. We demonstrate how a single network can induce different quantum gates, including a universal gate set. Moreover, in the few-qubit regime, we show that sequences of multiple quantum gates in quantum circuits can be compressed with a single operation, potentially reducing the operation time and complexity. As the key resource is a random network of nodes, with no specific topology or structure, this architecture is a hardware friendly alternative paradigm for quantum computation. Building quantum computers typically requires substantial engineering efforts to achieve precise control on qubits and quantum gates. Here, the authors introduce an architecture based on reservoir computing and machine learning to realize efficient quantum operations without resorting to full optimization of the control parameters.

TI Exact rate analysis for quantum repeaters with imperfect memories and
   entanglement swapping as soon as possible
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present an exact rate analysis for a secret key that can be shared among two parties employing a linear quantum repeater chain. One of our main motivations is to address the question whether simply placing quantum memories along a quantum communication channel can be beneficial in a realistic setting. The underlying model assumes deterministic entanglement swapping of single-spin quantum memories and it excludes probabilistic entanglement distillation, and thus two-way classical communication, on higher nesting levels. Within this framework, we identify the essential properties of any optimal repeater scheme: entanglement distribution in parallel, entanglement swapping as soon and parallel quantum storage as little as possible. While these features are obvious or trivial for the simplest repeater with one middle station, for more stations they cannot always be combined. We propose an optimal scheme including channel loss and memory dephasing, proving its optimality for the case of two stations and conjecturing it for the general case. In an even more realistic setting, we consider additional tools and parameters such as memory cutoffs, multiplexing, initial state and swapping gate fidelities, and finite link coupling efficiencies in order to identify potential regimes in memory-assisted quantum key distribution beyond one middle station that exceed the rates of the smallest quantum repeaters as well as those obtainable in all-optical schemes unassisted by stationary memory qubits and two-way classical communication. Our analytical treatment enables us to determine simultaneous trade-offs between various parameters, their scaling, and their influence on the performance ordering among different types of protocols, comparing two-photon interference after dual-rail qubit transmission with one-photon interference of single-rail qubits or, similarly, optical interference of coherent states. We find that for experimental parameter values that are highly demanding but not impossible (up to 10 s coherence time, about 80% link coupling, and state or gate infidelities in the regime of 1%-2%), one secret bit can be shared per second at a total channel loss budget of 157.6 dB, i.e. a total distance of 800 km for a fiber attenuation length of 22 km with repeater stations placed at every 100 km-a clear improvement over realistic twin-field or, much more pronouncedly, ideal point-to-point quantum key distribution at GHz clock rates.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The goal of the space-based quantum network is to form the backbone of the quantum internet for long-distance secure data transfer, networked distributed quantum information processing, and other applications. Consider that the quantum network evolved from a recent form where a satellite performs a sequence of satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution (SatQKD) missions that allow any two ground nodes to have the symmetric encryption keys, we here develop a framework for the SatQKD downlink modelling and scheduling analysis. Incorporated with the orbital calculation and the meteorological data to downlink SatQKD modelling, the dynamic characteristics of the satellite-to-ground optical transmission could be simulated. Our work shows that the satellite downlink scheduling allows for the possibility to consider different strategies for SatQKD missions such as extending connection for distant ground nodes, prioritized delivery and promoting keys utilization, which may guide design and analysis of future missions for future satellite application.

TI Quantum resource estimation for large scale quantum algorithms
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Quantum algorithms are often represented in terms of quantum circuits operating on ideal (logical) qubits. However, the practical implementation of these algorithms poses significant challenges. Many quantum algorithms require a substantial number of logical qubits, and the inherent susceptibility to errors of quantum computers require quantum error correction. The integration of error correction introduces overhead in terms of both space (physical qubits required) and runtime (how long the algorithm needs to be run for). This paper addresses the complexity of comparing classical and quantum algorithms, primarily stemming from the additional quantum error correction overhead. We propose a comprehensive framework that facilitates a direct and meaningful comparison between classical and quantum algorithms. By acknowledging and addressing the challenges introduced by quantum error correction, our framework aims to provide a clearer understanding of the comparative performance of classical and quantum computing approaches. This work contributes to understanding the practical viability and potential advantages of quantum algorithms in real-world applications. We apply our framework to quantum cryptanalysis, since it is well known that quantum algorithms can break factoring and discrete logarithm based cryptography and weaken symmetric cryptography and hash functions. In order to estimate the real-world impact of these attacks, apart from tracking the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers it is important to have an estimate of the resources needed to implement these quantum attacks. This analysis provides state-of-the art snap-shot estimates of the realistic costs of implementing quantum attacks on these important cryptographic algorithms, assuming quantum fault-tolerance is achieved using surface code methods, and spanning a range of potential error rates. These estimates serve as a guide for gauging the realistic impact of these algorithms and for benchmarking the impact of future advances in quantum algorithms, circuit synthesis and optimization, fault-tolerance methods and physical error rates.

TI Quantum communication capacity transition of complex quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum network is the key to enable distributed quantum information processing. As the single-link communication rate decays exponentially with the distance, to enable reliable end-to-end quantum communication, the number of nodes needs to grow with the network scale. For highly connected networks, we identify a threshold transition in the capacity as the density of network nodes increases: below a critical density the rate is almost zero, while above the threshold the rate increases linearly with the density. Surprisingly, above the threshold the typical communication capacity between two nodes is independent of the distance between them, due to multipath routing enabled by the quantum network. In contrast, for less connected networks such as scale-free networks, the end-to-end capacity saturates to constants as the number of nodes increases, and always decays with the distance. Our results are based on capacity evaluations, therefore the minimum density requirement for an appreciable capacity applies to any general protocols of quantum networks.

TI New Single-Preparation Methods for Unsupervised Quantum Machine Learning
   Problems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The term "machine learning" especially refers to algorithms that derive mappings, i.e., input-output transforms, by using numerical data that provide information about considered transforms. These transforms appear in many problems related to classification/clustering, regression, system identification, system inversion, and input signal restoration/separation. We here analyze the connections between all these problems in the classical and quantum frameworks. We then focus on their most challenging versions, involving quantum data and/or quantum processing means, and unsupervised, i.e., blind, learning. We consider the general single-preparation quantum information processing (SIPQIP) framework that we have recently proposed. It involves methods that can work with a single instance of each (unknown) state, whereas usual methods are quite cumbersome because they have to very accurately create many copies of each (known) state. In our previous papers, we applied the SIPQIP approach to only one task [blind quantum process tomography (BQPT)], but it opens the way to a large range of other types of methods. In this article, we, therefore, propose various new SIPQIP methods that efficiently perform tasks related to system identification (blind Hamiltonian parameter estimation (BHPE), blind quantum channel identification/estimation, and blind phase estimation), system inversion and state estimation (blind quantum source separation (BQSS), blind quantum entangled state restoration (BQSR), and blind quantum channel equalization), and classification. Numerical tests show that our SIPQIP framework, moreover, yields much more accurate estimation than the usual multiple-preparation approach. Our methods are especially useful in a quantum computer, which we propose to more briefly call a "quamputer": BQPT and BHPE simplify the characterization of quamputer gates; BQSS and BQSR yield quantum gates that may be used to compensate for the nonidealities that alter states stored in quantum registers and open the way to very general self-adaptive quantum gates.

TI Fusion-based quantum computation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The standard primitives of quantum computing include deterministic unitary entangling gates, which are not natural operations in many systems including photonics. Here, we present fusion-based quantum computation, a model for fault tolerant quantum computing constructed from physical primitives readily accessible in photonic systems. These are entangling measurements, called fusions, which are performed on the qubits of small constant sized entangled resource states. Probabilistic photonic gates as well as errors are directly dealt with by the quantum error correction protocol. We show that this computational model can achieve a higher threshold than schemes reported in literature. We present a ballistic scheme which can tolerate a 10.4% probability of suffering photon loss in each fusion, which corresponds to a 2.7% probability of loss of each individual photon. The architecture is also highly modular and has reduced classical processing requirements compared to previous photonic quantum computing architectures.
   Fusion gates are common operations in photonic quantum information platforms, where they are employed to create entanglement. Here, the authors propose a quantum computation scheme where the same measurements used to generate entanglement can also be used to achieve fault-tolerance leading to an increased tolerance to errors.

TI Nonlocal activation of bound entanglement via local quantum Zeno
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bound entanglement was shown to be activated [P. Horodecki et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1056 (1999)] in the sense that the entanglement of a spatially separated two-qutrit system can be increased with nonzero probability via a sufficiently large number of preshared bound-entangled states, local three-level controlled operations, and classical communications. Here we present a local quantum Zeno scheme for activating bound entanglement which is based only on single-particle rotations and threshold measurements. In our scheme, neither a large number of bound-entangled states nor controlled operations are required, and classical communication is required only once at the end of the protocol. We show that a single bound entangled state is sufficient for increasing the negativity of the target entangled state from 0.11 to 0.17, and by using four more bound-entangled states, negativity can be made greater than 0.42 and the fidelity to the maximally entangled state increases from 0.3 to 0.41, 0.50, 0.59, and 0.61. We believe our results are important not only for quantum technologies but also for a better understanding of quantum entanglement.

TI Effects of the Exciton Fine Structure Splitting on the
   Entanglement-Based Quantum Key Distribution
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB The reliable transmission of secure keys is one of the essential tasks to be efficiently accomplished by quantum information processing, and the use of entangled particles is a very important tool toward that goal. However, efficient production of maximally entangled states is still a challenge for further progress in quantum computing and quantum communication. In the search for optimal sources of entanglement, quantum dots have emerged as promising candidates, but the presence of dephasing in the generated entangled states raises questions about their real usefulness in large-scale quantum networks. In this work, we evaluate the effects of the exciton fine structure splitting, present in most quantum dot samples, on the fidelity of the BBM92 protocol for quantum key distribution. We find that the protocol's performance is heavily impacted by such splitting and establish an upper limit for the product between the energy splitting and the exciton lifetime to have a dependable distributed key.

TI Designing a compact cavity-enhanced source of entangled photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement will be the key resource of future large-scale quantum networks, enabling quantum communication and advanced quantum applications like distributed quantum sensing and distributed quantum computing. To this end, entanglement will have to be distributed over large distances and efficiently coupled to quantum devices at the network nodes. This requires the entangled photons to have wavelengths and bandwidths compatible with the quantum memories in quantum repeater nodes or quantum devices at client nodes. Here, we present a cavity-enhanced source design using two nonlinear crystals inside a single cavity. We provide detailed considerations balancing the complexity of the cavity design with the photon bandwidth and the entanglement quality.

Because of the dramatically improved speed at which it processes data, it can be applied to various issues. QC has many potential applications, but three of the most exciting applications are unstructured search, quantum simulation, and network optimisation.

TI Quantum-enhanced radiometry via approximate quantum error correction
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Exotic quantum states can be advantageous for sensing, but are very fragile, so that some form of quantum error correction is needed. Here, the authors show how approximate QEC helps overcoming decoherence due to noise when measuring the excitation population of a receiver mode in a superconducting circuit.
   Quantum sensing based on exotic quantum states is appealing for practical metrology applications and fundamental studies. However, these quantum states are vulnerable to noise and the resulting quantum enhancement is weakened in practice. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum-enhanced sensing scheme with a bosonic probe, by exploring the large Hilbert space of the bosonic mode and developing both the approximate quantum error correction and the quantum jump tracking approaches. In a practical radiometry scenario, we attain a 5.3 dB enhancement of sensitivity, which reaches 9.1 x 10(-4) Hz(-1/2) when measuring the excitation population of a receiver mode. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum sensing with near-term quantum technologies, not only shedding new light on the quantum advantage of sensing, but also stimulating further efforts on bosonic quantum technologies.

TI Reducing Quantum Error Correction Overhead With Versatile Flag-Sharing
   Syndrome Extraction Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Given that quantum error correction processes are unreliable, an efficient error syndrome extraction circuit should use fewer ancillary qubits, quantum gates, and measurements while maintaining low circuit depth, to minimize the circuit area, roughly defined as the product of circuit depth and the number of physical qubits. We propose to design parallel flagged syndrome extraction with shared flag qubits for quantum stabilizer codes. Versatile parallelization techniques are employed to minimize the required circuit area, thereby improving the error threshold and overall performance. Specifically, measurement outcomes across multiple rounds of syndrome extraction are integrated into a lookup table decoder, enabling parallelization of multiple stabilizer measurements with shared flag qubits. In addition, we introduce an adaptive technique to reduce the overhead from excessive syndrome extraction. We present flag-sharing and fully parallel schemes for the [[17,1,5]], [[19,1,5]] Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and the [[5,1,3]] non-CSS code, where the [[5,1,3]] implementation achieves the minimum known circuit area. Numerical simulations have demonstrated improved pseudothresholds for these codes by up to an order of magnitude compared to previous schemes in the literature.

TI Quantum teleportation with one classical bit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum teleportation allows one to transmit an arbitrary qubit from point A to point B using a pair of (pre-shared) entangled qubits and classical bits of information. The conventional protocol for teleportation uses two bits of classical information and assumes that the sender has access to only one copy of the arbitrary qubit to be sent. Here, we ask whether we can do better than two bits of classical information if the sender has access to multiple copies of the qubit to be teleported. We place no restrictions on the qubit states. Consequently, we propose a modified quantum teleportation protocol that allows Alice to reset the state of the entangled pair to its initial state using only local operations. As a result, the proposed teleportation protocol requires the transmission of only one classical bit with a probability greater than one-half. This has implications for efficient quantum communications and the security of quantum cryptographic protocols based on quantum entanglement.

TI Quantum algorithm for quantum state discrimination via partial negation

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum state discrimination problem is to distinguish between non-orthogonal quantum states. This problem has many applications in quantum information theory, quantum communication and quantum cryptography. In this paper, a quantum algorithm using weak measurement and partial negation will be proposed to solve the quantum state discrimination problem using a single copy of an unknown qubit. The usage of weak measurement makes it possible to reconstruct the qubit after measurement since the superposition will not be destroyed due to measurement. The proposed algorithm will be able to determine, with high probability of success, the state of the unknown qubit and whether it is encoded in the Hadamard or the computational basis by counting the outcome of the successive measurements on an auxiliary qubit.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The field of quantum communication promises to provide efficient and unconditionally secure ways to exchange information, particularly, in the form of quantum states. Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in quantum computation with superconducting circuits trigger a demand for quantum communication channels between spatially separated superconducting processors operating at microwave frequencies. In pursuit of this goal, we demonstrate the unconditional quantum teleportation of propagating coherent microwave states by exploiting two-mode squeezing and analog feedforward over a macroscopic distance of d = 0.42 m. We achieve a teleportation fidelity of F = 0.689 +/- 0.004, exceeding the asymptotic no-cloning threshold. Thus, the quantum nature of the teleported states is preserved, opening the avenue toward unconditional security in microwave quantum communication.

TI Hybrid Quantum Technologies for Quantum Support Vector Machines
SO INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing has rapidly gained prominence for its unprecedented computational efficiency in solving specific problems when compared to classical computing counterparts. This surge in attention is particularly pronounced in the realm of quantum machine learning (QML) following a classical trend. Here we start with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs). Subsequently, we analyze the limitations inherent in both annealing and gate-based techniques. To address these identified weaknesses, we propose a novel hybrid methodology that integrates aspects of both techniques, thereby mitigating several individual drawbacks while keeping the advantages. We provide a detailed presentation of the two components of our hybrid models, accompanied by the presentation of experimental results that corroborate the efficacy of the proposed architecture. These results pave the way for a more integrated paradigm in quantum machine learning and quantum computing at large, transcending traditional compartmentalization.

TI Qutrit Control for Bucket Brigade RAM Using Transmon Systems
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Qudits allow the encoding and manipulation of additional quantum information compared to that stored to a two-level qubit system. Although manipulations of qudit states are generally more complex and can introduce extra sources of noise, qudits can still be used in a number of applications when this error can be kept sufficiently low. One such application is the case of the Bucket Brigade Algorithm for realizing a Quantum RAM (QRAM), which inherently uses qutrits for encoding the state of address switches. In this paper, we study a methodology for qutrit manipulation that leverages efficient encoding techniques and pulse calibration methods for the case of transmon systems. The methodology employs an encoding scheme that allows the execution of controlled operations, using the subspace spanned by the two lowest levels of the transmon; we show how this scheme can be used for generating one- and two-qutrit gates by leveraging the Qiskit and Boulder Opal frameworks to compute the parameters of pulses that implement the quantum gates that are used by the BBA. For this type of gate, simulations show that the pulses perform the required operations with a low infidelity when errors introduced by the qutrit Hamiltonian dynamics are considered.

TI Key Device and Materials Specifications for a Repeater Enabled Quantum
   Internet
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Entangled photons can be used to create a truly secure communication link between two parties. However, the distance overwhich this can be achieved is limited by the transmission losses associated with optical fibers. One potential solution is using quantum repeaters (QRs) where initial entanglement is created over short distances and then extended via entanglement swapping. The system-level performance metrics (data rate, fidelity of entanglement, etc.) impose demands upon the hardware components (of a QR), which can be used to guide applied materials and device design toward these objectives. This has become increasingly important with an expanding list of candidates for quantum technologies, as the physical realization of each qubit or detector technology brings its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we present a framework that uses a modular QR and highlights the tradeoffs that exist between technological component modules. Using reported values, we take a near-term perspective and show the achievable range of rates as a function of distance and the corresponding requirements on matter qubit properties.

AB Despite fundamental interests in learning quantum circuits, the existence of a computationally efficient algorithm for learning shallow quantum circuits remains an open question. Because shallow quantum circuits can generate distributions that are classically hard to sample from, existing learning algorithms do not apply. In this work, we present a polynomial-time classical algorithm for learning the description of any unknown n-qubit shallow quantum circuit U (with arbitrary unknown architecture) within a small diamond distance using single-qubit measurement data on the output states of U. We also provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for learning the description of any unknown n-qubit state |psi  = U | 0(n) prepared by a shallow quantum circuit U (on a 2D lattice) within a small trace distance using single-qubit measurements on copies of | psi . Our approach uses a quantum circuit representation based on local inversions and a technique to combine these inversions. This circuit representation yields an optimization landscape that can be efficiently navigated and enables efficient learning of quantum circuits that are classically hard to simulate.

TI Hardware routed quantum key distribution networks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum communication networks pose immense potential for revolutionising secure communications for several applications such as banking, defence, etc. The majority literature on quantum networks deals with the problems of networking and resource allocation using Software Defined Networks (SDNs). SDNs, however, introduce several issues, such as app manipulation attacks and scalability issues. We propose a novel scheme of implementing quantum communication networks that are hardware routed rather than software defined by labelling qubit photons using laser communications. We provide a comprehensive implementation of the new scheme and propose two novel algorithms-Bandwidth sharing and Equitable bandwidth sharing to implement the hardware routed quantum network. The algorithms result in a key rate increase of 118% and improved network resource utilization of 147% as compared to the First Come First Serve algorithm.

TI Selective and Scalable Control of Spin Quantum Memories in a Photonic
   Circuit
SO NANO LETTERS
AB A central goal in many quantum information processing applications is a network of quantum memories that can be entangled with each other while being individually controlled and measured with high fidelity. This goal has motivated the development of programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with integrated spin quantum memories using diamond color center spin-photon interfaces. However, this approach introduces a challenge into the microwave control of individual spins within closely packed registers. Here, we present a quantum memory-integrated photonics platform capable of (i) the integration of multiple diamond color center spins into a cryogenically compatible, high-speed programmable PIC platform, (ii) selective manipulation of individual spin qubits addressed via tunable magnetic field gradients, and (iii) simultaneous control of qubits using numerically optimized microwave pulse shaping. The combination of localized optical control, enabled by the PIC platform, together with selective spin manipulation opens the path to scalable quantum networks on intrachip and interchip platforms.

TI Multimode capacity of atomic-frequency comb quantum memories
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Ensemble-based quantum memories are key to developing multiplexed quantum repeaters, able to overcome the intrinsic rate limitation imposed by finite communication times over long distances. Rare-earth ion doped crystals are main candidates for highly multimode quantum memories, where time, frequency and spatial multiplexing can be exploited to store multiple modes. In this context the atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memory provides large temporal multimode capacity, which can readily be combined with multiplexing in frequency and space. In this article, we derive theoretical formulas for quantifying the temporal multimode capacity of AFC-based memories, for both optical memories with fixed storage time and spin-wave memories with longer storage times and on-demand read out. The temporal multimode capacity is expressed in key memory parameters, such as AFC bandwidth, fixed-delay storage time, memory efficiency, and control field Rabi frequency. Current experiments in europium- and praseodymium-doped Y2SiO5 are analyzed within this theoretical framework, which is also tested with newly acquired data, as prospects for higher temporal capacity in these materials are considered. In addition we consider the possibility of spectral and spatial multiplexing to further increase the mode capacity, with examples given for praseodymium doped Y2SiO5.

TI Improving the speed of variational quantum algorithms for quantum error
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the problem of devising suitable quantum error correction (QEC) procedures for a generic quantum noise acting on a quantum circuit. In general, there is no analytic universal procedure to obtain the encoding and correction unitary gates, and the problem is even harder if the noise is unknown and has to be reconstructed. The existing procedures rely on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) and are very difficult to train since the size of the gradient of the cost function decays exponentially with the number of qubits. We address this problem using a cost function based on the quantum Wasserstein distance of order 1 (QW1). At variance with other quantum distances typically adopted in quantum information processing, QW1 lacks the unitary invariance property which makes it a suitable tool to avoid getting trapped in local minima. Focusing on a simple noise model for which an exact QEC solution is known and can be used as a theoretical benchmark, we run a series of numerical tests that show how, guiding the VQA search through the QW1, can indeed significantly increase both the probability of a successful training and the fidelity of the recovered state, with respect to the results one obtains when using conventional approaches.

TI Picosecond Synchronization System for Quantum Networks
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB The operation of long-distance quantum networks requires photons to be synchronized and must account for length variations of quantum channels. We demonstrate a 200 MHz clock-rate fiber optic-based telecommunication C-band quantum network using off-the-shelf components combined with custom-made electronics. The network is backed by a scalable and fully automated synchronization system with ps-scale timing resolution. Synchronization of the photons is achieved by distributing O-band-wavelength laser pulses between network nodes. Specifically, we distribute photon pairs between three nodes, and measure a reduction of coincidence-to-accidental ratio from 77 to only 42 when the synchronization system is enabled, which permits high-fidelity qubit transmission. Our demonstration sheds light on the role of noise in quantum communication and represents a key step in realizing deployed co-existing classical-quantum networks.

TI Lagrangian Relaxation Based Parallelized Quantum Annealing and Its
   Application in Network Function Virtualization
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Quantum computing is commonly considered one highly efficient computing method with the potential to revolutionize computation technology and solve problems that are currently unsolvable. However, due to the limitation of hardware equipment and an immature experimental base, quantum technology is still in its early stages and is far from achieving the expected performance, especially in solving large-scale complex problems. To break through these barriers, we propose a parallelized quantum annealing algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation. The proposed algorithm divides the large-scale problem into several small problems and then employs multiple quantum computers to solve them. Our proposed approach overcomes the limited number of qubits and allows quantum computing to solve largescale optimization problems. Additionally, we incorporate a local search method to ensure this Lagrangian relaxation based quantum algorithm achieves an optimal solution. We use the proposed parallelized quantum annealing algorithm to solve optimal scheduling problems in network function virtualization networks. The problem is expressed in a linear optimization model that is NP-hard. Our proposed algorithm presents excellent time performance in solving this virtualized network functions scheduling problem, compared with the Lagrangian relaxation based classical algorithm.

SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Since its discovery, the quantum entanglement becomes a promising resource in quantum communication and computation. However, the entanglement is fragile due to the presence of noise in quantum channels. Entanglement purification is a powerful tool to distill high quality entangled states from the low quality entangled states. In this review, we present an overview of entanglement purification, including the basic entanglement purification theory, the entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) with linear optics, EPPs with cross-Kerr nonlinearities, hyperentanglement EPPs, deterministic EPPs, and measurement-based EPPs. We also review experimental progress of EPPs in linear optics. Finally, we give the discussion on potential outlook for the future development of EPPs. This review may pave the way for practical implementations in future long-distance quantum communication and quantum network.

TI Calibrated Decoders for Experimental Quantum Error Correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Arbitrarily long quantum computations require quantum memories that can be repeatedly measured without being corrupted. Here, we preserve the state of a quantum memory, notably with the additional use of flagged error events. All error events were extracted using fast, midcircuit measurements and resets of the physical qubits. Among the error decoders we considered, we introduce a perfect matching decoder that was calibrated from measurements containing up to size-four correlated events. To compare the decoders, we used a partial postselection scheme shown to retain ten times more data than full postselection. We observed logical errors per round of 2.2 +/- 0.1 x 10(-2) (decoded without postselection) and 5.1 +/- 0.7 x 10(-4) (full postselection), which was less than the physical measurement error of 7 x 10(-3) and therefore surpasses a pseudothreshold for repeated logical measurements.

TI Optimizing entanglement generation and distribution using genetic
   algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Long-distance quantum communication via entanglement distribution is of great importance for the quantum internet. However, scaling up to such long distances has proved challenging due to the loss of photons, which grows exponentially with the distance covered. Quantum repeaters could in theory be used to extend the distances over which entanglement can be distributed, but in practice hardware quality is still lacking. Furthermore, it is generally not clear how an improvement in a certain repeater parameter, such as memory quality or attempt rate, impacts the overall network performance, rendering the path toward scalable quantum repeaters unclear. In this work we propose a methodology based on genetic algorithms and simulations of quantum repeater chains for optimization of entanglement generation and distribution. By applying it to simulations of several different repeater chains, including real-world fiber topology, we demonstrate that it can be used to answer questions such as what are the minimum viable quantum repeaters satisfying given network performance benchmarks. This methodology constitutes an invaluable tool for the development of a blueprint for a pan-European quantum internet. We have made our code, in the form of NetSquid simulations and the smart-stopos optimization tool, freely available for use either locally or on high-performance computing centers.

TI Magnetic Molecules as Building Blocks for Quantum Technologies
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Since the initial observation of quantum effects, scientists have worked diligently to understand and harness their potential. Thanks to many pioneers, a level where quantum effects can be exploited is reached. Numerous cutting-edge technologies, such as quantum sensing and quantum computing, are proposed. A common trait in all technologies is the need to manipulate and read out their states; therefore, the quantum characteristics of the building blocks must adhere to strict guidelines. Magnetic Molecules (MMs) are promising candidates. They can be obtained indistinguishably, and the control over their structural and electronic properties, makes them appealing to act as quantum bits or "qubits". MMs can be connected to other units while preserving their coherence properties, enabling the implementation of quantum gates. Furthermore, the low-lying energy levels can be exploited as qudits, which can exist in more than 2 states simultaneously (d > 2), allowing them to hold more information efficiently. The larger electronic/nuclear space in qudits can decrease the number of physical units and enhance computational efficiency, reducing error and making them promise for complex problem-solving. In this perspective article, the physical characteristics of MMs and key achievements that position them as promising candidates for quantum technologies, are described.

TI Quantum algorithm compiler for architectures with semiconductor spin

AB Various architectures have been proposed using a large array of semiconductor spin qubits with high-fidelity and high-speed gate operation. However, no quantum algorithm compilers have been developed which can compile quantum algorithms in a consistent manner for the various architectures, limiting the discussion on evaluating the efficiency of quantum algorithm implementation. Here, we propose Qubit Operation Orchestrator considering qubit Connectivity and Addressability Implementation (QOOCAI), a first quantum algorithm compiler designed for various architectures with semiconductor spin qubits. QOOCAI can compile quantum algorithms to various architectures with different qubit connectivity and addressability, which are important features that affect the efficiency of quantum algorithm implementation. Furthermore, we compile multiple quantum algorithms on different architectures with QOOCAI, showing that higher qubit connectivity and addressability make the algorithm implementation quantitatively more efficient. These findings are crucial for developing semiconductor spin qubit devices, highlighting QOOCAI's potential for improving quantum algorithm implementation efficiency across diverse architectures.

TI Entanglement swapping with spatially multiplexed modes in an
   atomic-ensemble quantum memory in a single excitation regime
SO OPTICA
AB Entanglement swapping (ES) between memory repeater links is critical for establishing quantum networks via quantum repeaters. So far, ES with atomic-ensemble-based memories has not been achieved. Here, we experimentally demonstrate ES between different spatial modes for a cold-atom-ensemble quantum memory via the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller scheme. With a cloud of cold atoms inserted in a cavity, we produce non-classically correlated spin-wave-photon pairs in 12 spatial modes. We then prepare two entangled pairs of spin-wave modes through memory multiplexing. Via single- photon Bell-state measurement on retrieved fields from two spin-wave modes, we project the two remaining modes never entangled previously into an entangled state with a measured concurrence of C = 0.0124 +/- 0.0030. The successful probability of ES in our scheme is increased by three times, compared with that in the scheme without memory multiplexing. Our presented work shows that the generation of entanglement (C > 0) between the remaining spin-wave modes requires the average cross-correlation function of the spin-wave-photon pairs to be >= 30. This presented work represents a significant step toward practical quantum repeaters. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB In the past decade, color centers in silicon carbide (SiC) have emerged as promising platforms for various quantum information technologies. There are three main types of color centers in SiC: silicon-vacancy centers, divacancy centers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. Their spin states can be polarized by laser and controlled by microwave. These spin defects have been applied in quantum photonics, quantum information processing, quantum networks, and quantum sensing. In this review, we first provide a brief overview of the progress in single-color center fabrications for the three types of spin defects, which form the foundation of color center-based quantum technology. We then discuss the achievements in various quantum sensing, such as magnetic field, electric field, temperature, strain, and pressure. Finally, we summarize the current state of fabrications and quantum sensing of spin defects in SiC and provide an outlook for future developments.

TI Quantum Machine Learning: A Review and Case Studies
SO ENTROPY
AB Despite its undeniable success, classical machine learning remains a resource-intensive process. Practical computational efforts for training state-of-the-art models can now only be handled by high speed computer hardware. As this trend is expected to continue, it should come as no surprise that an increasing number of machine learning researchers are investigating the possible advantages of quantum computing. The scientific literature on Quantum Machine Learning is now enormous, and a review of its current state that can be comprehended without a physics background is necessary. The objective of this study is to present a review of Quantum Machine Learning from the perspective of conventional techniques. Departing from giving a research path from fundamental quantum theory through Quantum Machine Learning algorithms from a computer scientist's perspective, we discuss a set of basic algorithms for Quantum Machine Learning, which are the fundamental components for Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. We implement the Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs) on a quantum computer to recognize handwritten digits, and compare its performance to that of its classical counterpart, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, we implement the QSVM on the breast cancer dataset and compare it to the classical SVM. Finally, we implement the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and many classical classifiers on the Iris dataset to compare their accuracies.

AB In recent years, there has been a proliferation of quantum algorithms, primarily due to their exponential speedup over their classical counterparts. Quantum algorithms find applications in various domains, including machine learning, molecular simulation, and cryptography. However, extensive knowledge of linear algebra and quantum mechanics are required to program a quantum computer, which might not be feasible for traditional software programmers. Moreover, current quantum programming paradigm is difficult to scale and integrate quantum circuits to achieve complex functionality. To this end, in this paper, we introduce QHLS, a quantum high-level synthesis (HLS) framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first HLS framework for quantum circuits. The proposed QHLS allows quantum programmers to start with high-level behavioral descriptions (e.g., C, C++) and automatically generate the corresponding quantum circuit; thus, reducing the complexity of programming a quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate the success of QHLS in translating high-level behavioral software programs containing arithmetic, logical, and conditional statements.

TI Symmetry-protected self-correcting quantum memory in three space
   dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Whether self-correcting quantum memories can exist at nonzero temperature in a physically reasonable setting remains a great open problem. It has recently been argued [S. Roberts and S. D. Bartlett, Phys. Rev. X 10, 031041 (2020)] that symmetry-protected topological (SPT) systems in three space dimensions subject to a strong constraint-that the quantum dynamics respect a 1-form symmetry-realize such a quantum memory. We illustrate how this works in Walker-Wang codes, which provide a specific realization of these desiderata. In this setting we show that it is sufficient for the 1-form symmetry to be enforced on a subvolume of the system. This strongly suggests that the SPT character of the state is not essential. We confirm this by constructing an explicit example with a trivial (paramagnetic) bulk that realizes a self-correcting quantum memory. We therefore show that the enforcement of a 1-form symmetry on a measure-zero subvolume of a three-dimensional system can be sufficient to stabilize a self-correcting quantum memory at nonzero temperature.

AB Quantum computers can solve specific complex tasks for which no reasonable-time classical algorithm is known. Quantum computers do however also offer inherent security of data, as measurements destroy quantum states. Using shared entangled states, multiple parties can collaborate and securely compute quantum algorithms. In this paper we propose an approach for distributed quantum machine learning, which allows multiple parties to securely perform computations, without having to reveal their data. We will consider a distributed adder and a distributed distance-based classifier.

TI Quantum teleportation and dynamics of quantum coherence and metrological
   non-classical correlations for open two-qubit systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the dynamics of non-classical correlations and quantum coherence in open quantum systems by employing metrics like local quantum Fisher information, local quantum uncertainty, and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our focus here is on a system of two qubits in two distinct physical situations: the first one when the two qubits are coupled to a cavity field whether the system is closed or open, while the second consists of two qubits immersed in dephasing reservoirs. Our study places significant emphasis on how the evolution of these quantum criterion is influenced by the initial state's purity (whether pure or mixed) and the nature of the environment (whether Markovian or non-Markovian). We observe that a decrease in the initial state's purity corresponds to a reduction in both quantum correlations and quantum coherence, whereas higher purity enhances these quantumness. Furthermore, we establish a quantum teleportation strategy based on the two different physical scenarios. In this approach, the resulting state of the two qubits functions as a quantum channel integrated into a quantum teleportation protocol. We also analyze how the purity of the initial state and the Markovian or non-Markovian regimes impact the quantum teleportation process.

TI Pricing Multiasset Derivatives by Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Pricing a multiasset derivative is an important problem in financial engineering, both theoretically and practically. Although it is suitable to numerically solve partial differential equations to calculate the prices of certain types of derivatives, the computational complexity increases exponentially as the number of underlying assets increases in some classical methods, such as the finite difference method. Therefore, there are efforts to reduce the computational complexity by using quantum computation. However, when solving with naive quantum algorithms, the target derivative price is embedded in the amplitude of one basis of the quantum state, and so an exponential complexity is required to obtain the solution. To avoid the bottleneck, our previous study utilizes the fact that the present price of a derivative can be obtained by its discounted expected value at any future point in time and shows that the quantum algorithm can reduce the complexity. In this article, to make the algorithm feasible to run on a small quantum computer, we use variational quantum simulation to solve the Black-Scholes equation and compute the derivative price from the inner product between the solution and a probability distribution. This avoids the measurement bottleneck of the naive approach and would provide quantum speedup even in noisy quantum computers. We also conduct numerical experiments to validate our method. Our method will be an important breakthrough in derivative pricing using small-scale quantum computers.

TI Full Bell-basis measurement of an atom-photon 2-qubit state and its
   application for quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The efficiency of a Bell-state measurement on photon pairs is bound to 50% due to the number of Bell states that can be distinguished using linear optics. Here we present the implementation of a protocol that allows us to distinguish all four Bell states by the use of a single-ion quantum memory and heralded absorption as state-selective measurement. The protocol is implemented in two steps. First we demonstrate the state-preserving mapping of a photonic qubit onto the quantum memory, verified by the preservation of entanglement in the process. Then we demonstrate the full Bell-state projection between a memory qubit and an incoming photonic qubit, by applying it for atom-to-photon quantum-state teleportation.

TI Quantum state transfer with measurement-based noiseless linear
   amplification
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A partially disembodied quantum state transfer (PDQST) machine is crucial for Gaussian quantum information processing. It integrates Gaussian quantum teleportation and Gaussian quantum cloning machines into a single quantum information platform and therefore enhances the multifunctionality and compatibility of the present quantum information system. However, the standard PDQST machine relies on infinite quantum squeezing, which is unachievable in the practical implementation. In this paper, we propose to use measurement-based noiseless linear amplification (MBNLA) to enhance the performance of the PDQST machine. By moving the standard PDQST machine to be non-deterministic, MBNLA reduces the need for infinite squeezing, enabling perfect quantum teleportation or asymmetric cloning with achievable squeezing levels. The feasibility of the MBNLA-based PDQST machine is analyzed by considering parameters such as noiseless gain and cutoff.

TI Research progress of integrated optical quantum computing*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum computing, based on the inherent superposition and entanglement properties of quantum states, can break through the limits of classical computing power. However, under the present technical conditions, the number of qubits that can be manipulated is still limited. In addition, the preparation of high-precision quantum gates and additional quantum error correction systems requires more auxiliary bits, which leads to extra cost. Therefore, it seems to be a long-term goal to realize a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer.
   The development of analog quantum computing is a transition path that can be used to simulate manybody physics problems. Quantum walk, as the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, is a research hotspot in analog quantum computing. Owing to the unique quantum superposition characteristics, quantum walk exhibits the ballistic transport properties of outward diffusion, so quantum walk provides acceleration in computing power for various algorithms. Based on quantum walk, different computing models are derived to deal with practical physical problems in different fields, such as biology, physics, economics, and computer science.
   A large number of technical routes are devoted to the experiments on realizing quantum walk, including optical fiber networks, superconducting systems, nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and trapped ion atom systems. Among these routes, photons are considered as the reliable information carriers in the experiments on quantum walking due to their controllability, long coherence time. and fast speed.
   Therefore, in this review, we focus on different quantum walk theories and experimental implementations in optical versions, such as traditional optical platforms, optical fiber platforms, and integrated optical quantum platform. In recent years, the rapid development of integrated optical quantum platforms has driven the experiments on quantum walk to move towards the stage of integration and miniaturization, and at the same time, the experimental scale and the number of qubits have gradually increased.
   To this end, we summarize the technological progress of integrated optical quantum computing, including various integrated optical quantum experimental platforms and their applications. Secondly, we specifically discuss the experiment on quantum walk and practical applications based on integrated optical quantum platforms. Finally, we briefly describe other quantum algorithms and corresponding experimental implementations.
   These quantum computing schemes provide computational speedups for specific physical problems. In the future, with the further development of integrated optical quantum technology, along with the increase in the number of controllable qubits and the realization of the supporting quantum error correction system, a largerscale many-body physical system can be constructed to further expand these algorithms and move towards the field of optical quantum computing, a new stage.

SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Currently, quantum hardware is restrained by noises and qubit numbers. Thus, a quantum virtual machine (QVM) that simulates operations of a quantum computer on classical computers is a vital tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms before deploying them on real quantum computers. Various variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been proposed and tested on QVMs to surpass the limitations of quantum hardware. Our goal is to exploit further the VQAs towards practical applications of quantum machine learning (QML) using state-of-the-art quantum computers. In this paper, we first introduce a QVM named Qsun, whose operation is underlined by quantum state wavefunctions. The platform provides native tools supporting VQAs. Especially using the parameter-shift rule, we implement quantum differentiable programming essential for gradient-based optimization. We then report two tests representative of QML: quantum linear regression and quantum neural network.

TI Quantum memory assisted entropic uncertainty relation as a signature of
   quantum phase transition in the spin XXZ model
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Uncertainty principle establishes a remarkable lower bound to predict the measured outcome of two non-commuting observables. In this paper, based on the quantum renormalization-group method, we study the relation between quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation (QMA-EUR) and quantum phase transition (QPT) in the spin XXZ model. The results shows that the entropic uncertainty and the lower bound have similar traits. In addition, we propose two schemes, one is based on quantum discord and classical correlation, the other Holevo quantity and mutual information, both can tighten the bound of EUR in the presence of quantum memory. The tighter the entropy uncertainty relationship is, the higher the accuracy of the predicted results will be. Moreover, we can obtain the optimal lower bound with the help of Holevo quantity and mutual information, which have the best optimization effect in this model. Additionally, we study QPT by virtue of EUR and after a certain number of iterations, finding that the value of QMA-EUR of the whole block-block state can form two saturated values, which are related to two different phases: spin-fluid phase and N & eacute;el phase. Afterwards, we discover that the QMA-EUR of the block-block state obeys the nonanalytic and scaling properties with entropic uncertainty relation exponent associated with correlation length. Our findings show that QMA-EUR deserves to be used as an effective tool in reflecting quantum criticality for more quantum many-body systems and may also shed light on many applications in quantum physics including the quantum key distribution, the detection of QPT and the evaluation of the capacity of quantum computation in critical systems.

AB Quantum memories integrated into nanophotonic silicon devices are a promising platform for large quantum networks and scalable photonic quantum computers. In this context, erbium dopants are particularly attractive, as they combine optical transitions in the telecommunications frequency band with the potential for second-long coherence time. Here, we show that these emitters can be reliably integrated into commercially fabricated low-loss waveguides. We investigate several integration procedures and obtain ensembles of many emitters with an inhomogeneous broadening of <2 GHz and a homogeneous linewidth of <30 kHz. We further observe the splitting of the electronic spin states in a magnetic field up to 9 T that freezes paramagnetic impurities. Our findings are an important step toward long-lived quantum memories that can be fabricated on a wafer-scale using CMOS technology.

TI End-to-end variational quantum sensing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Harnessing quantum correlations can enable sensing beyond classical precision limits, with the realization of such sensors poised for transformative impacts across science and engineering. Real devices, however, face the accumulated impacts of noise and architecture constraints, making the design and success of practical quantum sensors challenging. Numerical and theoretical frameworks to optimize and analyze sensing protocols in their entirety are thus crucial for translating quantum advantage into widespread practice. Here, we present an end-to-end variational framework for quantum sensing protocols, where parameterized quantum circuits and neural networks form trainable, adaptive models for quantum sensor dynamics and estimation, respectively. The framework is general and can be adapted towards arbitrary qubit architectures, as we demonstrate with experimentally-relevant ans & auml;tze for trapped-ion and photonic systems, and enables to directly quantify the impacts that noise and finite data sampling. End-to-end variational approaches can thus underpin powerful design and analysis tools for practical quantum sensing advantage.

TI Quantum discord and its dynamics for multipartite systems
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum discord, one of the famous quantum correlations, has been recently generalized to multipartite systems by Radhakrishnan et al. Here we give analytical solutions of the quantum discord for a family of N-qubit quantum states. For the bipartite system, we derive a zero quantum discord which will remain unchanged under the phase damping channel. For multiparitite systems, it is found that the quantum discord can be classified into three categories and the quantum discord for odd-partite systems can exhibit freezing under the phase damping channel, while the freezing does not exist in the even-partite systems.

TI Ion-photonic frequency qubit correlations for quantum networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Efficiently scaling quantum networks to long ranges requires local processing nodes to perform basic computation and communication tasks. Trapped ions have demonstrated all the properties required for the construction of such a node, storing quantum information for up to 12 min, implementing deterministic high fidelity logic operations on one and two qubits, and ion-photon coupling. While most ions suitable for quantum computing emit photons in visible to near ultraviolet (UV) frequency ranges poorly suited to long-distance fibre optical based networking, recent experiments in frequency conversion provide a technological solution by shifting the photons to frequencies in the telecom band with lower attenuation for fused silica fibres. Encoding qubits in frequency rather than polarization makes them more robust against decoherence from thermal or mechanical noise due to the conservation of energy. To date, ion-photonic frequency qubit entanglement has not been directly shown. Here we demonstrate a frequency encoding ion-photon entanglement protocol in Yb-171(+) with correlations equivalent to 92.4(8)% fidelity using a purpose-built UV hyperfine spectrometer. The same robustness against decoherence precludes our passive optical setup from rotating photonic qubits to unconditionally demonstrate entanglement, however it is sufficient to allow us to benchmark the quality of ion-UV photon correlations prior to frequency conversion to the telecom band.

AB We review the current status of efforts to develop and deploy post-quantum cryptography on the Internet. Then we suggest specific ways in which quantum technologies might be used to enhance cybersecurity in the near future and beyond. We focus on two goals: protecting the secret keys that are used in classical cryptography, and ensuring the trustworthiness of quantum computations. These goals may soon be within reach, thanks to recent progress in both theory and experiment. This progress includes interactive protocols for testing quantumness as well as for performing uncloneable cryptographic computations; and experimental demonstrations of device-independent random number generators, device-independent quantum key distribution, quantum memories, and analog quantum simulators.

TI Quantum neural networks for the discovery and implementation of quantum
   error-correcting codes
SO CHAOS
AB We implement and use quantum neural networks that exploit bit-flip quantum error-correcting codes that correct bit-flip errors in arbitrary logical qubit states. We introduce conjugate layer quantum autoencoders and use them in order to restore states impacted by amplitude damping through the utilization of an approximative four-qubit error-correcting codeword. Our specific implementation avoids barren plateaus of the cost function and improves the training time. Moreover, we propose a strategy that allows one to discover new encryption protocols tailored for specific quantum channels. This is exemplified by learning to generate logical qubits explicitly for the bit-flip channel. Our modified quantum neural networks consistently outperform the standard implementations across all tasks.

TI Progress in integrated and fiber optics for time-bin based quantum
   information processing
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES
AB The development of integrated photonic systems, both on-chip and fiber-based, has transformed quantum photonics by replacing bulky, fragile free-space optical setups with compact, efficient, and robust circuits. Photonic platforms incorporating fiber-connected sources of correlated and entangled photon pairs offer practical advantages, such as operation at room temperature, efficient integration with telecom infrastructure, and compatibility with mature and efficient semiconductor fabrication processes for cost-effective and large-scale optical circuits. The stability and scalability of integrated quantum photonics platforms have facilitated the generation and processing of quantum information in the temporal domain within a single spatial mode. Time-bin encoded states, known for their robustness against decoherence and compatibility with existing fiber-optic infrastructure, have shown to be an efficient paradigm for advanced applications like quantum secure communication, information processing, spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing. This review examines recent advancements in fiber- and chip-based platforms for generating non-classical states and their applications as quantum state processors in the time domain. We discuss the generation of pulsed quantum frequency combs using microring resonators and intra-cavity mode-locked laser schemes, enabling co- and cross-polarized quantum photonic states. Additionally, the versatility of these resonator chips for entanglement generation is emphasized, including two- and multi-photon time-bin entangled schemes. We highlight the development of time-bin entanglement analyzers in fiber architectures, featuring ultrahigh stability and post-selection-free capabilities, which enable precise and efficient characterization of two- and higher-dimensional time-bin entanglement. We also review scalable on-chip schemes for quantum key distribution, demonstrating low quantum bit error rates and compatibility with higher-dimensional quantum communication protocols. Further, methods for enhancing temporal resolution in detection schemes, crucial for time-bin encoding, are presented, such as the time-stretch sampling technique using electro-optic modulation. These innovations, relying on readily available, telecom-based fiber-optic components, provide practical, scalable, and cost-effective solutions for advancing quantum photonic technologies. Looking forward, time-bin encoding is expected to play a pivotal role in the advancement of quantum repeaters, distributed quantum networks, and hybrid light-matter systems, advancing the realization of globally scalable quantum technologies.

TI Deterministic generation and nanophotonic integration of 2D quantum
   emitters for advanced quantum photonic functionalities
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Quantum emitters (QEs) are essential building blocks for quantum applications, such as quantum communication, quantum computing and metrology. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), are promising platforms for scalable QE generation due to their unique properties, including their compatibility with external photonic structures. Advances in defect engineering and strain manipulation enable precise localization of emission sites within these materials, while integration with nanophotonic structures, including cavities and waveguides, enhances photon emission through the Purcell effect. This integration supports quantum functionalities like single-photon routing and spin-photon interactions. Challenges include achieving precise QE placement and emission control, as environmental factors can affect QE purity and indistinguishability. Nonetheless, electrically driven QEs, strain-tunable emission, and the integration of van der Waals magnets present opportunities for compact, scalable quantum devices with on-demand single-photon sources and spin-based quantum memory, positioning 2D QEs as foundational for next-generation quantum devices.

TI Learning Phase-Flip Noise Using Balanced Datasets and Hybrid Models for
   Noise Classification in Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing promises unparalleled computational power, but its practical implementation is hampered by quantum noise, which affects the reliability of quantum circuits. This paper addresses the critical challenge of noise classification in NISQ 'Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum' algorithms, focusing on bit flip, phase flip, and depolarising noise. We introduce a novel balanced quantum noise dataset generated through random quantum circuits, ensuring comprehensive coverage of various noise types and intensities. Additionally, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model that achieves over 85% accuracy in classifying bit flip and depolarising noise, and perfect accuracy in detecting phase flip noise under our simulation conditions. Our approach builds on a dual quantum architecture, utilising IBM Qiskit for dataset generation and Pennylane for model training. These simulation results indicate potential improvements for noise-aware modelling and error mitigation; however, we emphasise that translating this performance to physical devices requires further validation due to hardware-specific decoherence and calibration effects.

TI Qutrit Randomized Benchmarking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Ternary quantum processors offer significant potential computational advantages over conventional qubit technologies, leveraging the encoding and processing of quantum information in qutrits (three-level systems). To evaluate and compare the performance of such emerging quantum hardware it is essential to have robust benchmarking methods suitable for a higher-dimensional Hilbert space. We demonstrate extensions of industry standard randomized benchmarking (RB) protocols, developed and used extensively for qubits, suitable for ternary quantum logic. Using a superconducting five-qutrit processor, we find an average single-qutrit process infidelity of 3.8 x 10(-3). Through interleaved RB, we characterize a few relevant gates, and employ simultaneous RB to fully characterize crosstalk errors. Finally, we apply cycle benchmarking to a two-qutrit CSUM gate and obtain a two-qutrit process fidelity of 0.85. Our results present and demonstrate RB-based tools to characterize the performance of a qutrit processor, and a general approach to diagnose control errors in future qudit hardware.

TI Quantum computer error structure probed by quantum error correction
   syndrome measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB With quantum devices rapidly approaching qualities and scales needed for fault tolerance, the validity of simplified error models underpinning the study of quantum error correction needs to be experimentally evaluated. In this work, we have assessed the performance of IBM superconducting quantum computer devices implementing heavy-hexagon code syndrome measurements with circuit sizes up to 23 qubits, against the error assumptions underpinning code threshold calculations. Circuit operator change rate statistics in the presence of depolarizing and biased noise were modeled using analytic functions of error model parameters. Data from 16 repeated syndrome measurement cycles were found to be inconsistent with a uniform depolarizing noise model, with slightly improved fits found with biased and inhomogeneous noise models. Spatial-temporal correlations investigated via Z stabilizer measurements revealed significant temporal correlation in detection events. These results highlight the nontrivial structure that may be present in the noise of quantum error correction circuits, revealed by operator measurement statistics, and support the development of noise-tailored codes and decoders to adapt.

TI Realizing repeated quantum error correction in a distance-three surface
   code
SO NATURE
AB Quantum computers hold the promise of solving computational problems that are intractable using conventional methods(1). For fault-tolerant operation, quantum computers must correct errors occurring owing to unavoidable decoherence and limited control accuracy(2). Here we demonstrate quantum error correction using the surface code, which is known for its exceptionally high tolerance to errors(3-6). Using 17 physical qubits in a superconducting circuit, we encode quantum information in a distance-three logical qubit, building on recent distance-two error-detection experiments(7-9). In an error-correction cycle taking only 1.1 mu s, we demonstrate the preservation of four cardinal states of the logical qubit. Repeatedly executing the cycle, we measure and decode both bit-flip and phase-flip error syndromes using a minimum-weight perfect-matching algorithm in an error-model-free approach and apply corrections in post-processing. We find a low logical error probability of 3% per cycle when rejecting experimental runs in which leakage is detected. The measured characteristics of our device agree well with a numerical model. Our demonstration of repeated, fast and high-performance quantum error-correction cycles, together with recent advances in ion traps(10), support our understanding that fault-tolerant quantum computation will be practically realizable.

TI Entropic witness for quantum memory in open system dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The dynamics of open quantum systems are often modeled by non-Markovian processes that account for memory effects arising from interactions with the environment. It is well known that the memory provided by the environment can be classical or quantum in nature. Remarkably, the quantumness of the memory can be witnessed locally by measurements on the open system alone, without requiring access to the environment. However, existing witnesses are computationally challenging for systems beyond qubits, which severely limits their practical applicability. In this work, we present a tractable criterion for quantum memory based on the von Neumann entropy, which is easily computable for systems of any dimension. Using this witness, we investigate the nature of memory in a class of physically motivated finite-dimensional qudit dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that this criterion is also suitable for detecting quantum memory in continuous-variable systems. As an illustrative example, we analyze non-Markovian Gaussian dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator.

AB Once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is built, confidential information that is communicated today can be decrypted and exposed. Key exchange methods currently used can then be broken and the key used to protect the data can be recovered. Depending on the duration for which information needs to remain confidential, quantum-safe solutions have to be used now to protect data transmitted today. In this paper, we review recent advances in integrating the combination of two different quantum-safe solutions, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), in existing protocols. We also combine classical cryptography, PQC and QKD to securely exchange a key that remains secure even if only one of the three key exchange methods is secure. This is one of the first steps to update existing communication methods such that they remain secure even if only one of PQC, QKD or classical cryptography is secure.

However, implementation of more complex quantum information protocols with many qubits still remains a critical challenge for realization of practical programmability in silicon devices. In this study, we present a computational investigation of entanglement-based quantum information applications implemented on an electrically defined quantum dot structure in silicon. Using in-house multi-scale simulations based on tight-binding calculations augmented with classical physics with bulk properties, we model a five quantum dot system that can create up to five electron spin qubits, and discuss details of control engineering needed to implement single-qubit rotations and two-qubit logic operations in a programmable manner. Using these elementary operations, we design a five-qubit quantum teleportation protocol and computationally verify its end-to-end operation including a simple but clear analysis on how the designed circuit can be affected by charge noise. With engineering details that are not well uncovered by experiments, our results demonstrate the advanced programmability of silicon quantum dot systems, delivering the practical guidelines for potential designs of quantum information processes based on electrically defined silicon quantum dot structures.

   in Urban Communications: A Comprehensive Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Information security faces unprecedented challenges in the digital age, particularly in the face of cyber threats and the emergence of quantum computing. This research examines QKD as a solution for secure communications in urban fiber networks. The study analyzes QKD protocols, including BB84 and Twin-Field QKD, implementing a 46-node metropolitan quantum network and key distribution over distances greater than 1002 kilometers. Various transmission media, such as multicore optical fibers and free-space communication, were evaluated, demonstrating high-capacity quantum communication with advanced noise mitigation techniques. The results reveal significant advances in quantum communication security, highlighting the potential of QKD to provide theoretically secure key distribution based on quantum mechanical principles. The research addresses challenges such as transmission loss, environmental disturbances, and network scalability, laying the groundwork for future implementations in metropolitan networks. This work contributes significantly to the standardization of evaluation protocols and metrics, which is crucial for the global adoption of QKD in a world increasingly dependent on cybersecurity, especially in developing smart cities.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum implementation of conventional decoder logic with
   enable input
SO IET CIRCUITS DEVICES & SYSTEMS
AB Decoherence is the greatest obstacle to the physical realization of scalable quantum computer, jeopardises coherent superposition of the qubit, and makes qubit extremely fragile. Quantum Error Correction Code (QECC), and Fault-tolerant quantum computation collectively could protect qubit and improve scalability. On the other hand, the conventional logic circuit is no more useful in quantum computing due to much difference from quantum logic. However, quantum computer has to perform classical tasks which can be addressed by translating to its equivalent quantum algorithm. Herein, zero-garbage-based reversible and fault-tolerant quantum circuit for 1 : 2, and 2 : 4 Decoder with enable signal using Clifford + T-group are proposed. Further, the design approach to implement n : 2(n) decoder on fault-tolerant quantum logic in linear T - depth is extended. Besides, performance parameters likely T - count, T - depth, and garbage output have been evaluated for n : 2(n) decoder.

TI Preparing remote states for genuine quantum networks
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum networks typically comprise quantum channels, repeaters, and end nodes. Remote state preparation (RSP) allows one end node to prepare the states of the other end nodes remotely. While quantum discord has recently been recognized as necessary for RSP, it does not guarantee the practical implementation of RSP in quantum networks surpasses any classical method. Herein, we theoretically introduce and experimentally study a quantum resource that we call the RSP capability. This resource validates all the static and dynamic elements required to enable genuine quantum networks where the RSP's implementation can outperform any classical emulation of entanglement- and qubit-unitaries-free strategies, including the static resources of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs and the dynamic resources of quantum channels and repeaters. Our experiment measures the RSP capability to demonstrate the transition between classical and nonclassical RSP depending on the photon-pair qualities. It shows that quantum discord does not confirm a nonclassical RSP, but the RSP capability does. These results help reveal the quantum advantages that emerge when networking RSP is in play.

TI Optimized Distribution of Entanglement Graph States in Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Building large-scale quantum computers, essential to demonstrating quantum advantage, is a key challenge. Quantum networks can help address this challenge by enabling the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Moreover, unlike classical systems, quantum networks can enable fully secured long-distance communication. Thus, quantum networks lie at the heart of the success of future quantum information technologies. In quantum networks, multipartite entangled states distributed over the network help implement and support many quantum network applications for communications, sensing, and computing. Our work focuses on developing optimal techniques to generate and distribute multipartite entanglement states efficiently. Prior works on generating general multipartite entanglement states have focused on the objective of minimizing the number of maximally entangled pairs while ignoring the heterogeneity of the network nodes and links as well as the stochastic nature of underlying processes. In this work, we develop a hypergraph-based linear programming framework that delivers optimal (under certain assumptions) generation schemes for general multipartite entanglement represented by graph states, under the network resources, decoherence, and fidelity constraints, while considering the stochasticity of the underlying processes. We illustrate our technique by developing generation schemes for the special cases of path and tree graph states and discuss optimized generation schemes for more general classes of graph states. Using extensive simulations over a quantum network simulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform prior known schemes by up to orders of magnitude.

TI Multi-qubit DC gates over an inhomogeneous array of quantum dots
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The prospect of large-scale quantum computation with an integrated chip of spin qubits is imminent as technology improves. This invites us to think beyond the traditional two-qubit-gate framework and consider a naturally supported 'instruction set' of multi-qubit gates. In this work, we systematically study such a family of multi-qubit gates implementable over an array of quantum dots by DC evolution. A useful representation of the computational Hamiltonian is proposed for a dot-array with strong spin-orbit coupling effects, distinctive g-factor tensors and varying interdot couplings. Adopting a perturbative treatment, we model a multi-qubit DC gate by the first-order dynamics in the qubit frame and develop a detailed formalism for decomposing the resulting gate, estimating and optimizing the coherent gate errors with appropriate local phase shifts for arbitrary array connectivity. Examples of such multi-qubit gates and their applications in quantum error correction and quantum algorithms are also explored, demonstrating their potential advantage in accelerating complex tasks and reducing overall errors.

TI Enhanced Network Security Protocols for the Quantum Era: Combining
   Classical and Post-Quantum Cryptography, and Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB The emergence of quantum computing poses a threat to classical cryptography algorithms, necessitating a shift to quantum secure cryptography. Hybrid protocols combining at least one classical and one quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm are becoming the standard for securing communications. In this work, we present our novel solution for integrating three different cryptographic assumptions (two of them quantum-resistant) into hybrid network security protocols, ensuring that three different cryptographic assumptions must be broken before the protocol becomes vulnerable. Our solution allows for a seamless integration of classical and post-quantum (PQ) cryptography, and quantum key distribution (QKD) into existing network security protocols (e.g., TLS, IPsec) without any major modifications to the protocols themselves. This crypto-agility ensures the mitigation of some of the most well known challenges of both PQ cryptography and QKD. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of such triple-hybrid network security protocols, showing non-substantial decrease in performance and almost no added packet overhead compared to state of the art protocols. In exchange, we pave the way towards next generation networks where the potential of new quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes can be leveraged in a dynamic and agile fashion, thus fostering a new era of unbreakable communication systems.

AB Quantum computing roadmaps predict the availability of 10,000-qubit devices within the next 3-5 years. With projected two-qubit error rates of 0.1%, these systems will enable certain operations under quantum error correction (QEC) using lightweight codes, offering significantly improved fidelities compared to the NISQ era. However, the high qubit cost of QEC codes like the surface code (especially at near-threshold physical error rates) limits the error correction capabilities of these devices. In this emerging era of Early Fault Tolerance (EFT), it will be essential to use QEC resources efficiently and focus on applications that derive the greatest benefit.
   In this work, we investigate the implementation of Variational Quantum Algorithms in the EFT regime (EFT-VQA). We explore the ideas of partial quantum error correction (pQEC), a strategy that error-corrects Clifford operations while performing R-Z (theta) rotations via magic state injection instead of the more expensive T-state distillation, and adapt it to VQAs. Our results show that pQEC can improve VQA fidelities by 9.27x over standard approaches. Furthermore, we propose architectural optimizations that reduce circuit latency by similar to 2x, and achieve qubit packing efficiency of 66% in the EFT regime.

AB Photons are natural carriers of high-dimensional quantum information, and, in principle, can benefit from higher quantum information capacity and noise resilience. However, schemes to generate the resources required for high-dimensional quantum computing have so far been lacking in linear optics. Here, we show how to generate GHZ states in arbitrary dimensions and numbers of photons using linear optical circuits described by Fourier transform matrices. Combining our results with recent schemes for qudit Bell measurements, we show that universal linear optical quantum computing can be performed in arbitrary dimensions.

AB The possibility of a quantum computer threatens modern public key cryptography. Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are designed to protect sensitive data and communications also against an attacker equipped with a quantum computer. National Institute of Standards and Technology is standardizing postquantum algorithms that could replace currently used public key cryptographic algorithms in key exchange and digital signatures. Lattice-based cryptography is one of the post-quantum algorithm groups with the biggest potential. Cryptography libraries are used by developers in all kinds of different solutions, but currently the availability of post-quantum algorithms in open-source libraries is very limited. Implementing post-quantum algorithms into a software library involves a multitude of challenges. We integrated three lattice-based postquantum algorithms into a fork of Crypto++, a C++ cryptography library. We analyzed challenges in the implementation process and the performance and security of the fork. Especially the complex mathematical ideas behind the algorithms make implementation difficult. The performance of the algorithms was satisfactory but analyzing the security of the implementation in more detail is needed.

TI Convolutional-Neural-Network-Based Hexagonal Quantum Error Correction
   Decoder
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Topological quantum error-correcting codes are an important tool for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers. Heavy hexagonal coding is a new class of quantum error-correcting coding that assigns physical and auxiliary qubits to the vertices and edges of a low-degree graph. The layout of heavy hexagonal codes is particularly suitable for superconducting qubit architectures to reduce frequency conflicts and crosstalk. Although various topological code decoders have been proposed, constructing the optimal decoder remains challenging. Machine learning is an effective decoding scheme for topological codes, and in this paper, we propose a machine learning heavy hexagonal decoder based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain the decoding threshold. We test our method on heavy hexagonal codes with code distance of three, five, and seven, and increase it to five, seven, and nine by optimizing the RestNet network architecture. Our results show that the decoder thresholding accuracies are about 0.57% and 0.65%, respectively, which are about 25% higher than the conventional decoding scheme under the depolarizing noise model. The proposed decoding architecture is also applicable to other topological code families.

TI Long-Lived Quantum Memory Enabling Atom-Photon Entanglement over 101 km
   of Telecom Fiber
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Long-distance entanglement distribution is the key task for quantum networks, enabling applications such as secure communication and distributed quantum computing. In this work, we take a crucial step toward this task by sharing entanglement over long optical fibers between a single 87Rb atom and a single photon. High fidelity of the atomic state could be maintained during long flight times through such fibers by prolonging the coherence time of the single atom to 10 ms based on encoding in long-lived states. In addition, the attenuation in the fibers is minimized by converting the wavelength of the photon to the telecom S band via polarization-preserving quantum frequency conversion. These improvements enable us to observe entanglement between the atomic quantum memory and the emitted photons transmitted through standard spooled telecom fibers with a length of 101 km with a fidelity of 70.8 +/- 2.4%. This fidelity is comparable to recent demonstrations over 20 km, despite the channel loss now significantly exceeding 20 dB. In fact, now the reduction in fidelity is due to detector dark counts rather than loss of coherence of the atom or photon, proving the suitability of our platform to realize city-to-city-scale quantum network links.

TI Quantum optical memory for entanglement distribution
SO OPTICA
AB Optical photons are powerful carriers of quantum information, which can be delivered in free space by satellites or in fibers on the ground over long distances. Entanglement of quantum states over long distances can empower quantum computing, quantum communications, and quantum sensing. Quantum optical memories are devices designed to store quantum information in the form of stationary excitations, such as atomic coherence, and are capable of coherently mapping these excitations to flying qubits. Quantum memories can effectively store and manipulate quantum states, making them indispensable elements in future long-distance quantum networks. Over the past two decades, quantum optical memories with high fidelities, high efficiencies, long storage times, and promising multiplexing capabilities have been developed, especially at the single-photon level. In this review, we introduce the working principles of commonly used quantum memory protocols and summarize the recent advances in quantum memory demonstrations. We also offer a vision for future quantum optical memory devices that may enable entanglement distribution over long distances.

TI Unconditional advantage of noisy qudit quantum circuits over biased
   threshold circuits in constant depth
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The rapid evolution of quantum devices fuels concerted efforts to experimentally establish quantum advantage over classical computing. Many demonstrations of quantum advantage, however, rely on computational assumptions and face verification challenges. Furthermore, steady advances in classical algorithms and machine learning make the issue of provable, practically demonstrable quantum advantage a moving target. In this work, we unconditionally demonstrate that parallel quantum computation can exhibit greater computational power than previously recognized. We prove that polynomial-size biased threshold circuits of constant depth-which model neural networks with tunable expressivity-fail to solve certain problems solvable by small constant-depth quantum circuits with local gates, for values of the bias that allow quantifiably large computational power. Additionally, we identify a family of problems that are solvable in constant depth by a universal quantum computer over prime-dimensional qudits with bounded connectivity, but remain hard for polynomial-size biased threshold circuits. We thereby bridge the foundational theory of non-local games in higher dimensions with computational advantage on emerging devices operating on a wide range of physical platforms. Finally, we show that these quantum advantages are robust to noise across all prime qudit dimensions with all-to-all connectivity, enhancing their practical appeal.

TI Reusability report: Optimizing T count in general quantum circuits with
   AlphaTensor-Quantum
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, with possible applications in areas such as drug discovery and high-energy physics. However, the practical implementation of quantum computation is hindered by the complexity of executing quantum circuits on hardware. In particular, minimizing the number of T gates is crucial for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. AlphaTensor-Quantum1 is a reinforcement-learning-based method designed to optimize the T count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task. Although it has demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on benchmark quantum arithmetic circuits, its applicability has so far been restricted to specific circuit families, requiring separate, time-intensive training for each new application. This report reproduces some of the key results of the original work and extends AlphaTensor-Quantum's capabilities to simplify random quantum circuits with varying qubit counts, eliminating the need for retraining on new circuits. Our experiments show that a general agent trained on five- to eight-qubit circuits achieves greater T-count reduction than previous methods for a large fraction of quantum circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a general agent trained on circuits with varying qubit numbers outperforms agents trained on fixed qubit numbers, highlighting the method's generalizability and its potential for broader quantum circuit optimization tasks.

TI Accurate Image Multi-Class Classification Neural Network Model with
   Quantum Entanglement Approach
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has attracted significant research attention over the last decade. Multiple models have been developed to demonstrate the practical applications of the quantum properties. In this study, we first demonstrate that the previously proposed quanvolutional neural network (QuanvNN) using a randomly generated quantum circuit improves the image classification accuracy of a fully connected neural network against the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research 10 class (CIFAR-10) dataset from 92.0% to 93.0% and from 30.5% to 34.9%, respectively. We then propose a new model referred to as a Neural Network with Quantum Entanglement (NNQE) using a strongly entangled quantum circuit combined with Hadamard gates. The new model further improves the image classification accuracy of MNIST and CIFAR-10 to 93.8% and 36.0%, respectively. Unlike other QML methods, the proposed method does not require optimization of the parameters inside the quantum circuits; hence, it requires only limited use of the quantum circuit. Given the small number of qubits and relatively shallow depth of the proposed quantum circuit, the proposed method is well suited for implementation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. While promising results were obtained by the proposed method when applied to the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a test against a more complicated German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset degraded the image classification accuracy from 82.2% to 73.4%. The exact causes of the performance improvement and degradation are currently an open question, prompting further research on the understanding and design of suitable quantum circuits for image classification neural networks for colored and complex data.

TI On the Stochastic Analysis of a Quantum Entanglement Distribution Switch
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we study a quantum entanglement distribution switch that serves k users in a star topology. We model variants of the system as continuous-time Markov chains and obtain expressions for switch capacity, expected number of qubits stored in memory at the switch, and the quantum memory occupancy distribution. We obtain a number of analytic results for systems in which measurements are imperfect, the links are homogeneous or heterogeneous and for switches that have an infinite or finite number of quantum memories or buffers. In addition, we model the effect of decoherence of quantum states and associated cutoff times on their storage using a simple model. From numerical observations, we discover that decoherence-associated cutoff times have little effect on capacity and expected number of stored qubits for homogeneous systems. For heterogeneous systems, especially those operating near the boundaries of their stability regions (i.e., systems that are nearly unstable), buffer size and decoherence can have significant effects on performance metrics. We also learn that in general, increasing the buffer size from one to two qubits per link is advantageous to most systems, whereas increasing the buffer size further yields diminishing returns. The analytical results obtained in this work can serve as a useful guide toward the future design of quantum switches-e.g., by allowing the designer to determine how many quantum memories suffice for a given number of users-as well as provide valuable insight on the performance of these and similar devices.

TI Synchronization and Phase Shaping of Single Photons with High-Efficiency
   Quantum Memory
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Time synchronization and phase shaping of single photons both play fundamental roles in quantum information applications that rely on multi-photon quantum interference. Phase shaping typically requires separate modulators with extra insertion losses. Here, we develop an all-optical built-in phase modulator for single photons using a quantum memory. The fast phase modulation of a single photon in both step and linear manner are verified by observing the efficient quantum-memory-assisted Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between two single photons, where the anti-coalescence effect of bosonic photon pairs is demonstrated. The developed phase modulator may push forward the practical quantum information applications.

TI Data re-uploading with a single qudit
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum two-level systems, i.e., qubits, form the basis for most quantum machine learning approaches that have been proposed throughout the years. However, higher dimensional quantum systems constitute a promising alternative and are increasingly explored in theory and practice. Here, we explore the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems, so-called qudits, for their use in a quantum machine learning context. We formulate classification and regression problems with the data re-uploading approach and demonstrate that a quantum circuit operating on a single qudit is able to successfully learn highly non-linear decision boundaries of classification problems such as the MNIST digit recognition problem. We demonstrate that the performance strongly depends on the relation between the qudit states representing the labels and the structure of labels in the training data set. Such a bias can lead to substantial performance improvement over qubit-based circuits in cases where the labels, the qudit states, and the operators employed to encode the data are well-aligned. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of the choice of the elementary operators and show that a squeezing operator is necessary to achieve good performances. We also show that there exists a trade-off for qudit systems between the number of circuit-generating operators in each processing layer and the total number of layers needed to achieve a given accuracy. Finally, we compare classification results from numerically exact simulations and their equivalent implementation on actual IBM quantum hardware. The findings of our work support the notion that qudit-based algorithms exhibit attractive traits and constitute a promising route to increasing the computational capabilities of quantum machine learning approaches.

TI A Quantum Algorithm for Boolean Functions Processing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Detecting junta variables is a critical issue in Boolean function analysis, circuit design optimization, and machine learning feature selection. In this paper, we investigate a novel quantum computation algorithm based on the Mz operator. The algorithm takes in an unknown oracle concealing a Boolean function with n variables and an unknown input state, which can be quantum or classical. The input state can be complete or incomplete quantum basis states, and it can be a weighted or uniform superposition of basis states. The proposed approach determines whether a given variable is a junta with a time cost of O (2 /& varepsilon; (2) ) and a memory cost of 2n+ 6. The algorithm is analyzed and experimentally implemented using the Qiskit simulator and IBM's real quantum computer. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved a quantum supremacy ratio 6300% higher than that of the classical method when verifying junta variables for Boolean functions with 12 variables. The results suggest that the proposed quantum method can verify junta variables in scenarios beyond the capabilities of current classical or quantum methods.

TI Establishing of quantum entanglement among three atomic nodes via
   spontanenous Raman scattering
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum entanglement is an essential quantum resource. With the development of quantum information science, quantum network consisting of quantum nodes and quantum channels has attracted extensive attention. The development of quantum information network requires the capability of generating, storing and distributing quantum entanglement among multiple quantum nodes. It is significant to construct the quantum information, and it has very important applications in the distributed quantum computation and quantum internet. Here we propose a simple and feasible scheme to deterministically entangle three distant atomic ensembles via the interference and feedforward network of the light-atom mixed entanglement. Firstly, three atomic ensembles placed at three remote nodes in a quantum network are prepared into the mixed entangled state of light and atomic ensembles via the spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) process. Then, the first and second Stokes optical field are interfered on an R-1:T-1 optical beam splitter (BS1), and one of the output optical fields from the first optical beam splitter is interfered with the third Stokes field on the second R-2:T-2 optical beam splitter (BS2). The quantum fluctuations of the amplitude and phase quadratures of these three output optical fields from BS1 and BS2 are detected by three sets of balanced homodyne detectors, respectively. Finally, the detected signals of the amplitude and phase quadratures are fed to the three atomic ensembles via the radio frequency coils to establish the entanglement among three remote atomic ensembles. At the user-controlled time, three read optical pulses can be applied to these three atomic ensembles to convert the stored entangled state from the atomic spin waves into the anti-Stokes optical fields via the SRS process. According to the tripartite inseparability criterion, the correlation variance combinations of these three anti-Stokes optical fields can be used to verify the performance of entanglement of three atomic ensembles. This scheme can be extended to larger-scale quantum information network with different physical systems and more atomic nodes. Moreover, the entanglement distillation can be combined with this scheme to realize the entanglement among longer distance quantum nodes.

TI Quantum-Resilient Cryptography: A Survey on Classical and Quantum
   Algorithms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The rapid advancement of quantum computing is poised to disrupt the foundations of classical cryptography, calling into question the long-term security of widely used algorithms. Classical cryptographic techniques, including symmetric key algorithms like DES, 3DES and AES, asymmetric schemes such as RSA and ECC, and essential primitives like hash functions and the One-Time Pad (OTP), have been the cornerstone of secure digital communication since their inception. However, the progress of quantum algorithms, spearheaded by Shor and Grover, poses serious threats to these schemes, necessitating a shift in cryptographic design. This paper presents an all-encompassing review of classical cryptographic techniques, along with emerging post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms that have been developed to provide quantum-resistant security while maintaining compatibility with classical infrastructure. Concurrently, the quantum key distribution (QKD) introduces a radical shift, leveraging quantum mechanics principles to attain unconditional security. This paper elaborates both Discrete Variable (DV-QKD) and Continuous Variable (CV-QKD) approaches, highlighting their operational principles and security models. By providing a relative analysis of classical cryptographic methods, PQC, and quantum cryptography, including QKD protocols and quantum-safe primitives, this work targets to provide a consolidated insight into modern cryptographic landscape and further research toward secure communication in the quantum era.

TI Quantum memory and coherence dynamics of two dipole-coupled qubits
   interacting with two cavity fields under decoherence effect
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB This paper investigates the intrinsic decoherence effect on quantum memory and coherence dynamics of two dipole-coupled qubits in a non-degenerate bimodel cavity. Entropic uncertainty, entropy, and concurrence are utilized to examine the dynamics of quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations, mixedness, and entanglement. The results indicate that the nonlinear interactions between the two qubits and the cavity generate quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty, mixedness, and entanglement, which are reliant not only on the qubit-qubit interaction but also on the intrinsic decoherence and coherence intensity of the initial two-mode cavity states. For specific values of the dipole-dipole interaction, non-classical correlations can be enhanced By reducing the initial intensity coherence, the stability of the quantum memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations, as well as the two-qubit mixedness of the intrinsic decoherence, are accelerated.

TI Flexible Threshold Quantum Homomorphic Encryption on Quantum Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Currently, most quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) schemes only allow a single evaluator (server) to accomplish computation tasks on encrypted data shared by the data owner (user). In addition, the quantum computing capability of the evaluator and the scope of quantum computation it can perform are usually somewhat limited, which significantly reduces the flexibility of the scheme in quantum network environments. In this paper, we propose a novel (t,n)-threshold QHE (TQHE) network scheme based on the Shamir secret sharing protocol, which allows k(t <= k <= n) evaluators to collaboratively perform evaluation computation operations on each qubit within the shared encrypted sequence. Moreover, each evaluator, while possessing the ability to perform all single-qubit unitary operations, is able to perform arbitrary single-qubit gate computation task assigned by the data owner. We give a specific (3, 5)-threshold example, illustrating the scheme's correctness and feasibility, and simulate it on IBM quantum computing cloud platform. Finally, it is shown that the scheme is secure by analyzing encryption/decryption private keys, ciphertext quantum state sequences during transmission, plaintext quantum state sequence, and the result after computations on the plaintext quantum state sequence.

AB The simulation of quantum programs by classical computers is a critical endeavor for several reasons: it provides proof-of-concept validation of quantum algorithms; it provides opportunities to experiment with new programming abstractions suitable for the quantum domain; and most significantly it is a way to explore the elusive boundary at which a quantum advantage may materialize. Here, we show that traditional techniques of symbolic evaluation and partial evaluation yield surprisingly efficient classical simulations for some instances of textbook quantum algorithms that include the Deutsch, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Grover, and Shor's algorithms. The success of traditional partial evaluation techniques in this domain is due to one simple insight: the quantum bits used in these algorithms can be modeled by a symbolic boolean variable while still keeping track of the correlations due to superposition and entanglement. More precisely, the system of constraints generated over the symbolic variables contains all the necessary quantum correlations and hence the answer to the quantum algorithms. With a few programming tricks explained in the paper, quantum circuits with millions of gates can be symbolically executed in seconds. Paradoxically, other circuits with as few as a dozen gates take exponential time. We reflect on the significance of these results in the conclusion.

TI Detecting Tripartite Steering via Quantum Entanglement
SO ENTROPY
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a kind of powerful nonlocal quantum resource in quantum information processing such as quantum cryptography and quantum communication. Many criteria have been proposed in the past few years to detect steerability, both analytically and numerically, for bipartite quantum systems. We propose effective criteria for tripartite steerability and genuine tripartite steerability of three-qubit quantum states by establishing connections between the tripartite steerability (resp. genuine tripartite steerability) and the tripartite entanglement (resp. genuine tripartite entanglement) of certain corresponding quantum states. From these connections, tripartite steerability and genuine tripartite steerability can be detected without using any steering inequalities. The "complex cost" of determining tripartite steering and genuine tripartite steering can be reduced by detecting the entanglement of the newly constructed states in the experiment. Detailed examples are given to illustrate the power of our criteria in detecting the (genuine) tripartite steerability of tripartite states.

TI Nonlinear protocol for high-dimensional quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bell measurements, which allow entanglement between uncorrelated distant particles, play a central role in quantum communication. Indeed, sharing, measuring, and creating entanglement lie at the core of various protocols, such as entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation. While for optical qubit systems a Bell measurement can be implemented using only linear components, the same result is no longer true for highdimensional states, where one has to consider either auxiliary photons or nonlinear processes. Here, inspired by the latter approach, we propose a protocol for high-dimensional quantum teleportation based on nonlinear techniques. Moreover, we discuss the practical implementation of our proposed setup in the case of path-encoded qutrits, where nonlinear effects arise from sum-frequency generation. Finally, we compute the fidelity between quantum states to benchmark the validity of our model under the presence of crosstalk noise. Our approach is deterministic, versatile, and does not rely on the use of auxiliary photons, thus paving the way towards the practical implementation of quantum networks based on nonlinear effects.

TI Dynamical-invariant-based holonomic quantum gates: Theory and experiment
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Among existing approaches to holonomic quantum computing, the adiabatic holonomic quantum gates (HQGs) suffer errors due to decoherence, while the non-adiabatic HQGs either require additional Hilbert spaces or are difficult to scale. Here, we report a systematic, scalable approach based on dynamical invariants to realize HQGs without using additional Hilbert spaces. While presenting the theoretical framework of our approach, we design and experimentally evaluate single-qubit and two-qubits HQGs for the nuclear magnetic resonance system. The single-qubit gates acquire average fidelity 0.9972 by randomized benchmarking, and the controlled-NOT gate acquires fidelity 0.9782 by quantum process tomography. Our approach is also platform-independent, and thus may open a way to large-scale holonomic quantum computation.

TI Constructing quantum circuits with global gates
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB There are various gate sets that can be used to describe a quantum computation. A particularly popular gate set in the literature on quantum computing consists of arbitrary single-qubit gates and two-qubit CNOT gates. A CNOT gate is however not always the natural multi-qubit interaction that can be implemented on a given physical quantum computer, necessitating a compilation step that transforms these CNOT gates to the native gate set. An especially interesting case where compilation is necessary is for ion trap quantum computers, where the natural entangling operation can act on more than two qubits and can even act globally on all qubits at once. This calls for an entirely different approach to constructing efficient circuits. In this paper we study the problem of converting a given circuit that uses two-qubit gates to one that uses global gates. Our three main contributions are as follows. First, we find an efficient algorithm for transforming an arbitrary circuit consisting of Clifford gates and arbitrary phase gates into a circuit consisting of single-qubit gates and a number of global interactions proportional to the number of non-Clifford phases present in the original circuit. Second, we find a general strategy to transform a global gate that targets all qubits into one that targets only a subset of the qubits. This approach scales linearly with the number of qubits that are not targeted, in contrast to the exponential scaling reported in (Maslov and Nam 2018 New J. Phys. 20 033018). Third, we improve on the number of global gates required to synthesise an arbitrary n-qubit Clifford circuit from the 12n - 18 reported in (Maslov and Nam 2018 New J. Phys. 20 033018) to 6n - 8.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB This paper presents a hybrid classical-quantum program for density estimation and supervised classification. The program is implemented as a quantum circuit in a high-dimensional quantum computer simulator. We show that the proposed quantum protocols allow to estimate probability density functions and to make predictions in a supervised learning manner. This model can be generalized to find expected values of density matrices in high-dimensional quantum computers. Experiments on various data sets are presented. Results show that the proposed method is a viable strategy to implement supervised classification and density estimation in a high-dimensional quantum computer.

TI Quantum Cryptography for Future Networks Security: A Systematic Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Cryptography (QC) revolutionizes network communication - harnessing principles of quantum mechanics to enable the exchange of encrypted messages - for enabling secure data transmission in an era of quantum information processing. With a significant rise in quantum computing research and development efforts, there is an increasing interest in exploring QC (e.g., Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Secured Encryption (QSE)) against a multitude of security threats in futuristic networks for quantum information processing. The objective of this study is to review the existing research i.e., consolidating the published evidence, that streamlines and documents the predominant challenges, recurring solutions, security threats, and their counter-measures against the outlined research questions in the context of QC. To conduct this study, we followed the guidelines and method of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) to answer seven research questions. These questions investigate the proposed solutions for state-of-the-art QC and its impact on future network security. Based on the seven (7) outlined research questions, this study systematically selected and reviewed one hundred and thirty four (134) research studies published from 2016 to 2023 with a focus on QC for quantum information processing. The results of this SLR establish a knowledge base for modern QC applications to guarantee network security in quantum-enabled network communications. The review reveals that though still in the phase of its inception, the research on QC is progressing rapidly, highlighting the necessity for network protocol and frameworks to cater for quantum network security. The SLR also highlights the challenges encountered while designing or implementing the QC systems, pinpointing the significance of keeping abreast of QKD networks and addressing possible ramifications for internet security in the future. The SLR provides theoretical foundations and evidence-based guidelines to tackle emerging and futuristic challenges of security in the context of QC and QKD for quantum information processing.

TI Overcoming noise in quantum teleportation with multipartite hybrid
   entanglement
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum entanglement and decoherence are the two counterforces of many quantum technologies and protocols. For example, while quantum teleportation is fueled by a pair of maximally entangled resource qubits, it is vulnerable to decoherence. Here, we propose an efficient quantum teleportation protocol in the presence of pure decoherence and without entangled resource qubits entering the Bell-state measurement. Instead, we use multipartite hybrid entanglement between the auxiliary qubits and their local environments within the open-quantum system context. With a hybrid-entangled initial state, it is the decoherence that allows us to achieve high fidelities. We demonstrate our protocol in an all-optical experiment.

TI Quantum Machine Learning Applications in the Biomedical Domain: A
   Systematic Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum technologies have become powerful tools for a wide range of application disciplines, which tend to range from chemistry to agriculture, natural language processing, and healthcare due to exponentially growing computational power and advancement in machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the processing of classical data and machine learning algorithms in the quantum domain has given rise to an emerging field like quantum machine learning. Recently, quantum machine learning has become quite a challenging field in the case of healthcare applications. As a result, quantum machine learning has become a common and effective technique for data processing and classification across a wide range of domains. Consequently, quantum machine learning is the most commonly used application of quantum computing. The main objective of this work is to present a brief overview of current state-of-the-art published articles between 2013 and 2021 to identify, analyze, and classify the different QML algorithms and applications in the biomedical field. Furthermore, the approach adheres to the requirements for conducting systematic literature review techniques such as research questions and quality metrics of the articles. Initially, we discovered 3149 articles, excluded the 2847 papers, and read the 121 full papers. Therefore, this research compiled 30 articles that comply with the quantum machine learning models and quantum circuits using biomedical data. Eventually, this article provides a broad overview of quantum machine learning limitations and future prospects.

TI Surrogate-guided optimization in quantum networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB When physical architectures become too complex for analytical study, numerical simulation proves essential to investigate quantum network behavior. Although highly informative, these simulations involve intricate numerical functions without known analytical forms, making traditional optimization techniques that assume continuity, differentiability, or convexity inapplicable. We introduce a more efficient computational framework that employs machine learning models as surrogates for the objective function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three well-known optimization problems in quantum networking: allocating quantum memory across multiple nodes, tuning an experimental parameter in every physical link of a quantum entanglement switch, and finding effective protocol configurations in a large asymmetric quantum network. Our algorithm consistently outperforms Simulated Annealing and Bayesian optimization within the allotted time, improving results by up to 29% and 28%, respectively. Our framework will thus allow for more comprehensive quantum network studies, integrating surrogate-assisted optimization with existing quantum network simulators.

TI Optimal tests for continuous-variable quantum teleportation and
   photodetectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum teleportation is a primitive in several important applications, including quantum communication, quantum computation, error correction, and quantum networks. In this paper, we propose an optimal test for the performance of continuous-variable (CV) quantum teleportation in terms of the energy-constrained channel fidelity between ideal CV teleportation and its experimental implementation. Work prior to ours considered suboptimal tests of the performance of CV teleportation, focusing instead on its performance for particular states, such as ensembles of coherent states, squeezed states, cat states, etc. Here, we prove that the optimal state for testing CV teleportation is an entangled superposition of twin Fock states. We establish this result by reducing the problem of estimating the energy-constrained channel fidelity between ideal CV teleportation and its experimental approximation to a quadratic program and solving it. As an additional result, we obtain an analytical solution to the energy-constrained diamond distance between a photodetector and its experimental approximation. These results are relevant for experiments that make use of CV teleportation and photodetectors.

TI Simulating two-dimensional lattice gauge theories on a qudit quantum
   computer
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Particle physics describes the interplay of matter and forces through gauge theories. Yet, the intrinsic quantum nature of gauge theories makes important problems notoriously difficult for classical computational techniques. Quantum computers offer a promising way to overcome these roadblocks. We demonstrate two essential requirements on this path: first, we perform a quantum computation of the properties of the basic building block of two-dimensional lattice quantum electrodynamics, involving both gauge fields and matter. Second, we show how to refine the gauge-field discretization beyond its minimal representation, using a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, where quantum information is encoded in several states per ion. Such qudits are ideally suited for describing gauge fields, which are naturally high dimensional, leading to reduced register size and circuit complexity. We prepare the ground state of the model using a variational quantum eigensolver and observe the effect of dynamical matter on quantized magnetic fields. By controlling the qudit dimension, we also show how to seamlessly observe the effect of different gauge-field truncations. Finally, we experimentally study the dynamics of pair creation and magnetic energy. Our results open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations of gauge theories with qudits in near-term quantum devices.

TI Practical distributed quantum information processing with LOCCNet
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Distributed quantum information processing is essential for building quantum networks and enabling more extensive quantum computations. In this regime, several spatially separated parties share a multipartite quantum system, and the most natural set of operations is Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). As a pivotal part in quantum information theory and practice, LOCC has led to many vital protocols such as quantum teleportation. However, designing practical LOCC protocols is challenging due to LOCC's intractable structure and limitations set by near-term quantum devices. Here we introduce LOCCNet, a machine learning framework facilitating protocol design and optimization for distributed quantum information processing tasks. As applications, we explore various quantum information tasks such as entanglement distillation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum channel simulation. We discover protocols with evident improvements, in particular, for entanglement distillation with quantum states of interest in quantum information. Our approach opens up new opportunities for exploring entanglement and its applications with machine learning, which will potentially sharpen our understanding of the power and limitations of LOCC. An implementation of LOCCNet is available in Paddle Quantum, a quantum machine learning Python package based on PaddlePaddle deep learning platform.

TI Experimental hierarchy of two-qubit quantum correlations without state
   tomography
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A Werner state, which is the singlet Bell state affected by white noise, is a prototype example of states, which can reveal a hierarchy of quantum entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality by controlling the amount of noise. However, experimental demonstrations of this hierarchy in a sufficient and necessary way (i.e., by applying measures or universal witnesses of these quantum correlations) have been mainly based on full quantum state tomography, corresponding to measuring at least 15 real parameters of two-qubit states. Here we report an experimental demonstration of this hierarchy by measuring only six elements of a correlation matrix depending on linear combinations of two-qubit Stokes parameters. We show that our experimental setup can also reveal the hierarchy of these quantum correlations of generalized Werner states, which are any two-qubit pure states affected by white noise.

TI Exchange-symmetrized qudit Bell bases and Bell-state distinguishability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement of qudit pairs, with single-particle Hilbert space dimension d, has important potential for quantum information processing, with applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. For a pair of qudits of arbitrary even dimension d, we introduce a generalized Bell basis with definite symmetry under exchange of internal states between the two particles. We show that no complete exchange-symmetrized basis can exist for odd d. This framework extends prior work on exchange-symmetrized hyperentangled qubit bases, where d is a power of 2. For our exchange-symmetrized basis, we show that measurement devices restricted to linear evolution and local measurement (LELM) can unambiguously distinguish 2d-1 qudit Bell states for any even d. This achieves the upper bound in general for reliable Bell-state distinguishability via LELM and augments previously known limits for d = 2n and d = 3. This result is relevant to near-term realizations of quantum communication protocols.

TI Unraveling spin entanglement using quantum gates with scanning tunneling

SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing, and its controlled generation and detection remain key challenges in scalable quantum architectures. Here, we numerically demonstrate the deterministic generation of entangled spin states in a solid-state platform by implementing quantum gates via electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). Using two titanium atoms on a MgO/Ag(100) substrate as a model, we construct a two-qubit system whose dynamics are coherently manipulated through tailored microwave pulse sequences. We generate Bell states by implementing a Hadamard gate followed by a controlled-NOT gate, and evaluate its fidelity and concurrence using the quantum-master equation-based code TimeESR. Our results demonstrate that ESR-STM can create entangled states with significant fidelity. This study paves the way for the realization of atom-based quantum circuits and highlights ESR-STM as a powerful tool for probing and engineering entangled states on surfaces.

TI Quantum Geometric Transformation Based on QIRHSI Quantum Color images
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The negative effects caused by geometric distortion can be removed to the maximum extent possible through appropriate geometric transformations, allowing us to focus on the image content itself in subsequent processing and recognition. Therefore, geometric transformations are often used as a pre-processing step for other image processing applications. In this paper, quantum algorithms are designed to implement geometric transformations, including two-point swapping, circular translation, flipping transformations and right-angle rotation, across a quantum image representation QIRHSI (Quantum Image Representation based on HSI color space) which is built on HSI (Hue-Saturation-Intensity) color space. The above geometric transformations are realized by quantum circuits composed of elementary quantum gates. By analyzing the complexity of the fundamental quantum gates needed for the above geometric transformations, it is found that the global transformations (circular translation, flip transformation and right-angle rotation) are lower than the local transformation (two-point swapping). The proposed geometric transforms are used to facilitate the applications of quantum images with low complexity and high efficiency.

TI Distributed quantum computing with black-box subroutines
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, we propose a general protocol for distributed quantum computing that accommodates arbitrary unknown subroutines. It can be applied to scale up quantum computing through multi-chip interconnection, as well as to tasks such as estimating unknown parameters or processes for circuit depth reduction and constructing secure quantum cryptographic protocols. Our protocol builds upon a few techniques we develop, such as the oblivious quantum teleportation and control, which can circumvent quantum no-go theorems on the manipulation of unknown objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protocol can be physically implemented using currently available quantum computing platforms. These results suggest that our framework could provide a foundation for developing more advanced quantum algorithms and protocols in the future.

TI Local available quantum correlations of X states: The symmetric and
   anti-symmetric cases
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B
AB Local available quantum correlations (LAQC), as defined by Mundarain et al., are analyzed for two-qubit X states with local Bloch vectors of equal magnitude. Symmetric X-states are invariant under the exchange of subsystems, hence having the same Bloch vector. On the other hand, anti-symmetric X states have Bloch vectors with an equal magnitude but opposite direction. In both cases, we obtain exact analytical expressions for their LAQC quantifier. We present some examples and compare this quantum correlation to concurrence and quantum discord. We have also included Markovian decoherence, with Werner states under amplitude damping decoherence. As is the case for depolarization and phase damping, no sudden death behavior occurs for the LAQC of these states with this quantum channel.

TI Performance of Quantum Annealing Machine Learning Classification Models
   on ADMET Datasets
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Quantum Annealer built by D-Wave, known as Advantage, is currently the largest quantum computer in the world, featuring a topology called "Pegasus." This groundbreaking system opens new possibilities for solving highly complex problems. The advancement of quantum annealers has spurred experimental demonstrations and intensified research interest, particularly in quantum machine learning. However, the application of quantum annealing in machine learning remains limited due to the lack of conclusive performance evaluations on real-world datasets. There is still no clear consensus on the efficacy of these models in practical scenarios. This work focuses on experimentally evaluating quantum annealing machine learning (QAML) classification methods, specifically Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) and QBoost, on ADMET datasets-one of the most important datasets in the drug discovery domain. We compare QAML with classical machine learning to evaluate their relative performance. This study seeks to address this gap by rigorously comparing the performance of QBoost and QSVM models using ADMET datasets, employing D-Wave's Quantum Annealer. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential and limitations of quantum annealers in quantum machine learning, with a focus on their application to real-world data in the ADMET domain. The findings offer critical insights into the nuanced advantages and challenges of quantum annealers in advancing machine learning methodologies.

TI Investigating Imperfect Cloning for Extending Quantum Communication
   Capabilities
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum computing allows the implementation of powerful algorithms with enormous computing capabilities and promises a secure quantum Internet. Despite the advantages brought by quantum communication, certain communication paradigms are impossible or cannot be completely implemented due to the no-cloning theorem. Qubit retransmission for reliable communications and point-to-multipoint quantum communication (QP2MP) are among them. In this paper, we investigate whether a Universal Quantum Copying Machine (UQCM) generating imperfect copies of qubits can help. Specifically, we propose the Quantum Automatic Repeat Request (QARQ) protocol, which is based on its classical variant, as well as to perform QP2MP communication using imperfect clones. Note that the availability of these protocols might foster the development of new distributed quantum computing applications. As current quantum devices are noisy and they decohere qubits, we analyze these two protocols under the presence of various sources of noise. Three major quantum technologies are studied for these protocols: direct transmission (DT), teleportation (TP), and telecloning (TC). The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center platform is used to create simulation models. Results show that TC outperforms TP and DT in terms of fidelity in both QARQ and QP2MP, although it is the most complex one in terms of quantum cost. A numerical study shows that the QARQ protocol significantly improves qubit recovery and that creating more clones does not always improve qubit recovery.

TI Toward a Complete Software Stack to Integrate Quantum Key Distribution
   in a Cloud Environment
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The coming advent of Quantum Computing promises to jeopardize current communications security, undermining the effectiveness of traditional public-key based cryptography. Different strategies (Post-Quantum or Quantum Cryptography) have been proposed to address this problem. Many techniques and algorithms based on quantum phenomena have been presented in recent years; the most relevant example is the introduction of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This approach allows to exchange cryptographic keys among parties and does not suffer from the development of quantum computation. Problems arise when this technique has to be deployed and combined with modern distributed infrastructures that heavily depend on cloud and virtualisation paradigms. This paper addresses the issue by presenting a new software stack that effortlessly introduces QKD in such environments. This software stack allows for agnostic integration, monitoring, and management of QKD, independent from a specific vendor or technology. Furthermore, a QKD simulator is presented, designed, and tested. This latter contribution is suitable as a low-level testing device, as an independent software module to check QKD protocols, and as a testbed to identify future practical enhancements.

TI Optimal Partitioning of Quantum Circuits Using Gate Cuts and Wire Cuts
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB A limited number of qubits, high error rates, and limited qubit connectivity are major challenges for effective near-term quantum computations. Quantum circuit partitioning divides a quantum computation into classical postprocessing steps and a set of smaller scale quantum computations that individually require fewer qubits, lower qubit connectivity, and typically incur less error. However, as partitioning generally increases the duration of a quantum computation exponentially in the required partitioning effort, it is crucial to select optimal partitioning points, so-called cuts, and to use optimal cut realizations. In this work, we develop the first optimal partitioning method relying on quantum circuit knitting for optimal cut realizations and an optimal selection of wire cuts and gate cuts that trades off ancilla qubit insertions for a decrease in quantum computing time. Using this combination, the developed method demonstrates a reduction in quantum computing runtime by 41% on average compared to previous quantum circuit partitioning methods. Furthermore, the qubit requirement of the evaluated quantum circuits was reduced by 40% on average for a runtime budget of one hour and a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. These results highlight the optimality gap of previous quantum circuit partitioning methods and the possible extension in the computational reach of near-term quantum computers.

TI Single-step implementation of a hybrid controlled-NOT gate with one
   superconducting qubit simultaneously controlling multiple target
   cat-state qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hybrid quantum gates have recently drawn considerable attention. They play significant roles in connecting quantum information processors with qubits of different encoding and have important applications in the transmission of quantum states between a quantum processor and a quantum memory. In this work, we propose a single-step implementation of a multitarget-qubit controlled- NOT gate with one superconducting (SC) qubit simultaneously controlling n target cat-state qubits. In this proposal, the gate is implemented with n microwave cavities coupled to a three-level SC qutrit. The two logic states of the control SC qubit are represented by the two lowest levels of the qutrit, while the two logic states of each target cat-state qubit are represented by two quasi-orthogonal cat states of a microwave cavity. This proposal operates essentially through the dispersive coupling of each cavity with the qutrit. The gate realization is quite simple because it requires only a single-step operation. There is no need of applying a classical pulse or performing a measurement. The gate operation time is independent of the number of target qubits, thus it does not increase as the number of target qubits increases. Moreover, because the third higher energy level of the qutrit is not occupied during the gate operation, decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed. As an application of this hybrid multitarget-qubit gate, we further discuss the generation of a hybrid Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state of SC qubits and cat-state qubits. As an example, we numerically analyze the experimental feasibility of generating a hybrid GHZ state of one SC qubit and three cat-state qubits within present circuit QED technology. This proposal is quite general and can be extended to implement a hybrid controlled-NOT gate with one matter qubit (of different type) simultaneously controlling multiple target cat-state qubits in a wide range of physical systems, such as multiple microwave or optical cavities coupled to a three-level natural or artificial atom.

TI An Optimized Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation Scheme with the Use of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Bidirectional quantum teleportation scheme is a two-way quantum communication process, in which two parties simultaneously receive each other information. Recently, in paper (Zhou et al., IEEE Access, 7, 44269 2019), a six-qubit cluster state has been used to teleport a three-qubit entangled state (Alice) and arbitrary single-qubit unknown quantum state (Bob) bidirectionally. In experimental point of view, the preparation and the maintenance of cluster type entangled state is very difficult and costly. So, in this paper we have designed an optimal scheme (less amount of quantum resource) of bidirectional quantum teleportation scheme and shown that proposed scheme requires an optimized amount of quantum resource.

TI Selected topics of quantum computing for nuclear physics*
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Nuclear physics, whose underling theory is described by quantum gauge field coupled with matter, is fundamentally important and yet is formidably challenge for simulation with classical computers. Quantum computing provides a perhaps transformative approach for studying and understanding nuclear physics. With rapid scaling-up of quantum processors as well as advances on quantum algorithms, the digital quantum simulation approach for simulating quantum gauge fields and nuclear physics has gained lots of attention. In this review, we aim to summarize recent efforts on solving nuclear physics with quantum computers. We first discuss a formulation of nuclear physics in the language of quantum computing. In particular, we review how quantum gauge fields (both Abelian and non-Abelian) and their coupling to matter field can be mapped and studied on a quantum computer. We then introduce related quantum algorithms for solving static properties and real-time evolution for quantum systems, and show their applications for a broad range of problems in nuclear physics, including simulation of lattice gauge field, solving nucleon and nuclear structures, quantum advantage for simulating scattering in quantum field theory, non-equilibrium dynamics, and so on. Finally, a short outlook on future work is given.

TI Variational Quantum Optimization of Nonlocality in Noisy Quantum
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The noise and complexity inherent to quantum communication networks leads to technical challenges in designing quantum network protocols using classical methods. We address this issue with a hybrid variational quantum optimization (VQO) framework that simulates quantum networks on quantum hardware and optimizes the simulation using differential programming. We maximize nonlocality in noisy quantum networks to showcase our VQO framework. Using a classical simulator, we investigate the noise robustness of quantum nonlocality. Our VQO methods reproduce known results and uncover novel phenomena. We find that maximally entangled states maximize nonlocality in the presence of unital qubit channels, while nonmaximally entangled states can maximize nonlocality in the presence of nonunital qubit channels. Thus, we show VQO to be a practical design tool for quantum networks even when run on a classical simulator. Finally, using IBM quantum computers, we demonstrate that our VQO framework can maximize nonlocality on noisy quantum hardware. In the long term, our VQO techniques show promise of scaling beyond classical approaches and can be deployed on quantum network hardware to optimize network protocols against their inherent noise.

TI All-photonic one-way quantum repeaters with measurement-based error
   correction
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum repeater is the key technology enabler for long-distance quantum communication. To date, most of the existing quantum repeater protocols are designed based on specific quantum codes or graph states. In this paper, we propose a general framework for all-photonic one-way quantum repeaters based on the measurement-based error correction, which can be adapted to any Calderbank-Shor-Steane code including the recently discovered quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We present a decoding scheme, where the error correction process is carried out at the destination based on the accumulated data from the measurements made across the network. This procedure not only outperforms the conventional protocols with independent repeaters but also simplifies the local quantum operations at repeaters. As an example, we numerically show that the [[48, 6, 8]] generalized bicycle code (as a small but efficient QLDPC code) has an equally good performance while reducing the resources by at least an order of magnitude.

TI Machine-Learning-Based Qubit Allocation for Error Reduction in Quantum
   Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing is a quickly growing field with great potential for future technology. Quantum computers in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era face two major limitations:1) qubit count and 2) error vulnerability. Although quantum error correction methods exist, they are not applicable to the current size of computers, requiring thousands of qubits, while current NISQ systems have hundreds at most. It is, therefore, imperative to improve the reliability of the circuits as much as possible to make them robust to the errors that will occur. One common approach is to adjust the compilation process of a circuit to create a final circuit with improved reliability. However, there are many decisions to be made when compiling that affect the final performance of the circuit, two of the most critical ones being the mapping of logical to physical qubits (the qubit allocation problem) and the movement of qubits to satisfy two-qubit gate adjacency requirements (the qubit routing problem). We focus on solving the qubit allocation problem and identifying initial layouts that reduce error. To identify these layouts, we combine reinforcement learning with a graph neural network (GNN)-based Q-network for analyzing both the connections and error rates of the graphlike backend of superconducting quantum computers to make mapping decisions, creating a GNN-assisted compilation (GNAQC) strategy. We provide both the circuit and the properties of the target backend as input to guide the decision-making process. We work with the IBM Qiskit applications programming interface to compile and simulate our quantum circuits. We train the architecture using a set of four backends and six circuits and find that GNAQC generally outperforms preexisting qubit allocation algorithms, increasing final relative output fidelity by roughly 12.7%.

TI Boosting Quantum Key Distribution via the End-to-End Loss Control
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB With the rise of quantum technologies, data security increasingly relies on quantum cryptography and its most notable application, quantum key distribution (QKD). Yet, current technological limitations, in particular, the unavailability of quantum repeaters, cause relatively low key distribution rates in practical QKD implementations. Here, we demonstrate a remarkable improvement in the QKD performance using end-to-end line tomography for the wide class of relevant protocols. Our approach is based on the real-time detection of interventions in the transmission channel, enabling an adaptive response that modifies the QKD setup and post-processing parameters, leading, thereby, to a substantial increase in the key distribution rates. Our findings provide everlastingly secure efficient quantum cryptography deployment potentially overcoming the repeaterless rate-distance limit.

TI Ultrahigh-fidelity spatial mode quantum gates in high-dimensional space
   by diffractive deep neural networks
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB While the spatial mode of photons is widely used in quantum cryptography, its potential for quantum computation remains largely unexplored. Here, we showcase the use of the multi-dimensional spatial mode of photons to construct a series of high-dimensional quantum gates, achieved through the use of diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs). Notably, our gates demonstrate high fidelity of up to 99.6(2)%, as characterized by quantum process tomography. Our experimental implementation of these gates involves a programmable array of phase layers in a compact and scalable device, capable of performing complex operations or even quantum circuits. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the D2NN gates by successfully implementing the Deutsch algorithm and propose an intelligent deployment protocol that involves self-configuration and self-optimization. Moreover, we conduct a comparative analysis of the D2NN gate's performance to the wave-front matching approach. Overall, our work opens a door for designing specific quantum gates using deep learning, with the potential for reliable execution of quantum computation.
   We showcase the use of deep diffractive neural networks to construct a series of high fidelity and high-dimensional quantum gates, which are encoded by the spatial modes of photons.

TI Development of a multi-technology, template-based quantum circuits
   compilation toolchain
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB With noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ) becoming larger in scale and more reliable, quantum circuits are growing in size and complexity. In order to face the challenge of achieving optimal circuits, design automation approaches for improving and mapping quantum circuits on different architectures have been proposed, each one characterized by a specific optimization strategy. In this article, the use of a template-based approach for quantum circuits optimization purposes is explored, and the proposal of a modular compilation toolchain, which supports three quantum technologies (nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions and superconducting qubits), is presented. The toolchain tackles the task of implementing logic synthesis for single-qubit and multi-qubit gates in the compilation process and it is structured with multiple steps and modular libraries. The toolchain was tested through a benchmarking procedure, and the results for a subset of complex quantum circuits as inputs are here reported, alongside a comparison with those provided by the compilers of IBM's Qiskit and Cambridge Quantum Computing's t vertical bar ket >. The current toolchain prototype was crafted to be an easily expandable and reliable core for future developments, which could lead it to support even more quantum technologies and a fully fledged layout synthesis. Nonetheless, the obtained results are quite encouraging, and they prove that in certain conditions the Toolchain can be competitive in quantum circuits optimization, especially when dealing with single-qubit gates.

AB Compared to other types of qubits, photon is one of a kind due to its unparalleled advantages in long-distance quantum information exchange. Therefore, photon is a natural candidate for building a large-scale, modular optical quantum computer operating at room temperature. However, low-fidelity two-photon quantum logic gates and their probabilistic nature result in a large resource overhead for fault tolerant quantum computation. While the probabilistic problem can, in principle, be solved by employing multiplexing and error correction, the fidelity of linear-optical quantum logic gate is limited by the imperfections of single photons. Here, we report the demonstration of a linear-optical quantum logic gate with truth table fidelity of 99.84(3)% and entangling gate fidelity of 99.69(4)% post-selected upon the detection of photons. The achieved high gate fidelities are made possible by our near-optimal Rydberg single-photon source. Our work paves the way for scalable photonic quantum applications based on near-optimal single-photon qubits and photon-photon gates.
   The current main source of errors for photonic quantum logic gates is the imperfections of the single photons. Here, by using high-quality photons from Rydberg atoms, the authors are able to reach 99.7% entangling gate fidelity in a photonic CNOT gate.

TI Quantum Wrapper Networking
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB We propose Quantum Wrapper as a novel networking technology that enables simultaneous control, management, and operation of quantum networks that coexist with classical networks. The quantum wrapper networks enable the transparent and interoperable transportation of quantum wrapper datagrams consisting of quantum payloads and, notably, classical headers, to facilitate the datagram switching without measuring or disturbing the qubits of the quantum payload. Furthermore, quantum wrapper networks can utilize the common network control and management for performance monitoring on the classical header, and infer the quantum channel quality.

TI Resource-efficient simulation of noisy quantum circuits and application
   to network-enabled QRAM optimization
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone (2008) proposed a quantum random access memory (QRAM) architecture to retrieve arbitrary superpositions of N (quantum) memory cells via quantum switches and O & eth;log & eth;N & THORN;& THORN; address qubits. Toward physical QRAM implementations, Chen et al. (2021) recently showed that QRAM maps natively onto optically connected quantum networks with O & eth;log & eth;N & THORN;& THORN; overhead and built-in error detection. However, modeling QRAM on large networks has been stymied by exponentially rising classical compute requirements. Here, we address this bottleneck by: (1) introducing a resource-efficient method for simulating large-scale noisy entanglement, allowing us to evaluate hundreds and even thousands of qubits under various noise channels; and (2) analyzing Chen et al.'s network-based QRAM as an application at the scale of quantum data centers or near-term quantum internet; and (3) introducing a modified network-based QRAM architecture to improve quantum fidelity and access rate. We conclude that network-based QRAM could be built with existing or near-term technologies leveraging photonic integrated circuits and atomic or atom-like quantum memories.

TI Detecting quantum capacities of continuous-variable quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum communication channels and quantum memories are the fundamental building blocks of large-scale quantum communication networks. Estimating their capacity to transmit and store quantum information is crucial in order to assess the performance of quantum communication systems and to detect useful communication paths among the nodes of future quantum networks. However, the estimation of quantum capacities is a challenging task for continuous-variable systems, such as the radiation field, for which a complete characterization via quantum tomography is practically unfeasible. Here we introduce a method for detecting the quantum capacity of continuous-variable communication channels and memories without performing a full process tomography. Our method works in the general scenario where the devices are used a finite number of times, can exhibit correlations across multiple uses, and can change dynamically under the control of a malicious adversary. The method is experimentally friendly and can be implemented using only finitely squeezed states and homodyne measurements.

TI Qumode transfer between continuous- and discrete-variable devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Transferring quantum information between different types of quantum hardware is crucial for integrated quantum technology. In particular, converting information between continuous variable (CV) and discrete variable (DV) devices enables many applications in quantum networking, quantum sensing, quantum machine learning, and quantum computing. This paper addresses the transfer of CV-encoded information between CV and DV devices. We present a resource-efficient method for encoding CV states and implementing CV gates on DV devices, as well as two measurement-based protocols for transferring CV states between CV and DV devices. The success probability of the transfer protocols depends on the measurement outcome and can be increased to near-deterministic values by adding ancillary qubits to the DV devices.

TI Ab-initio tree-tensor-network digital twin for quantum computer
   benchmarking in 2D
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Large-scale numerical simulations of the Hamiltonian dynamics of a noisy intermediate scale quantum computer-a digital twin-could play a major role in developing efficient and scalable strategies for tuning quantum algorithms for specific hardware. Via a two-dimensional tensor network digital twin of a Rydberg atom quantum computer, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a program. In particular, we quantify the effects of gate crosstalks induced by the van der Waals interaction between Rydberg atoms: according to an 8x8 digital twin simulation based on the current state-of-the-art experimental setups, the initial state of a five-qubit repetition code can be prepared with a high fidelity, a first indicator for a compatibility with fault-tolerant quantum computing. The preparation of a 64-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with about 700 gates yields a 99.9% fidelity in a closed system while achieving a speedup of 35% via parallelization.

TI DYNAMICS OF QUANTUM CORRELATIONS IN A TWO-PARAMETER CLASS SYSTEM UNDER
   QUANTUM NOISE
SO THERMAL SCIENCE
AB In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of quantum correlations in a two-qubit system influenced by an optical channel. The systems' dynamics are analyzed in terms of concurrence (CN), Bell non-locality (BN), and trace distance discord (TDD), which quantify entanglement, non-local correlations, and quantum discord, respectively. Our model explores the impact of key parameters such as the beam-splitter angle, theta, channel parameter, lambda, and angular frequency, omega, on these quantum correlations. The results show that CN and BN exhibit oscillatory behavior with periodic revivals, but tend to decay more rapidly under noisy conditions. Conversely, TDD demonstrates greater robustness, persisting even when CN and BN collapse, indicating the survival of quantum correlations in separable states. Higher noise strength and angular frequencies induce faster oscillations and revivals across all measures, with systems prepared with stronger initial quantum correlations showing increased resilience. This study highlights the robustness of quantum discord in noisy environments and its potential role in quantum information processing, even in the absence of entanglement.

TI Authenticated Semi-Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Based on W States
SO SENSORS
AB In 2019, Wen et al. proposed authenticated semi-quantum key distribution (ASQKD) for identity and message using the teleportation of W states and GHZ-like states without pre-shared keys. However, the ASQKD protocol presents a vital issue in the teleportation of W states owing to its inappropriate design. Bob recovers the teleported W states without obtaining the position of the corresponding photons and then returns the recovered photons back to Alice. Hence, the teleportation of W states in Wen et al.'s ASQKD protocol was malfunctioning. Moreover, Wen et al.'s ASQKD protocol requires quantum memory, which strongly disobeys the definition of semi-quantum proposed by Boyer et al. Therefore, in this study, we discover the flaws of Wen et al.'s ASQKD protocol and propose an authenticated semi-quantum key distribution protocol. When compared to Wen et al.'s ASQKD protocol, the proposed ASQKD protocol has the following advantages: legal semi-quantum environment (i.e., does not require quantum memory), reduced quantum hardware requirement (i.e., based only on W states), does not involve classical cryptography (i.e., the hash function), and provided 1.6 times higher qubit efficiency.

TI Experimental demonstration of continuous quantum error correction
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Continuous quantum error correction requires less ancillary resources compared to standard QEC methods. Here, the authors demonstrate experimentally a continuous quantum error correction code in a planar superconducting architecture.
   The storage and processing of quantum information are susceptible to external noise, resulting in computational errors. A powerful method to suppress these effects is quantum error correction. Typically, quantum error correction is executed in discrete rounds, using entangling gates and projective measurement on ancillary qubits to complete each round of error correction. Here we use direct parity measurements to implement a continuous quantum bit-flip correction code in a resource-efficient manner, eliminating entangling gates, ancillary qubits, and their associated errors. An FPGA controller actively corrects errors as they are detected, achieving an average bit-flip detection efficiency of up to 91%. Furthermore, the protocol increases the relaxation time of the protected logical qubit by a factor of 2.7 over the relaxation times of the bare comprising qubits. Our results showcase resource-efficient stabilizer measurements in a multi-qubit architecture and demonstrate how continuous error correction codes can address challenges in realizing a fault-tolerant system.

TI Improved Multi-party Quantum Key Agreement with Four-qubit Cluster
   States
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum key agreement is a promising key establishing protocol that can play a significant role in securing 5G/6G communication networks. Recently, Liu et al. (Quantum Information Processing 18(8):1-10, 2019) proposed a multi-party quantum key agreement protocol based on four-qubit cluster states was proposed. The aim of their protocol is to agree on a shared secret key among multiple remote participants. Liu et al. employed four-qubit cluster states to be the quantum resources and the X operation to securely share a secret key. In addition, Liu et al.???s protocol guarantees that each participant makes an equal contribution to the final key. The authors also claimed that the proposed protocol is secure against participant attack and dishonest participants cannot generate the final shared key alone. However, we show here that Liu et al. protocol is insecure against a collusive attack, where dishonest participants can retrieve the private inputs of a trustworthy participant without being caught. Additionally, the corresponding modifications are presented to address these security flaws in Liu et al.???s protocol.

Furthermore, it allows users to visualize the training trajectories of PQCs along with high-dimensional loss landscapes generated by them for different objective functions. It supports quantum circuits and noise models built using popular quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit, Cirq, and PyQuil. In our work, we demonstrate how qLEET provides opportunities to design and improve hybrid quantum-classical algorithms by utilizing intuitive insights from the ansatz capability and structure of the loss landscape.

AB Quantum computation attaches importance to high-precision quantum manipulation, where the quantum state transfer with high fidelity is necessary. Here, we propose a new scheme to implement the quantum state transfer of high fidelity and long distance, by adding on-site potential into the qubit chain and enlarging the proportion of the coupling strength between the two ends and the chain. In the numerical simulation, without decoherence, the transfer fidelities of 9 and 11 qubit chain are 0.999 and 0.997, respectively. Moreover, we give a detailed physical realization scheme of the quantum state transfer in superconducting circuits, and discuss the tolerance of our proposal against decoherence. Therefore, our scheme will shed light on quantum computation with long chain and high-fidelity quantum state transfer.

AB Quantum computing addresses the construction and operation of quantum computers to solve more efficiently instances of specific problems that are difficult to tackle with classical computers. Even if we are currently in the so-called Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ), steady signs of progress are being made towards the realization of a fast and reliable quantum computer, materializing the basic building blocks of quantum circuits, i.e., quantum bits and gates. On the other hand, quantum communications cover the transmission of quantum states across distances. Recent advances in this context have led to the novel research area of quantum networking, which is set to define the programming interfaces and protocols for the practical operation of quantum communication and computing infrastructures. The tutorial has the objective of raising awareness about these emerging topics, i.e., quantum computing and quantum networking, in the research community by i) introducing briefly the latest technologies developed in each, then ii) providing hands-on examples of how to use them for simple use cases, and iii) finally sketching the more promising open research challenges.

TI The construction of quantum network model based on formalized theory
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB With the rapid development of quantum communication, various types of quantum communication protocols emerge one after another, and their number has been very large. Usually a quantum communication protocol is expressed in long words. Formalized processing of quantum communication protocol can simplify its expression mode, which is conducive to fast reading and selection of required protocols according to actual application requirements. In this paper, quantum communication protocols that use entangled particles as quantum channels to transmit known or unknown quantum states are classified based on classification of set, and the classified protocols are described in formalized language. A new quantum communication network model is constructed by using the formalized quantum communication protocol.

TI Quantum computing with Rydberg atom graphs
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY
AB In recent years, Rydberg atom graphs, which are the arrangement of atoms of which the interaction through Rydberg state excitation can be represented by a mathematical graph, have emerged as a promising qubit platform for quantum computing and quantum simulation, through implementing quantum gates and circuits, probing quantum phase transitions in designed atom arrays, and solving the classically difficult class of computational problems. Here we briefly review the remarkable progress of the related techniques and research activities involved with the Rydberg atom graphs. The ease of scalability and controllability of Rydberg atom graphs might enable the quantum advantage in the NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) era.

TI Qudit Dynamical Decoupling on a Superconducting Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Multilevel qudit systems are increasingly being explored as alternatives to traditional qubit systems due to their denser information storage and processing potential. However, qudits are more susceptible to decoherence than qubits due to increased loss channels, noise sensitivity, and crosstalk. To address these challenges, we develop protocols for dynamical decoupling (DD) of qudit systems based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. We implement and experimentally verify these DD protocols on a superconducting transmon processor that supports qudit operation based on qutrits (d = 3) and ququarts (d = 4). Specifically, we demonstrate single-qudit DD sequences to decouple qutrits and ququarts from systembath-induced decoherence. We also introduce two-qudit DD sequences designed to suppress the detrimental cross-Kerr couplings between coupled qudits. This allows us to demonstrate a significant improvement in the fidelity of time-evolved qutrit Bell states. Our results highlight the utility of leveraging DD to enable scalable qudit-based quantum computing.

TI Projective measurements under qubit quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The action of qubit channels on projective measurements on a qubit state is used to establish an equivalence between channels and properties of generalized measurements characterized by bias and sharpness parameters. This can be interpreted as shifting the description of measurement dynamics from the Schrodinger to the Heisenberg picture. In particular, unital quantum channels are shown to induce unbiased measurements. The Markovian channels are found to be equivalent to measurements for which sharpness is a monotonically decreasing function of time. These results are illustrated by considering various noise channels. The effect of bias and sharpness parameters on various quantum correlations and on the energy cost of measurements is discussed. Further, we illustrate the quantum circuit implementation of the two element positive operator-valued measures characterized by the bias and sharpness parameters.

AB Due to the unreliability and limited capacity of existing quantum computer prototypes, quantum circuit simulation continues to be a vital tool for validating next generation quantum computers and for studying variational quantum algorithms, which are among the leading candidates for useful quantum computation. Existing quantum circuit simulators do not address the common traits of variational algorithms, namely: 1) their ability to work with noisy qubits and operations, 2) their repeated execution of the same circuits but with different parameters, and 3) the fact that they sample from circuit final wavefunctions to drive a classical optimization routine. We present a quantum circuit simulation toolchain based on logical abstractions targeted for simulating variational algorithms. Our proposed toolchain encodes quantum amplitudes and noise probabilities in a probabilistic graphical model, and it compiles the circuits to logical formulas that support efficient repeated simulation of and sampling from quantum circuits for different parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art state vector and density matrix quantum circuit simulators, our simulation approach offers greater performance when sampling from noisy circuits with at least eight to 20 qubits and with around 12 operations on each qubit, making the approach ideal for simulating near-term variational quantum algorithms. And for simulating noise-free shallow quantum circuits with 32 qubits, our simulation approach offers a 66x reduction in sampling cost versus quantum circuit simulation techniques based on tensor network contraction.

TI Quantum Coding Transitions in the Presence of Boundary Dissipation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We investigate phase transitions in the encoding of quantum information in a quantum many-body system due to the competing effects of unitary scrambling and boundary dissipation. Specifically, we study the fate of quantum information in a one-dimensional qudit chain, subject to local unitary quantum circuit evolution in the presence of depolarizing noise at the boundary. If the qudit chain initially contains a finite amount of locally accessible quantum information, unitary evolution in the presence of boundary dissipation allows this information to remain partially protected when the dissipation is sufficiently weak, and up to timescales growing linearly in the system size L . In contrast, for strong enough dissipation, this information is completely lost to the dissipative environment. We analytically investigate this "quantum coding transition" by considering dynamics involving Haar-random, local unitary gates, and confirm our predictions in numerical simulations of Clifford quantum circuits. Scrambling the quantum information in the qudit chain with a unitary circuit of depth O(logL) L ) before the onset of dissipation can perfectly protect the information until late times. The nature of the coding transition changes when the dynamics extend for times much longer than L . We further show that at weak dissipation, it is possible to code at a finite rate, i.e., a fraction of the many-body Hilbert space of the qudit chain can be used to encode quantum information.

TI Complex quantum networks: a topical review
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB These are exciting times for quantum physics as new quantum technologies are expected to soon transform computing at an unprecedented level. Simultaneously network science is flourishing proving an ideal mathematical and computational framework to capture the complexity of large interacting systems. Here we provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rising field of complex quantum networks. On one side, this subject is key to harness the potential of complex networks in order to provide design principles to boost and enhance quantum algorithms and quantum technologies. On the other side this subject can provide a new generation of quantum algorithms to infer significant complex network properties. The field features fundamental research questions as diverse as designing networks to shape Hamiltonians and their corresponding phase diagram, taming the complexity of many-body quantum systems with network theory, revealing how quantum physics and quantum algorithms can predict novel network properties and phase transitions, and studying the interplay between architecture, topology and performance in quantum communication networks. Our review covers all of these multifaceted aspects in a self-contained presentation aimed both at network-curious quantum physicists and at quantum-curious network theorists. We provide a framework that unifies the field of quantum complex networks along four main research lines: network-generalized, quantum-applied, quantum-generalized and quantum-enhanced. Finally we draw attention to the connections between these research lines, which can lead to new opportunities and new discoveries at the interface between quantum physics and network science.

TI Entanglement Distribution with Minimal Memory Requirements Using
   Time-Bin Photonic Qudits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The generation of multiple entangled qubit pairs between distributed nodes is a prerequisite for a future quantum Internet. To achieve a practicable generation rate, standard protocols based on photonic qubits require multiple long-term quantum memories, which remains a significant experimental challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol based on 2m-dimensional time-bin photonic qudits that allows for the simultaneous generation of multiple (m) entangled pairs between two distributed qubit registers and we outline a specific implementation of the protocol based on cavity-mediated spin-photon interactions. By adopting the qudit protocol, the required qubit memory time is independent of the transmission loss between the nodes, in contrast to standard qubit approaches. As such, our protocol can significantly boost the performance of near-term quantum networks.

TI Quantum correlations in optomechanical system in the presence of optical
   feedback
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of quantum correlations for the continuous-variable bipartite optomechanical system in the presence of homodyne mediated quantum feedback. The system is constructed using the Fabry-Perot cavity and a mechanical oscillator. In detail, we have studied the quantum entanglement via logarithmic negativity, quantum discord, and quantum steering between the optical and mechanical modes. The results show that the maximum entanglement between the optical and mechanical modes occurred out of the resonance frequency at the steady-state region due to the presence of the optical feedback. We also employ quantum steering to see the steerability between the modes. It is observed that the quantum entanglement increases when the effective detuning frequency increases, however, the quantum discord and steering decrease when the effective detuning frequency increases for a given quantum feedback strength with other parameters of the system are to be fixed. Moreover, the presence of quantum feedback has an enhancement effect on the quantum correlations.

TI Single-shot quantum error correction with the three-dimensional
   subsystem toric code
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Fault-tolerant protocols and quantum error correction (QEC) are essential to building reliable quantum computers from imperfect components that are vulnerable to errors. Optimizing the resource and time overheads needed to implement QEC is one of the most pressing challenges. Here, we introduce a new topological quantum error-correcting code, the three-dimensional subsystem toric code (3D STC). The 3D STC can be realized with geometrically-local parity checks of weight at most three on the cubic lattice with open boundary conditions. We prove that one round of parity-check measurements suffices to perform reliable QEC with the 3D STC even in the presence of measurement errors. We also propose an efficient single-shot QEC decoding strategy for the 3D STC and numerically estimate the resulting storage threshold against independent bit-flip, phase-flip and measurement errors to be p(STC) approximate to 1.045%. Such a high threshold together with local parity-check measurements make the 3D STC particularly appealing for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing.
   Topological quantum error correction is a promising approach towards fault-tolerant quantum computing, but suffers from large time overhead. Here, the authors generalise the stabiliser toric code to a single-shot 3D subsystem toric code, featuring good performance and resilience to measurement errors.

TI Quantum Computing in Semantic Communications: Overcoming Optimization
   Challenges With High-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Semantic communications prioritize transmitting meaningful information over raw data in communication systems. However, these systems face significant optimization challenges, particularly concerning resource efficiency and fidelity due to the costly and delicate nature of photonic resources. Quantum computing offers promising solutions to these challenges through its unique capabilities, such as superposition and entanglement, within high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This survey reviews the integration of quantum computing into semantic communications, tracing developments from foundational concepts to current advancements. It explores how quantum embeddings and machine learning techniques enhance semantic representation and transmission, enabling the encoding and processing of only relevant information. This approach addresses issues of polysemy and contextual variations in large datasets more effectively than classical methods. Key topics include the utilization of quantum probability and cognition in semantic analysis, optimization of quantum protocols for faster information retrieval, and the role of variational quantum circuits in improving computation latency, communication bandwidth, data privacy, and transmission delays. It also examines the implications for future communication systems like next-generation networks. It highlights the shift towards intelligent computing-intensive architectures and the support for advanced applications such as extended reality and holographic communications. Potential pathways are identified to achieve more efficient, secure, and intelligent data transmission, aiming to provide researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of this emerging field, outlining open research challenges and future directions to inspire further exploration and innovation.

TI OpenQL: A Portable Quantum Programming Framework for Quantum
   Accelerators
SO ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB With the potential of quantum algorithms to solve intractable classical problems, quantum computing is rapidly evolving, and more algorithms are being developed and optimized. Expressing these quantum algorithms using a high-level language and making them executable on a quantum processor while abstracting away hardware details is a challenging task. First, a quantum programming language should provide an intuitive programming interface to describe those algorithms. Then a compiler has to transform the program into a quantum circuit, optimize it, and map it to the target quantum processor respecting the hardware constraints such as the supported quantum operations, the qubit connectivity, and the control electronics limitations. In this article, we propose a quantum programming framework named OpenQL, which includes a high-level quantum programming language and its associated quantum compiler. We present the programming interface of OpenQL, we describe the different layers of the compiler and how we can provide portability over different qubit technologies. Our experiments show that OpenQL allows the execution of the same high-level algorithm on two different qubit technologies, namely superconducting qubits and Si-Spin qubits. Besides the executable code, OpenQL also produces an intermediate quantum assembly code, which is technology independent and can be simulated using the QX simulator.

SO MATHEMATICS
AB The perception that mathematics is difficult has always persisted. Nevertheless, mathematics is such an essential component of STEM education. Quantum technologies are already having enormous effects on our society, with advantages seen across a broad variety of industries, including finance, aerospace, and energy. These innovations promise to transform our lives. Managers in the business and public sectors will need to learn quantum computing. Quantum algorithmic literacy may help increase mathematical understanding and enthusiasm. The current paper proposes that one possible approach is to present the information in a reasonably gentle but intelligible way, in order to excite individuals with the mathematics that they already know by extending them to acquiring quantum algorithmic literacy. A gentle introduction to the mathematics required to model quantum computing ideas, including linear transformations and matrix algebra, will be given. Quantum entanglement, linear transformations, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation will be used as examples to illustrate the usefulness of basic mathematical concepts in formulating quantum algorithms. These exemplars in quantum algorithmic literacy can help to invigorate people's interest in mathematics. Additionally, a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) framework is provided that teachers can utilize to determine which students to approach for remediation. This assists the teachers in dispelling any pupils' uncertainty about mathematical concepts.

TI Fiber-coupled broadband quantum memory for polarization-encoded photonic
   qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Various near-term quantum networking applications will benefit from low-loss, fiber-coupled photonic quantum memory devices with high efficiencies. We demonstrate a fiber-coupled loop-and-switch quantum memory platform with a pass-through efficiency of similar to 54% and an overall storage efficiency that scales as similar to 0.5(N+1) where N is the number of storage cycles. We highlight the trade-off between memory lifetime and qubit accessibility in this platform by using two different storage cycle times of similar to 40 ns and similar to 0.5 mu s, and demonstrate high-fidelity storage and retrieval of ultra-broadband single-photon polarization qubits in both cases.

AB Quantum deletions, which are harder to correct than erasure errors, occur in many realistic settings. It is therefore pertinent to develop quantum coding schemes for quantum deletion channels. To date, not much is known about which explicit quantum error correction codes can combat quantum deletions. We note that any permutation-invariant quantum code that has a distance of t + 1 can correct t quantum deletions for any positive integer t in both the qubit and the qudit setting. Leveraging on coding properties of permutation-invariant quantum codes under erasure errors, we derive corresponding coding bounds for permutation-invariant quantum codes under quantum deletions. We focus our attention on a specific family of N-qubit permutation-invariant quantum codes, which we call shifted gnu codes. The main result of this work is that their encoding and decoding algorithms can be performed in O(N) and O(N-2).

TI Single-Photon Storage in a Ground-State Vapor Cell Quantum Memory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Interfaced single-photon sources and quantum memories for photons together form a foundational component of quantum technology. Achieving compatibility between heterogeneous, state-of-the-art devices is a long-standing challenge. We built and successfully interfaced a heralded single-photon source based on cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion in periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate and a matched memory based on electromagnetically induced transparency in warm Rb-87 vapor. The bandwidth of the photons emitted by the source is 370 MHz, placing its speed in the technologically relevant regime while remaining well within the acceptance bandwidth of the memory. Simultaneously, the experimental complexity is kept low, with all components operating at or above room temperature. Read-out noise of the memory is considerably reduced by exploiting polarization selection rules in the hyperfine structure of spin-polarized atoms. For the first time, we demonstrate single-photon storage and retrieval in a ground-state vapor cell memory, with g(c,ret)((2)) = 0.177(23) demonstrating the single-photon character of the retrieved light. Our platform of single-photon source and atomic memory is attractive for future experiments on room-temperature quantum networks operating at high bandwidth.

TI Quantum teleportation and remote sensing through semiconductor quantum
   dots affected by pure dephasing
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum teleportation allows the transmission of quantum states over arbitrary distances and is an applied tool in quantum computation and communication. This paper theoretically addresses the feasibility of quantum teleportation based on a single semiconductor quantum dot influenced by pure dephasing through the biexciton cascade decay. We also investigate the idea of remote sensing in quantum teleportation affected by pure dephasing. In particular, we compare the quality of quantum teleportation in single- and two-qubit schemes and show that, within the present model, single-qubit quantum teleportation has a quantum advantage. Finally, to investigate the dynamics of the system, we introduce important witnesses of the non-Markovian dynamics of the system, so that our results may solve outstanding problems in the realization of faithful quantum teleportation over a long time.

TI CMOS Integrated Circuits for the Quantum Information Sciences
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Over the past decade, significant progress in quantum technologies has been made, and hence, engineering of these systems has become an important research area. Many researchers have become interested in studying ways in which classical integrated circuits can be used to complement quantum mechanical systems, enabling more compact, performant, and/or extensible systems than would be otherwise feasible. In this article-written by a consortium of early contributors to the field-we provide a review of some of the early integrated circuits for the quantum information sciences. Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) integrated circuits for nuclear magnetic resonance, nitrogen-vacancy-based magnetometry, trapped-ion-based quantum computing, superconductor-based quantum computing, and quantum-dot-based quantum computing are described. In each case, the basic technological requirements are presented before describing proof-of-concept integrated circuits. We conclude by summarizing some of the many open research areas in the quantum information sciences for CMOS designers.

TI Quantum Computing Applications in Future Colliders

AB High-energy physics is facing a daunting computing challenge with the large amount of data expected from the HL-LHC and other future colliders. In addition, the landscape of computation has been expanding dramatically with technologies beyond the standard x86 CPU architecture becoming increasingly available. Both of these factors necessitate an extensive and broad-ranging research and development campaign. As quantum computation has been evolving rapidly over the past few years, it is important to evaluate how quantum computation could be one potential avenue for development for future collider experiments. A wide variety of applications have been considered by different authors. We review here selected applications of quantum computing to high-energy physics, including topics in simulation, reconstruction, and the use of machine learning, and their challenges. In addition, recent advances in quantum computing technology to enhance such applications are briefly highlighted. Finally, we will discuss how such applications might transform the workflows of future collider experiments and highlight other potential applications.

AB Quantum oracle synthesis involves compiling arbitrary Boolean functions into quantum circuits using specific quantum gates supported by the target quantum computer. The Clifford+T gate library is particularly common in fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. Utilizing XOR-AND-inverter graphs (XAGs) as the logic representation for the target Boolean functions has received extensive attention due to the observed direct correlation between the number of AND nodes in an XAG and the T count and the helper qubit count of the quantum oracle optimally compiled from it. However, to be deployed onto fault-tolerant quantum hardware, quantum gates must be further re-expressed by logical quantum error correction (QEC) code operations, a process known as back-end compilation. This paper enhances the current XAG-based oracle synthesis techniques by establishing a link between the properties of XAGs and quality measures of back-end-compiled quantum oracles. This link unlocks more optimization opportunities-experimental results demonstrate average reductions of 4.49% in T count, 7.00% in logical time steps, and 14.89% in helper qubit count, respectively, on benchmarks optimized by the proposed back-end-aware XAG optimization approaches.

TI Quantum teleportation coexisting with classical communications in
   optical fiber
SO OPTICA
AB The ability for quantum and conventional networks to operate in the same optical fibers would aid the deployment of quantum network technology on a large scale. Quantum teleportation is a fundamental operation in quantum networking, but has yet to be demonstrated in fibers populated with high-power conventional optical signals. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of quantum teleportation over fibers carrying conventional telecommunications traffic. Quantum state transfer is achieved over a 30.2-km fiber carrying 400-Gbps C-band classical traffic with a Bell state measurement performed at the fiber's midpoint. To protect quantum fidelity from spontaneous Raman scattering noise, we use optimal O-band quantum channels, narrow spectro-temporal filtering, and multi-photon coincidence detection. Fidelity is shown to be well maintained with an elevated C-band launch power of 18.7 dBm for the single-channel 400-Gbps signal, which we project could support multiple classical channels totaling many terabits/s aggregate data rates. These results show the feasibility of advanced quantum and classical network applications operating within a unified fiber infrastructure.

TI Design and Validation of Quantum Key Management System for Construction
   of KREONET Quantum Cryptography Communication
SO JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING
AB As it has been recently proven that the public key-based RSA algorithms that are currently used in encryption can be unlocked by Shor's algorithm of quantum computers in a short time, conventional security systems are facing new threats, and accordingly, studies have been actively conducted on new security systems. They are classified into two typical methods: Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). PQC aims to design conventional cryptography systems in a more robust way so that they will not be decrypted by a quantum computer in a short time whereas QKD aims to make data tapping and interception physically impossible by using quantum mechanical characteristics. In this paper, we design a quantum key management system, which is most crucial for constructing a QKD network and analyze the design requirements to apply them to Korea Research Environment Open NETwork (KREONET). The quantum key management system not only manages the lifecycle, such as storage, management, derivation, allocation, and deletion of the symmetric key generated in QKD but also enables many-to-many communication in QKD communication based on the key relay function and P2P communication to overcome the limitation of distance, which is a disadvantage of QKD. We have validated the designed quantum key management system through simulations to supplement the parts that were not considered during the initial design.

TI Deterministic multi-qubit entanglement in a quantum network
SO NATURE
AB High-fidelity deterministic quantum state transfer and multi-qubit entanglement are demonstrated in a quantum network comprising two superconducting quantum nodes one metre apart, with each node including three interconnected qubits.
   The generation of high-fidelity distributed multi-qubit entanglement is a challenging task for large-scale quantum communication and computational networks(1-4). The deterministic entanglement of two remote qubits has recently been demonstrated with both photons(5-10) and phonons(11). However, the deterministic generation and transmission of multi-qubit entanglement has not been demonstrated, primarily owing to limited state-transfer fidelities. Here we report a quantum network comprising two superconducting quantum nodes connected by a one-metre-long superconducting coaxial cable, where each node includes three interconnected qubits. By directly connecting the cable to one qubit in each node, we transfer quantum states between the nodes with a process fidelity of 0.911 +/- 0.008. We also prepare a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state(12-14) in one node and deterministically transfer this state to the other node, with a transferred-state fidelity of 0.656 +/- 0.014. We further use this system to deterministically generate a globally distributed two-node, six-qubit GHZ state with a state fidelity of 0.722 +/- 0.021. The GHZ state fidelities are clearly above the threshold of 1/2 for genuine multipartite entanglement(15), showing that this architecture can be used to coherently link together multiple superconducting quantum processors, providing a modular approach for building large-scale quantum computers(16,17).

TI Avoiding barren plateaus via Gaussian mixture model
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Variational quantum algorithms are among the most prominent methods in quantum computing, with applications in quantum machine learning, quantum simulation, and related fields. However, as the number of qubits grows, these algorithms often encounter the barren-plateau phenomenon, which severely limits their scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel parameter-initialization strategy based on Gaussian mixture models. We rigorously prove that for a hardware-efficient ansatz initialized in the |0 >circle times N state, our scheme avoids barren plateaus regardless of circuit depth, qubit count, or choice of cost function. Specifically, the lower bound on the initial gradient norm provided by our method remains independent of the number of qubits Building on this foundation, we validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, including variational ground-state searches for Hamiltonians, to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the critical role of Gaussian mixture model-based initialization in enhancing the trainability of quantum circuits and offer valuable guidance for future theoretical and experimental advances in quantum machine learning.

TI Quantifying Quantum Correlation of Quasi-Werner State and Probing Its
   Suitability for Quantum Teleportation
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The significance of photon addition in engineering the single- and two-mode (bipartite correlations) nonclassical properties of a quantum state is investigated. Specifically, the behavior of the Wigner function of two quasi-Werner states constructed by superposing two normalized bipartite m-photon added coherent states are analyzed. This allows the authors' to quantify the nonclassicality present in the quantum states using Wigner logarithmic negativity (WLN), while quantum correlations are measured using concurrence, entanglement of formation, and quantum discord. The WLN for a two-mode state corresponds to the sum of the single-mode nonclassicality and quantum correlations, and both of these are observed to enhance with photon addition manifesting the efficacy of photon addition in the entanglement distillation. Usefulness of photon addition is further established by showing that the performance of the quasi-Werner states as quantum channel for the teleportation of single-mode coherent and squeezed states, as quantified via teleportation fidelity, improves with the photon addition. The non-Gaussian operation is shown effective in stalling the detrimental effects of transmission through noisy channel and/or inefficient detection under realistic scenario. Further, in contrast to a set of existing results, it is established that the negative values of two-mode Wigner function is not a witness of quantum correlation.

TI Parameterized quantum comb and simpler circuits for reversing unknown
   qubit-unitary operations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum combs play a vital role in characterizing and transforming quantum processes, with wide-ranging applications in quantum information processing. However, obtaining the explicit quantum circuit for the desired quantum comb remains a challenging problem. We propose PQComb, a novel framework that employs parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) or quantum neural networks to harness the full potential of quantum combs for diverse quantum process transformation tasks. This method is well-suited for near-term quantum devices and can be applied to various tasks in quantum machine learning. As a notable application, we present two streamlined protocols for the time-reversal simulation of unknown qubit unitary evolutions, reducing the ancilla qubit overhead from six to three compared to the previous best-known method. We also extend PQComb to solve the problems of qutrit unitary transformation and channel discrimination. Furthermore, we demonstrate the hardware efficiency and robustness of our qubit unitary inversion protocol under realistic noise simulations of IBM-Q superconducting quantum hardware, yielding a significant improvement in average similarity over the previous protocol under practical regimes. PQComb's versatility and potential for broader applications in quantum machine learning pave the way for more efficient and practical solutions to complex quantum tasks.

TI Qudit machine learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a comprehensive investigation into the learning capabilities of a simple d-level system (qudit). Our study is specialized for classification tasks using real-world databases, specifically the Iris, breast cancer, and MNIST datasets. We explore various learning models in the metric learning framework, along with different encoding strategies. In particular, we employ data re-uploading techniques and maximally orthogonal states to accommodate input data within low-dimensional systems. Our findings reveal optimal strategies, indicating that when the dimension of input feature data and the number of classes are not significantly larger than the qudit's dimension, our results show favorable comparisons against the best classical models. This trend holds true even for small quantum systems, with dimensions d < 5 and utilizing algorithms with a few layers ( L = 1 , 2 ). However, for high-dimensional data such as MNIST, we adopt a hybrid approach involving dimensional reduction through a convolutional neural network. In this context, we observe that small quantum systems often act as bottlenecks, resulting in lower accuracy compared to their classical counterparts.

TI Multi-qubit entanglement and algorithms on a neutral-atom quantum
   computer
SO NATURE
AB Gate-model quantum computers promise to solve currently intractable computational problems if they can be operated at scale with long coherence times and high-fidelity logic. Neutral-atom hyperfine qubits provide inherent scalability owing to their identical characteristics, long coherence times and ability to be trapped in dense, multidimensional arrays(1). Combined with the strong entangling interactions provided by Rydberg states(2-4), all the necessary characteristics for quantum computation are available. Here we demonstrate several quantum algorithms on a programmable gate-model neutral-atom quantum computer in an architecture based on individual addressing of single atoms with tightly focused optical beams scanned across a two-dimensional array of qubits. Preparation of entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states(5) with up to six qubits, quantum phase estimation for a chemistry problem(6) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)(7) for the maximum cut (MaxCut) graph problem are demonstrated. These results highlight the emergent capability of neutral-atom qubit arrays for universal, programmable quantum computation, as well as preparation of non-classical states of use for quantum-enhanced sensing.

TI Transformation of Bell states using linear optics
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Bell states form a complete set of four maximally polarization entangled two-qubit quantum state. Being a key ingredient of many quantum applications such as entanglement based quantum key distribution protocols, superdense coding, quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping etc, Bell states have to be prepared and measured. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the easiest way of preparing Bell states and a desired Bell state can be prepared from any entangled photon pair through single-qubit logic gates. In this paper, we present the generation of complete set of Bell states, only by applying unitary transformations of half-wave plate (HWP) on the initial Bell state. The initial Bell state is prepared using a combination of a nonlinear crystal and a beam-splitter (BS) and the rest of the Bell states are created by applying single-qubit logic gates on the entangled photon pairs using HWPs. Our results can be useful in many quantum applications, especially in superdense coding where control over basis of maximally entangled state is required.

TI A four-qubit germanium quantum processor
SO NATURE
AB The prospect of building quantum circuits(1,2) using advanced semiconductor manufacturing makes quantum dots an attractive platform for quantum information processing(3,4). Extensive studies of various materials have led to demonstrations of two-qubit logic in gallium arsenide(5), silicon(6-12) and germanium(13). However, interconnecting larger numbers of qubits in semiconductor devices has remained a challenge. Here we demonstrate a four-qubit quantum processor based on hole spins in germanium quantum dots. Furthermore, we define the quantum dots in a two-by-two array and obtain controllable coupling along both directions. Qubit logic is implemented all-electrically and the exchange interaction can be pulsed to freely program one-qubit, two-qubit, three-qubit and four-qubit operations, resulting in a compact and highly connected circuit. We execute a quantum logic circuit that generates a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and we obtain coherent evolution by incorporating dynamical decoupling. These results are a step towards quantum error correction and quantum simulation using quantum dots.

TI A three-user fully connected quantum network based on hyperentanglement
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Hyperentanglement, as a high-dimensional quantum entanglement phenomenon with multiple degrees of freedom, plays a critical role in quantum communication, quantum computing, and high-dimensional quantum state manipulation. Unlike entangled states in a single degree of freedom, hyperentangled states establish entanglement relationships simultaneously in multiple degrees of freedom, such as polarization, path, and orbital angular momentum. Through entanglement-based distribution techniques, high-dimensional quantum information networks can be constructed. On this basis, a fully connected quantum network with hyperentanglement is constructed in this work, and the polarization and time-bin degree-of-freedom hyperentanglement is realized through the process of second-harmonic generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide cascades. The hyperentangled state is then multiplexed into a single-mode fiber by using dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) technology for transmission to terminal users. The quality of the entangled states in the two degrees of freedom is characterized using Franson-type interference and photon-pair coincidence measurement techniques. Polarization entangled states are subjected to quantum state tomography, and entanglement distribution technology is employed to achieve long-distance distribution and quantum key transmission within the network. Experimental results show that the two-photon interference visibility of both polarization and time-bin entanglement is greater than 95%, demonstrating the high quality of the hyperentanglement in the network. After 100-km-entanglement distribution, the fidelity of the quantum states in both degrees of freedom remains above 88%, indicating the effectiveness of long-distance entanglement distribution in this network. Additionally, it is verified that this network supports the distribution of quantum keys over a distance of more than 50 km between users. These results confirm the feasibility of a fully connected quantum network with hyperentanglement and demonstrate the potential for constructing large-scale metropolitan networks by using hyperentanglement. As a higher-dimensional entanglement, hyperentangled states can significantly enhance the capacity and efficiency of quantum information processing. Although the quantum communication is still in its early stages of development, achieving stable storage and transmission of entangled states in large-scale metropolitan networks remains a great challenge. By utilizing the frequency conversion properties and high integration characteristics of the periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides, the three-user hyperentangled quantum network constructed in this work provides a new solution for developing the large-scale metropolitan networks with high-dimensional quantum information networks. It is expected to provide a new platform for quantum tasks such as superdense coding and quantum teleportation.

TI Quantum discord and entanglement in radiative capture reactions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of quantum correlations in radiative-capture reactions through a unified lens of quantum information theory and nuclear physics. By combining density matrix formulations with open quantum system dynamics, we can establish universal scaling laws governing the relationship between quantum discord (D), entanglement entropy (5), and fundamental nuclear properties. The analysis reveals the inverse power-law dependencies D alpha Gamma(-0.83 +/- 0.04) and S alpha Gamma(-1.12 +/- 0.06) between these quantum metrics and the decay width (Gamma), maintained across fourteen nuclear systems spanning six decades in I and masses 2 <= A <= 56 A machine learning architecture that integrates physical constraints with deep residual networks achieves 92% prediction accuracy for coherence lengths Le while identifying shell structure effects that enhance quantum correlations near magic numbers. The persistent quantum discord (D > 0.3) observed in systems with sub-attometer coherence lengths suggests nuclear spins maintain non-classical correlations through internal degrees of freedom rather than spatial coherence. The developed phase diagram categorizes nuclear reactions into three quantum technology regimes: memory (Q > 10(20) s(-1)) sensing (10(18) < Q < 10(20) s(-1)) and foundational tests (Q < 10(18) s(-1)) , with Fe(n,gamma) and Li-6(n,gamma) identified as optimal candidates for applications. These results bridge nuclear physics with quantum information science, providing both theoretical insights into decoherence mechanisms and practical tools for quantum material design. The proposed methodology establishes radiative capture reactions as a novel platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena in strongly interacting systems.

TI Building Qutrit Diagonal Gates from Phase Gadgets

CL Univ Oxford, Oxford, ENGLAND

AB Phase gadgets have proved to be an indispensable tool for reasoning about ZX-diagrams, being used in optimisation and simulation of quantum circuits and the theory of measurement-based quantum computation. In this paper we study phase gadgets for qutrits. We present the flexsymmetric variant of the original qutrit ZX-calculus, which allows for rewriting that is closer in spirit to the original (qubit) ZX-calculus. In this calculus phase gadgets look as you would expect, but there are non-trivial differences in their properties. We devise new qutrit-specific tricks to extend the graphical Fourier theory of qubits, resulting in a translation between the 'additive' phase gadgets and a 'multiplicative' counterpart we dub phase multipliers.This enables us to generalise the qubit notion of multiple-control to qutrits in two ways. The first type is controlling on a single tritstring, while the second type applies the gate a number of times equal to the tritwise multiplication modulo 3 of the control qutrits. We show how both types of control can be implemented for any qutrit Z or X phase gate, ancilla-free, and using only Clifford and phase gates. The first requires a polynomial number of gates and exponentially small phases, while the second requires an exponential number of gates, but constant sized phases. This is interesting, because such a construction is not possible in the qubit setting.As an application of these results we find a construction for emulating arbitrary qubit diagonal unitaries, and specifically find an ancilla-free emulation for the qubit CCZ gate that only requires three single-qutrit non-Clifford gates - provably lower than the four T gates needed for qubits with ancilla.

SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB We study mathematical, physical and computational aspects of the stabilizer formalism arising in quantum information and quantum computation. The measurement process of Pauli observables with its algorithm is given. It is shown that to detect genuine entanglement we need a full set of stabilizer generators and the stabilizer witness is coarser than the GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) witness. We discuss stabilizer codes and construct a stabilizer code from a given linear code. We also discuss quantum error correction, error recovery criteria and syndrome extraction. The symplectic structure of the stabilizer formalism is established and it is shown that any stabilizer code is unitarily equivalent to a trivial code. The structure of graph codes as stabilizer codes is identified by obtaining the respective stabilizer generators. The distance of embeddable stabilizer codes in lattices is obtained. We discuss the Knill-Gottesman theorem, tableau representation and frame representation. The runtime of simulating stabilizer gates is obtained by applying stabilizer matrices. Furthermore, an algorithm for updating global phases is given. Resolution of quantum channels into stabilizer channels is shown. We discuss capacity achieving codes to obtain the capacity of the quantum erasure channel. Finally, we discuss the shadow tomography problem and an algorithm for constructing classical shadow is given.

TI Quantum channel correction outperforming direct transmission
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Long-distance optical quantum channels are necessarily lossy, leading to errors in transmitted quantum information, entanglement degradation and, ultimately, poor protocol performance. Quantum states carrying information in the channel can be probabilistically amplified to compensate for loss, but are destroyed when amplification fails. Quantum correction of the channel itself is therefore required, but break-even performance-where arbitrary states can be better transmitted through a corrected channel than an uncorrected one-has so far remained out of reach. Here we perform distillation by heralded amplification to improve a noisy entanglement channel. We subsequently employ entanglement swapping to demonstrate that arbitrary quantum information transmission is unconditionally improved-i.e., without relying on postselection or post-processing of data-compared to the uncorrected channel. In this way, it represents realization of a genuine quantum relay. Our channel correction for single-mode quantum states will find use in quantum repeater, communication and metrology applications.
   Quantum channel correction could provide a remedy to unavoidable losses in long-distance quantum communication, but the break-even point has escaped demonstration so far. Here, the authors fill this gap using distillation by heralded amplification, followed by teleportation of entanglement.

TI Singular Value Decomposition Quantum Algorithm for Quantum Biology
SO ACS PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AU
AB There has been a recent interest in quantum algorithms for the modeling and prediction of nonunitary quantum dynamics using current quantum computers. The field of quantum biology is one area where these algorithms could prove to be useful as biological systems are generally intractable to treat in their complete form but amenable to an open quantum systems approach. Here, we present the application of a recently developed singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm to two systems in quantum biology: excitonic energy transport through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex and the radical pair mechanism for avian navigation. We demonstrate that the SVD algorithm is capable of capturing accurate short- and long-time dynamics for these systems through implementation on a quantum simulator and conclude that while the implementation of this algorithm is beyond the reach of current quantum computers, it has the potential to be an effective tool for the future study of systems relevant to quantum biology.

AB Quantum communication networks are emerging as a promising technology that could constitute a key building block in future communication networks in the 6G era and beyond. These networks have an inherent feature of parallelism that allows them to boost the capacity and enhance the security of communication systems. Recent advances led to the deployment of small- and large-scale quantum communication networks with real quantum hardware. In quantum networks, entanglement is a key resource that allows for data transmission between different nodes. However, to reap the benefits of entanglement and enable efficient quantum communication, the number of generated entangled pairs must be optimized. Indeed, if the entanglement generation rates are not optimized, then some of these valuable resources will be discarded and lost. In this paper, the problem of optimizing the entanglement generation rates and their distribution over a quantum memory is studied. In particular, a quantum network in which users have heterogeneous distances and applications is considered. This problem is posed as a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization problem whose goal is to efficiently utilize the available quantum memory by distributing the quantum entangled pairs in a way that maximizes the user satisfaction. An interior point optimization method is used to solve the optimization problem and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Simulation results show the key design considerations for efficient quantum networks, and the effect of different network parameters on the network performance.

AB Quantum walk has been regarded as a primitive to universal quantum computation. In this paper, we demonstrate the realization of the universal set of quantum gates on two- and three-qubit systems by using the operations required to describe the single particle discrete-time quantum walk on a position space. The idea is to utilize the effective Hilbert space of the single qubit and the position space on which it evolves in order to realize multi-qubit states and universal set of quantum gates on them. Realization of many non-trivial gates and engineering arbitrary states is simpler in the proposed quantum walk model when compared to the circuit based model of computation. We will also discuss the scalability of the model and some propositions for using lesser number of qubits in realizing larger qubit systems.

TI A two-step linear programming approach for repeater placement in
   large-scale quantum networks
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Thanks to the applications such as Quantum Key Distribution and Distributed Quantum Computing, the deployment of quantum networks is gaining great momentum. A major component in quantum networks is repeaters, which are essential for reducing the error rate of qubit transmission for long-distance links. However, repeaters are expensive devices, so minimizing the number of repeaters placed in a quantum network while satisfying performance requirements becomes an important problem. Existing solutions typically solve this problem optimally by formulating an Integer Linear Program (ILP). However, the number of variables in their ILPs is O(n(2)), where n is the number of nodes in a network. This incurs infeasible running time when the network scale is large. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes to solve the repeater placement problem by two steps, with each step using a linear program of a much smaller scale with O(n) variables. Although this solution is not optimal, it dramatically reduces the time complexity, making it practical for large-scale networks. Moreover, it constructs networks that have higher node connectivity than those by existing solutions, since it deploys slightly more number of repeaters into networks. Our extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world network topologies verified our claims.

TI Non-classical computing problems: Toward novel type of quantum computing
   problems
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum teleportation draws our attention to propose a new type of problems which can not be solved using classical computers. In this paper, we propose one of these problems. Concretely, this paper extends the definition of Deutsch's problem to decide whether a black box U-f applied on a given unknown qubit alpha vertical bar 0) + beta vertical bar 1), such that vertical bar alpha vertical bar > 0, vertical bar beta vertical bar > 0, and vertical bar alpha vertical bar not equal vertical bar beta vertical bar, is constant or balanced Boolean function, besides, estimation of vertical bar alpha vertical bar and vertical bar beta vertical bar. Although, this problem is very simple but it can not be solved using classical computers, because qubit can not be implemented physically using classical computers. A novel quantum algorithm based on principle of entanglement measure is proposed to solve this problem. IBMs 5-qubit quantum computer (ibmqx4) is used to realize the proposed algorithm experimentally.

TI Performance of entanglement-assisted quantum codes with noisy ebits over
   asymmetric and memory channels
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Entanglement-assisted quantum error correction codes (EAQECCs) play an important role in quantum communications with noise. Such a scheme can use arbitrary classical linear code to transmit qubits over noisy quantum channels by consuming some ebits between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob). It is usually assumed that the preshared ebits of Bob are error free. However, noise on these ebits is unavoidable in many cases. In this work, we evaluate the performance of EAQECCs with noisy ebits over asymmetric quantum channels and quantum channels with memory by computing the exact entanglement fidelity of several EAQECCs. We consider asymmetric errors in both qubits and ebits and show that the performance of EAQECCs in entanglement fidelity gets improved for qubits and ebits over asymmetric channels. In quantum memory channels, we compute the entanglement fidelity of several EAQECCs over Markovian quantum memory channels and show that the performance of EAQECCs is lowered down by the channel memory. Furthermore, we show that the performance of EAQECCs is diverse when the error probabilities of qubits and ebits are different. In both asymmetric and memory quantum channels, we show that the performance of EAQECCs is improved largely when the error probability of ebits is reasonably smaller than that of qubits.

TI Non-adaptive measurement-based quantum computation on IBM Q
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We test the quantumness of IBM's quantum computer IBM Quantum System One in Ehningen, Germany. We generate generalised n-qubit GHZ states and measure Bell inequalities to investigate the n-party entanglement of the GHZ states. The implemented Bell inequalities are derived from non-adaptive measurement-based quantum computation (NMQC), a type of quantum computing that links the successful computation of a non-linear function to the violation of a multipartite Bell-inequality. The goal is to compute a multivariate Boolean function that clearly differentiates non-local correlations from local hidden variables (LHVs). Since it has been shown that LHVs can only compute linear functions, whereas quantum correlations are capable of outputting every possible Boolean function it thus serves as an indicator of multipartite entanglement. Here, we compute various non-linear functions with NMQC on IBM's quantum computer IBM Quantum System One and thereby demonstrate that the presented method can be used to characterize quantum devices. We find a violation for a maximum of seven qubits and compare our results to an existing implementation of NMQC using photons.

TI Research progress of ion trap quantum computing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Ion trap is one of the leading physical platforms to implement quantum computation. Currently, highfidelity elementary quantum operations above the fault -tolerant threshold, including state preparation, measurement and universal gates, have been demonstrated for tens of ionic qubits. One important future research direction is to further enlarge the qubit number to the scale required for solving practical problems while maintaining the high performance of individual qubits. This paper introduces the current mainstream schemes for scalable ion trap quantum computation like quantum charge -coupled device (QCCD) and ionphoton quantum network, and describes the main limiting factors in current research. Then we further explore new schemes to scale up the qubit number like two-dimensional ion crystals and dual -type qubit, and discuss the future research directions.

This paper addresses the complexity of protecting these critical infrastructures against future quantum attacks while considering operational sustainability. We begin with an overview of the current landscape, identify the main vulnerabilities in mobile networks, and evaluate existing security solutions with new post-quantum cryptography (PQC) methods. We then present a quantum-secure architecture with PQC and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) tailored explicitly for sustainable mobile networks and illustrate its applicability with several use cases that emphasize the need for advanced protection measures in this new era. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of PQC algorithm families is presented, focusing on their suitability for integration in mobile environments, with particular attention to the trade-offs between energy consumption and security improvements. Finally, recommendations for strengthening mobile networks against quantum threats are provided through a detailed examination of current challenges and opportunities.

TI Systematic literature review: Quantum machine learning and its
   applications
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Quantum physics has changed the way we understand our environment, and one of its branches, quantum mechanics, has demonstrated accurate and consistent theoretical results. Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum mechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic particles (photons, electrons, etc.) for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for large-scale information processing. These advantages are achieved through the use of quantum features, such as entanglement or superposition. These capabilities can give quantum computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical computers. Nowadays, scientific challenges are impossible to perform by classical computation due to computational complexity (more bytes than atoms in the observable universe) or the time it would take (thousands of years), and quantum computation is the only known answer. However, current quantum devices do not have yet the necessary qubits and are not fault -tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are other fields like machine learning, finance, or chemistry where quantum computation could be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a review of the literature published between 2017 and 2023 to identify, analyze, and classify the different types of algorithms used in quantum machine learning and their applications. The methodology follows the guidelines related to Systematic Literature Review methods, such as the one proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the software engineering field. Consequently, this study identified 94 articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms and shows their implementation using computational quantum circuits or ansatzs. The main types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k -nearest neighbor model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks. One of the most relevant applications in the machine learning field is image classification. Many articles, especially within the classification, try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential. An improvement in quantum hardware is required for this potential to be achieved since the existing quantum computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to achieve its full potential.

TI Efficient parallelization of tensor network contraction for simulating
   quantum computation
SO NATURE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB We develop an algorithmic framework for contracting tensor networks and demonstrate its power by classically simulating quantum computation of sizes previously deemed out of reach. Our main contribution, index slicing, is a method that efficiently parallelizes the contraction by breaking it down into much smaller and identically structured subtasks, which can then be executed in parallel without dependencies. We benchmark our algorithm on a class of random quantum circuits, achieving greater than 10(5) times acceleration over the original estimate of the simulation cost. We then demonstrate applications of the simulation framework for aiding the development of quantum algorithms and quantum error correction. As tensor networks are widely used in computational science, our simulation framework may find further applications.

Performance analysis showed that the effectiveness of error correction depends more on the frequency of six-length cycles than on girth, suggesting a new direction for optimization. The study emphasizes the transformative potential of quasi-geometric strategies in improving quantum communication by focusing on bit and quantum bit error rates within both stabilizer and classical frameworks. Future work focuses on integrating hybrid quantum-classical codes to raise error resilience and efficiency, addressing challenges like decoding instability, and limited orthogonality to enable reliable and computational quantum communication systems.

TI Optimal routing and end-to-end entanglement distribution in quantum
   networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum networks are designed to transmit quantum bits (qubits) among quantum devices to enable new network resources for the applications. Entanglement distribution and entanglement swapping are fundamental procedures that are required in several network operations. However, they are probabilistic operations, which can lead to severe network performance degradation. This article investigates the engineering problem of resource allocation in quantum networks, considering factors like entanglement distribution probability, quantum memory characteristics, and fidelity. We model this as an optimization model to obtain an optimal solution. In particular, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) and develop a heuristic algorithm, aiming to minimize the number of required entangled qubit pairs (Bell pairs or EPR pairs) in any adjacent pair in the quantum network. Extensive simulations are performed to compare the performance of proposed ILP and heuristic. In all the cases, the heuristic produces a comparable solution to the optimal one. Simulation results ensure that the value of maximum utilized Bell pairs in a quantum network highly depends on the value of the probability of entangled pairs established, considering the time in the quantum memory besides the number of incoming requests.

TI Selection of entanglement state in quantum repeater process
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The decoherence of entanglement states stored in quantum memory is a major obstacle when implementing a quantum repeater. So far, the electron spins in quantum dots are usually utilized to construct entangled states in quantum repeater. In the quantum repeater process, the distance between quantum dots is large, so the interaction between them can be neglected. Thus the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and its neighbor nuclear spins in the quantum dot is considered to be the main reason for the decoherence of the system. In early researches, the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and its neighbor nuclear spins was considered as an effective magnetic field whose magnitude and direction are random and the magnitude follows the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we simultaneously consider an applied magnetic field and the interaction between the electron spin and its neighbor nuclear spins, and investigate the decoherence of the quantum repeater of two quantum dots. We first solve the time evolution of the system by the numerical method, and the result shows that when the applied magnetic field is increased to a certain value, the four Bell states can be divided into two kinds, each with two Bell states. The system cannot transit from the Bell state in one kind to that in the other kind, but can transit between two Bell states with in the same kind. This effectively improves the fidelity of the initial state and suppresses the decoherence of the system. For a given applied magnetic field with large magnitude, we theoretically study the effect of the fluctuation of nuclear spin on the entangled state, and give an analytical expression for each of the fidelity and the decoherence time of the initial state. We show that the decoherence times of the four Bell states are the same, but the time evolutions of the Bell states belonging to different kinds are different obviously. The fidelity of two Bell states not only decays exponentially but also oscillates rapidly, so such two Bell states are difficult to be manipulated and not suggested in quantum repeater process. The results in this paper are expected to provide theoretical suggestions for selecting the entangled states in quantum repeater.

In this study, we improve the performance of asymmetric MDI-QKD using numerical analysis techniques. Simulation results show a twofold increase in tolerance to basis misalignment compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Specifically, for instances of substantial basis misalignment, the key rate increases by an order of magnitude, and the maximum communication distance extends by 20 km. Our work significantly enhances the robustness and feasibility of asymmetric MDI-QKD, thereby promoting the widespread deployment of MDI-QKD networks.

Advancements in integrated photonics are expected to further enhance these capabilities as the technology evolves from few-photon architectures to systems capable of generating and processing tens, possibly hundreds, of photons, marking critical progress toward scalable quantum information processing. Although each integrated platform has its own unique advantages and limitations, thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics has recently emerged as a strong contender thanks to its low-loss characteristics, large electro-optic and nonlinear coefficients, broad transparency window, and ultra-fast modulation capabilities. In this review, we examine the latest developments in TFLN quantum photonics and identify promising directions and challenges for future research in this field.

TI Virtual Photon-Mediated Quantum State Transfer and Remote Entanglement
   between Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots Using Superadiabatic Pulses
SO ENTROPY
AB Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are an attractive candidate for scalable quantum information processing. Reliable quantum state transfer and entanglement between spatially separated spin qubits is a highly desirable but challenging goal. Here, we propose a fast and high-fidelity quantum state transfer scheme for two spin qubits mediated by virtual microwave photons. Our general strategy involves using a superadiabatic pulse to eliminate non-adiabatic transitions, without the need for increased control complexity. We show that arbitrary quantum state transfer can be achieved with a fidelity of 95.1% within a 60 ns short time under realistic parameter conditions. We also demonstrate the robustness of this scheme to experimental imperfections and environmental noises. Furthermore, this scheme can be directly applied to the generation of a remote Bell entangled state with a fidelity as high as 97.6%. These results pave the way for fault-tolerant quantum computation on spin quantum network architecture platforms.

TI Advantage of deterministic entanglement transmission on Gaussian-state
   quantum networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB The promising future of the quantum internet hinges on how we scale entanglement distribution on quantum networks (QNs). Classical entanglement percolation (CEP) offers a simple approach for this but is limited by 'classical' scaling laws, while deterministic entanglement transmission (DET) leverages the determinacy of quantum protocols to achieve a more effective 'quantum' scaling. This advantage is, however, unexplored for Gaussian-state QNs, where the infinite-dimensional, continuous-variable states are often required to be first prepared into qubits or qudits via additional conversions. This overhead raises a question: can DET's quantum advantage survive in a practical Gaussian-to-qudit conversion process? To answer this, we analyze both DET and CEP across a spectrum of conversion strategies, from best-case theoretical limits to probabilistic, practical projections. We find that DET's superiority is robust: even a DET scheme burdened by the overhead of practical projective conversions consistently outperforms CEP endowed with theoretically perfect conversion. Our work thus provides a possible roadmap, demonstrating that the quantum-native approach of DET could be the key to unlocking the potential of long-range quantum communication.

TI Near-Term Spin-Qubit Architecture Design via Multipartite Maximally
   Entangled States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The design and benchmarking of quantum computer architectures traditionally rely on practical hardware restrictions, such as gate fidelities, control, and cooling. At the theoretical and software levels, numerous approaches have been proposed for benchmarking quantum devices, ranging from, inter alia, quantum volume to randomized benchmarking. In this work, we utilize the quantum information-theoretic properties of multipartite maximally entangled quantum states, in addition to their correspondence with quantum error-correction codes, permitting us to quantify the entanglement generated on near-term bilinear spin-qubit architectures. For this aim, we introduce four metrics that ascertain the quality of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement, along with circuit-level fidelity measures. As part of the task of executing a quantum circuit on a device, we devise simulations, which combine expected hardware characteristics of spin-qubit devices with appropriate compilation techniques; we then analyze three different architectural choices of varying lattice sizes for bilinear arrays, under three increasingly realistic noise models. We find that if the use of a compiler is assumed, sparsely connected spin-qubit lattices can approach comparable values of our metrics to those of the most highly connected device architecture. Even more surprisingly, by incorporating crosstalk into our last noise model, we find that, as error rates for crosstalk approach realistic values, the benefits of utilizing a bilinear array with advanced connectivity vanish. Our results highlight the limitations of adding local connectivity to near-term spin-qubit devices, and can be readily adapted to other qubit technologies. The framework developed here can be used for analyzing quantum entanglement on a device before fabrication, informing experimentalists on concomitant realistic expectations.

TI The power of qutrits for non-adaptive measurement-based quantum
   computing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Non-locality is not only one of the most prominent quantum features but can also serve as a resource for various information-theoretical tasks. Analysing it from an information-theoretical perspective has linked it to applications such as non-adaptive measurement-based quantum computing (NMQC). In this type of quantum computing the goal is to output a multivariate function. The success of such a computation can be related to the violation of a generalised Bell inequality. So far, the investigation of binary NMQC with qubits has shown that quantum correlations can compute all Boolean functions using at most 2(n) - 1 qubits, whereas local hidden variables (LHVs) are restricted to linear functions. Here, we extend these results to NMQC with qutrits and prove that quantum correlations enable the computation of all three-valued logic functions using the generalised qutrit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as a resource and at most 3(n) - 1 qutrits. This yields a corresponding generalised GHZ type paradox for any three-valued logic function that LHVs cannot compute. We give an example for an n-variate function that can be computed with only n + 1 qutrits, which leads to convenient generalised qutrit Bell inequalities whose quantum bound is maximal. Finally, we prove that not all functions can be computed efficiently with qutrit NMQC by presenting a counterexample.

TI A critical analysis of deployed use cases for quantum key distribution
   and comparison with post-quantum cryptography
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is currently being discussed as a technology to safeguard communication in a future where quantum computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive security evaluation of QKD-based solutions, focusing on real-world use cases sourced from academic literature and industry reports. We analyze these use cases, assess their security and identify the possible advantages of deploying QKD-based solutions. We further compare QKD-based solutions with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), the alternative approach to achieving security when quantum computers compromise traditional public-key cryptosystems, evaluating their respective suitability for each scenario. Based on this comparative analysis, we critically discuss and comment on which use cases QKD is suited for, considering factors such as implementation complexity, scalability, and long-term security. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role QKD could play in future cryptographic infrastructures and offer guidance to decision-makers considering the deployment of QKD.

AB A scalable architecture for quantum computing requires logical units supporting quantum-error correction. In this respect, magnetic molecules are particularly promising, since they allow one to define logical qubits with embedded quantum-error correction by exploiting multiple energy levels of a single molecule. The single-object nature of this encoding is expected to facilitate the implementation of error correction procedures and logical operations. In this work, we make progress in this direction by showing how two-qubit gates between error-protected units can be realised, by means of easily implementable sequences of electro-magnetic pulses.

TI A Method to Compute the Schrieffer-Wolff Generator for Analysis of

AB Quantum illumination uses entangled light that consists of signal and idler modes to achieve higher detection rate of a low-reflective object in noisy environments. The best performance of quantum illumination can be achieved by measuring the returned signal mode together with the idler mode. Thus, it is necessary to prepare a quantum memory that can keep the idler mode ideal. To send a signal towards a long-distance target, entangled light in the microwave regime is used. There was a recent demonstration of a microwave quantum memory using microwave cavities coupled with a transmon qubit. We propose an ordering of bosonic operators to efficiently compute the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation generator to analyze the quantum memory. Our proposed method is applicable to a wide class of systems described by bosonic operators whose interaction part represents a definite number of transfer in quanta.</p>

TI The controlled SWAP test for determining quantum entanglement
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum entanglement is essential to the development of quantum computation, communications, and technology. The controlled SWAP test, widely used for state comparison, can be adapted to an efficient and useful test for entanglement of a pure state. Here we show that the test can evidence the presence of entanglement (and further, genuine n-qubit entanglement), can distinguish entanglement classes, and that the concurrence of a two-qubit state is related to the test's output probabilities. We also propose a multipartite measure of entanglement that acts similarly for n-qubit states. The average number of copies of the test state required to detect entanglement decreases for larger systems, to four on average for many (n greater than or similar to 8) qubits for maximally entangled states. For non-maximally entangled states, the number of copies required to detect entanglement increases with decreasing entanglement. Furthermore, the results are robust to second order when typical small errors are introduced to the state under investigation.

TI Swapping of Quantum Correlations and the Role of Local Filtering
   Operations
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The swapping of various quantum correlation measures is addressed including, Bell-nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, usefulness for teleportation, and entanglement, as well as quantum obesity as a quantum correlation more general than entanglement. The effects that local filtering operations have on the swapping of such correlations are particularly focused. Based on a generalization of entanglement swapping with arbitrary two-qubit states and arbitrary measurements, analytical formulae for the swapping of two-qudit as well as multi-qubit quantum states are derived and the exact amount of quantum obesity that is swapped is provided. Then, in order to enhance the final amount of correlations in the post-swapping two-qubit state, the action of local filters before as well as after the swapping protocol is explored. In this regard, it is conjectured that applying local filters first is more efficient. This is supported by an analytical proof on the quantum obesity of almost Bell-diagonal states, as well as numerical evidence for all the considered quantum correlations of arbitrary X-form states.

TI Noncyclic Geometric Quantum Gates with Smooth Paths via Invariant-Based
   Shortcuts
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation is dedicated to the realization of high-fidelity and robust quantum gates, which are necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, it is limited by cyclic and mutative evolution path, which usually requires longer gate-time and abrupt pulse control, weakening the gate performance. Here, a scheme to realize geometric quantum gates with noncyclic and nonadiabatic evolution via invariant-based shortcuts is proposed, where universal quantum gates can be induced in one step without path mutation and the gate time is also effectively shortened. Our numerical simulations show that, comparing with the conventional dynamical gates, the constructed geometric gates have stronger resistance not only to systematic errors, induced by both qubit-frequency drift and the deviation of the amplitude of the driving fields, but also to environment-induced decoherence effect. In addition, this scheme can also be implemented on a superconducting circuit platform, with the fidelities of single-qubit and two-qubit gates higher than 99.97% and 99.84%, respectively. Therefore, this scheme provides a promising way to realize high-fidelity fault-tolerant quantum gates for scalable quantum computation.

AB Checking whether two quantum circuits are equivalent is important for the design and optimization of quantum-computer applications with real-world devices. We consider quantum circuits consisting of Clifford gates, a practically-relevant subset of all quantum operations which is large enough to exhibit quantum features such as entanglement and forms the basis of, for example, quantum-error correction and many quantum-network applications. We present a deterministic algorithm that is based on a folklore mathematical result and demonstrate that it is capable of outperforming previously considered state-of-the-art method. In particular, given two Clifford circuits as sequences of singleand two-qubit Clifford gates, the algorithm checks their equivalence in O(n center dot m) time in the number of qubits n and number of elementary Clifford gates m. Using the performant Stim simulator as backend, our implementation checks equivalence of quantum circuits with 1000 qubits (and a circuit depth of 10.000 gates) in similar to 22 s and circuits with 100.000 qubits (depth 10) in similar to 15 min, outperforming the existing SAT-based and path-integral based approaches by orders of magnitude. This approach shows that the correctness of application-relevant subsets of quantum operations can be verified up to large circuits in practice.

TI Quanto: optimizing quantum circuits with automatic generation of circuit

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Existing quantum compilers focus on mapping a logical quantum circuit to a quantum device and its native quantum gates. Only simple circuit identities are used to optimize the quantum circuit during the compilation process. This approach misses more complex circuit identities, which could be used to optimize the quantum circuit further. We propose Quanto, the first quantum optimizer that automatically generates circuit identities. Quanto takes as input a gate set and generates provably correct circuit identities for the gate set. Quanto's automatic generation of circuit identities includes single-qubit and two-qubit gates, which leads to a new database of circuit identities, some of which are novel to the best of our knowledge. In addition to the generation of new circuit identities, Quanto's optimizer applies such circuit identities to quantum circuits and finds optimized quantum circuits that have not been discovered by other quantum compilers, including IBM Qiskit and Cambridge Quantum Computing Tket. Quanto's database of circuit identities could be applied to improve existing quantum compilers and Quanto can be used to generate identity databases for new gate sets.

TI A Novel Approach Based on Quantum Key Distribution Using BB84 and E91
   Protocol for Resilient Encryption and Eavesdropper Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum cryptography is anticipated to drive substantial advancements in cybersecurity. The impending arrival of quantum cryptography compromises current encryption methods, possibly compromising the effectiveness of traditional key management-based security protocols. One fundamental Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, BB84, encounters challenges when operating with fewer Quantum bits (Qubits) and bases that only support up to 8 Qubits. This limitation weakens the system's security, making brute force, intercept, and resend attacks less challenging. Consequently, this study proposes a method to enhance the security of the BB84 protocol, to reduce susceptibility to attacks and eavesdropping. The improved BB84 protocol utilizes 9, 12, and 16 quantum bits along with two, and three bases to significantly bolster security. This allows authorized parties to eliminate the use of compromised keys. Additionally, the study implements the E91 QKD protocol utilizing the Entanglement Pair Generation (EPR) method to produce secure keys. While the existing E91 protocol ensures security through Bell's theorem and Bell's inequality, it overlooks the impact of noise, leading to inaccuracies in eavesdropper detection. To address this, the study introduces an additional security measure. Whenever an eavesdropper attempts to measure the quantum state, the proposed E91 protocol collapses its state from 10) to 11), setting the first Qubit to 1) and the other Qubit to 0), thus providing the eavesdropper with incorrect information, accompanied by a phase angle of 15 pi/8. This leads to a misconception, preventing eavesdroppers from obtaining useful details about transferred quantum states. Additionally, considering that the proposed E91 protocol relies on entangled particles and utilizes double Qubit gates, which are inherently noisier than single Qubit gates and more susceptible to quantum decoherence, this study employs error mitigation techniques during the final measurement to predict outcomes more efficiently.

Recently, the research community has focused considerable effort on the simulation of large-scale quantum networks with the ultimate goal of understanding their general properties, developing technical standards, and estimating their expected performance. However, comparatively little effort has been spent considering how quantum networks may impact tactical scenarios of military relevance where both quantum and classical resources may be severely constrained. Here, we develop a custom framework, called QuanTACT, for quantum network simulation explicitly designed for future integration into existing tactical simulation tools. In particular, our framework extends the existing quantum networking tool, SQUANCH, to include channel models required to simulate deployed fiber environments. Furthermore, we implement the additional subroutines needed to simulate entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) and use published results from various field-deployed QKD experiments to benchmark the performance of our framework.

TI GAN Decoder on a Quantum Toric Code for Noise-Robust Quantum
   Teleportation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A generative adversarial network (GAN)-based decoder is proposed for quantum topological codes and applied it to enhance a quantum teleportation protocol under depolarizing noise. By constructing and training the GAN's generator and discriminator networks using eigenvalue datasets from the code, a decoder is obtained with a significantly improved decoding pseudo-threshold. Simulation results show that the GAN decoder achieves a pseudo-threshold of approximately , estimated from the crossing point of logical error rate curves for code distances and , nearly double that of a classical decoder under the same conditions (). Moreover, at the same target logical error rate, the GAN decoder consistently achieves higher logical fidelity compared to the classical decoder. When applied to quantum teleportation, the protocol optimized using the decoder demonstrates enhanced fidelity across noise regimes. Specifically, for code distance , fidelity improves within the depolarizing noise threshold range ; for , the range extends to . Moreover, with appropriate training, our GAN decoder can generalize to other error models. This work positions GANs as powerful tools for decoding in topological quantum error correction, offering a flexible and noise-resilient framework for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

AB Quantum many-core processors are envisioned as the ultimate solution for the scalability of quantum computers. Based upon Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) chips interconnected in a sort of quantum intranet, they enable large algorithms to be executed on current and close future technology. In order to optimize such architectures, it is crucial to develop tools that allow specific design space explorations. To this aim, in this paper we present a technique to perform a spatio-temporal characterization of quantum circuits running in multi-chip quantum computers. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of the qubit traffic resulting from operations that involve qubits residing in different cores, and hence quantum communication across chips, while also giving importance to the amount of intra-core operations that occur in between those communications. Using specific multi-core performance metrics and a complete set of benchmarks, our analysis showcases the opportunities that the proposed approach may provide to guide the design of multi-core quantum computers and their interconnects.

TI Quantum memory at nonzero temperature in a thermodynamically trivial
   system
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Passive error correction protects logical information forever (in the thermodynamic limit) by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that certain families of constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no thermodynamic phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit ergodicity-breaking dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. Slow Gibbs sampling of such codes enables fault-tolerant passive quantum error correction using finite-depth circuits. This strategy is well suited to measurement-free quantum error correction, and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.

TI Revisiting the Mapping of Quantum Circuits: Entering the Multi-core Era
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computation, offering the potential to solve complex problems intractable for classical computers. Although current quantum processors already consist of a few hundred qubits, their scalability remains a significant challenge. Modular quantum computing architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale up quantum computing systems. This article delves into the critical aspects of distributed multi-core quantum computing, focusing on quantum circuit mapping, a fundamental task to successfully execute quantum algorithms across cores while minimizing inter-core communications. We derive the theoretical bounds on the number of non-local communications needed for random quantum circuits and introduce the Hungarian Qubit Assignment (HQA) algorithm, a multi-core mapping algorithm designed to optimize qubit assignments to cores with the aim of reducing inter-core communications. Our exhaustive evaluation of HQA against state-of-the-art circuit mapping algorithms for modular architectures reveals a 4.9x and 1.6x improvement in terms of execution time and non-local communications, respectively, compared to the best-performing algorithm. HQA emerges as a very promising scalable approach for mapping quantum circuits into multi-core architectures, positioning it as a valuable tool for harnessing the potential of quantum computing at scale.

TI An exponentially-growing family of universal quantum circuits
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning has become an area of growing interest but has certain theoretical and hardware-specific limitations. Notably, the problem of vanishing gradients, or barren plateaus, renders the training impossible for circuits with high qubit counts, imposing a limit on the number of qubits that data scientists can use for solving problems. Independently, angle-embedded supervised quantum neural networks were shown to produce truncated Fourier series with a degree directly dependent on two factors: the depth of the encoding and the number of parallel qubits the encoding applied to. The degree of the Fourier series limits the model expressivity. This work introduces two new architectures whose Fourier degrees grow exponentially: the sequential and parallel exponential quantum machine learning architectures. This is done by efficiently using the available Hilbert space when encoding, increasing the expressivity of the quantum encoding. Therefore, the exponential growth allows staying at the low-qubit limit to create highly expressive circuits avoiding barren plateaus. Practically, parallel exponential architecture was shown to outperform the existing linear architectures by reducing their final mean square error value by up to 44.7% in a one-dimensional test problem. Furthermore, the feasibility of this technique was also shown on a trapped ion quantum processing unit.

TI Whole-Device Entanglement in a 65-Qubit Superconducting Quantum Computer
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The ability to generate large-scale entanglement is an important progenitor of quantum information processing capability in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this paper, the extent to which entangled quantum states over large numbers of qubits can be prepared on current superconducting quantum devices is investigated. Native-graph states on the IBM Quantum 65-qubit ibmq_manhattan device and the 53-qubit ibmq_rochester device are prepared and quantum readout-error mitigation (QREM) is applied. Connected entanglement graphs spanning each of the full devices are detected, indicating bipartite entanglement over the whole of each device. The application of QREM is shown to increase the observed entanglement within all measurements, in particular, the detected number of entangled pairs of qubits found within ibmq_rochester increases from 31 to 56 of the total 58 connected pairs. The results of this work indicate full bipartite entanglement in two of the largest superconducting devices to date.

TI Optical driving, spin initialization and readout of single
   SiV- centers in a Fabry-Perot resonator
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Large-scale quantum communication networks require quantum repeaters due to the signal attenuation in optical fibers. Ideal quantum repeater nodes efficiently link a quantum memory with photons serving as flying qubits. Color centers in diamond, particularly the negatively charged silicon vacancy center, are promising candidates to establish such nodes. Inefficient connection between the color center's spin to the optical fiber networks is a major obstacle, that could be resolved by utilizing optical resonators. Here, we couple individual silicon vacancy centers incorporated in a nanodiamond to a hemispherical, stable Fabry-Perot microcavity, achieving Purcell-factors larger than 1. We demonstrate coherent optical driving between ground and excited state with a Rabi-frequency of 330 MHz, all-optical initialization and readout of the electron spin in magnetic fields of up to 3.2 T. Spin initialization within 67 ns with a 80 % fidelity and a lifetime of 350 ns are reached. Our demonstration opens the way to realize quantum repeater applications.

TI Learning Unitary Transformation by Quantum Machine Learning Model
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly rising research field that incorporates ideas from quantum computing and machine learning to develop emerging tools for scientific research and improving data processing. How to efficiently control or manipulate the quantum system is a fundamental and vexing problem in quantum computing. It can be described as learning or approximating a unitary operator. Since the success of the hybrid-based quantum machine learning model proposed in recent years, we investigate to apply the techniques from QML to tackle this problem. Based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism in quantum computing, we transfer the original problem of learning a unitary operator to a min-max optimization problem which can also be viewed as a quantum generative adversarial network. Besides, we select the spectral norm between the target and generated unitary operators as the regularization term in the loss function. Inspired by the hybrid quantum-classical framework widely used in quantum machine learning, we employ the variational quantum circuit and gradient descent based optimizers to solve the min-max optimization problem. In our numerical experiments, the results imply that our proposed method can successfully approximate the desired unitary operator and dramatically reduce the number of quantum gates of the traditional approach. The average fidelity between the states that are produced by applying target and generated unitary on random input states is around 0.997.

The proposed method enables us to perform logical S (Phase gate), T ( pi / 8 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pi /8$$\end{document} gate), and H (Hadamard) with low overhead. Combined with other universal quantum gates, we can implement fault-tolerant quantum computation at the lattice surgery level beyond the gate level while saving considerable resources. We compare our method with previous methods using benchmark circuits by calculating the space and time costs. The proposed method requires additional lines of physical qubits for each encoded patch. Although it slightly increases the space cost for logical H compared to the previous work, it reduces the time cost. In addition, the proposed method decreases the space cost and time cost by introducing a 4-qubit twist defect for logical S and T. Therefore, the overall space-time cost is reduced.

AB We introduce the qudit ZH-calculus and show how to generalise the phase-free qubit rules to qudits. We prove that for prime dimensions d, the phase-free qudit ZH-calculus is universal for matrices over the ring Z[e2 & pi;i/d]. For qubits, there is a strong connection between phase-free ZH-diagrams and Toffoli+Hadamard circuits, a computationally universal fragment of quantum circuits. We generalise this connection to qudits, by finding that the two-qudit |0)-controlled X gate can be used to construct all classical reversible qudit logic circuits in any odd qudit dimension, which for qubits requires the three-qubit Toffoli gate. We prove that our construction is asymptotically optimal up to a logarithmic term. Twenty years after the celebrated result by Shi proving universality of Toffoli+Hadamard for qubits, we prove that circuits of |0)-controlled X and Hadamard gates are approximately universal for qudit quantum computing for any odd prime d, and moreover that phase-free ZH-diagrams correspond precisely to such circuits allowing postselections.

TI Counteracting dephasing in Molecular Nanomagnets by optimized qudit

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Molecular Nanomagnets may enable the implementation of qudit-based quantum error-correction codes which exploit the many spin levels naturally embedded in a single molecule, a promising step towards scalable quantum processors. To fully realize the potential of this approach, a microscopic understanding of the errors corrupting the quantum information encoded in a molecular qudit is essential, together with the development of tailor-made quantum error correction strategies. We address these central points by first studying dephasing effects on the molecular spin qudit produced by the interaction with surrounding nuclear spins, which are the dominant source of errors at low temperatures. Numerical quantum error correction codes are then constructed, by means of a systematic optimization procedure based on simulations of the coupled system-bath dynamics, that provide a striking enhancement of the coherence time of the molecular computational unit. The sequence of pulses needed for the experimental implementation of the codes is finally proposed.

TI Towards quantum-secure software defined networks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The evolution of quantum computers is considered a serious threat to public-key cryptosystems (e.g. RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, etc.). This is indeed a big concern for security of the Internet and other data communication and storage systems. The reason is that public-key schemes are the basis in the generation of shared symmetric keys that are used to perform data encryption/decryption in communication and data transfer protocols. One possible approach to address this issue is to use Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) (instead of public-key schemes) for the ultra-secure generation of symmetric keys. QKD is a physical layer technology that allows two parties (equipped with optical communication interfaces) to generate secure random keys over a quantum channel that is immune to eavesdropping threats. The keys are then used by symmetric encryption schemes (e.g. AES) to encrypt data over classical channels. This allows us to have data encryption/decryption without needing a public-key scheme. However, due to its inherent characteristics, the implementation of QKD has mostly been considered in particular contexts only (e.g. backhaul networks, point-to-point connections, optical networks, etc.). This indeed limits the utility of QKD technology to only some particular applications while it has the potential to be used in a wide range of used cases. Motivated by this (increasing the usability of QKD technology), in this study, the authors propose a model that enables SDN-based networks to utilise QKD technology and provide QKD security service (i.e., random key generation service) to network applications and security protocols in a practical and efficient way. In the proposed approach, secret keys are generated based on the distribution of quantum entanglement between QKD nodes deployed in the network. The significant characteristic of our proposed model is that it does not rely on quantum repeaters to operate. This also improves the efficiency of the employed QKD mechanisms in terms of the key generation rate.
   Quantum computing threatens public-key cryptosystems. QKD may solve this problem. QKD has only been evaluated for certain situations. This restricts QKD technology use. This letter proposes an SDN-IoT QKD paradigm. The suggested method distributes quantum entanglement amongst QKD nodes without quantum repeaters. Key generation efficiency increases.image

TI Entanglement source and quantum memory analysis for
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-rate, high-fidelity entanglement distribution is essential to the creation of a quantum internet, but recent achievements in fiber (248 km at a 9-s-1 rate) and satellite-based (1200 km at a 1.1-s-1 rate) entanglement distribution fall far short of what is needed. Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 054209 (2023)] proposed a means for dramatically increasing entanglement-distribution rates via a scheme they called zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM). ZALM's quantum transmitter employs a pair of Sagnac-configured spontaneous parametric down-converters (SPDCs), channelization via dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, and partial Bell-state measurements (BSMs) to realize a heralded source of frequency-multiplexed polarization-entangled biphotons. Each biphoton is transmitted to Alice and Bob along with a classical message identifying its frequency channel and whether a Ili- singlet or a Ili+ triplet was heralded. Alice's and Bob's quantum receivers then use DWDM filtering and temporal-mode conversion to interface their received biphotons to intracavity color-center quantum memories. This paper delves deeply into ZALM's SPDCs, partial BSMs, and Duan-Kimble loading of Alice's and Bob's quantum memories. Its principal results-the density operators for the SPDC sources and the quantum memories-allow heralding probability, heralding efficiency, and fidelity to be evaluated for both the polarization-entangled biphotons and the loaded quantum memories, thus enabling exploration of the parameter space for optimizing ZALM's performance. Even without a comprehensive optimization analysis, the paper's examples already demonstrate two critical features of the ZALM architecture: (1) the necessity of achieving a near-separable channelized biphoton wave function to ensure that the biphoton sent to Alice and Bob is of high purity; and (2) the premium placed on Alice's and Bob's temporal-mode converters enabling narrowband push-pull memory loading to ensure that the arriving biphoton's state is faithfully transferred to the intracavity color centers.

TI Programming tools for Analogue Quantum Computing in the High-Performance
   Computing Context-A Review
SO QUANTUM
AB Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way: Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities. Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration. Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.

TI Practical Quantum Computing: Solving the Wave Equation Using a Quantum
   Approach
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB In the last few years, several quantum algorithms that try to address the problem of partial differential equation solving have been devised: on the one hand, "direct" quantum algorithms that aim at encoding the solution of the PDE by executing one large quantum circuit; on the other hand, variational algorithms that approximate the solution of the PDE by executing several small quantum circuits and making profit of classical optimisers. In this work, we propose an experimental study of the costs (in terms of gate number and execution time on a idealised hardware created from realistic gate data) associated with one of the "direct" quantum algorithm: the wave equation solver devised in [32]. We show that our implementation of the quantum wave equation solver agrees with the theoretical big-O complexity of the algorithm. We also explain in great detail the implementation steps and discuss some possibilities of improvements. Finally, our implementation proves experimentally that some PDE can be solved on a quantum computer, even if the direct quantum algorithm chosen will require error-corrected quantum chips, which are not believed to be available in the short-term.

TI Unleashing quantum algorithms with Qinterpreter: bridging the gap
   between theory and practice across leading quantum computing platforms
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging and promising fi eld with the potential to transform various research domains including drug design, network technologies, and sustainable energy solutions. Due to the inherent complexity and divergence from classical computing, several major quantum computing libraries have been developed to implement quantum algorithms, namely IBM Qiskit, Amazon Braket, Cirq, PyQuil, and PennyLane. These libraries enable quantum simulations on classical computers and execution on corresponding quantum hardware, such as Qiskit programs on IBM quantum computers. Despite the variations among these platforms, the core concepts remain the same. One notable challenge is the absence of a Python-based quantum interpreter to connect these fi ve frameworks, a gap that remains to be fully addressed. In response, our work introduces a tool called Qinterpreter, accessible through a user-friendly web interface, the Quantum Science Gateway QubitHub, which operates alongside Jupyter Notebooks. Built using the Python Object-Oriented Programming System, Qinterpreter unifies fi es the fi ve wellknown quantum libraries into a single framework. Designed as an educational tool for students and researchers entering the quantum domain, Qinterpreter enables the straightforward development and execution of quantum circuits across such platforms. This work highlights the quantum programming versatility and accessibility of Qinterpreter and underscores our ultimate goal of pervading Quantum Computing through younger, less specialized, and diverse cultural and national communities.

TI Exploring the application of quantum technologies to industrial and
   real-world use cases
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Recent advancements in quantum computing are leading to an era of practical utility, enabling the tackling of increasingly complex problems. The goal of this era is to leverage quantum computing to solve real-world problems in fields such as machine learning, optimization, and material simulation, using revolutionary quantum methods and machines. All this progress has been achieved even while being immersed in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, characterized by the current devices' inability to process medium-scale complex problems efficiently. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in quantum algorithms in various fields. Multiple factors have played a role in this extraordinary development, with three being particularly noteworthy: (i) the development of larger devices with enhanced interconnections between their constituent qubits, (ii) the development of specialized frameworks, and (iii) the existence of well-known or ready-to-use hybrid schemes that simplify the method development process. In this context, this manuscript presents and overviews some recent contributions within this paradigm, showcasing the potential of quantum computing to emerge as a significant research catalyst in the fields of machine learning and optimization in the coming years.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for node embedding
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning has made remarkable progress in many important tasks. However, the gate complexity of the initial state preparation is seldom considered in lots of quantum machine learning algorithms, making them non-end-to-end. Herein, we propose a quantum algorithm for the node embedding problem that maps a node graph's topological structure to embedding vectors. The resulting quantum embedding state can be used as an input for other quantum machine learning algorithms. With O(log(N)) qubits to store the information of N nodes, our algorithm will not lose quantum advantage for the subsequent quantum information processing. Moreover, owing to the use of a parameterized quantum circuit with O(poly(log(N))) depth, the resulting state can serve as an efficient quantum database. In addition, we explored the measurement complexity of the quantum node embedding algorithm, which is the main issue in training parameters, and extended the algorithm to capture high-order neighborhood information between nodes. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated our algorithm on an nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor to solve a graph model.

AB We propose a dephasing-tolerant protocol for quantum sensing of transverse magnetic fields which exploits spin qudit sensors with embedded fault-tolerant (FT) quantum error correction. By exploiting longitudinal drives, the transverse field induces logical Rabi oscillations between encoded states, whose frequency is linear in the transverse field to be probed. Numerical simulations show that the present FT protocol enables the detection of very small fields, orders of magnitudes below the limit imposed by the coherence time.

TI A Single-Step Multiclass SVM Based on Quantum Annealing for Remote
   Sensing Data Classification
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB In recent years, the development of quantum annealers has enabled experimental demonstrations and has increased research interest in applications of quantum annealing, such as in quantum machine learning and in particular for the popular quantum support vector machine (SVM). Several versions of the quantum SVM have been proposed, and quantum annealing has been shown to be effective in them. Extensions to multiclass problems have also been made, which consist of an ensemble of multiple binary classifiers. This article proposes a novel quantum SVM formulation for direct multiclass classification based on quantum annealing, called quantum multiclass SVM (QMSVM). The multiclass classification problem is formulated as a single quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem solved with quantum annealing. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and time performance of this approach. Experiments have been performed on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer for a classification problem on remote sensing data. Results indicate that, despite the memory demands of the quantum annealer, QMSVM can achieve an accuracy that is comparable to standard SVM methods, such as the one-versus-one (OVO), depending on the dataset (compared to OVO: 0.8663 versus 0.8598 on Toulouse, 0.8123 versus 0.8521 on Potsdam). More importantly, it scales much more efficiently with the number of training examples, resulting in nearly constant time (compared to OVO: 85.72 versus 248.02 s on Toulouse, 58.89 versus 580.17 s on Potsdam). This article shows an approach for bringing together classical and quantum computation, solving practical problems in remote sensing with current hardware.

TI Dissipative Variational Quantum Algorithms for Gibbs State Preparation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In recent years, variational quantum algorithms have gained significant attention due to their adaptability and efficiency on near-term quantum hardware. They have shown potential in a variety of tasks, including linear algebra, search problems, Gibbs, and ground state preparation. Nevertheless, the presence of noise in current day quantum hardware severely limits their performance. In this work, we introduce dissipative variational quantum algorithms (D-VQAs) by incorporating dissipative operations, such as qubit RESET and stochastic gates, as an intrinsic part of a variational quantum circuit. We argue that such dissipative variational algorithms possess some natural resilience to dissipative noise. We demonstrate how such algorithms can prepare Gibbs states over a wide range of quantum many-body Hamiltonians and temperatures, while significantly reducing errors due to both coherent and noncoherent noise. An additional advantage of our approach is that no ancilla qubits are need. Our results highlight the potential of D-VQAs to enhance the robustness and accuracy of variational quantum computations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI Bidirectional cyclic hybrid quantum information transmission of
   arbitrary single-qubit state with different levels of control
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Current hierarchical control quantum communication protocols are mostly limited to linear bidirectional architectures with only two communication agents, lacking cyclic information exchange capabilities and flexible scalability for large-scale scenarios. This limitation impedes the practical deployment of complex quantum communication networks. To address this issue, a novel hierarchical control bidirectional cyclic hybrid quantum information transmission protocol for an arbitrary single-qubit state is proposed. The protocol comprises six participating entities: three communication agents (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) at different levels and three control agents (David, Emma, and Frank) with a clear permission hierarchy. The bidirectional communication tasks of each communication agent require matching control authorization corresponding to their level: high-level communication agents only need David's assistance, mid-level ones require joint control from David and Emma, and low-level ones demand collaborative authorization from all three control agents to complete their quantum teleportation and remote state preparation tasks. Furthermore, the proposed six-party protocol is extended to a 2N-party scenario involving N control agents and N communication agents at different levels, adapting to the needs of large-scale quantum communication networks. This work provides a flexible and scalable theoretical framework for constructing hierarchical quantum communication networks with cyclic information exchange.

TI Control of Qubit Dynamics Using Reinforcement Learning
SO INFORMATION
AB The progress in machine learning during the last decade has had a considerable impact on many areas of science and technology, including quantum technology. This work explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to the quantum control problem of state transfer in a single qubit. The goal is to create an RL agent that learns an optimal policy and thus discovers optimal pulses to control the qubit. The most crucial step is to mathematically formulate the problem of interest as a Markov decision process (MDP). This enables the use of RL algorithms to solve the quantum control problem. Deep learning and the use of deep neural networks provide the freedom to employ continuous action and state spaces, offering the expressivity and generalization of the process. This flexibility helps to formulate the quantum state transfer problem as an MDP in several different ways. All the developed methodologies are applied to the fundamental problem of population inversion in a qubit. In most cases, the derived optimal pulses achieve fidelity equal to or higher than 0.9999, as required by quantum computing applications. The present methods can be easily extended to quantum systems with more energy levels and may be used for the efficient control of collections of qubits and to counteract the effect of noise, which are important topics for quantum sensing applications.

TI Quantum Machine Learning-Quo Vadis?
SO ENTROPY
AB The book Quantum Machine Learning: What Quantum Computing Means to Data Mining, by Peter Wittek, made quantum machine learning popular to a wider audience. The promise of quantum machine learning for big data is that it will lead to new applications due to the exponential speed-up and the possibility of compressed data representation. However, can we really apply quantum machine learning for real-world applications? What are the advantages of quantum machine learning algorithms in addition to some proposed artificial problems? Is the promised exponential or quadratic speed-up realistic, assuming that real quantum computers exist? Quantum machine learning is based on statistical machine learning. We cannot port the classical algorithms directly into quantum algorithms due to quantum physical constraints, like the input-output problem or the normalized representation of vectors. Theoretical speed-ups of quantum machine learning are usually analyzed in the literature by ignoring the input destruction problem, which is the main bottleneck for data encoding. The dilemma results from the following question: should we ignore or marginalize those constraints or not?

AB We introduce diagrammatic differentiation for tensor calculus by generalising the dual number con-struction from rigs to monoidal categories. Applying this to ZX diagrams, we show how to calculate diagrammatically the gradient of a linear map with respect to a phase parameter. For diagrams of parametrised quantum circuits, we get the well-known parameter-shift rule at the basis of many variational quantum algorithms. We then extend our method to the automatic differentation of hybrid classical-quantum circuits, using diagrams with bubbles to encode arbitrary non-linear operators. Moreover, diagrammatic differentiation comes with an open-source implementation in DisCoPy, the Python library for monoidal categories. Diagrammatic gradients of classical-quantum circuits can then be simplified using the PyZX library and executed on quantum hardware via the tket compiler. This opens the door to many practical applications harnessing both the structure of string diagrams and the computational power of quantum machine learning.

This is analogous to creating classical algorithms using logic gates and bits. Even after learning all concepts, it is difficult to create new algorithms, which hinders the acceptance of quantum programming by most developers.
   This article outlines the need for higher-level abstractions and proposes some of them in a developer-friendly programming language called Rhyme. The new quantum types are extensions of classical types, including bits, integers, floats, characters, arrays, and strings. We show how to use such types with code snippets.

   machine learning problems that can be solved with a single qubit
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This work focuses on quantum machine learning and analyzes the power of one single qubit to solve classical machine learning problems. We explore possible strategies to address traditional supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning tasks. In particular, we study binary and multinomial classification, regression problems, time series forecasting, clustering, and quantum reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that the same methodology could be used to address all three types of learning with different measurement strategies and, despite the strong limitation of reduced data dimensionality of the candidate problems, a single qubit can achieve similar or even improved performance with respect to state-of-the-art classic machine learning methods in many cases. As simulating the evolution of one qubit state is computationally efficient, our study enables the possibility to use the qubit model as a candidate solution to implement simple decision-making machine learning models in hardware with extremely low memory resources such as embedded systems or edge devices. The outcomes provided could be also of interest in academia and for the construction of demonstrators using low-scale contemporary quantum hardware.

TI Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum
   communications
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Global-scale quantum networking faces significant technical and scientific obstacles. Quantum repeaters (QRs) have been proposed to overcome the inherent direct transmission range limit through optical fiber. However, QRs are typically limited to a total distance of a few thousand kilometers and/or require extensive hardware overhead. Recent proposals suggest that strings of space-borne QRs with on-board quantum memories (QMs) are able to provide global coverage. Here, we propose an alternative to such repeater constellations using a single satellite with two QMs that effectively acts as a time-delayed version of a single QR node. By physically transporting stored qubits, our protocol improves long-distance entanglement distribution with reduced system complexity over previous proposals. We estimate the amount of secure key in the finite block regime and demonstrate an improvement of at least three orders of magnitude over prior single-satellite methods that rely on a single QM, while simultaneously reducing the necessary memory capacity similarly. We propose an experimental platform to realize this scheme based on rare-earth ion doped crystals with appropriate performance parameters. By exploiting recent advances in quantum memory lifetimes, we are able to significantly reduce system complexity while achieving high key rates, bringing global quantum networking closer to implementation.

TI Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In recent years, research in quantum computing has largely focused on two approaches: near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing and future fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). A growing body of research into early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) is exploring how to utilize quantum computers during the transition between these two eras. However, without agreed-upon characterizations of this transition, it is unclear how best to utilize EFTQC architectures. We argue for the perspective that this transition period will be characterized by a law of diminishing returns in quantum error correction (QEC), where the ability of the architecture to maintain quality operations at scale determines the point of diminishing returns. Two challenges emerge from this picture: how to model this phenomenon of diminishing return of QEC as the performance of devices is continually improving and how to design algorithms to make the most use of these devices. To address these challenges, we present models for the performance of EFTQC architectures, capturing the diminishing returns of QEC. We then use these models to elucidate the regimes in which algorithms suited to such architectures are advantageous. As a concrete example, we show that for the canonical task of phase estimation, in a regime of moderate scalability and using just over one million physical qubits, the "reach" of the quantum computer can be extended (compared to the standard approach) from 90-qubit instances to over 130-qubit instances using a simple early fault-tolerant quantum algorithm, which reduces the number of operations per circuit by a factor of 100 and increases the number of circuit repetitions by a factor of 10 000. This clarifies the role that such algorithms might play in the era of limited-scalability quantum computing.

TI Quantum inspired qubit qutrit neural networks for real time financial
   forecasting
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This research investigates the performance and efficacy of machine learning models in stock prediction, comparing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Quantum Qubit-based Neural Networks (QQBNs), and Quantum Qutrit-based Neural Networks (QQTNs). By outlining methodologies, architectures, and training procedures, the study highlights significant differences in training times and performance metrics across models. While all models demonstrate robust accuracies above 70%, the Quantum Qutrit-based Neural Network consistently outperforms with advantages in risk-adjusted returns, measured by the Sharpe ratio, greater consistency in prediction quality through the Information Coefficient, and enhanced robustness under varying market conditions. The QQTN not only surpasses its classical and qubit-based counterparts in multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics but also achieves comparable performance with significantly reduced training times. These results showcase the promising prospects of Quantum Qutrit-based Neural Networks in practical financial applications, where real-time processing is critical. By achieving superior accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, the proposed models underscore the transformative potential of quantum-inspired approaches, paving the way for their integration into computationally intensive fields.

TI Benchmarking quantum state transfer on quantum devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum state transfer (QST) provides a method to send arbitrary quantum states from one system to another. Such a concept is crucial for transmitting quantum information into the quantum memory, quantum processor, and quantum network. The standard benchmark of QST is the average fidelity between the prepared and received states. In this work we provide a new benchmark which reveals the nonclassicality of QST based on spatiotemporal steering (STS). More specifically, we show that the local-hidden-state (LHS) model in STS can be viewed as the classical strategy of state transfer. Therefore, we can quantify the nonclassicality of the QST process by measuring the spatiotemporal steerability. We then apply the spatiotemporal steerability measurement technique to benchmark quantum devices including the IBM quantum experience and QuTech quantum inspire under QST tasks. The experimental results show that the spatiotemporal steerability decreases as the circuit depth increases, and the reduction agrees with the noise model, which refers to the accumulation of errors during the QST process. Moreover, we provide a quantity to estimate the signaling effect which could result from gate errors or intrinsic non-Markovian effect of the devices.

TI Collective neutrino oscillations in three flavors on qubit and qutrit
   processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions, which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Laboratory for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.

TI Coherence requirements for quantum communication from hybrid circuit
   dynamics
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The coherent superposition of quantum states is an important resource for quantum information processing which distinguishes quantum dynamics and information from their classical counterparts. In this article we determine the coherence requirements to communicate quantum information in a broad setting encompassing monitored quantum dynamics and quantum error correction codes. We determine these requirements by considering hybrid circuits that are generated by a quantum information game played between two opponents, Alice and Eve, who compete by applying unitaries and measurements on a fixed number of qubits. Alice applies unitaries in an attempt to maintain quantum channel capacity, while Eve applies measurements in an attempt to destroy it. By limiting the coherence generating or destroying operations available to each opponent, we determine Alice's coherence requirements. When Alice plays a random strategy aimed at mimicking generic monitored quantum dynamics, we discover a coherencetuned phase transitions in entanglement and quantum channel capacity. We then derive a theorem giving the minimum coherence required by Alice in any successful strategy, and conclude by proving that coherence sets an upper bound on the code distance in any stabelizer quantum error correction code. Such bounds provide a rigorous quantification of the coherence resource requirements for quantum communication and error correction.

The secrecy of the exchanged key is guaranteed by these quantum physical properties, even against an attacker using a quantum computer.

TI Compiler Design for Distributed Quantum Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In distributed quantum computing architectures, with the network and communications functionalities provided by the Quantum Internet, remote quantum processing units can communicate and cooperate for executing computational tasks that single, noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices cannot handle by themselves. To this aim, distributed quantum computing requires a new generation of quantum compilers, for mapping any quantum algorithm to any distributed quantum computing architecture. With this perspective, in this article, we first discuss the main challenges arising with compiler design for distributed quantum computing. Then, we analytically derive an upper bound of the overhead induced by quantum compilation for distributed quantum computing. The derived bound accounts for the overhead induced by the underlying computing architecture as well as the additional overhead induced by the suboptimal quantum compiler-expressly designed in this article to achieve three key features, namely, general-purpose, efficient, and effective. Finally, we validate the analytical results, and we confirm the validity of the compiler design through an extensive performance analysis.

TI Experimental Investigation on Quantum Channel Noise Simulation and
   Information Security Threshold Based on Two-Photon Four-Qubit
   Hyper-Entanglement Systems
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Due to the important role of quantum information technology in the future development of science and technology, researchers have extensively studied the preparation, characterization, and application of quantum systems. It is of great significance to further study the universality and generalization of multi-qubit entangled states. Especially in quantum communication, the actual quantum system is always affected by various noises from the environment. Noise has a significant impact on the properties of the actual quantum system, so we study the effects of noise on a prepared two-photon four-qubit state by two methods. We experimentally simulated the most common bit-flip noise in quantum systems. The law of evolution of the fidelity of two-dimensional four-qubit states and violation of the Mermin inequality and the Ardehali inequality for LR under different levels of bit-flip noise are investigated. The experimental results show that entanglement fidelity and nonlocality can be used to judge the degree of noise interference in the quantum channel and, thus, judge the security of the quantum communication channel. This judgment is of great significance for the realization of practical long-distance multi-node quantum communication.

TI Quantum Amplitude Hash Function for Quantum Evidence Integrity
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The integrity of evidence, a core principle of digital forensics, is essential for ensuring the reliability and admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings. Classical cryptographic hash functions have effectively ensured the integrity of digital evidence. However, they cannot be applied to quantum evidence emerging with the advent of the quantum computing era. This is due to fundamental principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. To address the challenge of ensuring quantum evidence integrity, this paper introduces a quantum amplitude hash function as a new paradigm. The function operates by directly hashing the entire amplitude, which represents the totality of information within the quantum evidence state, into a hash qubit. The proposed function is implemented as a quantum circuit of constant depth, ensuring excellent scalability. It is theoretically proven to satisfy key cryptographic properties such as preimage resistance, collision resistance, and sensitivity. Moreover, simulation experiments were conducted to validate the generation of hash qubits for representative quantum algorithms. This work is expected to lay a crucial technical foundation for advancing the field of quantum forensics and preparing for future investigative environments.

AB We present a novel approach to cryptographically secure verification and benchmarking of quantum computing, demonstrating our approach on an ion-trap quantum computer. Unlike previous cryptographically secure verification protocols, which typically require quantum communication between client and server, our approach is implemented entirely on chip. This eliminates the need for a quantum capable client, and significantly enhances practicality. We perform tomography to justify the additionally required assumption that the noise is independent of the secret used to prepare the server's single-qubit states. We quantify the soundness error that may be caused by residual secret dependencies. We demonstrate our protocol on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processing unit, using qubit measurements and resets to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices. To our knowledge, these are the largest verified measurement-based quantum computations performed to date.

TI Initial-State Dependent Optimization of Controlled Gate Operations with
   Quantum Computer
SO QUANTUM
AB There is no unique way to encode a quantum algorithm into a quantum circuit. With limited qubit counts, connectivity, and coherence times, a quantum circuit optimization is essential to make the best use of near-term quantum devices. We introduce a new circuit optimizer called AQCEL, which aims to remove redundant controlled operations from controlled gates, depending on initial states of the circuit. Especially, the AQCEL can remove unnecessary qubit controls from multi-controlled gates in polynomial computational resources, even when all the relevant qubits are entangled, by identifying zero-amplitude computational basis states using a quantum computer. As a bench-mark, the AQCEL is deployed on a quantum algorithm designed to model final state radiation in high energy physics. For this benchmark, we have demonstrated that the AQCEL-optimized circuit can produce equivalent final states with much smaller number of gates. Moreover, when deploying AQCEL with a noisy intermediate scale quantum computer, it efficiently produces a quantum circuit that approximates the original circuit with high fidelity by truncating low-amplitude computational basis states below certain thresholds. Our technique is useful for a wide variety of quantum algorithms, opening up new possibilities to further simplify quantum circuits to be more effective for real devices.

TI Quantum error mitigation via quantum-noise-effect circuit groups
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Near-term quantum computers have been built as intermediate-scale quantum devices and are fragile against quantum noise effects, namely, NISQ devices. Traditional quantum-error-correcting codes are not implemented on such devices and to perform quantum computation in good accuracy with these machines we need to develop alternative approaches for mitigating quantum computational errors. In this work, we propose quantum error mitigation (QEM) scheme for quantum computational errors which occur due to couplings with environments during gate operations, i.e., decoherence. To establish our QEM scheme, first we estimate the quantum noise effects on single-qubit states and represent them as groups of quantum circuits, namely, quantum-noise-effect circuit groups. Then our QEM scheme is conducted by subtracting expectation values generated by the quantum-noise-effect circuit groups from those obtained by the quantum circuits for the quantum algorithms under consideration. As a result, the quantum noise effects are reduced, and we obtain approximately the ideal expectation values via the quantum-noise-effect circuit groups and the numbers of elementary quantum circuits composing them scale polynomial with respect to the products of the depths of quantum algorithms and the numbers of register bits. To numerically demonstrate the validity of our QEM scheme, we run noisy quantum simulations of qubits under amplitude damping effects for four types of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we implement our QEM scheme on IBM Q Experience processors and examine its efficacy. Consequently, the validity of our scheme is verified via both the quantum simulations and the quantum computations on the real quantum devices. Our QEM scheme is solely composed of quantum-computational operations (quantum gates and measurements), and thus, it can be conducted by any type of quantum device. In addition, it can be applied to error mitigation for many other types of quantum noise effects as well as noisy quantum computing of long-depth quantum algorithms.

TI Scalable and robust quantum computing on qubit arrays with fixed
   coupling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a scheme for scalable and robust quantum computing on two-dimensional arrays of qubits with fixed longitudinal coupling. This opens the possibility for bypassing the device complexity associated with tunable couplers required in conventional quantum computing hardware. Our approach is based on driving a subarray of qubits such that the total multi-qubit Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a sum of commuting few-qubit blocks, and efficient optimisation of the unitary evolution within each block. The driving pulses are optimised to implement a target gate on the driven qubits, and at the same time identity gates on the neighbouring undriven qubits, cancelling any unwanted evolution due to the constant qubit-qubit interaction. We show that it is possible to realise a universal set of quantum gates with high fidelity on the basis blocks, and by shifting the driving pattern one can realise an arbitrary quantum circuit on the array. Allowing for imperfect Hamiltonian characterisation, we use robust optimal control to obtain fidelities around 99.99% despite 1% uncertainty in the qubit-qubit and drive-qubit couplings, and a detuning uncertainty at 0.1% of the qubit-qubit coupling strength. This robust feature is crucial for scaling up as parameter uncertainty is significant in large devices.

TI A Modified Depolarization Approach for Efficient Quantum Machine
   Learning
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era has shown promising applications in machine learning, optimization, and cryptography. Despite these progresses, challenges persist due to system noise, errors, and decoherence. These system noises complicate the simulation of quantum systems. The depolarization channel is a standard tool for simulating a quantum system's noise. However, modeling such noise for practical applications is computationally expensive when we have limited hardware resources, as is the case in the NISQ era. This work proposes a modified representation for a single-qubit depolarization channel. Our modified channel uses two Kraus operators based only on X and Z Pauli matrices. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from six to four matrix multiplications per channel execution. Experiments on a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model on the Iris dataset across various circuit depths and depolarization rates validate that our approach maintains the model's accuracy while improving efficiency. This simplified noise model enables more scalable simulations of quantum circuits under depolarization, advancing capabilities in the NISQ era.

AB Quantum computers have advanced rapidly in qubit count and gate fidelity. However, large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing still relies on quantum error correction code (QECC) to suppress noise. Manually or experimentally verifying the fault-tolerance property of complex QECC implementation is impractical due to the vast error combinations. This paper formalizes the fault-tolerance of QECC implementations within the language of quantum programs. By incorporating the techniques of quantum symbolic execution, we provide an automatic verification tool for quantum fault-tolerance.

TI Quantum error correction and large N
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB In recent years quantum error correction (QEC) has become an important part of AdS/CFT. Unfortunately, there are no field-theoretic arguments about why QEC holds in known holographic systems. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by studying the error correcting properties of the fermionic sector of various large N theories. Specifically we examine SU (N) matrix quantum mechanics and 3-rank tensor O (N)(3) theories. Both of these theories contain large gauge groups. We argue that gauge singlet states indeed form a quantum error correcting code. Our considerations are based purely on large N analysis and do not appeal to a particular form of Hamiltonian or holography.

TI Variational secure cloud quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been considered to be useful applications of noisy intermediatescale quantum (NISQ) devices. Typically, in VQAs, a parametrized ansatz circuit is used to generate a trial wave function, and the parameters are optimized to minimize a cost function. On the other hand, blind quantum computing (BQC) has been studied in order to provide a quantum algorithm with security by using cloud networks. A client with a limited ability to perform quantum operations hopes to have access to a quantum computer of a server, and BQC allows the client to use the server's computer without leakage of the client's information (such as input, running quantum algorithms, and output) to the server. However, BQC is designed for fault-tolerant quantum computing, and this requires many ancillary qubits, which may not be suitable for NISQ devices. Here, we propose an efficient way to implement the NISQ computing with guaranteed security for the client. In our architecture, only N + 1 qubits are required, under an assumption that the form of ansatze is known to the server, where N denotes the necessary number of the qubits in the original NISQ algorithms. The client only performs single-qubit measurements on an ancillary qubit sent from the server, and the measurement angles can specify the parameters for the ansatze of the NISQ algorithms. The no-signaling principle guarantees that neither parameters chosen by the client nor the outputs of the algorithm are leaked to the server. This work paves the way for new applications of NISQ devices.

TI Ion trap long-range XY model for quantum state transfer and optimal
   spatial search
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Linear ion trap chains are a promising platform for quantum computation and simulation. The XY model with long-range interactions can be implemented with a single side-band M circle divide lmer-S circle divide rensen scheme, giving interactions that decay as 1/r(alpha), where alpha parameterises the interaction range. Lower a leads to longer range interactions, allowing faster long-range gate operations for quantum computing. However, decreasing alpha causes an increased generation of coherent phonons and appears to dephase the effective XY interaction model. We characterise and show how to correct for this effect completely, allowing lower alpha interactions to be coherently implemented. Ion trap chains are thus shown to be a viable platform for spatial quantum search in optimal O(root N) time, for N ions. Finally, we introduce a O(root N) quantum state transfer protocol, with a qubit encoding that maintains a high fidelity.

AB Future quantum Internet aims to enable quantum communication between arbitrary pairs of distant nodes through the sharing of end-to-end entanglement, a universal resource for many quantum applications. As in classical networks, quantum networks also have to resolve problems related to routing and satisfaction of service at a sufficient rate. We deal here with the problem of scheduling when multiple commodities must be served through a quantum network based on first generation quantum repeaters, or quantum switches. To this end, we introduce a novel discrete-time algebraic model for arbitrary network topology, including transmission and memory losses, and adapted to dynamic scheduling decisions.
   Our algebraic model allows the scheduler to use the storage of temporary intermediate links to optimize the performance, depending on the information availability, ranging from full global information for a centralized scheduler to partial local information for a distributed one. As an illustrative example, we compare a simple greedy scheduling policy with several Max-Weight inspired scheduling policies and illustrate the resulting achievable rate regions for two competing pairs of clients through a network.

TI Universal quantum computation with symmetric qubit clusters coupled to
   an environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB One of the most challenging problems for the realization of a scalable quantum computer is to design a physical device that keeps the error rate for each quantum processing operation low. These errors can originate from the accuracy of quantum manipulation, such as the sweeping of a gate voltage in solid state qubits or the duration of a laser pulse in optical schemes. Errors also result from decoherence, which is often regarded as more crucial in the sense that it is inherent to the quantum system, being fundamentally a consequence of the coupling to the external environment. Grouping small collections of qubits into clusters with symmetries may serve to protect parts of the calculation from decoherence. In this work, we use four-level cores with a straightforward generalization of discrete rotational symmetry, called omega-rotation invariance, to encode pairs of coupled qubits and universal two-qubit logical gates. We include quantum errors as a main source of decoherence, and show that symmetry makes logical operations particularly resilient to untimely anisotropic qubit rotations. We propose a scalable scheme for universal quantum computation where cores play the role of quantum-computational transistors, or quansistors for short. Initialization and readout are achieved by tunnel-coupling the quansistor to leads. The external leads are explicitly considered and are assumed to be the other main source of decoherence. We show that quansistors can be dynamically decoupled from the leads by tuning their internal parameters, giving them the versatility required to act as controllable quantum memory units. With this dynamical decoupling, logical operations within quansistors are also symmetry-protected from unbiased noise in their parameters. We identify technologies that could implement omega-rotation invariance. Many of our results can be generalized to higher-level omega-rotation-invariant systems, or adapted to clusters with other symmetries.

The gauge link registers and necessary primitives-the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the Sigma(36 x 3) Fourier transform-are presented for both an eight-qubit encoding and a heterogeneous three-qutrit plus two-qubit register. For the latter, a specialized compiler was developed for decomposing arbitrary unitaries onto this architecture.

TI Optical designs for realization of a set of schemes for quantum
   cryptography
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Several quantum cryptographic schemes have been proposed and realized experimentally in the past. However, even with an advancement in quantum technology and escalated interest in the designing of direct secure quantum communication schemes there are not many experimental implementations of these cryptographic schemes. In this paper, we have provided a set of optical circuits for such quantum cryptographic schemes, which have not yet been realized experimentally by modifying some of our theoretically proposed secure communication schemes. Specifically, we have proposed optical designs for the implementation of two single photon and one entangled state based controlled quantum dialogue schemes and subsequently reduced our optical designs to yield simpler designs for realizing other secure quantum communication tasks, i.e., controlled deterministic secure quantum communication, quantum dialogue, quantum secure direct communication, quantum key agreement, and quantum key distribution. We have further proposed an optical design for an entanglement swapping based deterministic secure quantum communication and its controlled counterpart. Finally, a brief discussion on security of the schemes, hacking strategies against different optical elements and corresponding countermeasures is also presented.

TI Mitigating noise in digital and digital-analog quantum computation
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices lack error correction, limiting scalability for quantum algorithms. In this context, digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) offers a more resilient alternative quantum computing paradigm that outperforms digital quantum computation by combining the flexibility of single-qubit gates with the robustness of analog simulations. This work explores the impact of noise on both digital and DAQC paradigms and demonstrates DAQC's effectiveness in error mitigation. We compare the quantum Fourier transform and quantum phase estimation algorithms under a wide range of single and two-qubit noise sources in superconducting processors. DAQC consistently surpasses digital approaches in fidelity, particularly as processor size increases. Moreover, zero-noise extrapolation further enhances DAQC by mitigating decoherence and intrinsic errors, achieving fidelities above 0.95 for 8 qubits, and reducing computation errors to the order of 10-3. These results establish DAQC as a viable alternative for quantum computing in the NISQ era.
   The authors explore the digital-analog quantum computing paradigm, which combines fast single-qubit gates with the natural dynamics of quantum devices. They find the digital-analog paradigm more robust against certain experimental imperfections than the standard fully-digital one and successfully apply error mitigation techniques to this approach.

TI Catalytic Quantum Teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In this work, we address fundamental limitations of quantum teleportation-the process of transferring quantum information using classical communication and preshared entanglement. We develop a new teleportation protocol based upon the idea of using ancillary entanglement catalytically, i.e., without depleting it. This protocol is then used to show that catalytic entanglement allows for a noiseless quantum channel to be simulated with a quality that could never be achieved using only entanglement from the shared state, even for catalysts with a small dimension. On the one hand, this allows for a more faithful transmission of quantum information using generic states and fixed amount of consumed entanglement. On the other hand, this shows, for the first time, that entanglement catalysis provides a genuine advantage in a generic quantum-information processing task. Finally, we show that similar ideas can be directly applied to study quantum catalysis for more general problems in quantum mechanics. As an application, we show that catalysts can activate so-called passive states, a concept that finds widespread application, e.g., in quantum thermodynamics.

TI Ancilla-driven blind quantum computation for clients with different
   quantum capabilities
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Blind quantum computation (BQC) allows a client with limited quantum power to delegate his quantum computational task to a powerful server and still keep his input, output, and algorithm private. There are mainly two kinds of models about BQC, namely circuit-based and measurement-based models. In addition, a hybrid model called ancilla-driven universal blind quantum computation (ADBQC) was proposed by combining the properties of both circuit-based and measurement-based models, where all unitary operations on the register qubits can be realized with the aid of single ancilla coupled to the register qubits. However, in the ADBQC model, the quantum capability of the client is strictly limited to preparing single qubits. If a client can only perform single-qubit measurements or a few simple quantum gates, he will not be able to perform ADBQC. This paper solves the problem and extends the existing model by proposing two types of ADBQC protocols for clients with different quantum capabilities, such as performing single-qubit measurements or single-qubit gates. Furthermore, in the two proposed ADBQC protocols, clients can detect whether servers are honest or not with a high probability by using corresponding verifiable techniques.

TI Controlled Quantum Network Coding Without Loss of Information
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum network coding is used to solve the congestion problem in quantum communication, which will promote the transmission efficiency of quantum information and the total throughput of quantum network. We propose a novel controlled quantum network coding without information loss. The effective transmission of quantum states on the butterfly network requires the consent form a third-party controller Charlie. Firstly, two pairs of three-particle non-maximum entangled states are pre-shared between senders and controller. By adding auxiliary particles and local operations, the senders can predict whether a certain quantum state can be successfully transmitted within the butterfly network based on the Z- {vertical bar 0 >, vertical bar 1 >} basis. Secondly, when transmission fails upon prediction, the quantum state will not be lost, and it will still be held by the sender. Subsequently, the controller Charlie re-prepares another three-particle non-maximum entangled state to start a new round. When the predicted transmission is successful, the quantum state can be transmitted successfully within the butterfly network. If the receiver wants to receive the effective quantum state, the quantum measurements from Charlie are needed. Thirdly, when the transmission fails, Charlie does not need to integrate the X- {vertical bar+>, vertical bar->} basis to measure its own particles, by which quantum resources are saved. Charlie not only controls the effective transmission of quantum states, but also the usage of classical and quantum channels. Finally, the implementation of the quantum circuits, as well as a flow chart and safety analysis of our scheme, is proposed.

   operations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Quantum discord is significant in analyzing quantum nonclassicality beyond the paradigm of entanglement. Presently, we have explored the effectiveness of global unitary operations in manifesting quantum discord from a general two-qubit zero discord state. Apart from the emergence of some obvious concepts such as absolute classical-quantum and absolute quantum-classical states, more interestingly, it is observed that set of states characterized by absoluteness contains only maximally mixed state. Consequently, this marks the peak of effectiveness of global unitary operations in purview of manifesting nonclassicality from arbitrary two-qubit state when other standard methods fail to do so. A set of effective global unitaries has been provided in this context. Our observations have direct implications in remote state preparation task.

TI Non-Gaussian approach: Withstanding loss and noise of multi-scattering
   underwater channel for continuous-variable quantum teleportation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Underwater quantum communication plays a crucial role in ensuring secure data transmission and extensible quantum networks in underwater environments. However, the implementation of such applications encounters challenges due to the light attenuation caused by the complicated natural seawater. This paper focuses on employing a model based on seawater chlorophyll-a concentration to characterize the absorption and scattering of light through quantum channels. We propose a multi-scattering random channel model, which demonstrates characteristics of the excess noise in different propagation directions of communication links. Furthermore, we consider the fidelity of a continuous-variable quantum teleportation through seawater channel. To enhance transmission performance, non-Gaussian operations have been conducted. Numerical simulations show that incorporating non-Gaussian operations enables the protocol to achieve higher fidelity transmission or lower fidelity fading rates over longer transmission distances.

TI Spin-bearing molecules as optically addressable platforms for quantum
   technologies
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Efforts to harness quantum hardware relying on quantum mechanical principles have been steadily progressing. The search for novel material platforms that could spur the progress by providing new functionalities for solving the outstanding technological problems is however still active. Any physical property presenting two distinct energy states that can be found in a long-lived superposition state can serve as a quantum bit (qubit), the basic information processing unit in quantum technologies. Molecular systems that can feature electron and/or nuclear spin states together with optical transitions are one of the material platforms that can serve as optically addressable qubits. The attractiveness of molecular systems for quantum technologies relies on the fact that molecular structures of atomically defined nature can be obtained in endless diversity of chemical compositions. Crucially, by harnessing the molecular design protocols, the optical and spin (electronic and nuclear) properties of molecules can be tailored, aiding the design of optically addressable spin qubits and quantum sensors. In this contribution, we present a concise and collective discussion of optically addressable spin-bearing molecules - namely, organic molecules, transition metal (TM) and rare-earth ion (REI) complexes - and highlight recent results such as chemical tuning of optical and electron spin quantum coherence, optical spin initialization and readout, intramolecular quantum teleportation, optical coherent storage, and photonic-enhanced optical addressing. We envision that optically addressable spin-carrying molecules could become a scalable building block of quantum hardware for applications in the fields of quantum sensing, quantum communication and quantum computing.

TI Multi-agent blind quantum computation without universal cluster states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Blind quantum computation (BQC) protocols enable quantum algorithms to be executed on third-party quantum agents while keeping the data and algorithm confidential. The previous proposals for measurement-based BQC require preparing a highly entangled cluster state. In this paper, we show that such a requirement is not necessary. Our protocol only requires pre-shared Bell pairs between delegated quantum agents, and there is no requirement for any classical or quantum information exchange between agents during the execution. Our proposal requires fewer quantum resources than previous proposals by eliminating the need for a universal cluster state.

TI Quantum key distribution with entangled photons generated on demand by a
   quantum dot
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum key distribution-exchanging a random secret key relying on a quantum mechanical resource-is the core feature of secure quantum networks. Entanglement-based protocols offer additional layers of security and scale favorably with quantum repeaters, but the stringent requirements set on the photon source have made their use situational so far. Semiconductor-based quantum emitters are a promising solution in this scenario, ensuring on-demand generation of near-unity-fidelity entangled photons with record-low multiphoton emission, the latter feature countering some of the best eavesdropping attacks. Here, we use a coherently driven quantum dot to experimentally demonstrate a modified Ekert quantum key distribution protocol with two quantum channel approaches: both a 250-m-long single-mode fiber and in free space, connecting two buildings within the campus of Sapienza University in Rome. Our field study highlights that quantum-dot entangled photon sources are ready to go beyond laboratory experiments, thus opening the way to real-life quantum communication.

TI Maximizing quantum discord from interference in multi-port fiber
   beamsplitters
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Fourth-order interference is an information processing primitive for photonic quantum technologies, as it forms the basis of photonic controlled-logic gates, entangling measurements, and can be used to produce quantum correlations. Here, using classical weak coherent states as inputs, we study fourth-order interference in 4 x 4 multi-port beam splitters built within multi-core optical fibers, and show that quantum correlations, in the form of geometric quantum discord, can be controlled and maximized by adjusting the intensity ratio between the two inputs. Though these states are separable, they maximize the geometric discord in some instances, and can be a resource for protocols such as remote state preparation. This should contribute to the exploitation of quantum correlations in future telecommunication networks, in particular in those that exploit spatially structured fibers.

TI Symmetry-Protected Infinite-Temperature Quantum Memory from Subsystem
   Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study a mechanism whereby quantum information present in the initial state of a quantum many-body system can be protected for arbitrary times due to a combination of symmetry and spatial locality. Remarkably, the mechanism is sufficiently generic that the dynamics can be fully ergodic upon resolving the protecting symmetry and fixing the encoded quantum state, resulting in a quantum memory that persists up to infinite temperature. After exemplifying the mechanism in a strongly nonintegrable two-dimensional (2D) spin model inspired by the surface code, we find it has a natural interpretation in the language of noiseless subsystems and stabilizer subsystem codes. This interpretation yields a number of further examples, including a nonintegrable Hamiltonian with quantum memory based on the Bacon-Shor code. The lifetime of the encoded quantum information in these models is infinite provided that the dynamics respect the stabilizer symmetry of the underlying subsystem code. In the presence of symmetry-violating perturbations, we make contact with previous work leveraging the concept of prethermalization to show that the encoded quantum information can acquire a parametrically long lifetime under dynamics with an enlarged continuous symmetry group. The prethermalization mechanism hinges on the application of external fields that are much larger than the perturbations themselves. We identify conditions on the underlying subsystem code that enable such a prethermal enhancement of the memory lifetime.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for entanglement quantification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement is a foundational resource in quantum information science, underpinning applications across physics. However, detecting and quantifying entanglement remains a significant challenge. In this article, we introduce a variational quantum algorithm inspired by Uhlmann's theorem to quantify the Bures entanglement of general quantum states, a method that naturally extends to other quantum resources, including genuine multipartite entanglement, quantum discord, quantum coherence, and total correlations, while also enabling reconstruction of the closest free states. The algorithm requires a polynomial number of ancillary qubits and circuit depth relative to the system size, dimensionality, and free-state cardinality, making it scalable for practical implementations. Thus, it provides a versatile framework for quantifying quantum resources, demonstrated here through several applications.

TI Quadripartite entanglement from two-port resonator with second-order
   harmonic generation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource for performing quantum computing and constructing quantum communication networks. The preparation and manipulation of entangled light field are the basic elements of quantum communication. With the development of science and technology, multicolor multipartite entanglement is becoming a kind of special resource for quantum information, quantum networks, and quantum memory. In this paper, we propose a scheme of generating quadripartite entanglement among four output beams from a two-port frequency doubling resonator, in which a type-II phase matching nonlinear crystal is placed. We make two fundamental-frequency pump beams with the same frequency and vertical polarization pass through the nonlinear crystal to produce two frequency-doubling beams. There is a quadripartite entanglement between the frequency-doubling beams, which are output at two ports of the optical resonator, and the incident fundamental beams. Based on the transmission matrix from the coupled wave equation, the self-consistent equations of the intracavity modes and the corresponding noise properties of the output modes can be obtained. Then, the quadripartite entanglement produced from two second harmonic beams and two reflected fundamental-frequency pump beams, is verified by using the positive partial transposition criterion, in a wide range of pumping power and analysis frequency. The setup proposed in this work is compact and experimentally feasible. It is also convenient to separate the four entangled beams spatially, with different wavelengths and polarizations. When the beam wavelengths are matched with 1560 nm (low loss window of fiber) and 780 nm (atomic absorption line of Rb), this scheme can be more useful in both quantum communication and quantum memory.

TI Implementing Quantum Secret Sharing on Current Hardware
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum secret sharing is a cryptographic scheme that enables the secure storage and reconstruction of quantum information. While the theory of secret sharing is mature in its development, relatively few studies have explored the performance of quantum secret sharing on actual devices. In this work, we provide a pedagogical description of encoding and decoding circuits for different secret sharing codes, and we test their performance on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane system. We evaluate the quality of the implementation by performing a SWAP test between the decoded state and the ideal one, as well as by estimating how well the code preserves entanglement with a reference system. The results indicate that a ((3,5)) threshold secret sharing scheme and a non-threshold 7-qubit scheme perform similarly based on the SWAP test and entanglement fidelity, with both attaining a roughly 70-75% pass rate on the SWAP test for the reconstructed secret. We also investigate one implementation of a ((2,3)) qutrit threshold scheme and find that it performs the worst of all, which is expected due to the additional number of multi-qubit gate operations needed to encode and decode qutrits. A comparison is also made between schemes using mid-circuit measurement versus delayed-circuit measurement.

TI Experimental realization of deterministic and selective photon addition
   in a bosonic mode assisted by an ancillary qubit
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Bosonic quantum error correcting codes are primarily designed to protect against single-photon loss. To correct for this type of error, one can encode the logical qubit in code spaces with a definite photon parity, such as cat codes or binomial codes. Error correction requires a recovery operation that maps the error states-which have opposite parity-back onto the code space. Here, we realize a collection of photon-number-selective, simultaneous photon addition operations on a bosonic mode, a microwave cavity, assisted by a superconducting qubit. These operations are implemented as two-photon transitions that excite the cavity and the qubit at the same time. The additional degree of freedom of the qubit makes it possible to implement a coherent, unidirectional mapping between spaces of opposite photon parity. We present the successful experimental implementation of the drives and the phase control they enable on superpositions of Fock states. The presented technique, when supplemented with qubit reset, is suitable for autonomous quantum error correction in bosonic systems and, more generally, opens the possibility to realize a range of non-unitary transformations on a bosonic mode.

TI Sample complexity of learning parametric quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computers hold unprecedented potentials for machine learning applications. Here, we prove that physical quantum circuits are probably approximately correct learnable on a quantum computer via empirical risk minimization: to learn a parametric quantum circuit with at most n(c) gates and each gate acting on a constant number of qubits, the sample complexity is bounded by O(n(c+1)). In particular, we explicitly construct a family of variational quantum circuits with O(n(c+1)) elementary gates arranged in a fixed pattern, which can represent all physical quantum circuits consisting of at most n` elementary gates. Our results provide a valuable guide for quantum machine learning in both theory and practice.

This is accompanied by promising opportunities, but also new challenges for our society. However, quantum computing as a subject of computer science education is still at the very beginning. This paper aims to discuss quantum computing as a topic in computer science education and to make a first approach to central terms and ideas as well as their explanatory approaches. With the help of an explorative focus group interview with experts, five core ideas of quantum computer science are identified in this study. A literature review is then used to identify, categorize, and contrast different explanatory approaches for these ideas. The results thus contribute to making quantum computer science accessible for computing education and raise further questions for the computing education research community.

TI Deterministic multi-mode gates on a scalable photonic quantum computing
   platform
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing can be realized with numerous different hardware platforms and computational protocols. A highly promising, and potentially scalable, idea is to combine a photonic platform with measurement-induced quantum information processing. In this approach, gate operations can be implemented through optical measurements on a multipartite entangled quantum state-a so-called cluster state. Previously, a few quantum gates on non-universal or non-scalable cluster states have been performed, but a full set of gates for universal scalable quantum computing has not been realized. Here we propose and demonstrate the deterministic implementation of a multi-mode set of measurement-induced quantum gates in a large two-dimensional optical cluster state using phase-controlled continuous-variable quadrature measurements. Each gate is programmed into the phases of high-efficiency quadrature measurements, which execute the transformations by teleportation through the cluster state. We further execute a small quantum circuit consisting of 10 single-mode gates and 2 two-mode gates on a three-mode input state. Fault-tolerant universal quantum computing is possible with this platform if the cluster-state entanglement is improved and a supply of states with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding is available.
   Measurement-based quantum computing performs quantum gates on entangled states without difficult multi-qubit coherent dynamics. A set of gates sufficient for universal quantum computing has now been implemented on a programmable optical platform.

TI Witnessing quantum memory in non-Markovian processes
SO QUANTUM
AB We present a method to detect quantum memory in a non-Markovian process. We call a process Markovian when the environment does not provide a memory that retains correlations across different system-environment interactions. We define two types of non-Markovian processes, depending on the required memory being classical or quantum. We formalise this distinction using the process matrix formalism, through which a process is represented as a multipartite state. Within this formalism, a test for entanglement in a state can be mapped to a test for quantum memory in the corresponding process. This allows us to apply separability criteria and entanglement witnesses to the detection of quantum memory. We demonstrate the method in a simple model where both system and environment are single interacting qubits and map the parameters that lead to quantum memory. As with entanglement witnesses, our method of witnessing quantum memory provides a versatile experimental tool for open quantum systems.

TI Practical Quantum Error Correction with the XZZX Code and Kerr-Cat
   Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The development of robust architectures capable of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation should consider both their quantum error-correcting codes and the underlying physical qubits upon which they are built, in tandem. Following this design principle, we demonstrate remarkable error-correction performance by concatenating the XZZX surface code with Kerr-cat qubits. We contrast several variants of fault-tolerant systems undergoing different circuit-noise models that reflect the physics of Kerr-cat qubits. Our simulations show that our system is scalable below a threshold gate infidelity of P-CX similar to 6.5% within a physically reasonable parameter regime, where P-CX is the infidelity of the noisiest gate of our system, the controlled-NOT gate. This threshold can be reached in a superconducting-circuit architecture with a Kerr nonlinearity of 10MHz, an approximately 6.25-photon cat qubit, single-photon lifetime of greater than or similar to 64 mu s, and a thermal photon population less than or similar to 8%. Such parameters are routinely achieved in superconducting circuits.

TI Fault-tolerant operation of a logical qubit in a diamond quantum
   processor
SO NATURE
AB Solid-state spin qubits is a promising platform for quantum computation and quantum networks(1,2). Recent experiments have demonstrated high-quality control over multi-qubit systems(3-8), elementary quantum algorithms(8-11) and non-fault-tolerant error correction(12-14). Large-scale systems will require using error-corrected logical qubits that are operated fault tolerantly, so that reliable computation becomes possible despite noisy operations(15-18). Overcoming imperfections in this way remains an important outstanding challenge for quantum science(15,19-27). Here, we demonstrate fault-tolerant operations on a logical qubit using spin qubits in diamond. Our approach is based on the five-qubit code with a recently discovered flag protocol that enables fault tolerance using a total of seven qubits(28-30).We encode the logical qubit using a new protocol based on repeated multi-qubit measurements and show that it outperforms non-fault-tolerant encoding schemes. We then fault-tolerantly manipulate the logical qubit through a complete set of single-qubit Clifford gates. Finally, we demonstrate flagged stabilizer measurements with real-time processing of the outcomes. Such measurements are a primitive for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. Although future improvements in fidelity and the number of qubits will be required to suppress logical error rates below the physical error rates, our realization of fault-tolerant protocols on the logical-qubit level is a key step towards quantum information processing based on solid-state spins.

TI Dynamics of quantum-memory assisted entropic uncertainty and
   entanglement in two-dimensional graphene
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB We explore the quantum-memory assisted entropic uncertainty (QMA-EU), JensenShannon coherence and entanglement dynamics in a Graphene sheet of disordered electrons in the presence of the intrinsic decoherence. The Graphene sheet containing two sublattices in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, which results due to the impurity-potentials interaction of two Dirac points. Entropic uncertainty and logarithmic negativity are used to investigate the generation and preservation of QMA-EU and entanglement under the major factors of Graphene material, including the band structure parameter, the wave numbers as well as the decoherence effect. For the initial uncorrelated two-lattice-point-qubit state, it is found that the lattice-point interactions have high capacity to generated partially/maximally two-lattice-point-qubit entangled and hence the partial/perfect Bob's ability to guessing the outcome of Alice's measurement. The increase of the graphite band structure parameter, the wave numbers enhance the generated lattice-point entanglement and Jensen-Shannon coherence, and hence the quantum memory game has a high prediction accuracy. For the intrinsic decoherence, the ability to generate entanglement, Jensen-Shannon coherence. and guessing the Alice's measurement outcomes weakens. The sudden

TI A New Security Proof for Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) protocols allow for increased key rates over long distances when compared to standard QKD protocols. They are even able to surpass the PLOB bound without the need for quantum repeaters. In this work, we revisit a previous TF-QKD protocol and derive a new, simple, proof of security for it. We also look at several variants of the protocol and investigate their performance, showing some interesting behaviors due to the asymmetric nature of the protocol.

TI A Model-Driven Framework for Composition-Based Quantum Circuit Design
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum programming languages support the design of quantum applications. However, to create such programs, one needs to understand the fundamental characteristics of quantum computing and quantum information theory. Furthermore, quantum algorithms frequently make use of abstract operations with a hidden to a higher-level view of quantum circuit design not only reduces the development effort but also lowers the entry barriers for non-quantum computing experts. To this end, this article proposes a modeling language and design framework for quantum circuits. This allows the definition of composite operators to advocate a higher-level quantum algorithm design, together with automated code generation for the circuit execution. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, coined Composition-based Quantum Circuit Designer , we applied it for realizing the Quantum Counting algorithm and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Our evaluation results show that, compared to an existing state-of-the-art editor, the proposed approach allows for the realization of both quantum algorithms on a high level with a substantially reduced development effort. In particular, the proposed approach shows constant scaling when increasing the size of the investigated quantum circuits and a lower change criticality when evolving existing quantum circuits.

TI Quantum error-correction using humming sparrow optimization based
   self-adaptive deep cnn noise correction module
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The error correction model's main purpose in heavy hexagonal quantum codes is to improve their reliability for quantum computing applications. Existing challenges include finding the optimal decoder for quantum error correction in heavy hexagonal codes. This research propels the frontier of quantum error correction, with a specific focus on tailoring topological quantum error-correcting codes for the unique challenges posed by superconducting qubits in quantum computers. In response, this research harnesses the power of deep learning, presenting a Humming sparrow optimization based self-adaptive deep CNN (HSO-based SADCNN) model designed for heavy hexagonal codes. This decoder incorporates a Self-adaptive Deep CNN (SADCNN) Noise Correction Module, a sophisticated component to refine error correction. The proposed decoder's efficacy is rigorously evaluated across varying code distances (three, five, and seven) using the Humming Sparrow Optimization (HSO) algorithm. HSO, intricately designed to fine-tune the SADCNN decoder, significantly enhances its error correction capabilities for heavy hexagonal quantum codes. The algorithm seamlessly integrates advantageous characteristics of herding and tracing from Humming Bird optimization and Sparrow search optimization, representing a critical stride in advancing the reliability of quantum computing applications, particularly within the intricate domain of heavy hexagonal quantum codes. Based upon the achievements, the Training Percentage (TP) 90 metrics demonstrate significant progress, boasting a commendable accuracy of 97.35 % \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$97.35\%$$\end{document} , coupled with reduced logical error probability and a diminished bit error rate, marked at 5.51 and 3.72, respectively.

AB Despite the rapid development of quantum computing these years, state-of-the-art quantum devices still contain only a limited number of qubits. One possible way to execute more realistic algorithms in near-term quantum devices is to employ dynamic quantum circuits (DQCs). In DQCs, measurements can happen during the circuit, and their outcomes can be processed with classical computers and used to control other parts of the circuit. This technique can help significantly reduce the qubit resources required to implement a quantum algorithm. In this paper, we give a formal definition of DQCs and then characterise their functionality in terms of ensembles of linear operators, following the Kraus representation of superoperators. We further interpret DQCs as tensor networks, implement their functionality as tensor decision diagrams (TDDs), and reduce the equivalence of two DQCs to checking if they have the same TDD representation. Experiments show that embedding classical logic into conventional quantum circuits does not incur a significant time and space burden.

TI High-fidelity qutrit entangling gates for superconducting circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ternary quantum information processing in superconducting devices poses a promising alternative to its more popular binary counterpart through larger, more connected computational spaces and proposed advantages in quantum simulation and error correction. Although generally operated as qubits, transmons have readily addressable higher levels, making them natural candidates for operation as quantum three-level systems (qutrits). Recent works in transmon devices have realized high fidelity single qutrit operation. Nonetheless, effectively engineering a high-fidelity two-qutrit entanglement remains a central challenge for realizing qutrit processing in a transmon device. In this work, we apply the differential AC Stark shift to implement a flexible, microwave-activated, and dynamic cross-Kerr entanglement between two fixed-frequency transmon qutrits, expanding on work performed for the ZZ interaction with transmon qubits. We then use this interaction to engineer efficient, high-fidelity qutrit CZ(dagger) and CZ gates, with estimated process fidelities of 97.3(1)% and 95.2(3)% respectively, a significant step forward for operating qutrits on a multi-transmon device.
   Qutrits, or quantum three-level systems, can provide advantages over qubits in certain quantum information applications, and high-fidelity single-qutrit gates have been demonstrated. Goss et al. realize high-fidelity entangling gates between two superconducting qutrits that are universal for ternary computation.

TI Energetic cost of Hamiltonian quantum gates
SO EPL
AB Landauer's principle laid the main foundation for the development of modern thermodynamics of information. However, in its original inception the principle relies on semiformal arguments and dissipative dynamics. Hence, if and how Landauer's principle applies to unitary quantum computing is less than obvious. Here, we prove an inequality bounding the change of Shannon information encoded in the logical quantum states by quantifying the energetic cost of Hamiltonian gate operations. The utility of this bound is demonstrated by outlining how it can be applied to identify energetically optimal quantum gates in theory and experiment. The analysis is concluded by discussing the energetic cost of quantum error correcting codes with non-interacting qubits, such as Shor's code. Copyright (C) 2021 EPLA

TI Stream Privacy Amplification for Quantum Cryptography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Privacy amplification is the key step to guarantee the security of quantum communication. The existing security proofs require the accumulation of a large number of raw key bits for privacy amplification. This is similar to block ciphers in classical cryptography that would delay the final key generation since an entire block must be accumulated ahead of privacy amplification. Moreover, any leftover errors after information reconciliation would corrupt the entire block. By modifying the security proof based on quantum error correction, we develop a stream privacy-amplification scheme, which resembles the classical stream cipher. This scheme can output the final key in a stream way, prevent error from spreading, and hence can put privacy amplification ahead of information reconciliation. The stream scheme can also help to enhance the security of trusted-relay quantum networks and improve the practicality of randomness extraction for quantum random number generators.

TI Detecting Entanglement-Generating Circuits in Cloud-Based Quantum
   Computing
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Entanglement, which is a direct consequence of elementary quantum gates such as controlled-NOT and Toffoli, is a key resource that provides quantum advantages. In this work, we establish a framework for certifying entanglement generation in cloud-based quantum computing services and present the construction of quantum circuits that certify entanglement generation in a circuit-based quantum computing model. The framework relaxes the assumption of qubit allocation, which, in cloud services, relates the physical qubits in hardware to a circuit proposed by a user. Consequently, certification is valid in cloud computing regardless of the success or trustworthiness of qubit allocation. The certification of entanglement generation was demonstrated on 2 and 3 qubits in the IBMQ and IonQ services. Remarkably, entanglement generation was successfully certified in the IonQ service, which does not offer manual qubit allocation. The capabilities of entanglement generation in IBMQ and IonQ circuits were also quantified. We envisage the application of the proposed framework in cloud-based quantum computing services for practical computation and information tasks, with the results determining whether it is possible to achieve quantum advantages.

TI Entanglement distribution in multi-platform buffered-router-assisted
   frequency-multiplexed automated repeater chains
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Realization of a globe-spanning quantum network is a current worldwide goal, where near and long term implementations will benefit from connectivity between platforms optimized for specific tasks. Towards this goal, a quantum network architecture is herewith proposed whereby quantum processing devices based on NV- colour centers act as quantum routers (QR) and, between which, long-distance entanglement distribution is enabled by spectrally-multiplexed quantum repeaters based on absorptive quantum memories in rare-earth ion-doped crystals and imperfect entangled photon-pair sources. The inclusion of a quantum buffer structure between repeaters and routers is shown to, albeit the increased complexity, improve the achievable entanglement distribution rates in the network. Although the expected rate and fidelity results are presented for a simple linear network (point-to-point), complex topologies are compatible with the proposed architecture through the inclusion of an extra layer of temporal multiplexing in the QR's operation. Figures of merit are extracted based on parameters found in the literature for near-term scenarios and attest the availability of the proposed buffered-router-assisted frequency-multiplexed automated repeater chain network.

TI Fast population transfer with a superconducting qutrit via non-Hermitian
   shortcut to adiabaticity
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Non-Hermitian dissipation dynamics, capable of turning the conventionally detrimental decoherence effects to useful resources for state engineering, is highly attractive to quantum information processing. In this work, an effective scheme is developed for implementing fast population transfer with a superconducting qutrit via the non-Hermitian shortcut to adiabaticity (STA). We first deal with a ?-configuration interaction between the qutrit and microwave drivings, in which the dephasing-assisted qubit state inversion requiring an overlarge dephasing rate is constructed non-adiabatically. After introducing a feasible ancillary driving that directly acts upon the qubit states, the target state transfer can be well realized but with an accessible qubit dephasing rate. Moreover, a high fidelity could be numerically obtained in the considered system. The strategy could provide a new route towards the non-Hermitian shortcut operations on superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Error-Correcting Codes with a Covariant Encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Given some group G of logical gates, for instance the Clifford group, what are the quantum encodings for which these logical gates can be implemented by simple physical operations, described by some physical representation of G? We study this question by constructing a general form of such encoding maps. For instance, we recover that the [[5, 1, 3]] and Steane codes admit transversal implementations of the binary tetrahedral and binary octahedral groups, respectively. For bosonic encodings, we show how to obtain the GKP and cat qudit encodings by considering the appropriate groups, and essentially the simplest physical implementations. We further illustrate this approach by introducing a two-mode bosonic code defined from a constellation of 48 coherent states, for which all single-qubit Clifford gates correspond to passive Gaussian unitaries.

TI Experimental simulation of quantum superchannels
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Simulating quantum physical processes has been one of the major motivations for quantum information science. Quantum channels, which are completely positive and trace preserving processes, are the standard mathematical language to describe quantum evolution, while in recent years quantum superchannels have emerged as the substantial extension. Superchannels capture effects of quantum memory and non-Markovianality more precisely, and have found broad applications in universal models, algorithm, metrology, discrimination tasks, as examples. Here, we report an experimental simulation of qubit superchannels in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system with high accuracy, based on a recently developed quantum algorithm for superchannel simulation. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary target superchannels, and our experiment shows the high quality of NMR simulators for near-term usage. Our approach can also be adapted to other experimental systems and demonstrates prospects for more applications of superchannels.

TI Qudit Entanglers Using Quantum Optimal Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the generation of two-qudit entangling quantum logic gates using two techniques in quantum optimal control. We take advantage of both continuous, Lie algebraic control and digital, Lie group control. In both cases, the key is access to a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which can generate an arbitrary unitary matrix in the group SU(d(2)). We find efficient protocols for creating high-fidelity entangling gates. As a test of our theory, we study the case of qudits robustly encoded in nuclear spins of alkaline earth atoms and manipulated with magnetic and optical fields, with entangling interactions arising from the wellknown Rydberg blockade. We applied this in a case study based on a d = 10 dimensional qudit encoded in the I = 9/2 nuclear spin in Sr-87, controlled through a combination of nuclear spin resonance, a tensor ac-Stark shift, and Rydberg dressing, which allows us to generate an arbitrary symmetric entangling twoqudit gate, such as CPhase. Our techniques can be used to implement qudit entangling gates for any 2 <= d <= 10 encoded in the nuclear spin. We also studied how decoherence due to the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states affects the creation of the CPhase gate and found, through numerical optimization, a fidelity of 0.9985, 0.9980, 0.9942, and 0.9800 for d = 2, d = 3, d = 5, and d = 7, respectively. This provides a powerful platform to explore the various applications of quantum information processing of qudits, including metrological enhancement with qudits, quantum simulation, universal quantum computation, and quantum error correction.

TI High-Fidelity Geometric Quantum Gates with Short Paths on
   Superconducting Circuits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Geometric phases are robust against certain types of local noises, and thus provide a promising way toward high-fidelity quantum gates. However, comparing with the dynamical ones, previous implementations of nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates usually require longer evolution time, due to the needed longer evolution path. Here, a scheme is proposed to realize nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates with short paths based on simple pulse control techniques, instead of deliberated pulse control in previous investigations, which can thus further suppress the influence from the environment induced noises. Specifically, the idea is illustrated on a superconducting quantum circuit, which is one of the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computer. As the current scheme shortens the geometric evolution path, ultra-high gate fidelity can be obtained, especially for the two-qubit gate case, as verified by the numerical simulation. Therefore, the protocol suggests a promising way toward high-fidelity and robust quantum computation on a solid-state quantum system.

AB Quantum algorithms for solving a wide range of practical problems have been proposed in the last ten years, such as data search and analysis, product recommendation, and credit scoring. The concern about privacy and other ethical issues in quantum computing naturally rises up. In this paper, we define a formal framework for detecting violations of differential privacy for quantum algorithms. A detection algorithm is developed to verify whether a (noisy) quantum algorithm is differentially private and automatically generates bugging information when the violation of differential privacy is reported. The information consists of a pair of quantum states that violate the privacy, to illustrate the cause of the violation. Our algorithm is equipped with Tensor Networks, a highly efficient data structure, and executed both on TensorFlow Quantum and TorchQuantum which are the quantum extensions of famous machine learning platforms - TensorFlow and PyTorch, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm are confirmed by the experimental results of almost all types of quantum algorithms already implemented on realistic quantum computers, including quantum supremacy algorithms (beyond the capability of classical algorithms), quantum machine learning models, quantum approximate optimization algorithms, and variational quantum eigensolvers with up to 21 quantum bits.

TI Control protocol for dynamic synthesis of qubit and qudit gates using
   photonic pulses and magnetic fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a theoretical control protocol designed for the dynamic synthesis of single-qubit and four-level qudit quantum gates using external parameters, such as photonic Gaussian pulses and magnetic fields, in a microcavity-quantum well system. Our approach takes advantage of tunable coherent light-matter interactions that can be modulated by the magnetic field between the exciton and negative trion coupled to the lowest photonic mode. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve precise manipulation of populations of encoded quantum states through the unitary evolution of the system. In particular, we illustrate our optimization method for generating a single-qubit gate with a mean fidelity of 99.99 as well as the realization of an iswap gate in the four-level qudit case with a fidelity of 99.6.

TI Hybrid Keys in Practice: Combining Classical, Quantum and Post-Quantum
   Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Currently, with the threat of quantum computer attacks, the idea of combining several same-type primitives has reemerged. This is also the case for cryptographic keys where a hybrid quantum key exchange combination allows for preserving the security guarantees of pre-quantum schemes and achieving quantum resistance of post-quantum schemes. In this article, we present a concrete 3-key combiner system implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) platform. Our system involves a pre-quantum Key EXchange scheme (KEX), a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism, and a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) algorithm. The proposed 3-key combiner is proven to be secure in the quantum standard model and it is INDistinguishable under a Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA). Our combiner can run in small FPGA platforms due to its relatively low resources usage. In particular, the key combiner without QKD is able to output up to 1 624 keys per second and the key combiner with QKD is able to output up to 9.2 keys per second.

AB Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, their implementation faces significant challenges due to disparity between required dense qubit connectivity and sparse hardware architectures. Current approaches often either underutilize QEC circuit features or focus on manual designs tailored to specific codes and architectures, limiting their capability and generality. In response, we introduce QECC-Synth, an automated compiler for QEC code implementation that addresses these challenges. We leverage the ancilla bridge technique tailored to the requirements of QEC circuits and introduces a systematic classification of its design space flexibilities. We then formalize this problem using the MaxSAT framework to optimize these flexibilities. Evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms existing methods while demonstrating broader applicability across diverse QEC codes and hardware architectures.

TI Real-time quantum error correction beyond break-even
SO NATURE
AB The ambition of harnessing the quantum for computation is at odds with the fundamental phenomenon of decoherence. The purpose of quantum error correction (QEC) is to counteract the natural tendency of a complex system to decohere. This cooperative process, which requires participation of multiple quantum and classical components, creates a special type of dissipation that removes the entropy caused by the errors faster than the rate at which these errors corrupt the stored quantum information. Previous experimental attempts to engineer such a process(1-7) faced the generation of an excessive number of errors that overwhelmed the error-correcting capability of the process itself. Whether it is practically possible to utilize QEC for extending quantum coherence thus remains an open question. Here we answer it by demonstrating a fully stabilized and error-corrected logical qubit whose quantum coherence is substantially longer than that of all the imperfect quantum components involved in the QEC process, beating the best of them with a coherence gain of G = 2.27 +/- 0.07. We achieve this performance by combining innovations in several domains including the fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits and model-free reinforcement learning.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum error correction for Steane's seven-qubit color
   code with few or no extra qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Steane's seven-qubit quantum code is a natural choice for fault-tolerance experiments because it is small and just two extra qubits are enough to correct errors. However, the two-qubit error-correction technique, known as 'flagged' syndrome extraction, works slowly, measuring only one syndrome at a time. This is a disadvantage in experiments with high qubit rest error rates. We extend the technique to extract multiple syndromes at once, without needing more qubits. Qubits for different syndromes can flag errors in each other. This gives equally fast and more qubit-efficient alternatives to Steane's error-correction method, and also conforms to planar geometry constraints. We further show that Steane's code and some others can be error-corrected with no extra qubits, provided there are at least two code blocks. The rough idea is that two seven-qubit codewords can be temporarily joined into a twelve-qubit code, freeing two qubits for flagged syndrome measurement.

TI Quantum repeaters based on individual electron spins and
   nuclear-spin-ensemble memories in quantum dots
SO QUANTUM
AB Inspired by recent developments in the control and manipulation of quantum dot nuclear spins, which allow for the transfer of an electron spin state to the surrounding nuclear-spin ensemble for storage, we propose a quantum repeater scheme that combines individual quantum dot electron spins and nuclear-spin ensembles, which serve as spin-photon interfaces and quantum memories respectively. We consider the use of low-strain quantum dots embedded in high-cooperativity optical microcavities. Quantum dot nuclear-spin ensembles allow for the long-term storage of entangled states, and heralded entanglement swapping is performed using cavity-assisted gates. We highlight the advances in quantum dot technologies required to realize our quantum repeater scheme which promises the establishment of high-fidelity entanglement over long distances with a distribution rate exceeding that of the direct transmission of photons.

TI A Connection- Oriented Entanglement Distribution Design in Quantum
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum networks create a completely new way for communication, and the most important function of a quantum network is to generate long-distance quantum entanglement to serve a number of quantum applications. As the scale of the network expands, in order to establish end-to-end entanglement between two remote nodes, entangled pairs need to be generated and distributed among multiple repeaters along the path from the source to the destination, which requires a specific protocol to negotiate resource allocations and quantum operations among the repeaters. Thus, to realize such remote entanglement distribution in a quantum network, designing a stable and reliable protocol becomes urgent and necessary. In this article, we focus on how to guarantee the generation rate of entangled pairs between any two quantum nodes to meet the requirements of various quantum applications in a large-scale quantum network. We present a connection-oriented entanglement distribution protocol inspired by the connection-oriented communication model in classical networks. Our protocol is located in the network layer of the quantum network to enable end-to-end quantum communication. Three main features are provided by the proposed protocol: 1) it is reliable and can guarantee the successful entanglement generation; 2) it can reduce the influence of quantum decoherence via reducing the latency caused by resource competition; and 3) it can guarantee the rate of generating entanglement between two quantum nodes according to the requirement of quantum applications.

TI Efficient Pauli Channel Estimation with Logarithmic Quantum Memory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this work, we consider one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating eigenvalues of an n-qubit Pauli noise channel. Prior work [Chen et al., Phys. Rev. A 105, 032435 (2022)] has proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime in which one has a limited amount of quantum memory; i.e., any protocol with <= 0.99n ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided that it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward. Surprisingly, in this work we show that concatenating protocols with an extremely small amount of quantum memory achieve an exponential advantage for this task. We give a protocol that can estimate any prescribed set of eigenvalues A of a Pauli channel to error epsilon using only O(loglog(|A|)/epsilon(2)) ancilla qubits, O(n(2)/epsilon(2)) measurements, and O(n(2)|A|/epsilon(2)) queries to the Pauli channel. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla-even a concatenating one-must make Omega(2(n)/epsilon(2)) measurements. We also prove that the number of queries cannot be improved significantly: with k ancilla qubits, Omega(2((n-k)/3)) queries to the channel are necessary to learn all eigenvalues, even for concatenating protocols.

TI Topologically Protected Polarization Quantum Entanglement on a Photonic
   Chip
SO CHIP
AB Quantum entanglement, as the strictly non-classical phenomenon, is the kernel of quantum computing and quantum simulation, and has been widely applied ranging from fundamental tests of quantum physics to quantum information processing. Meanwhile, the topological phase is found inherently capable of protecting physical fields from unavoidable fabrication-induced disorder, which inspires the potential application of topological protection to quantum states. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of topologically protected quantum entangled states on a photonic chip. The process tomography shows that quantum entanglement can be well preserved by the topological states even when the chip material introduces disorder and relative polarization rotation in phase space. Our work links the fields of materials, topological science and quantum physics, opening the door to wide applications of topological enhancement in quantum regime.

TI Advancing quantum communication security: Metamaterial based quantum key
   distribution with enhanced protocols
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is increasingly pivotal in securing communication channels against the looming threats posed by quantum computing. However, existing QKD protocols encounter challenges related to efficiency and transmission capabilities. In response, this research investigates the integration of metamaterials into QKD systems, aiming to fortify security and enhance practicality. In the current landscape of quantum communication, where the vulnerability of classical encryption methods is magnified by rapid advancements in quantum computing, finding innovative solutions is imperative. This study is motivated by the need to strengthen the security and viability of QKD protocols to meet the demands of evolving cryptographic threats. By integrating metamaterials, the authors optimise quantum state control, improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enable longer transmission distances. Through mathematical modelling and simulations, the authors demonstrate how metamaterials reduce errors and enhance the robustness of QKD systems. Our findings show significant improvements in transmission efficiency and security, making Metamaterial-Based Quantum Key Distribution (MQKD) a promising approach for future quantum communication networks. The study not only advances the understanding of the theoretical foundations, but also presents simulated results illustrating the practical effectiveness of MQKD. The exploration of these innovative techniques contributes to the ongoing efforts to secure quantum communication channels.
   To summarise, this study made the following contributions: (i). Alice produces a series of photons, with each one being produced in a polarisation state that is randomly selected. (ii). Bob conducts measurements on randomly selected bases (vertical/horizontal or diagonal/anti-diagonal) with predetermined probabilities on incoming photons. (iii). A cascade code error coding mechanism was incorporated to reduce the error rate of the generated key. Syndrome Vector Comparison and Matrix Construction and Solution have been implemented to generate the error-free key. (iv). Privacy amplification (Metamaterial hash function) technique employed to modify the generated key which leads to an increase in security. The proposed MQKD protocol reduced error rates, faster key generation, and improved performance over longer distances.image

To provide ultimate insight into this fascinating area of physics, the realization of dedicated experiments in space will sooner or later become a necessity. Quantum technologies, and among them quantum memories in particular, are providing novel approaches to reach conclusive experimental results due to their advanced state of development backed by decades of progress. Storing quantum states for prolonged time will make it possible to study Bell tests on astronomical baselines, to increase measurement precision for investigations of gravitational effects on quantum systems, or enable distributed networks of quantum sensors and clocks. We here promote the case of exploiting quantum memories for fundamental physics in space, and discuss both distinct experiments as well as potential quantum memory platforms and their performance.

TI Probabilistic one-time programs using quantum entanglement
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum technology allows for unparalleled levels of data and software protection. Probabilistic one-time programs harness these capabilities for quantum-assisted classical computations by encoding classical software in small quantum states resulting in computer programs that can be used only once. Such self-destructing one-time programs facilitate a variety of applications reaching from software distribution to one-time delegation of signature authority. Whereas previous experiments demonstrated the feasibility of such schemes, the practical applications were limited. Here we present an improved protocol for one-time programs that resolves major drawbacks of previous schemes, by employing entangled qubit pairs. This results in four orders of magnitude higher count rates and the ability to execute a program long after the quantum information exchange has taken place. We implement a one-time delegation of signature authority over an underground fiber link between university buildings in downtown Vienna, emphasizing the compatibility of our scheme with prepare-and-measure quantum internet networks.

TI Electronic Noise Considerations for Designing Integrated Solid-State
   Quantum Memories
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB As quantum networks expand and are deployed outside research laboratories, a need arises to design and integrate compact control electronics for each memory node. It is essential to understand the performance requirements for such systems, especially concerning tolerable levels of noise, since these specifications dramatically affect a system's design complexity and cost. Here, using an approach that can be easily generalized across quantum-hardware platforms, a case study based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is presented. The effects of phase noise and timing jitter in the control system in conjunction are modeled and experimentally verified with the spin qubit's environmental noise. The impact of different phase noise characteristics on the fidelity of dynamical decoupling sequences is also considered. The results demonstrate a procedure to specify design requirements for integrated quantum control signal generators for solid-state spin qubits, depending on their coherence time, intrinsic noise spectrum, and required fidelity.

TI Quantum-assisted rendezvous on graphs: explicit algorithms and quantum
   computer simulations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study quantum advantage in one-step rendezvous games on simple graphs analytically, numerically, and using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Our protocols realise the recently discovered (Mironowicz 2023 New J. Phys. 25 013023) optimal bounds for small cycle graphs and cubic graphs. In the case of cycle graphs, we generalise the protocols to arbitrary graph size. The NISQ processor experiments realise the expected quantum advantage with high accuracy for rendezvous on the complete graph K3. In contrast, for the graph 2K4, formed by two disconnected 4-vertex complete graphs, the performance of the NISQ hardware is sub-classical, consistent with the deeper circuit and known qubit decoherence and gate error rates.

TI A Best-Path Approach to the Design of a Hybrid Space-Ground Quantum
   Network with Dynamic Constraints
SO PHOTONICS
AB The design and operation of quantum networks are both decisive in the current push towards a global quantum internet. Although space-enabled quantum connectivity has already been identified as a beneficial candidate for long-range quantum channels for over two decades, the architecture of a hybrid space-ground network is still a work in progress. Here, we propose an analysis of such a network based on a best-path approach, where either fiber- or satellite-based elementary links can be concatenated to form a repeater chain. The network consisting of quantum information processing nodes, equipped with both ground and space connections, is mapped into a graph structure, where edge weights represent the achievable secret key rates, chosen as the figure of merit for the network analysis. A weight minimization algorithm allows for identifying the best path dynamically, i.e., as the weather conditions, stray light radiance, and satellite orbital position change. From the results, we conclude that satellite links will play a significant role in the future large-scale quantum internet, in particular when node distances exceed 500 km, and both a constellation of satellites-spanning 20 or more satellites-and significant advances in filtering technology are required to achieve continuous coverage.

TI Entangling single atoms over 33 km telecom fibre
SO NATURE
AB Quantum networks promise to provide the infrastructure for many disruptive applications, such as efficient long-distance quantum communication and distributed quantum computing(1,2). Central to these networks is the ability to distribute entanglement between distant nodes using photonic channels. Initially developed for quantum teleportation(3,4) and loophole-free tests of Bell's inequality(5,6) recently, entanglement distribution has also been achieved over telecom fibres and analysed retrospectively(7,8). Yet, to fully use entanglement over long-distance quantum network links it is mandatory to know it is available at the nodes before the entangled state decays. Here we demonstrate heralded entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms generated over fibre links with a length up to 33 km. For this, we generate atom-photon entanglement in two nodes located in buildings 400 m line-of-sight apart and to overcome high-attenuation losses in the fibres convert the photons to telecom wavelength using polarization-preserving quantum frequency conversion(9). The long fibres guide the photons to a Bell-state measurement setup in which a successful photonic projection measurement heralds the entanglement of the atoms(10). Our results show the feasibility of entanglement distribution over telecom fibre links useful, for example, for device-independent quantum key distribution(11-13) and quantum repeater protocols. The presented work represents an important step towards the realization of large-scale quantum network links.

AB Quantum sensing utilizes the inherent sensitivity of a quantum system to external stimuli. Our goal is to leverage this sensitivity to develop a quantum sensor designed for the detection of ionizing radiation. Here we report on the design, fabrication, and measurement of a new quantum device for hard x-ray and gamma-ray detection. Our quantum device is based on a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) with superconducting tunnel junctions as the core device elements. We describe our experimental investigation directed toward the detection metrics of energy resolution, dynamic range, and active area. In contrast to existing superconducting detectors, the active area per qubit may be much larger than the physical area of the tunnel junctions or the physical area of the qubit device, due to the sensitivity of quantum coherence to ionizing radiation deposition within a radius on the millimeter or centimeter scale. Our experimental design enables an ionizing radiation source at room temperature to be detected by our quantum sensor at low temperature.

TI Quantum key distribution as a quantum machine learning task
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose considering Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols as a use case for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms. We define and investigate the QML task of optimizing eavesdropping attacks on the quantum circuit implementation of the BB84 protocol. QKD protocols are well understood and solid security proofs exist enabling an easy evaluation of the QML model performance. The power of easy-to-implement QML techniques is shown by finding the explicit circuit for optimal individual attacks in a noise-free setting. For the noisy setting we find, to the best of our knowledge, a new cloning algorithm, which can outperform known cloning methods. Finally, we present a QML construction of a collective attack by using classical information from QKD post-processing within the QML algorithm.

TI Research progress of integrated optical quantum computing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum computing, based on the inherent superposition and entanglement properties of quantum states,can break through the limits of classical computing power. However, under the present technical conditions, thenumber of qubits that can be manipulated is still limited. In addition, the preparation of high-precisionquantum gates and additional quantum error correction systems requires more auxiliary bits, which leads toextra cost. Therefore, it seems to be a long-term goal to realize a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer. The development of analog quantum computing is a transition path that can be used to simulate many-body physics problems. Quantum walk, as the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, is a researchhotspot in analog quantum computing. Owing to the unique quantum superposition characteristics, quantumwalk exhibits the ballistic transport properties of outward diffusion, so quantum walk provides acceleration incomputing power for various algorithms. Based on quantum walk, different computing models are derived todeal with practical physical problems in different fields, such as biology, physics, economics, and computerscience. A large number of technical routes are devoted to the experiments on realizing quantum walk, includingoptical fiber networks, superconducting systems, nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and trapped ion atomsystems. Among these routes, photons are considered as the reliable information carriers in the experiments onquantum walking due to their controllability, long coherence time. and fast speed. Therefore, in this review, we focus on different quantum walk theories and experimental implementations inoptical versions, such as traditional optical platforms, optical fiber platforms, and integrated optical quantumplatform. In recent years, the rapid development of integrated optical quantum platforms has driven theexperiments on quantum walk to move towards the stage of integration and miniaturization, and at the sametime, the experimental scale and the number of qubits have gradually increased. To this end, we summarize the technological progress of integrated optical quantum computing, includingvarious integrated optical quantum experimental platforms and their applications. Secondly, we specificallydiscuss the experiment on quantum walk and practical applications based on integrated optical quantumplatforms. Finally, we briefly describe other quantum algorithms and corresponding experimental implementations These quantum computing schemes provide computational speedups for specific physical problems. In thefuture, with the further development of integrated optical quantum technology, along with the increase in thenumber of controllable qubits and the realization of the supporting quantum error correction system, a larger-scale many-body physical system can be constructed to further expand these algorithms and move towards the field of optical quantum computing, a new stage

TI Typical machine learning datasets as low-depth quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g. by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.

TI Application of quantum machine learning using the quantum variational
   classifier method to high energy physics analysis at the LHC on IBM
   quantum computer simulator and hardware with 10 qubits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS
AB One of the major objectives of the experimental programs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the discovery of new physics. This requires the identification of rare signals in immense backgrounds. Using machine learning algorithms greatly enhances our ability to achieve this objective. With the progress of quantum technologies, quantum machine learning could become a powerful tool for data analysis in high energy physics. In this study, using IBM gate-model quantum computing systems, we employ the quantum variational classifier method in two recent LHC flagship physics analyses: t (t) over barH <i (Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair, probing the Higgs boson couplings to the top quark) and H -> mu (+) mu (-) (Higgs boson decays to two muons, probing the Higgs boson couplings to second-generation fermions). We have obtained early results with 10 qubits on the IBM quantum simulator and the IBM quantum hardware. With small training samples of 100 events on the quantum simulator, the quantum variational classifier method performs similarly to classical algorithms such as SVM (support vector machine) and BDT (boosted decision tree), which are often employed in LHC physics analyses. On the quantum hardware, the quantum variational classifier method has shown promising discrimination power, comparable to that on the quantum simulator. This study demonstrates that quantum machine learning has the ability to differentiate between signal and background in realistic physics datasets. We foresee the usage of quantum machine learning in future high-luminosity LHC physics analyses, including measurements of the Higgs boson self-couplings and searches for dark matter.

TI Path-optimized nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation on
   superconducting qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computation based on nonadiabatic geometric phases has attracted a broad range of interests, due to its fast manipulation and inherent noise resistance. However, it is limited to some special evolution paths, and the gate-times are typically longer than conventional dynamical gates, resulting in weakening of robustness and more infidelities of the implemented geometric gates. Here, we propose a path-optimized scheme for geometric quantum computation (GQC) on superconducting transmon qubits, where high-fidelity and robust universal nonadiabatic geometric gates can be implemented, based on conventional experimental setups. Specifically, we find that, by selecting appropriate evolution paths, the constructed geometric gates can be superior to their corresponding dynamical ones under different local errors. Numerical simulations show that the fidelities for single-qubit geometric phase, pi/8 and Hadamard gates can be obtained as 99.93%, 99.95% and 99.95%, respectively. Remarkably, the fidelity for two-qubit control-phase gate can be as high as 99.87%. Therefore, our scheme provides a new perspective for GQC, making it more promising in the application of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Robustness of two-qubit and three-qubit states in correlated quantum
   channels
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We investigate how the correlated actions of quantum channels affect the robustness of entangled states. We consider the Bell-like state and random two-qubit pure states in the correlated depolarizing, bit flip, bit-phase flip, and phase flip channels. It is found that the robustness of two-qubit pure states can be noticeably enhanced due to the correlations between consecutive actions of these noisy channels, and the Bell-like state is always the most robust one. We also consider the robustness of three-qubit pure states in correlated noisy channels. For the correlated bit flip and phase flip channels, the result shows that although the most robust and most fragile states are locally unitary equivalent, they exhibit different robustness in different correlated channels, and the effect of channel correlations on them is also significantly different. However, for the correlated depolarizing and bit-phase flip channels, the robustness of two special three-qubit pure states is exactly the same. Moreover, compared with the random three-qubit pure states, they are neither the most robust states nor the most fragile states.

TI Protecting Hilbert space fragmentation through quantum Zeno dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hilbert space fragmentation is an intriguing paradigm of ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum many-body systems with applications to quantum information technology, but it is usually adversely compromised in the presence of perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate the protection of constrained dynamics arising due to a combination of mirror symmetry and Hilbert space fragmentation by employing the concept of quantum Zeno dynamics. We focus on an Ising spin ladder with carefully chosen quantum fluctuations, which in the ideal case guarantee a perfect disentanglement under Hamiltonian dynamics for a large class of initial conditions. This is known to be a consequence of the interplay of Hilbert space fragmentation with a mirror symmetry, and we show numerically the effect of breaking the latter. To evince the power of this perfect disentanglement, we study the effect of generic perturbations around the fine-tuned model and show that we can protect against the undesirable growth of entanglement entropy by using a local Ising interaction on the rungs of the ladder. This allows us to suppress the entanglement entropy to an arbitrarily small value for an arbitrarily long time by controlling the strength of the rung interaction. Our work demonstrates the experimentally feasible viability of quantum Zeno dynamics in the protection of quantum information against thermalization.

TI The deterministic pattern matching based on the parameterized quantum
   circuit
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Grover quantum algorithm is an unstructured search algorithm that can run on a quantum computer with the complexity of Ov N, and is one of the typical algorithms of quantum computing. Recently, it has served as a routine for pattern-matching tasks. However, the original Grover search algorithm is probabilistic, which is not negligible for problems involving determinism. Besides that, efficient data loading is also a key challenge for the practical applications of the Grover algorithm. Here in this work, we propose a modified pattern-matching scheme with Long's quantum search algorithm, in which the quantum circuit structure search algorithm requires fewer multi- qubit quantum gates, and can obtain the desired results deterministically. Then, the comparison of the performance of our scheme and the previous algorithms is presented through numerical simulations, indicating our algorithm is feasible with current quantum technologies which is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI Practical advantage of quantum machine learning in ghost imaging
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum computation can provide practical applications where quantum algorithms can outperform classical ones. The authors focus on experimental ghost imaging using a mixture of classical and quantum machine learning (simulated on a classical computer) to process the experimental data and reconstruct/classify the image, finding that quantum machine learning techniques allow for a better reconstruction compared to standard methods.
   Demonstrating the practical advantage of quantum computation remains a long-standing challenge whereas quantum machine learning becomes a promising application that can be resorted to. In this work, we investigate the practical advantage of quantum machine learning in ghost imaging by overcoming the limitations of classical methods in blind object identification and imaging. We propose two hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms and a physical-inspired patch strategy to allow distributed quantum learning with parallel variational circuits. In light of the algorithm, we conduct experiments for imaging-free object identification and blind ghost imaging under different physical sampling rates. We further quantitatively analyze the advantage through the lens of information geometry and generalization capability. The numerical results showcase that quantum machine learning can restore high-quality images but classical machine learning fails. The advantage of identification rate are up to 10% via fair comparison with the classical machine learning methods. Our work explores a physics-related application capable of practical quantum advantage, which highlights the prospect of quantum computation in the machine learning field.

TI Hybrid Quantum Photonics Based on Artificial Atoms Placed Inside One
   Hole of a Photonic Crystal Cavity
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Spin-based, quantum-photonics promise to realize distributed quantum computing and quantum networks. The performance depends on an efficient entanglement distribution where cavity quantum electrodynamics could boost the efficiency. The central challenge is the development of compact devices with large spin-photon coupling rates and a high operation bandwidth. Photonic crystal cavities comprise strong field confinement but require highly accurate positioning of atomic systems in mode field maxima. Negatively charged silicon-vacancy centers in diamond emerged as promising atom-like systems. Spectral stability and access to long-lived, nuclear-spin memories enabled elementary demonstrations of quantum network nodes, including memory-enhanced quantum communication. In a hybrid approach, we deterministically place SiV-containing nanodiamonds inside one hole of one-dimensional, freestanding, Si3N4-based photonic crystal cavities and coherently couple individual optical transitions to cavity modes. We optimize light-matter coupling utilizing two-mode composition, waveguiding, Purcell-enhancement, and cavity-resonance tuning. The resulting photon flux increases by 14 compared to free space. Corresponding lifetime-shortening below 460 ps puts potential operation bandwidth beyond GHz rates.

TI A Theoretical Investigation of Third-Order Optical Susceptibility in
   Metronidazolium-Picrate Crystal and Its Potential for Quantum Memory
   Applications
SO ACS OMEGA
AB In this work, we report a theoretical investigation of the third-order nonlinear optical properties of the metronidazolium-picrate salt. The effects of the crystal environment are accounted for by the Iterative Charge Embedding approach, and the electronic calculations are carried out at the DFT (CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)) level. Furthermore, we use the ab initio results to parametrize a cavity Quantum Electrodynamics model for a quantum memory based on the Off-Resonant Cascaded Absorption protocol. The system's performance is then simulated via a Lindblad-type master equation that includes realistic decoherence channels. Our results confirm a strong third-order susceptibility (chi(3)) of 3.4 x 10-20 (m/V)2 at 532 nm driven by significant charge polarization in the crystal. The quantum memory simulations, initiated with a single-photon Fock state, reveal that protocol fidelity is critically dependent on the cavity quality factor. A peak retrieval fidelity of 84.51% is achieved in the strong coupling regime, which collapses to less than 1% when the system leaves this regime. These findings demonstrate that METPA is a promising material for quantum photonics, where its strong intrinsic electronic properties can be harnessed in engineered cavity Quantum Electrodynamics systems to realize high-fidelity quantum information protocols.

TI Performance analysis for crosstalk errors between parallel entangling
   gates in trapped-ion quantum error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ability to execute a large number of quantum gates in parallel is a fundamental requirement for quantum error correction, allowing an error threshold to exist under the finite coherence time of physical qubits. Recently, two-dimensional ion crystals have been demonstrated as a plausible approach to scale up the qubit number in a trapped ion quantum computer. However, although the long-range Coulomb interaction between the ions enables their strong connectivity, it also complicates the design of parallel gates and leads to intrinsic crosstalk errors. Here we examine the effects of crosstalk errors on a rotated surface code. We show that, instead of the distance-3 code considered in previous works, a distance-5 code is necessary to correct the two-qubit crosstalk error. We numerically calculate the logical error rates and coherence times under various crosstalk errors, gate infidelities, and coherence times of the physical qubits, and we optimize the parallelism level according to the competition between different error sources. We show that a break-even point can be reached under realistic parameters. We further analyze the spatial dependence of the crosstalk, and discuss the scaling of the logical error rate versus the code distance for the long-term goal of a logical error rate below 10-10.

TI Quantum Computing for Molecular Biology
SO CHEMBIOCHEM
AB Molecular biology and biochemistry interpret microscopic processes in the living world in terms of molecular structures and their interactions, which are quantum mechanical by their very nature. Whereas the theoretical foundations of these interactions are well established, the computational solution of the relevant quantum mechanical equations is very hard. However, much of molecular function in biology can be understood in terms of classical mechanics, where the interactions of electrons and nuclei have been mapped onto effective classical surrogate potentials that model the interaction of atoms or even larger entities. The simple mathematical structure of these potentials offers huge computational advantages; however, this comes at the cost that all quantum correlations and the rigorous many-particle nature of the interactions are omitted. In this work, we discuss how quantum computation may advance the practical usefulness of the quantum foundations of molecular biology by offering computational advantages for simulations of biomolecules. We not only discuss typical quantum mechanical problems of the electronic structure of biomolecules in this context, but also consider the dominating classical problems (such as protein folding and drug design) as well as data-driven approaches of bioinformatics and the degree to which they might become amenable to quantum simulation and quantum computation.

TI Experimental Certification of Quantum Entanglement Based on the
   Classical Complementary Correlations of Two-Qubit States
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum entanglement is one of the essential resources in quantum information processing. It is of importance to verify whether a quantum state is entangled. At present, a typical quantum certification focused on the classical correlations has attracted widespread attention. Here, we experimentally investigate the relation between quantum entanglement and the classical complementary correlations based on the mutual information, Pearson correlation coefficient and mutual predictability of two-qubit states. Our experimental results show the classical correlations for complementary properties have strong resolution capability to verify entanglement for two qubit pure states and Werner states. We find that the resolution capability has great performance improvement when the eigenstates of the measurement observables constitute a complete set of mutually unbiased bases. For Werner states in particular, the classical complementary correlations based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and mutual predictability can provide the ultimate bounds to certify entanglement.

TI Femtosecond laser micromachining for integrated quantum photonics
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Integrated quantum photonics, i.e. the generation, manipulation, and detection of quantum states of light in integrated photonic chips, is revolutionizing the field of quantum information in all applications, from communications to computing. Although many different platforms are being currently developed, from silicon photonics to lithium niobate photonic circuits, none of them has shown the versatility of femtosecond laser micromachining (FLM) in producing all the components of a complete quantum system, encompassing quantum sources, reconfigurable state manipulation, quantum memories, and detection. It is in fact evident that FLM has been a key enabling tool in the first-time demonstration of manyquantum devices and functionalities. Although FLM cannot achieve the same level of miniaturization of other platforms, it still has many unique advantages for integrated quantumphotonics. Inparticular, in the last five years, FLM has greatly expanded its range of quantum applications with several scientific breakthroughs achieved. For these reasons, we believe that a review article on this topic is very timely and could further promote the development of this field by convincing end-users of the great potentials of this technological platform and by stimulating more research groups in FLM to direct their efforts to the exciting field of quantum technologies.

TI Inequal Three Qubit Entanglement Using GHZ State Generation for
   Spin-Torque Based Qubit Architecture
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB This article presents the generation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states using a spin-torque-based qubit architecture, introducing a hardware-native decomposition of the Hadamard and controlled NOT (CNOT) gates. Unlike optical or superconducting implementations, the proposed approach exploits intrinsic spin-transfer-torque dynamics to realize single-qubit and entangling operations with minimal external control. The method reduces gate overhead and decoherence, enabling high-fidelity (> 99%) GHZ formation. An unequal entanglement amplitude naturally arises from spin-torque non-linearities and is analytically characterized as a tunable property advantageous for quantum secret sharing (QSS) and asymmetric quantum communication schemes. Numerical simulations of state evolution and density-matrix fidelity validate the robustness and efficiency of the approach. The results demonstrate that current-driven spin-torque interactions provide a compact, energy-efficient platform for scalable multi-qubit entanglement, linking spintronic device physics with quantum information processing.

TI Transformations of Stabilizer States in Quantum Networks
SO QUANTUM
AB Stabilizer states and graph states find application in quantum error correction, measurement-based quantum computation and various other concepts in quantum information theory. In this work, we study party-local Clifford (PLC) transformations among stabilizer states. These transformations arise as a physically motivated extension of local operations in quantum networks with access to bipartite entanglement between some of the nodes of the network. First, we show that PLC transformations among graph states are equivalent to a generalization of the well-known local complementation, which describes local Clifford transformations among graph states. Then, we introduce a mathematical framework to study PLC equivalence of stabilizer states, relating it to the classification of tuples of bilinear forms. This framework allows us to study decompositions of stabilizer states into tensor products of indecomposable ones, that is, decompositions into states from the entanglement generating set (EGS). While the EGS is finite up to 3 parties [Bravyi et al., J. Math. Phys. 47, 062106 (2006)], we show that for 4 and more parties it is an infinite set, even when considering party-local unitary transformations. Moreover, we explicitly compute the EGS for 4 parties up to 10 qubits. Finally, we generalize the framework to qudit stabilizer states in prime dimensions not equal to 2, which allows us to show that the decomposition of qudit stabilizer states into states from the EGS is unique.

TI Entanglement harvesting and quantum discord of alpha vacua in de Sitter
   space
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The CPT invariant vacuum states of a scalar field in de Sitter space, called alpha-vacua, are not unique. We explore the alpha-vacua from the quantum information perspective by a pair of static Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors coupled to a scalar field with either monopole or dipole coupling, which are in time-like zero separation or space-like antipodal separation. The analytical form of the reduced final state of the UDW detector is derived. We study the entanglement harvesting and quantum discord of the reduced state, which characterize the quantum entanglement and quantum correlation of the underlying alpha-vacua, respectively. Our results imply that the quantum entanglement gravitated by de Sitter gravity behaves quite differently for time-like and space-like separations. It experiences "sudden death" for the former and grows for the latter as the measuring time or the value of alpha increases. This demonstrates the nonlocal nature of quantum entanglement. For the quantum discord, we find no "sudden death" behavior, and it experiences superhorizon suppression, which explains the superhorizon decoherence in the inflationary universe scenario. Overall, the time-like or space-like quantum entanglement and correlation behave differently on their dependence of alpha, measuring time and spectral gaps, with details discussed in this work.

TI Improving Gaussian channel simulation using nonunity-gain heralded
   quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Gaussian channel simulation is an essential paradigm in understanding the evolution of bosonic quantum states. It allows us to investigate how such states are influenced by the environment and how they transmit quantum information. This makes it an essential tool for understanding the properties of Gaussian quantum communication. Quantum teleportation provides an avenue to effectively simulate Gaussian channels, such as amplifier channels, loss channels, and classically additive noise channels. However, implementations of these channels, particularly quantum amplifier channels and channels capable of performing Gaussian noise suppression, are limited by experimental imperfections and nonideal entanglement resources. In this work, we overcome these difficulties using a heralded quantum teleportation scheme that is empowered by a measurement-based noiseless linear amplifier. The noiseless linear amplification enables us to simulate a range of Gaussian channels that were previously inaccessible. In particular, we demonstrate the simulation of nonphysical Gaussian channels otherwise inaccessible using conventional means. We report Gaussian noise suppression, effectively converting an imperfect quantum channel into a near-identity channel. The performance of Gaussian noise suppression is quantified by calculating the transmitted entanglement.

TI Quantum teleportation with relativistic communication from first
   principles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper we provide a genuine relativistic quantum teleportation protocol the classical communication component of which makes use of relativistic causal propagation of a quantum field. Consequently, the quantum teleportation is fully relativistic by construction. Our scheme is based on the Unruh-DeWitt qubit detector model, where the quantum state being teleported is associated to an actual qubit rather than the field mode considered by Alsing and Milburn [P. M. Alsing and G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 180404 (2003)]. We show that the existing works in (relativistic) quantum information, including good definitions of one-shot and asymptotic channel capacities, as well as algebraic formulation of quantum field theory, already provide us with all the necessary ingredients to construct a fundamentally relativistic teleportation protocol in a relatively straightforward manner.

TI Quantum Entanglement in Molecular Optomechanical System
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum entanglement serves as a cornerstone of modern quantum technologies, with critical applications in communication, teleportation, and cryptography. A key challenge in the practical implementation of these technologies lies in achieving the stable generation of strongly coupled macroscopic quantum entanglement while enhancing its robustness against thermal noise. We address this challenge innovatively by introducing a molecular system with dual mechanisms: first, the collective coupling effect of molecules significantly enhances the light-matter interaction strength; second, the inherent properties of the molecular system effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise. Based on this framework, we systematically investigate the entanglement characteristics and control mechanisms in molecular optomechanical systems. Through the optimization of key parameters, including coupling strength and detuning, we achieve the stable preparation of maximum entanglement within experimentally feasible ranges. This innovative approach not only overcomes the limitations of traditional optomechanical systems but also provides a new technical pathway toward practical quantum information processing. Method We establish a molecular optomechanical system composed of (N) molecules and two cavity modes, where the molecules are coupled to the visible (VIS) mode via optomechanical interaction and to the low-frequency infrared (IR) mode through bilinear coupling. The system Hamiltonian is constructed within the rotating-wave approximation, incorporating the dissipation effects of both the cavity and molecular vibrational modes. By introducing collective molecular operators, the system Hamiltonian is simplified, and the dynamics are described using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. To handle the nonlinear terms, linearization techniques are employed by decomposing the Heisenberg operators into steady-state mean values and quantum fluctuation components. The steady-state solution of the system is obtained by solving the linearized quantum Langevin equations, where the quantum state is characterized by the covariance matrix. Bipartite entanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity, while tripartite entanglement is evaluated via the minimal residual contangle. Numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of coupling strength, detuning, dissipation rates, and temperature on entanglement. The primary objective is to identify optimal parameter ranges that simultaneously maximize the degree of entanglement and robustness. Results and Discussions We reveal remarkable quantum entanglement characteristics in molecular optomechanical systems. First, the degree of both bipartite and tripartite entanglement exhibits significant dependence on the coupling strengths and dissipation rates. Appropriate coupling strengths can substantially enhance entanglement, while excessive coupling induces decoherence effects that degrade entanglement. Specifically, maximum entanglement is achieved when the coupling strengths Ga and Gc fall within optimal ranges (Figs. 2 and 6). Second, in resonant and near-resonant regimes, we observe entanglement transfer and complementary distribution among different subsystems (Fig. 3). Notably, the tripartite entanglement demonstrates exceptional thermal robustness, maintaining persistence at 600?800 K (Fig. 5).
   This high-temperature stability stems from the molecular system's inherent capability to suppress thermal noise, which provides critical advantages for practical quantum technologies that depend on stable macroscopic entanglement. These results demonstrate that molecular optomechanical systems serve as versatile platforms for generating and controlling macroscopic quantum entanglement while significantly improving decoherence suppression. The work advances new directions for quantum optics and quantum information science by bridging fundamental quantum effects with practical applications. Conclusions A novel scheme leveraging a molecular optomechanical system has been introduced to generate and control stable bipartite and tripartite quantum entanglement at macroscopic scales. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the remarkable potential of molecular optomechanical systems in quantum entanglement generation and manipulation. The robust performance under high-temperature and high-dissipation conditions is particularly highlighted, which provides new insights and methodologies for advancing quantum information science. The intensity of quantum entanglement can be significantly enhanced by precisely tuning the coupling strengths and dissipation rates. This discovery not only provides clear parameter optimization guidelines for experimental design but also establishes a theoretical foundation for efficient quantum entanglement generation. In particular, the system achieves maximum entanglement when the coupling strengths are within optimal ranges, which provides crucial references for experimental parameter optimization. The entanglement transfer and complementary distribution phenomena are observed among different subsystems in resonant and near-resonant regimes. It demonstrates the capability of dynamic quantum information redistribution among different modes and enables real-time entanglement control. Such dynamic manipulation provides new flexibility for quantum information processing and holds particular promise for applications in quantum networks and multi-task quantum information processing. Furthermore, the tripartite entanglement exhibits exceptional thermal robustness and remains persistent within the range of 600?800 K. The introduction of molecules suppresses the decoherence effect induced by thermal noise, consequently enhancing the temperature robustness of entanglement in the system. This thermal robustness offers critical advantages for practical quantum technologies, especially in scenarios requiring stable macroscopic entanglement. In conclusion, we present a new molecular optomechanical system for generating and controlling macroscopic quantum entanglement. We demonstrate its exceptional robustness against both thermal noise and dissipation through combined theoretical and numerical analysis. These findings provide new theoretical foundations for designing complex cavity optomechanical experiments and offer important references for advancing quantum optics and quantum information science. Future research could further explore specific applications of molecular optomechanical systems in quantum networks, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies to promote further development in quantum information science.

TI Experimental Implementation of Quantum Algorithm for Association Rules
   Mining
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB Recently, a quantum algorithm for a fundamentally important task in data mining, association rules mining (ARM), called qARM for short, has been proposed. Notably, qARM achieves significant speedup over its classical counterpart for implementing the main task of ARM, i.e., finding frequent itemsets from a transaction database. In this paper, we experimentally implement qARM on both real quantum computers and a quantum computing simulator via the IBM quantum computing platform. In the first place, we design quantum circuits of qARM for a 2 x 2 transaction database (i.e., a transaction database involving two transactions and two items), and run it on four real five-qubit IBM quantum computers as well as on the simulator. For a larger 4 x 4 transaction database which would lead to circuits with more qubits and a higher depth than the currently accessible IBM real quantum devices can handle, we also construct the quantum circuits of qARM and execute them on "aer_simulator" alone. Both experimental results show that all the frequent itemsets from the two transaction databases are successfully derived as desired, demonstrating the correctness and feasibility of qARM. Our work may serve as a benchmarking, and provide prototypes for implementing qARM for larger transaction databases on both noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and universal fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Multiplexed quantum repeaters based on dual-species trapped-ion systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Trapped ions form an advanced technology platform for quantum information processing with long qubit coherence times, high-fidelity quantum logic gates, optically active qubits, and a potential to scale up in size while preserving a high level of connectivity between qubits. These traits make them attractive not only for quantum computing, but also for quantum networking. Dedicated, special-purpose trapped-ion processors in conjunction with suitable interconnecting hardware can be used to form quantum repeaters that enable high-rate quantum communications between distant trapped-ion quantum computers in a network. In this regard, hybrid traps with two distinct species of ions, where one ion species can generate ion-photon entanglement that is useful for optically interfacing with the network and the other has long memory lifetimes, useful for qubit storage, have been proposed for entanglement distribution. We consider an architecture for a repeater based on such dual-species trapped-ion systems. We propose and analyze a protocol based on spatial and temporal mode multiplexing for entanglement distribution across a line network of such repeaters. Our protocol offers enhanced rates compared to rates previously reported for such repeaters. We determine the ion resources required at the repeaters to attain the enhanced rates, and the best rates attainable when constraints are placed on the number of repeaters and the number of ions per repeater. Our results bolster the case for near-term trapped-ion systems as quantum repeaters for long distance quantum communications.

TI Quantum computing enhanced computational catalysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum computation of electronic energies can break the curse of dimensionality that plagues many-particle quantum mechanics. It is for this reason that a universal quantum computer has the potential to fundamentally change computational chemistry and materials science, areas in which strong electron correlations present severe hurdles for traditional electronic structure methods. Here we present a state-of-the-art analysis of accurate energy measurements on a quantum computer for computational catalysis, using improved quantum algorithms with more than an order of magnitude improvement over the best previous algorithms. As a prototypical example of local catalytic chemical reactivity we consider the case of a ruthenium catalyst that can bind, activate, and transform carbon dioxide to the high-value chemical methanol. We aim at accurate resource estimates for the quantum computing steps required for assessing the electronic energy of key intermediates and transition states of its catalytic cycle. In particular, we present quantum algorithms for double-factorized representations of the four-index integrals that can significantly reduce the computational cost over previous algorithms, and we discuss the challenges of increasing active space sizes to accurately deal with dynamical correlations. We address the requirements for future quantum hardware in order to make a universal quantum computer a successful and reliable tool for quantum computing enhanced computational materials science and chemistry, and identify open questions for further research.

TI A Modular Quantum Compilation Framework for Distributed Quantum
   Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB For most practical applications, quantum algorithms require large resources in terms of qubit number, much larger than those available with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors. With the network and communication functionalities provided by the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing (DQC) is considered as a scalable approach for increasing the number of available qubits for computational tasks. For DQC to be effective and efficient, a quantum compiler must find the best partitioning for the quantum algorithm and then perform smart remote operation scheduling to optimize Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair consumption. At the same time, the quantum compiler should also find the best local transformation for each partition. In this article, we present a modular quantum compilation framework for DQC that takes into account both network and device constraints and characteristics. We implemented and tested a quantum compiler based on the proposed framework with some circuits of interest, such as the VQE and QFT ones, considering different network topologies, with quantum processors characterized by heavy-hexagon coupling maps. We also devised a strategy for remote scheduling that can exploit both TeleGate and TeleData operations and tested the impact of using either only TeleGates or both. The evaluation results show that TeleData operations can have a positive impact on the number of consumed EPR pairs, depending on the characteristic of compiled circuit. Meanwhile, choosing a more connected network topology helps reduce the number of layers dedicated to remote operations.

TI Assessing the Limits of Simple Quantum Hardware
SO ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA
AB Although quantum computing is advancing rapidly, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the computations available to quantum computer researchers is still a challenge today. This paper reviews the main directions of quantum error correction (QEC) techniques that can potentially be applied in superconducting qubit computers. We present the Mermin-Peres magic square game, where the quantum strategy has theoretical advantages over classical and can provide a benchmark solution for testing the accuracy of quantum computation. In the experimental part of our work, we run the algorithm of the Mermin-Peres magic square game on IBMQ quantum computers accessible via the cloud. Our experimental results failed to demonstrate a proven quantum advantage of the game on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware tested, confirming the inevitable need to implement error correction techniques on physical qubits. By aligning with the Digital and Cognitive Corporate Reality (DCR) theme, this research seeks to inform business strategies incorporating emerging quantum technologies.

TI Quantum logic gate synthesis as a Markov decision process
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Reinforcement learning has witnessed recent applications to a variety of tasks in quantum programming. The underlying assumption is that those tasks could be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Here, we investigate the feasibility of this assumption by exploring its consequences for single-qubit quantum state preparation and gate compilation. By forming discrete MDPs, we solve for the optimal policy exactly through policy iteration. We find optimal paths that correspond to the shortest possible sequence of gates to prepare a state or compile a gate, up to some target accuracy. Our method works in both the absence and presence of noise and compares favorably to other quantum compilation methods, such as the Ross-Selinger algorithm. This work provides theoretical insight into why reinforcement learning may be successfully used to find optimally short gate sequences in quantum programming.

TI Deterministic and multiuser quantum teleportation network of
   continuous-variable polarization states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum teleportation is widely applied as a key ingredient in quantum information science, and quantum network provides unique abilities for upscaling its applications. Polarization state of light is a vital degree of freedom with the advantages of remote transfer and direct light-atom interaction. To construct a multiuser quantum network, deterministic quantum teleportation of polarization state in more users' network remains challenging. Compared with photonic quantum state, the deterministic quantum teleportation network of polarization state is realized with a single set of continuous-variable entangled states. The key techniques include only one set of quadrature entangled network, single quadrature controller, and active polarization controller. Arbitrary polarization state is deterministically and controllably teleported in such a system involving four or three users. This system is deterministic and scalable with user number, which enables the potential application in deterministic metropolitan quantum network.

TI Blind quantum computation where a user only performs single-qubit gates
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Blind quantum computation (BQC) allows a user who has limited quantum ability to complete a quantum computational task with the aid of a remote quantum server, such that the user's input, output, and even the algorithm can be kept hidden from the server. Up to now, there are mainly two models of BQC. One is that the client just needs the ability to prepare single qubits initiated by Broadbent, Fitzsimons, and Kashefi and the other is that the client only needs to perform single-qubit measurements first given by Morimae. In this paper, we put forward a new model of BQC in which a user only requires implementing a few single-qubit gates. We also propose a specific BQC protocol where a user only needs to implement two kinds of single-qubit gates to show the feasibility of the presented model and thus answer positively the open question whether a verified BQC protocol that only requires single-qubit gates for the user can be designed. This circuit model is quite flexible since various users with the ability to perform different single-qubit gates may all have the chance to achieve BQC. Furthermore, compared with the other two models, it may be more suitable for practical implementation in some experimental setups such as trapped ions and superconducting systems since the single-qubit gates are the most exact operations in such systems.

TI One-Shot Manipulation of Entanglement for Quantum Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We show that the dynamic resource theory of quantum entanglement can be formulated using the superchannel theory. In this formulation, we identify the separable channels and the class of free superchannels that preserve channel separability as free resources, and choose the swap channels as dynamic entanglement golden units. Our first result is that the one-shot dynamic entanglement cost of a bipartite quantum channel under the free superchannels is bounded by the standard log-robustness of channels. The one-shot distillable dynamic entanglement of a bipartite quantum channel under the free superchannels is found to be bounded by a resource monotone that we construct from the hypothesis-testing relative entropy of channels with minimization over separable channels. We also address the one-shot catalytic dynamic entanglement cost of a bipartite quantum channel under a larger class of free superchannels that could generate the dynamic entanglement which is asymptotically negligible; it is bounded by the generalized log-robustness of channels.

TI Quantum entanglement assisted via Duffing nonlinearity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a scheme to enhance quantum entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting the so-called Duffing nonlinearity. Our model system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, both driven by an optical field. One resonator supports Duffing nonlinearity, while the other does not. The resonators are coupled to each other via the so-called phonon-hopping mechanism. The hopping rate is theta-phase dependent that induces exceptional point singularities in the system. Interestingly, while the resonator with Duffing nonlinearity exhibits vanishing entanglement with light, we observe an increase in entanglement between light and the other mechanical resonator. This enhanced entanglement persists longer against thermal fluctuations compared to the one without the nonlinearity. Additionally, this entanglement features a sudden death and revival phenomenon, where the peaks happen at multiples of theta = pi/2. This work opens another avenue for exploiting nonlinear resources to generate strong quantum entanglement, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum computing within complex systems.

TI Symbolic model checking quantum circuits in Maude
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB This article presents a symbolic approach to model checking quantum circuits using a set of laws from quantum mechanics and basic matrix operations with Dirac notation. We use Maude, a high-level specification/programming language based on rewriting logic, to implement our symbolic approach. As case studies, we use the approach to formally specify several quantum communication protocols in the early work of quantum communication and formally verify their correctness: Superdense Coding, Quantum Teleportation, Quantum Secret Sharing, Entanglement Swapping, Quantum Gate Teleportation, Two Mirror-image Teleportation, and Quantum Network Coding. We demonstrate that our approach/implementation can be a first step toward a general framework to formally specify and verify quantum circuits in Maude. The proposed way to formally specify a quantum circuit makes it possible to describe the quantum circuit in Maude such that the formal specification can be regarded as a series of quantum gate/measurement applications. Once a quantum circuit has been formally specified in the proposed way together with an initial state and a desired property expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL), the proposed model checking technique utilizes a builtin Maude LTL model checker to automatically conduct formal verification that the quantum circuit enjoys the property starting from the initial state.

TI Post-quantum cryptography Algorithm's standardization and performance
   analysis
SO ARRAY
AB -Quantum computer is no longer a hypothetical idea. It is the world's most important technology and there is a race among countries to get supremacy in quantum technology. It is the technology that will reduce the computing time from years to hours or even minutes. The power of quantum computing will be a great support for the scientific community. However, it raises serious threats to cybersecurity. Theoretically, all the cryptography algorithms are vulnerable to attack. The practical quantum computers, when available with millions of qubits capacity, will be able to break nearly all modern public-key cryptographic systems. Before the quantum computers arrive with sufficient 'qubit' capacity, we must be ready with quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms, tools, techniques, and deployment strategies to protect the ICT infrastructure. This paper discusses in detail the global effort for the design, development, and standardization of various quantum-safe cryptography algorithms along with the performance analysis of some of the potential quantum-safe algorithms. Most quantum-safe algorithms need more CPU cycles, higher runtime memory, and a large key size. The objective of the paper is to analyze the feasibility of the various quantum-safe cryptography algorithms.

TI Implementation of space-division multiplexed entanglement-based quantum
   cryptography over multicore fiber
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum key distribution has shown promising advances in information transmission security. In particular, quantum communication schemes based on entanglement have enormous potential to enhance the security and efficiency of information transmission. Therefore, today's efforts address overcoming issues related to high data transmission and long-distance implementations to enable real-world quantum communication applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a multiplexing technique to enhance the secret key rate by exploiting the momentum correlation of photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion. We distributed polarization-entangled photon pairs into opposite cores within a 19-core multicore fiber. We estimated the secret key rates in a configuration with 6 and 12 cores from the entanglement visibility after transmission through a 411-m-long multicore fiber. Our results can lead to the transmission of more information per photon and the establishment of novel quantum networks with one common communication channel, which opens the possibility of deploying new quantum channels over longer distances.

TI Quantum error correction under numerically exact open-quantum-system
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The known quantum error-correcting codes are typically built on approximative open-quantum-system models such as Born-Markov master equations. However, it is an open question how such codes perform in actual physical systems that, to some extent, necessarily exhibit phenomena beyond the limits of these models. To this end, we employ numerically exact open-quantum-system dynamics to analyze the performance of a five-qubit error-correction code where each qubit is coupled to its own bath. We first focus on the performance of a single error-correction cycle covering timescales and coupling strengths beyond those of Born-Markov models. We observe distinct power-law behavior of the error-corrected channel infidelity proportional to t(2 alpha): alpha less than or similar to 2 in the ultrashort times t < 3/omega(c) and alpha approximate to 1/2 in the short-time range 3/omega(c )< t < 30/omega(c), where omega(c) is the cutoff angular frequency of the bath. Furthermore, the observed scaling of the performance of error correction is found to be robust against various imperfections in physical qubit systems, such as perturbations in qubit-qubit coupling strengths and parametric disorder. For repeated error correction, we demonstrate the breaking of the five-qubit error-correction code and of the Born-Markov models if the repetition rate of the error-correction cycles exceeds 2 pi/omega or the coupling strength kappa greater than or similar to omega/10, where omega is the angular frequency of the qubit. Our results provide bounds of validity for the standard quantum error-correction codes and pave the way for applying numerically exact open-quantum-system methods for further studies of error correction beyond simple error models and for other strongly coupled many-body models.

TI Free-Space Quantum Teleportation with Orbital Angular Momentum
   Multiplexed Continuous Variable Entanglement
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum teleportation is one of the fundamental primitives of quantum cryptography. In order to achieve a wider range of high-capacity information transfer, we propose a free-space quantum teleportation (QT) protocol with orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexed continuous variable (CV) entangled states. The preparation of the entangled states is accomplished by the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process occurring in a hot 85Rb vapor cell, and the mode selection for the Bell-state measurement is achieved by employing the balanced homodyne detection technique. The fidelity of teleporting EPR entangled states carrying different topological charges via a Kolmogorov-type atmospheric turbulence channel is derived, and the superiority of enhancing the system channel capacity via OAM multiplexing is demonstrated. Our work provides a feasible scheme to implement high-capacity quantum communication in atmospheric environments.

TI Exponential Learning Advantages with Conjugate States and Minimal
   Quantum Memory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The ability of quantum computers to directly manipulate and analyze quantum states stored in quantum memory allows them to learn about aspects of our physical world that would otherwise be invisible given a modest number of measurements. Here we investigate a new learning resource, which could be available to quantum computers in the future-measurements on the unknown state accompanied by its complex conjugate rho circle times rho*. For a certain shadow tomography task, we surprisingly find that measurements on only copies of rho circle times rho* can be exponentially more powerful than measurements on rho(circle times k), even for large K. This expands the class of provable exponential advantages using only a constant overhead quantum memory, or minimal quantum memory, and we provide a number of examples where the state rho* is naturally available in both computational and physical applications. In addition, we precisely quantify the power of classical shadows on single copies under a generalized Clifford ensemble and give a class of quantities that can be efficiently learned. The learning task we study in both the single copy and quantum memory settings is physically natural and corresponds to real-space observables with a limit of bosonic modes, where it achieves an exponential improvement in detecting certain signals under a noisy background. We quantify a new and powerful resource in quantum learning, and we believe the advantage may find applications in improving quantum simulation, learning from quantum sensors, and uncovering new physical phenomena.

TI GHZ-like states in the Qubit-Qudit Rabi model
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study a Rabi type Hamiltonian system in which a qubit and a d-level quantum system (qudit) are coupled through a common resonator. In the weak and strong coupling limits the spectrum is analysed through suitable perturbative schemes. The analysis show that the presence of the multilevels of the qudit effectively enhance the qubit-qudit interaction. The ground state of the strongly coupled system is found to be of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type. Therefore, despite the qubit-qudit strong coupling, the nature of the specific tripartite entanglement of the GHZ state suppresses the bipartite entanglement. We analyze the system dynamics under quenching and adiabatic switching of the qubit-resonator and qudit-resonator couplings. In the quench case, we found that the non-adiabatic generation of photons in the resonator is enhanced by the number of levels in the qudit. The adiabatic control represents a possible route for preparation of GHZ states. Our analysis provides relevant information for future studies on coherent state transfer in qubit-qudit systems.

TI Certifying high-dimensional quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The use of high-dimensional systems for quantum communication opens interesting perspectives, such as increased information capacity and noise resilience. In this context, it is crucial to certify that a given quantum channel can reliably transmit high-dimensional quantum information. Here we develop efficient methods for the characterization of high-dimensional quantum channels. We first present a notion of dimensionality of quantum channels and develop efficient certification methods for this quantity. We consider a simple prepare-and-measure setup and provide witnesses for both a fully and a partially trusted scenario. In turn, we apply these methods to a photonic experiment and certify dimensionalities up to 59 for a commercial graded-index multimode optical fiber. Moreover, we present extensive numerical simulations of the experiment, providing an accurate noise model for the fiber and exploring the potential of more sophisticated witnesses. Our work demonstrates the efficient characterization of high-dimensional quantum channels, a key ingredient for future quantum communication technologies.

TI Exploring the Percolation Phenomena in Quantum Networks
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum entanglement as a non-local correlation between particles is critical to the transmission of quantum information in quantum networks (QNs); the key challenge lies in establishing long-distance entanglement transmission between distant targets. This issue aligns with percolation theory, and as a result, an entanglement distribution scheme called "Classical Entanglement Percolation" (CEP) has been proposed. While this scheme provides an effective framework, "Quantum Entanglement Percolation" (QEP) indicates a lower percolation threshold through quantum preprocessing strategies, which will modify the network topology. Meanwhile, an emerging statistical theory known as "Concurrence Percolation" reveals the unique advantages of quantum networks, enabling entanglement transmission under lower conditions. It fundamentally belongs to a different universality class from classical percolation. Although these studies have made significant theoretical advancements, most are based on an idealized pure state network model. In practical applications, quantum states are often affected by thermal noise, resulting in mixed states. When these mixed states meet specific conditions, they can be transformed into pure states through quantum operations and further converted into singlets with a certain probability, thereby facilitating entanglement percolation in mixed state networks. This finding greatly broadens the application prospects of quantum networks. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the fundamental theories of quantum percolation and the latest cutting-edge research developments.

TI Towards entanglement distillation between atomic ensembles using
   high-fidelity spin operations
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Entanglement distillation is an essential ingredient for long-distance quantum communication. However, owing to their demanding requirements, integrating such entanglement distillation processing in scalable quantum devices remains an outstanding challenge. Here we propose the implementation of the filtering protocol in atomic ensembles, which are promising candidates for building quantum repeater nodes, and analyze the boost entanglement distribution rate considering different scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate the key step of this approach with a proof-of-principle experiment in a rare-earth-ion-doped crystal (Nd-143(3+):Y2SiO5). Leveraging its multi-level structure and long-lived coherence, spin manipulations are implemented with an average fidelity exceeding 97.2%, leading to the preparation of entanglement between the electron and nuclear spins with a concurrence of 0.75 with a sample temperature of 100 mK. The versatility, robustness, and potential scalability of our proposal contribute to the construction of quantum repeaters and quantum networks based on atomic ensembles.
   Entanglement distillation is essential for quantum information applications, generating remote entanglement in repeater units. Here, a filtering protocol using two-qubit entangled states in an atomic ensemble is proposed and demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment.

TI Efficient learning for linear properties of bounded-gate quantum
   circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The vast and complicated many-qubit state space forbids us to comprehensively capture the dynamics of modern quantum computers via classical simulations or quantum tomography. Recent progress in quantum learning theory prompts a crucial question: can linear properties of a many-qubit circuit with d tunable RZ gates and G - d Clifford gates be efficiently learned from measurement data generated by varying classical inputs? In this work, we prove that the sample complexity scaling linearly in d is required to achieve a small prediction error, while the corresponding computational complexity may scale exponentially in d. To address this challenge, we propose a kernel-based method leveraging classical shadows and truncated trigonometric expansions, enabling a controllable trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational overhead. Our results advance two crucial realms in quantum computation: the exploration of quantum algorithms with practical utilities and learning-based quantum system certification. We conduct numerical simulations to validate our proposals across diverse scenarios, encompassing quantum information processing protocols, Hamiltonian simulation, and variational quantum algorithms up to 60 qubits.

AB Quantum networks, which enable the transfer of quantum information across long distances, promise to provide exciting benefits and new possibilities in many areas including communication, computation, security, and metrology. These networks rely on entanglement between qubits at distant nodes to transmit information; however, creation of these quantum links is not dependent on the information to be transmitted. Researchers have explored schemes for continuous generation of entanglement, where network nodes may generate entanglement links before receiving user requests. In this paper we present an adaptive scheme that uses information from previous requests to better guide the choice of randomly generated quantum links before future requests are received. We analyze parameter spaces where such a scheme may provide benefit and observe an increase in performance of up to 75% over other continuous schemes on single-bottleneck and autonomous systems networks. We also test the scheme for other parameter choices and observe continued benefits of up to 95%. The power of our adaptive scheme on a randomized request queue is demonstrated on a single-bottleneck topology. We also explore quantum memory allocation scenarios, where a difference in latency performance implies the necessity of optimal allocation of resources for quantum networks.

TI Quantum Machine Learning-An Overview
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum computing has been proven to excel in factorization issues and unordered search problems due to its capability of quantum parallelism. This unique feature allows exponential speedup in solving certain problems. However, this advantage does not apply universally, and challenges arise when combining classical and quantum computing to achieve acceleration in computation speed. This paper aims to address these challenges by exploring the current state of quantum machine learning and benchmarking the performance of quantum and classical algorithms in terms of accuracy. Specifically, we conducted experiments with three datasets for binary classification, implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Quantum SVM (QSVM) algorithms. Our findings suggest that the QSVM algorithm outperforms classical SVM on complex datasets, and the performance gap between quantum and classical models increases with dataset complexity, as simple models tend to overfit with complex datasets. While there is still a long way to go in terms of developing quantum hardware with sufficient resources, quantum machine learning holds great potential in areas such as unsupervised learning and generative models. Moving forward, more efforts are needed to explore new quantum learning models that can leverage the power of quantum mechanics to overcome the limitations of classical machine learning.

TI Hierarchical controlled cyclic quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this paper, a new hierarchical controlled cyclic quantum teleportation scheme is proposed, which can be applied to hierarchical quantum information transmission in a variety of application scenarios. In this scheme, Charlie in the low-level position can only complete simple sending tasks under the control of Bob, while Alice in the middle-level position needs to complete ordinary sending tasks under the control of Charlie and Diana; Bob in the high-level position needs to complete important tasks sent to Charlie under the control of the controller Diana and the high-level controller Eve. Diana and Eve can be regarded as both internal middle and high-level managers as well as different external regulators. Finally, this paper also discusses the number of controllers and their control capabilities, and briefly proposes a simplified hierarchical cyclic quantum teleportation scheme, which provides more options for users with different needs.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms: Foundation, design and applications
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum computing, as an emerging computing paradigm, is expected to tackle problems such as quantum chemistry, optimization, quantum chemistry, information security, and artificial intelligence, which are intractable with using classical computing. Quantum computing hardware and software continue to develop rapidly, but they are not expected to realize universal quantum computation in the next few years. Therefore, the use of quantum hardware to solve practical problems in the near term has become a hot topic in the field of quantum computing. Exploration of the applications of near-term quantum hardware is of great significance in understanding the capability of quantum hardware and promoting the practical process of quantum computing. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm (also known as variational quantum algorithm) is an appropriate model for near-term quantum hardware. In the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, classical computers are used to maximize the power of quantum devices. By combining quantum computing with machine learning, the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is expected to achieve the first practical application of quantum computation and play an important role in the studying of quantum computing. In this review, we introduce the framework of hybrid quantum-classical algorithm and its applications in quantum chemistry, quantum information, combinatorial optimization, quantum machine learning, and other fields. We further discuss the challenges and future research directions of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm.

TI Demonstration of Measurement-Enhanced State Preparation and Erasure
   Conversion in a Molecular Tweezer Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Programmable optical tweezer arrays of molecules are an emerging platform for quantum simulation and quantum information science. For these applications, the reduction and mitigation of errors remain major challenges. In this work, we leverage the rich internal structure of molecules to mitigate two types of errors -internal state preparation and qubit leakage errors. First, we demonstrate robust measurement-enhanced tweezer preparation at a record fidelity using site-resolved error detection followed by tweezer movement. Second, using a new hyperfine qubit encoding well suited for use as a quantum memory, we demonstrate site-resolved detection of qubit leakage errors (erasures) induced by blackbody radiation. This approach constitutes the first demonstration of erasure conversion in molecules, a capability that has found recent interest in quantum error correction. Our work opens the door to new possibilities with molecular tweezer arrays: Measurement-enhanced preparation opens access to mesoscopic defect-free molecular arrays that are important for quantum simulation of interacting many-body systems; erasure conversion in molecular arrays lays the technical groundwork for midcircuit detection, an important capability for explorations in quantum information processing.

AB The recent decade has witnessed substantial advancements in silicon quantum computing. Important milestones include demonstrations of quantum gates exceeding the fault-tolerance threshold, high-fidelity single-shot spin readout, hot quantum bits (hot qubits), and compact scalable spin arrays. Silicon qubits hold promise to leverage semiconductor industry technologies into scalable qubit manufacturing. Both the academic and industry communities are striving to push this advantage into reality. However, formidable challenges persist in the quest to develop a fully operational universal quantum computer. This review focuses on single-spin qubits in silicon. First, we start with foundational spin qubit theory. Then, we discuss gate-defined quantum dots and donor dot systems, with a particular emphasis on two-qubit gate operations and the scalability of qubit arrays. Lastly, we address long-distance coupling, highlighting key areas for future research and potential scale-up strategies for this rapidly evolving field.

In particular, we study qudit CalderbankShor-Steane (CSS) codes as a special class of qudit stabilizer codes and the ensembles of the Narain code CFTs constructed from CSS codes. We obtain exact results for the averaged partition functions over the ensembles and discuss their implications for holographic duality.

TI Relaxation times do not capture logical qubit dynamics
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction procedures have the potential to enable faithful operation of large-scale quantum computers. They protect information from environmental decoherence by storing it in logical qubits, built from ensembles of entangled physical qubits according to suitably tailored quantum error correcting encodings. To date, no generally accepted framework to characterise the behaviour of logical qubits as quantum memories has been developed. In this work, we show that generalisations of well-established figures of merit of physical qubits, such as relaxation times, to logical qubits fail and do not capture dynamics of logical (plias. We experimentally illustrate that, in particular, spatial noise correlations can give rise to rich and counter-intuitive dynamical behavior of logical qubits. We show that a suitable set of observables, formed by code space population and logical operators within the code space, allows one to track and characterize the dynamical behaviour of logical qubits. Awareness of these effects and the efficient characterisation tools used in this work will help to guide and benchmark experimental implementations of logical qubits.

TI Optimizing Ancilla-Based Quantum Circuits with SPARE
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Many quantum algorithms instantiate and use ancillas, spare qubits that serve as temporary storage in a quantum circuit. In particular, many recently developed high-level and modular quantum programming languages (QPLs) use ancilla qubits to implement various programming constructs. These are lowered to circuits with nested/cascading compute-uncompute gate sequences that use ancilla qubits to track internal state. We present SPARE, a rewrite-based quantum circuit optimizer that restructures these compute-uncompute gate sequences, leveraging the ancilla qubit state information to optimize the circuit. In this work, we prove the correctness SPARE's rewrites and link SPARE's gate-level transforms to language-level program rewrites, which maybe performed on the input language. We evaluate SPARE on QPL-generated quantum circuits against Unqomp and Spire, two optimizing compilers for QPLs. SPARE achieves a reduction of up to 27.3% in qubit count, 56.7% in 2-qubit gates, 68.2% in 1-qubit gates and 73.9% in depth against Unqomp, and up to 17.8% in qubits, 67.3% in 2-qubit gates, 61.4% in 1-qubit gates and 59.9% in depth against Spire. We also evaluate SPARE against the Quartz, Feynman, and PyZX circuit optimizers: SPARE achieves up to a 70.0% reduction in two-qubit gates, up to a 53.6% reduction 1-qubit gates, and up to a 56.7% reduction in depth compared to the best result from all the gate-level optimizers.

TI Dynamic Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution for Securing a
   Future Global Quantum Network
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is a developing method to secure information exchange in future quantum networks. With the recent developments in quantum technology and greater access to space, a global quantum network secured by CVQKD can be within reach. In this work, the structures of existing QKD networks are analyzed, and how they can be fit into a general overarching three-layer QKD network architecture for the endeavor of a global QKD network. Such a network can comprise different links in fiber and free-space. The finite size limit secret key rates (SKRs) with multidimensional reconciliation are calculated for the different links for which CVQKD can be used in such a network. The results show that CVQKD generally achieves longer distances and larger SKRs in inter-satellite, satellite-to-ground, fiber, and underwater links in descending order. The different links and nodes are classified and secret key distribution is studied as a graph problem. The link capacity, a routing metric for secret key distribution, which considers a dynamic SKR based on dynamic links is presented. Its use in simulated CVQKD networks is presented for the aim of spatiotemporal secret key distribution through a dynamic CVQKD network.

TI Quantum machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection: A review
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB The advent of quantum computers has justified the development of quantum machine learning algorithms, based on the adaptation of the principles of machine learning to the formalism of qubits. Among such quantum algorithms, anomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines from cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the key concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of quantum speed up. The survey provides a structured map of anomaly detection based on quantum machine learning. We have grouped existing algorithms according to the different learning methods, namely quantum supervised, quantum unsupervised and quantum reinforcement learning, respectively. We provide an estimate of the hardware resources to provide sufficient computational power in the future. The survey provides a systematic and compact understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. We eventually provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the learning methods in real application domains.

TI Cost of emulating a small quantum annealing problem in the circuit model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Demonstrations of quantum advantage for certain sampling problems have generated considerable excitement for quantum computing and have further spurred the development of circuit-model quantum computers, which represent quantum programs as a sequence of quantum gates acting on a finite number of qubits. Amongst this excitement, analog quantum computation has become less prominent, with the expectation that circuit-model quantum computers will eventually be sufficient for emulating analog quantum computation and thus rendering analog quantum computation obsolete. In this work we explore the basic requirements for emulating a specific analog quantum computation in the circuit model: the preparation of a biased superposition of degenerate ground states of an Ising Hamiltonian using an adiabatic evolution. We show that the overhead of emulation is substantial even for this simple problem. This supports using analog quantum computation for solving time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics in the short term and midterm, assuming analog errors can be made low enough and coherence times long enough to solve problems of practical interest.

SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Quantum information (QI) experiments applying quantum optics in outer space with a very long baseline may have advantages over the current Earth-bound experiments or the Earth-to-satellite experiments, because they can minimize the loss in light transmission and maximize the gain in time resolution. This future class of experiments, among them quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping, can shed light on many fundamental theoretical issues in gravitational quantum physics and relativistic QI. Regarding relativity theory, these experiments in an outer-space setting can involve observations at spacelike and timelike separations and explicate intriguing phenomena from different choices of time-slicing. Regarding QI, they may be able to ensure the causal independence of the expectation values in the Bell test. These issues are addressed in this paper with analysis and explanations.

TI Scaling up to problem sizes: an environmental life cycle assessment of
   quantum computing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With the demonstrated ability to perform calculations in seconds that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years, quantum computers namely hold the promise of radically advancing sustainable IT. However, quantum computers face challenges due to the inherent noise in physical qubits, necessitating error correction for reliable operation in solving industrial-scale problems, which will require more computation time, energy, and electronic components than initial laboratory-scale experiments. Yet, while researchers have modeled and analyzed the environmental impacts of classical computers using Life cycle assessment the environmental performance of quantum computing remains unknown to date. This study contributes to filling this critical gap in two ways: (1) by establishing an environmental profile for quantum computers based on superconducting qubits; and (2) by comparing it to a functionally equivalent profile of a state-of-the-art supercomputer. With the comparison based on the problem size, the paper shows how the usage time can drive an environmental advantage for quantum computers under specific scaling conditions and quantum error correcting codes. The results emphasize that quantum error correction hardware has a substantial environmental impact due to the numerous electronic components needed to achieve 100 logical qubits. This paper can serve as a basis for designing more environmentally friendly quantum computers and for establishing their environmental profiles, as well as those of the human activities that will use them.

TI Learning Fourier series with parametrized quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) and their applications in the field of quantum machine learning through parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are thought to be one major way of leveraging noisy intermediatescale quantum computing devices. However, differences in the performance of certain VQA architectures are often unclear since established best practices, as well as detailed studies, are missing. In this paper, we build upon the work by Schuld et al. [Phys. Rev. A 103, 032430 (2021)] and Vidal et al. [Front. Phys. 8, 297 (2020)] by comparing how well popular ansatz for PQCs learn different one-dimensional truncated Fourier series. We also examine dissipative quantum neural networks (dQNN) as introduced by Beer et al. [Nat. Commun. 11, 808 (2020)] and propose a data reupload structure for dQNNs to increase their capability for this regression task. By comparing the results for different PQC architectures, we can provide guidelines for designing efficient PQCs.

TI Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers as Enabling Quantum Technology
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) represent the most fascinating achievement of quantum engineering, showing how artificial materials can be generated through quantum design, with tailor-made properties. Their inherent quantum nature deeply affects their core physical parameters. QCLs indeed display intrinsic linewidths approaching the quantum limit, and show spontaneous phase-locking of their emitted modes via intracavity four-wave-mixing, meaning that they can naturally operate as miniaturized metrological frequency rulers, also in frontier frequency domains, as the far-infrared, yet unexplored in quantum science. Here, the authors discuss the fundamental quantum properties of QCLs operating at terahertz frequencies and their key technological performances, highlighting future perspectives of this frontier research field in disruptive areas of quantum technologies such as quantum sensing, quantum metrology, quantum imaging, and photonic-based quantum computation.

TI Realization of a functioning dual-type trapped-ion quantum network node
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Trapped ions constitute a promising platform for implementation of a quantum network. Recently, a dual-type qubit scheme has been realized in a quantum network node where communication qubits and memory qubits are encoded in different energy levels of the same ion species, such that the generation of ion-photon entanglement on the communication qubits has negligible cross-talk error on the preloaded quantum information in the memory qubits. However, to achieve versatile applications of a quantum network, a crucial component of the dual-type node, namely, the entangling gate between the communication and the memory qubits, is still missing. Here, we report a dual-type quantum network node equipped with ion-photon entanglement generation, cross-talk-free quantum memory, and entangling gates between dual-type qubits simultaneously. We demonstrate its practical applications including the passive quantum-state teleportation and the preparation of multipartite entangled state. Our work achieves the necessary components of a dual-type quantum network node.

TI Measuring quantum discord at the LHC
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB There has been an increasing interest in exploring quantities associated with quantum information at colliders. We perform a detailed analysis describing how to measure the quantum discord in the top anti-top quantum state at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). While for pure states, quantum discord, entanglement, and Bell nonlocality all probe the same correlations, for mixed states they probe different aspects of quantum correlations. The quantum discord, in particular, is interesting because it aims to encapsulate all correlations between systems that cannot have a classical origin. We employ two complementary approaches for the study of the top anti-top system, namely the decay method and the kinematic method. We highlight subtleties associated with measuring discord for reconstructed quantum states at colliders. Usually quantum discord is difficult to compute due to an extremization that must be performed. We show, however, that for the tt<overline> system this extremization can be performed analytically and we provide closed-form formulas for the quantum discord. We demonstrate that with current LHC datasets, quantum discord can be observed at 3.6 - 5.7 sigma, depending on the signal region, with the decay method and can be measured at a precision of 0.1 - 0.2% with the kinematic method. At the high luminosity LHC, the observation of quantum discord is expected to be > 5 sigma using both the decay and kinematic methods and can be measured with a precision of 5% with the decay method and 0.05% with the kinematic method. Additionally, we identify the kinematic cuts at the LHC to isolate the tt<overline> state that is separable but has non-zero discord. By systematically investigating quantum discord for the first time through a detailed collider analysis, this work expands the toolkit for quantum information studies in particle physics and lays the groundwork for deeper insights into the quantum properties in high-energy collisions.

A full characterization is established for the entanglement-assisted masking equivocation region with a maximally correlated channel state, and a regularized formula is given for the quantum capacity-leakage function without assistance. For Hadamard channels without assistance, we derive single-letter inner and outer bounds, which coincide in the standard case of a channel that does not depend on a state.

TI Effect of Classical and Quantum Superposition of Atomic States on
   Quantum Correlations
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we report the effect of classical and quantum superposition of atomic states on quantum correlations. Coupled photon pairs generated in a ladder quantum beat laser using coherent-induced classical field and atomic state coherent superposition are considered. Once the quantum coherence get sufficient time, it can generate quantum correlations that include quantum discord, quantum entanglement, and quantum steering, which quickly increase with time until they get their maximum strength. Their strength can be improved further by increasing the number of superposed atoms per unit time, selecting an appropriate amplitude of the classical fields, and managing the amount of temperatures and phase fluctuations. In particular, two-way quantum steering, which is a guarantee for the existence of quantum discord and quantum entanglement, can be achieved by increasing the rate of atomic injection from 2 kHz to 25 kHz even if the mean temperature of the heat bath is considered. The maximum achievable strength of quantum correlations is enhanced by increasing the rate of atomic injection and choosing an appropriate parameters of the coherent-induced classical field in the open quantum system which is treated by using the density operator approach.

TI Shortest Path Finding in Quantum Networks With Quasi-Linear Complexity
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A fully-quantum network implies the creation of quantum entanglement between a given source node and some other destination node, with a number of quantum repeaters in between. This paper tackles the problem of quantum entanglement distribution by solving the routing problem over an infrastructure based on quantum repeaters and with a finite number of pairs of entangled qubits available in each link. The network model considers that link purification is available such that a nested purification protocol can be applied at each link to generate entangled qubits with higher fidelity than the original ones. A low-complexity multi-objective routing algorithm to find the shortest path between any two given nodes is proposed and assessed for random networks, using a fairly general path extension mechanism that can fit a large family of particular technological requirements. Different types of quantum protocols require different levels of fidelity for the entangled qubit pairs. For that reason, the proposed algorithm identifies the shortest path between two nodes that assures an end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold. The minimum requirements for the end-to-end entanglement fidelity depend on the whole extension of the paths, and cannot be looked at as a local property of each link. Moreover, one needs to keep track not only of the shortest path, but also of longer paths holding more entangled qubits than the shorter paths in order to satisfy the fidelity criterion. Thus, standard single parameter shortest-path algorithms do not necessarily converge to the optimal solution. The problem of finding the best path in a network subject to multiple criteria (known as multi-objective routing) is, in general, an NP-hard problem due to the rapid growth of the number of stored paths. This work proposes a metric that identifies and discards paths that are objectively worse than others. By doing so, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm scales near-to-linearly with respect to the number of nodes in the network, showing that the shortest-path problem in quantum networks can be solved with a complexity very close to the one of the classical counterparts. That is analytically proved for the case where all the links of a path have the same fidelity (homogeneous model). The algorithm is also adapted to a particular type of path extension, where different links along a path can be purified to different degrees, asserting its flexibility and near-to-linearity even when heterogeneous fidelities along the sections of a path are considered.

TI Measurement-free fault-tolerant logical-zero-state encoding of the
   distance-three nine-qubit surface code in a one-dimensional qubit array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Generation of logical zero states encoded with a quantum error-correcting code is the first step for fault-tolerant quantum computation but requires considerably large resource overheads in general. To reduce such overheads, we propose an efficient encoding method for the distance-three, nine-qubit surface code and show its fault tolerance. This method needs no measurement, unlike other fault-tolerant encoding methods. Moreover, this is applicable to a one-dimensional qubit array. Observing these facts, we experimentally demonstrate the logical-zero-state encoding of the surface code using a superconducting quantum computer on the cloud. We also experimentally demonstrate the suppression of fast dephasing due to intrinsic residual interactions in this machine by a dynamical decoupling technique dedicated to the qubit array. To extend this method to larger codes, we also investigate the concatenation of the surface code with itself, resulting in a distance-nine, 81-qubit code. We numerically show that fault-tolerant encoding of this large code can be achieved by appropriate error detection.

TI Natural Embedding of the Stokes Parameters of Polarimetric Synthetic
   Aperture Radar Images in a Gate-Based Quantum Computer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB Quantum algorithms are designed to process quantum data (quantum bits) in a gate-based quantum computer. They are proven rigorously that they reveal quantum advantages over conventional algorithms when their inputs are certain quantum data or some classical data mapped to quantum data. However, in a practical domain, data are classical in nature, and they are very big in dimension, size, and so on. Hence, there is a challenge to map (embed) classical data to quantum data, and even no quantum advantages of quantum algorithms are demonstrated over conventional ones when one processes the mapped classical data in a gate-based quantum computer. For the practical domain of earth observation (EO), due to the different sensors on remote-sensing platforms, we can map directly some types of EO data to quantum data. In particular, we have polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images characterized by polarized beams. A polarized state of the polarized beam and a quantum bit are the Doppelganger of a physical state. We map them to each other, and we name this direct mapping a natural embedding, otherwise an artificial embedding. Furthermore, we process our naturally embedded data in a gate-based quantum computer by using a quantum algorithm regardless of its quantum advantages over conventional techniques; namely, we use the QML network as a quantum algorithm to prove that we naturally embedded our data in input qubits of a gate-based quantum computer. Therefore, we employed and directly processed PolSAR images in a QML network. Furthermore, we designed and provided a QML network with an additional layer of a neural network, namely, a hybrid quantum-classical network, and demonstrate how to program (via optimization and backpropagation) this hybrid quantum-classical network when employing and processing PolSAR images. In this work, we used a gate-based quantum computer offered by an IBM Quantum and a classical simulator for a gate-based quantum computer. Our contribution is that we provided very specific EO data with a natural embedding feature, the Doppelganger of quantum bits, and processed them in a hybrid quantum-classical network. More importantly, in the future, these PolSAR data can be processed by future quantum algorithms and future quantum computing platforms to obtain (or demonstrate) some quantum advantages over conventional techniques for EO problems.

AB Obtaining high-fidelity and robust quantum gates is the key for scalable quantum computation, and one of the promising ways is to implement quantum gates using geometric phases, where the influence of local noises can be greatly reduced. To obtain robust quantum gates, we here propose a scheme for quantum manipulation by combining the geometric phase approach with the dynamical correction technique, where the imperfection control induced X-error can be greatly suppressed. Moreover, to be robust against the decoherence effect and the randomized qubit-frequency shift Z-error, our scheme is also proposed based on the polariton qubit, the eigenstates of the light-matter interaction, which is immune to both errors up to the second order, due to its near symmetric energy spectrum. Finally, our scheme is implemented on the superconducting circuits, which also simplifies previous implementations. Since the main errors can be greatly reduced in our proposal, it provides a promising strategy for scalable solid-state fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Variational quantum simulation of U(1) lattice gauge theories with qudit
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Lattice gauge theories are fundamental to various fields, including particle physics, condensed matter, and quantum information theory. Recent progress in the control of quantum systems allows for studying Abelian lattice gauge theories in table-top experiments. However, several challenges remain, such as implementing dynamical fermions in higher spatial dimensions and magnetic field terms. Here, we map U(1) Abelian lattice gauge theories in arbitrary spatial dimensions onto qudit systems with local interactions. We propose a variational quantum simulation scheme for the qudit system with a local Hamiltonian, that can be implemented on a universal qudit quantum device as the one developed in [Nat. Phys. 18, 1053 (2022)]. We describe how to implement the variational imaginary-time evolution protocol for ground-state preparation as well as the variational real-time evolution protocol to simulate nonequilibrium physics on universal qudit quantum computers, supplemented with numerical simulations. Our proposal can serve as a way of simulating lattice gauge theories, particularly in higher spatial dimensions, with minimal resources, regarding both system sizes and gate count.

TI Error-mitigated deep-circuit quantum simulation of open systems: Steady
   state and relaxation rate problems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Deep-circuit quantum computation, like Shor's algorithm, is undermined by error accumulation, and nearfuture quantum techniques are far from adequate for full-fledged quantum error correction. Instead of resorting to shallow-circuit quantum algorithms, recent theoretical research suggests that digital quantum simulation (DQS) of closed quantum systems are robust against the accumulation of Trotter errors, as long as local observables are concerned. In this paper, we investigate the error-mitigation problem of open systems via DQS. First, we prove that the deviation in the steady state obtained from digital quantum simulation depends only on the error in a single Trotter step, which indicates that error accumulation may not be disastrous. By numerical simulation of the quantum circuits for the DQS of the dissipative XYZ model, we then show that the correct results can be recovered by quantum error mitigation as long as the error rate in the DQS is below a sharp threshold. We explain this threshold behavior by the existence of a dissipation-driven quantum phase transition. Finally, we propose a error-mitigation technique based on the scaling behavior in the vicinity of the critical point of a quantum phase transition. Our results expand the territory of near-future available quantum algorithms and stimulate further theoretical and experimental efforts in practical quantum applications.

TI Towards Adiabatic Quantum Computing Using Compressed Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We describe tensor network algorithms to optimize quantum circuits for adiabatic quantum computing. To suppress diabatic transitions, we include counterdiabatic driving in the optimization and utilize variational matrix product operators to represent adiabatic gauge potentials. Traditionally, Trotter product formulas are used to turn adiabatic time evolution into quantum circuits and the addition of counterdiabatic driving increases the circuit depth per time step. Instead, we classically optimize a parameterized quantum circuit of fixed depth to simultaneously capture adiabatic evolution together with counterdiabatic driving over many time steps. The methods are applied to the ground-state preparation of quantum Ising chains with transverse and longitudinal fields. We show that the classically optimized circuits can significantly outperform Trotter product formulas. Additionally, we discuss how the approach can be used for combinatorial optimization.

TI Multi-hop entanglement swapping in quantum networks based on
   polization-space hyperentanglement
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Entanglement swapping (ES) based multi-hop quantum information transmission is a fundamental way torealize long-distance quantum communication. However, in the conventional quantum networks, theentanglement in one degree of freedom (DOF) of photon system is usually used as a quantum channel, showingdisadvantages of low capacity and susceptibility to noise. In this paper, we present an efficient multi-hopquantum hyperentanglement swapping (HES) method based on hyperentanglement, which utilizes the entangledphotos in polarization and spatial-mode DOFs to establish the hyperentangled multi-hop quantum channel.Taking long-distance hyperentanglement based quantum teleportation for example, we first describe a basic hopby hop HES scheme. Then, in order to reduce the end-to-end delay of this scheme, we propose a simultaneousHES (SHES) scheme, in which the intermediate quantum nodes perform hyperentangled Bell statemeasurements concurrently. On the basis of this scheme, we further put forward a hierarchical SHES (HSHES)scheme that can reduce the classical information cost. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that theend-to-end delay of HSHES is similar to that of SHES, meanwhile, the classical information cost of HSHES ismuch lower than that of SHES, showing a better tradeoff between the two performance metrics. Compared withthe traditional ES methods, the scheme proposed in this paper is conductive to meeting the requirements forlong-distance hyperentanglement based quantum communication, which has positive significance for buildingmore efficient quantum networks in the future

Behavior of quantum devices in small quantum networks has been the focus of recent studies, it is still an open question how they will work in networks of practical size. QuISP is designed to simulate large-scale quantum networks to investigate their behavior under realistic, noisy and heterogeneous configurations. Our confidence in the simulator is supported by comparing its output to analytic results for a small network. QuISP can handle thousands of qubits in hundreds of nodes on a laptop computer, preparing for full Quantum Internet simulation. This simulator promotes the development of protocols for larger and complex quantum networks.

TI The Communication Value of a Quantum Channel
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB There are various ways to quantify the communication capabilities of a quantum channel. In this work we introduce the communication value (cv) of quantum channel, which describes the optimal probability of guessing the channel input from its output. By connecting to prior work on zero-error channel simulation, we show that the cv and its entanglement-assisted variant also offer dual interpretations as the classical communication cost for perfectly simulating different aspects of a channel using non-signaling resources. Our study involves characterizing the communication value as a generalized conditional min-entropy over the cone of separable operators. Using this characterization, we evaluate the cv for all qubit channels and higher-dimensional channels with certain symmetries. We find that the any entanglement-breaking channel has multiplicative cv when used in parallel with any other channel; the same is shown to hold for Pauli channels and partially depolarizing channels. In contrast, the cv is found to be non-multiplicative for a subset of the well-known Werner-Holevo channels. A final component of this work investigates relaxations of the channel cv to other cones such as the set of operators having a positive partial transpose (PPT).

TI Quantum circuit simulation of superchannels
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum simulation is one of the central discipline to demonstrate the power of quantum computing. In recent years, the theoretical framework of quantum superchannels has been developed and applied widely as the extension of quantum channels. In this work, we study the quantum circuit simulation task of superchannels. We develop a quantum superchannel simulation algorithm based on the convex decomposition into sum of extreme superchannels. We demonstrate the algorithm by numerical simulation of qubit superchannels with high accuracy, making it applicable to current experimental platforms. Our study stands as an expansion of the superchannel theory to the field of quantum simulation and algorithm, as well as an extension of quantum simulation from channels and open-system dynamics to superchannels and processes with manifest quantum memory effects.

TI Essay: Quantum Sensing with Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Platforms for
   Fundamental Physics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics has been at the forefront of the development of quantum science while laying the foundation for modern technology. With the growing capabilities of quantum control of many atoms for engineered many-body states and quantum entanglement, a key question emerges: what critical impact will the second quantum revolution with ubiquitous applications of entanglement bring to bear on fundamental physics? In this Essay, we argue that a compelling long-term vision for fundamental physics and novel applications is to harness the rapid development of quantum information science to define and advance the frontiers of measurement physics, with strong potential for fundamental discoveries. As quantum technologies, such as fault-tolerant quantum computing and entangled quantum sensor networks, become much more advanced than today's realization, we wonder what doors of basic science can these tools unlock. We anticipate that some of the most intriguing and challenging problems, such as quantum aspects of gravity, fundamental symmetries, or new physics beyond the minimal standard model, will be tackled at the emerging quantum measurement frontier.

TI Comparison of encoding schemes for quantum computing of S> 1/2 spin
   chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We compare four different encoding schemes for the quantum computing of spin chains with a spin quantum number S>1/2: a compact mapping, a direct (or one-hot) mapping, a Dicke mapping, and a qudit mapping. The three different qubit encoding schemes are assessed by conducting a Hamiltonian simulation for 1/2 <= S <= 5/2 using a trapped-ion quantum computer. The qudit mapping is tested by running simulations with a simple noise model. The Dicke mapping, in which the spin states are encoded as superpositions of multiqubit states, is found to be the most efficient because of the small number of terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. We also investigate the S dependence of the time step length Delta tau in the Suzuki-Trotter approximation and find that Delta tau should be inversely proportional to S in order to obtain the same accuracy for all S.

TI Characterizing qubit channels in the context of quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a scenario where a party, say, Alice prepares a pure two-qubit (either maximally entangled or nonmaximally entangled) state and sends one half of this state to another distant party, say, Bob through a qubit (either unital or nonunital) channel. Finally, the shared state is used as a teleportation channel. In this scenario, we focus on characterizing the set of qubit channels with respect to the final state's efficacy as a resource of quantum teleportation (QT) in terms of maximal average fidelity and fidelity deviation (fluctuation in fidelity values over the input states). Importantly, we point out the existence of a subset of qubit channels for which the final state becomes useful for universal QT (having maximal average fidelity strictly greater than the classical bound and having zero fidelity deviation) when the initially prepared state is either useful for universal QT (i.e., for a maximally entangled state) or not useful for universal QT (i.e., for a subset of nonmaximally entangled pure states). Interestingly, in the latter case, we show that nonunital channels (dissipative interactions) are more effective than unital channels (nondissipative interactions) in producing useful states for universal QT from nonmaximally entangled pure states.

TI Ancilla-free implementation of generalized measurements for qubits
   embedded in a qudit space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Informationally complete (IC) positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) are generalized quantum measurements that offer advantages over the standard computational basis readout of qubits. For instance, IC-POVMs enable efficient extraction of operator expectation values, a crucial step in many quantum algorithms. POVM measurements are typically implemented by coupling one additional ancilla qubit to each logical qubit, thus imposing high demands on the device size and connectivity. Here, we show how to implement a general class of IC-POVMs without ancilla qubits. We exploit the higher-dimensional Hilbert space of a qudit in which qubits are often encoded. POVMs can then be realized by coupling each qubit to two of the available qudit states, followed by a projective measurement. We develop the required control pulse sequences and numerically establish their feasibility for superconducting transmon qubits through pulse-level simulations. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of a qudit-space POVM measurement on IBM Quantum hardware. This paves the way to making POVM measurements broadly available to quantum computing applications.

TI QM-DLA: an efficient qubit mapping method based on dynamic look-ahead
   strategy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing has already demonstrated great computational potential across multiple domains and has received more and more attention. However, due to the connectivity limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, most of the quantum algorithms cannot be directly executed without the help of inserting SWAP gates. Nevertheless, more SWAP gates lead to a longer execution time and, inevitably, lower fidelity of the algorithm. To this end, this paper proposes an optimized qubit mapping algorithm based on a dynamic look-ahead strategy to minimize the number of SWAP gates inserted. Firstly, a heuristic algorithm is proposed based on maximizing physical qubit connectivity to generate the optimal initial qubit mapping, which reduces the need for logical qubit shifts during subsequent SWAP gate insertion. Secondly, in the form of directed acyclic graphs, we identify quantum gates that violate the constraints of physical coupling and insert SWAP gates to remap qubits, thereby overcoming the limitations of qubit interactions. Finally, the optimal SWAP gate insertion strategy is built by comparing the cost of different SWAP gate insertion strategies through a multi-window look-ahead strategy to reduce the number of SWAP gates inserted. The experimental results show that the strategy in this paper decreases the number of SWAP gate insertions and significantly reduces the depth of quantum circuits when performing qubit mapping compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB We propose and analyze deterministic protocols to generate qudit photonic graph states from quantum emitters. We show that our approach can be applied to generate any qudit graph state and we exemplify it by constructing protocols to generate one- and two-dimensional qudit cluster states, absolutely maximally entangled states, and logical states of quantum error-correcting codes. Some of these protocols make use of time-delayed feedback, while others do not. The only additional resource requirement compared to the qubit case is the ability to control multilevel emitters. These results significantly broaden the range of multiphoton entangled states that can be produced deterministically from quantum emitters.

TI Cyclic assisted cloning of arbitrary unknown single-particle states in
   amplitude damping channel
SO PLOS ONE
AB In this paper, two conclusive three-party cyclic assisted cloning protocols in amplitude damping (AD) channel are put forward that, respectively clone three arbitrary unknown single-qubit states and single-qutrit states with the help of a state preparer. Each of our protocols includes three consecutive stages: quantum channel preparation, cyclic quantum teleportation (CQT), and multi-party assisted cloning. The first stage of each protocol proposes the detailed processes of sharing a pure entangled quantum state as a component of a quantum channel in AD channel via entanglement compensation. In second stage, a three-party CQT is presented where three unknown single-qubit states (or single-qutrit states) are reconstructed simultaneously in three different places, respectively, by introducing auxiliary qubits and performing appropriate operations. In the third stage, the state preparer Victor performs one multi-qubit measurement (or one unitary transformation and one multi-qutrit measurement) and informs the three communicators of his outcome, three distinct unknown single-qubit states or their orthogonal complement states (or single-qutrit states) are cloned simultaneously and with probability at three separate locations,respectively. Furthermore, we extend the above protocols from two aspects: (i) the extension to the case of (N+1) participants; (ii) extension to the case of d-dimensional unknown single-qudit state cycle-assisted cloning.

TI Optimizing quantum machine learning for proactive cybersecurity
SO OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING
AB The evolution of cyberattacks requires a continuous race to implement increasingly sophisticated techniques that allow us to stay ahead of cybercriminals. Thus, a relevant inverse problem in cybersecurity involves determining underlying patterns or models of possible cyber threats based on observed data. In particular, the processing of massive data combined with the application of Machine Learning methods and other techniques derived from Artificial Intelligence have so far achieved very significant advances in preventing and mitigating the impact of many cyberattacks. Given that the keyword in cybersecurity is anticipation, this work explores the possibilities of quantum computing and, in particular, of Quantum Machine Learning to have, when the quantum computing era arrives, the most optimal parameterisations to put these models into practice. Although the application of quantum technologies in a real context may still seem distant, having studies to assess the future viability of Quantum Machine Learning to identify different types of cyberattacks may be a differential element when it comes to ensuring the cybersecurity of essential services. For this reason, this work aims to use several datasets of known problems in the field of cybersecurity to evaluate the most optimal parameterisations in some known Quantum Machine Learning models, comparing the results with those obtained using classical models. After analysing the results of this study, it can be concluded that Quantum Machine Learning techniques are promising in the context of cybersecurity, giving rise to future work on a wider range of cybersecurity datasets and Quantum Machine Learning algorithms.

Because of the challenge of merely preparing the codewords, the GKP code was for a long time considered to be impractical. However, the remarkable developments in quantum hardware and control technology in the last two decades has made the GKP code a frontrunner in the race to build practical, fault-tolerant bosonic quantum technology. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the GKP code with emphasis on its implementation in the circuit-QED architecture and present our outlook on the challenges and opportunities for scaling it up for hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant quantum error correction.

TI Doubly ionized lanthanum as a qubit candidate for quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose doubly ionized lanthanum (La2+) as a possible qubit candidate for quantum networks. Transitions between the lowest levels in the atom are in the infrared, enabling a direct matter-light interface amenable to long-distance quantum communication. These transitions could also be used to directly laser-cool trapped La2+ ions. The rich hyperfine structure of the ion may allow for a qubit stored in magnetic-field insensitive states as well as protocols for atom-photon entanglement.

TI Integrated high-fidelity preparation and analysis of photonic two-qubit
   states for quantum network nodes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The realisation of quantum networks requires local quantum information processing at the network nodes and highly efficient transmission of quantum information across the network. Integrated photonics, based on silicon-on-insulator, is a promising platform for quantum network nodes, as it supports low-loss propagation of telecom wavelength photons, making it compatible with existing optical fibre networks. Here, we present a silicon-on-insulator integrated photonic chip, capable of bidirectional operation, enabling the preparation of arbitrary single- and two-qubit states, and performing full quantum state tomography on up to two qubits. Using our chip, we obtain preparation fidelities above \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${97}{\%}$$\end{document} for on-chip prepared Bell states coupled into optical fibres. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can distribute entanglement between network nodes by preparing a two-qubit cluster state on the first node and performing full quantum state tomography on the second node, achieving a fidelity of 90.0(16)%. This result proves that our approach allows the distribution of entanglement from one chip to another. The potential of bidirectional operation makes our circuit a versatile node in telecom quantum networks, both functioning as a sender and receiver unit, a key element for the deployment of fully photonic multi-purpose quantum networks.

TI Advantages of two quantum programming platforms in quantum computing and
   quantum chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS
AB Quantum computing is at the forefront of technological advancement and has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including quantum chemistry. Choosing an appropriate quantum programming language becomes critical as quantum education and research increase. In this paper, we comprehensively compare two leading quantum programming languages, Qiskit and PennyLane, focusing on their suitability for teaching and research. We delve into their basic and advanced usage, examine their learning curves, and evaluate their capabilities in quantum computing experiments. We also demonstrate using a quantum programming language to build a half adder and a machine learning model. Our study reveals that each language has distinct advantages. While PennyLane excels in research applications due to its flexibility to adjust parameters in detail and access multiple sources of real quantum devices, Qiskit stands out in education because of its web-based graphical user interface and smaller code size. The codes and the dataset used in the studies are available at https://github.com/wangpeihua1231/quantum-programming-platform.

TI Quantum Computation of the Cobb-Douglas Utility Function via the 2D
   Clairaut Differential Equation
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB This paper introduces the integration of the Cobb-Douglas (CD) utility model with quantum computation using the Clairaut-type differential formula. We propose a novel economic-physical model employing envelope theory to establish a link with quantum entanglement, defining emergent probabilities in the optimal utility function for two goods within a given expenditure limit. The study explores the interaction between the CD model and quantum computation, emphasizing system entropy and Clairaut differential equations in understanding utility's optimal envelopes. Algorithms using the 2D Clairaut equation are introduced for the quantum formulation of the CD function, showcasing representation in quantum circuits for one and two qubits. Our findings, validated through IBM-Q simulations, align with the predictions, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. This methodology articulates the utility-budget relationship through envelope representation, where normalized intercepts signify probabilities. The precision of our results, especially in modeling quantum entanglement, surpasses that of IBM-Q simulations, which require extensive iterations for similar accuracy.

TI Atomic-precision advanced manufacturing for Si quantum computing
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB A materials synthesis method that we call atomic-precision advanced manufacturing (APAM), which is the only known route to tailor silicon nanoelectronics with full 3D atomic precision, is making an impact as a powerful prototyping tool for quantum computing. Quantum computing schemes using atomic (P-31) spin qubits are compelling for future scale-up owing to long dephasing times, one- and two-qubit gates nearing high-fidelity thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, and emerging routes to manufacturing via proven Si foundry techniques. Multiqubit devices are challenging to fabricate by conventional means owing to tight interqubit pitches forced by short-range spin interactions, and APAM offers the required (angstrom-scale) precision to systematically investigate solutions. However, applying APAM to fabricate circuitry with increasing numbers of qubits will require significant technique development. Here, we provide a tutorial on APAM techniques and materials and highlight its impacts in quantum computing research. Finally, we describe challenges on the path to multiqubit architectures and opportunities for APAM technique development.

TI Multiplexed quantum state transfer in waveguides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this article, we consider a realistic waveguide implementation of a quantum network that serves as a testbed to show how to maximize the storage and manipulation of quantum information in QED setups. We analyze two approaches using wavepacket engineering and quantum state transfer protocols. First, we propose and design a family of orthogonal photons in the time domain. These photons allow for a selective interaction with distinct targeted qubits. Yet, mode multiplexing employing resonant nodes is largely spoiled by cross-talk effects. This motivates the second approach, namely, frequency multiplexing. Here we explore the limits of frequency multiplexing through the waveguide, analyzing its capabilities to host and faithfully transmit photons of different frequencies within a given bandwidth. We perform detailed one- and two-photon simulations and provide theoretical bounds for the fidelity of coherent quantum state transfer protocols under realistic conditions. Our results show that state-of-the-art experiments can employ dozens of multiplexed photons with global fidelities fulfilling the requirements imposed by fault-tolerant quantum computing. This is with the caveat that the conditions for single-photon fidelity are met.

TI A Novel Approach for Asymmetric Quantum Error Correction With Syndrome
   Measurement
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Most of the quantum error correction methods are symmetric. Symmetric methods are implemented by considering the amplitude of bit flip(X) and phase flip(Z) errors as same. With the quantum experiments, it is observed that the amplitude of Z errors are more compared to X errors. Due to which the need of asymmetric error correction has increased. This paved a path for the development of asymmetric error correction methods. In this paper, we discussed the concept of asymmetric quantum error correction (AQEC) and proposed an efficient approach for AQEC with encoding, syndrome measurement and decoding operations with increased fidelity to 85.89% and reduced circuit depth to 48%.

TI Spatial-temporal quantum optical pulses in stimulated raman quantum
   memory with laser-controlled dynamical stark and generalized quantum
   noise operators
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is highly relevant to quantum memories involving Raman system. Using quantum Langevin equations with complete noise operators coupled to the quantum field propagation equation, we present a general theory of SRS for moving quantum particles where quantum Stokes pulse couples to both transitions (m1 and m3) while an arbitrary laser pulses couple to only one (m1) transition. Our coupled equations contain dynamical ac Stark shift due to laser pulses and Doppler shift, complete quantum noise operators and atomic coherences corresponding to all possible three transitions (not only the ground state coherence), quantum mechanical microscopic expressions for linear and nonlinear interactions with nonlocal (memory) or temporal dispersion effects. We obtain an analytical solution of the quantum Stokes field in laboratory spacetime with generalized quantum noise operators that include all initial atomic coherences and arbitrary initial and boundary quantum fields, valid for arbitrary laser pulses. The general solution provides a complete physical picture, composed of basically two parts: above and below the light line, t = z/c. This robust framework offers a powerful tool for optimizing Raman-based quantum information processes, particularly for modeling the spatial-temporal dynamics of quantum Stokes pulses in storage and retrieval stages of quantum memory.

TI Fidelity-based distance bounds for N-qubit approximate quantum error
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Eastin-Knill theorem is a central result of quantum error correction theory and states that a quantum code cannot correct errors exactly, possess continuous symmetries, and implement a universal set of gates transversely. As a way to circumvent this result, there are several approaches in which one gives up on either exact error correction or continuous symmetries. In this context, it is common to employ a complementary measure of fidelity as a way to quantify quantum state distinguishability and benchmark approximations in error correction. Despite having useful properties, evaluating fidelity measures stands as a challenging task for quantum states with a large number of entangled qubits. With that in mind, we address two distance measures based on the suband superfidelities as a way to bound error approximations, which in turn require a lower computational cost. We model the lack of exact error correction to be equivalent to the action of a single dephasing channel, evaluate the proposed fidelity-based distances both analytically and numerically, and obtain a closed-form expression for a general N-qubit quantum state. We illustrate our bounds with two paradigmatic examples, an N-qubit mixed GHZ state and an N-qubit mixed W state.

TI State Transfer in Noisy Modular Quantum Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum state transfer is the act of transferring quantum information from one system in a quantum network to another without physically transporting carriers of quantum information, but instead engineering a Hamiltonian such that the state of the sender is transferred to the receiver through the dynamics of the whole network. A generalization of quantum state transfer called quantum routing concerns simultaneous transfers between multiple pairs in a quantum network, imposing limitations on its structure. This study considers transfer of Gaussian states over noisy quantum networks with modular structure, which have been identified as a suitable platform for quantum routing. Two noise models are compared, affecting either the network topology or the network constituents, studying their effects on both the transfer fidelities and the network properties. The two models are found to affect different features of the network allowing for the identification and quantification of the noise. These features are then used as a guide toward different strategies for the compensation of the noise, and to examine how the compensation strategies perform. The results show that in general, modular networks are more robust to noise than monolithic ones.
   This work explores noise in modular networks of harmonic oscillators, focusing on its effects on quantum state transfer. Noise in the network topology and in the oscillator frequencies is considered, and different modes are found to be robust toward either type of noise. Methods for probing and compensation of the noise are also presented. image

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum-computation architecture based on d-level systems, or qudits, has attracted considerable attention recently due to their enlarged Hilbert space. Extensive theoretical and experimental studies have addressed aspects of algorithms and benchmarking techniques for qudit-based quantum computation and quantum-information processing. Here, we report a physical realization of a qudit with up to four embedded levels in a superconducting transmon demonstrating high-fidelity initialization, manipulation, and simultaneous multilevel readout. In addition to constructing SU(d) operations and benchmarking protocols for quantum-state tomography, quantum-process tomography, randomized benchmarking, etc., we experimentally carry out these operations for d = 3 and d = 4. Moreover, we perform prototypical quantum algorithms and observe outcomes consistent with expectations. Our work will hopefully stimulate further research interest in developing manipulation protocols and efficient applications for quantum processors with qudits.

By combining complementary magnetic resonant techniques, such as pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and broadband nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we extensively characterize its Spin Hamiltonian parameters and its electronic and nuclear spin dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the qubit-qudit multilevel structure by resonant microwave and radiofrequency pulses, driving coherent Rabi oscillations between targeted electronuclear states. The obtained results demonstrate that this simple complex is a promising candidate for quantum computing applications.

This is achieved by making use of a boson-qubit mapping protocol and a digital gate decomposition that allow us to run the simulations in the quantum computers available in the IBM Quantum platform. We present the obtained results for the fidelity of the experiment in two different quantum computers, after applying error mitigation and post-selection techniques. The achieved results correspond to fidelities over 90%, which indicates that we were able to perform a faithful digital quantum simulation of the interaction and therefore of the generation of quantum entanglement by gravitational means in optomechanical systems.

TI LarQu cut: A New Cutting and Mapping Approach for Large-sized Quantum
   Circuits in Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) Environments
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a promising way to achieve large-scale quantum computing. However, mapping large-sized quantum circuits in DQC is a challenging job; for example, it is difficult to find an ideal cutting and mapping solution when many qubits, complicated qubit operations, and diverse QPUs are involved. In this study, we propose LarQucut, a new quantum circuit cutting and mapping approach for large-sized circuits in DQC. LarQucut has several new designs. (1) LarQucut can have cutting solutions that use fewer cuts, and it does not cut a circuit into independent sub-circuits, therefore reducing the overall cutting and computing overheads. (2) LarQucut finds isomorphic sub-circuits and reuses their execution results. So, LarQucut can reduce the number of sub-circuits that need to be executed to reconstruct the large circuit's output, reducing the time spent on sampling the sub-circuits. (3) We design an adaptive quantum circuit mapping approach, which identifies qubit interaction patterns and accordingly enables the best-fit mapping policy in DQC. The experimental results show that, for large circuits with hundreds to thousands of qubits in DQC, LarQucut can provide a better cutting and mapping solution with lower overall overheads and achieves results closer to the ground truth.

TI Quantum Teleportation between Remote Qubit Memories with Only a Single
   Photon as a Resource
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum teleportation enables the deterministic exchange of qubits via lossy channels. While it is commonly believed that unconditional teleportation requires a preshared entangled qubit pair, here we demonstrate a protocol that is in principle unconditional and requires only a single photon as an ex-ante prepared resource. The photon successively interacts, first, with the receiver and then with the sender qubit memory. Its detection, followed by classical communication, heralds a successful teleportation. We teleport six mutually unbiased qubit states with average fidelity (F) over bar= (88.3 +/- 1.3)% at a rate of 6 Hz over 60 m.

TI Proposal for a long-lived quantum memory using matter-wave optics with
   Bose-Einstein condensates in microgravity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Bose-Einstein condensates are a promising platform for optical quantum memories but suffer from several decoherence mechanisms, leading to short memory lifetimes. While some of these decoherence effects can be mitigated by conventional methods, density-dependent atom-atom collisions ultimately set the upper limit of the quantum memory lifetime to timescales of seconds in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. We propose a quantum memory technique that utilizes microgravity as a resource to minimize such density-dependent effects. We show that by using optical atom lenses to collimate and refocus the freely expanding atomic ensembles, in a semi-ideal environment, the expected memory lifetime is only limited by the quality of the background vacuum. We anticipate that this method can be experimentally demonstrated in Earth-bound microgravity platforms or space missions, eventually leading to storage times of minutes and unprecedented time-bandwidth products of 1010.

TI Removing leakage-induced correlated errors in superconducting quantum
   error correction
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computing can become scalable through error correction, but logical error rates only decrease with system size when physical errors are sufficiently uncorrelated. During computation, unused high energy levels of the qubits can become excited, creating leakage states that are long-lived and mobile. Particularly for superconducting transmon qubits, this leakage opens a path to errors that are correlated in space and time. Here, we report a reset protocol that returns a qubit to the ground state from all relevant higher level states. We test its performance with the bit-flip stabilizer code, a simplified version of the surface code for quantum error correction. We investigate the accumulation and dynamics of leakage during error correction. Using this protocol, we find lower rates of logical errors and an improved scaling and stability of error suppression with increasing qubit number. This demonstration provides a key step on the path towards scalable quantum computing. Correlated errors coming from leakage out of the computational subspace are an obstacle to fault-tolerant superconducting circuits. Here, the authors use a multi-level reset protocol to improve the performances of a bit-flip error correcting code by reducing the magnitude of correlations.

TI Hamiltonian quantum gates-energetic advantage from
   entangleability
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Hamiltonian quantum gates controlled by classical electromagnetic fields form the basis of any realistic model of quantum computers. In this letter, we derive a lower bound on the field energy required to implement such gates and relate this energy to the expected gate error. We study the entangleability (ability to entangle qubits) of Hamiltonians and highlight how this feature of quantum gates can provide a means for more energetically efficient computation. Ultimately, we show that a universal quantum computer can be realized with vanishingly low energetic requirements but at the expense of arbitrarily large complexity.

TI Hybrid Quantum Nanophotonics-Interfacing Color Center in Nanodiamonds
   with Si3N4-Photonics
SO PROGRESS IN NANOPHOTONICS 7
SE Topics in Applied Physics
AB This chapter covers recent developments in the field of hybrid quantum photonics based on color centers in nanodiamonds and Si3N4-photonics towards a technology platform with applications in quantum information processing and quantum information distribution. The methodological approach can be divided in three main tasks. First, the fabrication and optimization of Si3N4-photonics. Second, the creation, characterization and control of color centers in nanodiamonds. Third, the assembly of hybrid quantum photonics by integrating the nanodiamonds into the photonic structures. One focus will be the efficient interfacing of the color centers done by optimizing the optical coupling. The chapter describes recent progress in all three steps and summarizes the established hybrid platform. We believe, that the hybrid approach provides a promising path to realize quantum photonic applications, such as quantum networks or quantum repeaters, in the near future.

TI Experimental Integration of Quantum Key Distribution and Post-Quantum
   Cryptography in a Hybrid Quantum-Safe Cryptosystem
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are the two counter measures against cryptographic attacks via quantum computing. While QKD offers information theoretic security but limited authentication scalability, PQC facilitates scalable authentication in high density networks but is not information theoretic secure. Therefore, an ideal quantum-safe framework should efficiently leverage the complementarity of both techniques. However, despite growing efforts in integrating both, current realizations have focused on channel authentication, and a complete cryptosystem addressing both hybrid authentication and hybrid key exchange is yet to be demonstrated. Here, an authenticated hybrid key exchange protocol is introduced that incorporates PQC and QKD in a modular and information-theoretic secure architecture. The quantum-safe protocol is inherently resilient to catastrophic cryptographic failures and provides both forward and post-compromise security. As proof-of-concept implementation, the cryptosystem on a QKD hardware prototype is integrated, with the QKD processing, PQC key exchange and secret state masking via physical unclonable functions (PUFs) all running on a single field programmable gate array (FPGA). This work paves the way for the deployment of versatile and modular quantum-safe networks that exploit the complementarity of PQC and QKD.
   By leveraging the complementarity of Quantum, Post-Quantum, and Classical Cryptography, the authors design a modular Hybrid Authenticated Cryptosystem with advanced features of forward security and post-compromise security. In its optimal instantiation, the protocol is information theoretic secure for both authentication and key exchange. A proof-of-concept implementation is provided experimentally using a commercial-grade QKD system, where the post-quantum KEM algorithm is implemented in hardware on the same FPGA that runs the QKD functions. image

TI Entanglement Request Scheduling in Quantum Datacenter Networks
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB In Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC), reliable entanglement distribution across a network of quantum computers is crucial. During the quantum program compilation process, the timing and locations of required entanglement resources can be determined. Leveraging this information, we use the properties of quantum network hardware-specifically, the entanglement generation and quantum switch operation rates-to optimize quantum job execution schedules. This work presents a system that, given a set of quantum programs, extracts an Entaglement Demand Schedule (EDS) and generates an execution plan, including resource allocation tables and switch control instructions. We outline the system architecture and benchmark its performance using collections of randomized quantum programs, and describe further steps to enhance our system.

TI Quantum Fourier transform for nanoscale quantum sensing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The quantum Fourier transformation (QFT) is a key building block for a whole wealth of quantum algorithms. Despite its proven efficiency, only a few proof-of-principle demonstrations have been reported. Here we utilize QFT to enhance the performance of a quantum sensor. We implement the QFT algorithm in a hybrid quantum register consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin and three nuclear spins. The QFT runs on the nuclear spins and serves to process the sensor-i.e., the NV electron spin signal. Specifically, we show the application of QFT for correlation spectroscopy, where the long correlation time benefits the use of the QFT in gaining maximum precision and dynamic range at the same time. We further point out the ability for demultiplexing the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals using QFT and demonstrate precision scaling with the number of used qubits. Our results mark the application of a complex quantum algorithm in sensing which is of particular interest for high dynamic range quantum sensing and nanoscale NMR spectroscopy experiments.

TI Non-Markovian noise mitigation in quantum teleportation: enhancing
   fidelity and entanglement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Maintaining quantum coherence and entanglement in the presence of environmental noise, particularly within non-Markovian contexts, represents a significant challenge for the progression of quantum information science and technology. This study offers a substantial advancement by investigating the dynamics of a two-qubit system subjected to diverse noise conditions, encompassing relaxation, dephasing, and their cumulative effects. By employing quantum-state-diffusion equations specifically crafted for non-Markovian environments, we introduce an innovative strategy to counteract the detrimental influences of environmental noise on quantum teleportation fidelity and entanglement concurrence. Our results underscore the potential for external interventions to markedly improve the resilience of quantum information processing tasks over prolonged durations, especially in settings where dephasing noise prevails. A key revelation is the intricate relationship between dephasing noise and the initial state of entanglement, which profoundly impacts the occurrence of entanglement sudden death. This research not only deepens our comprehension of quantum system dynamics under noisy circumstances but also furnishes practical directives for engineering robust quantum systems, a necessity for the development of scalable quantum technologies.

TI Reducing classical communication costs in multiplexed quantum repeaters
   using hardware-aware quasi-local policies
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Future quantum networks will have nodes equipped with multiple quantum memories, allowing for multiplexing and entanglement distillation strategies for long-distance entanglement distribution. In this work, we focus on quasi-local policies for multiplexed quantum repeater chains. In fully-local policies, nodes use the knowledge of only their own states, whereas more efficient global policies use knowledge of the entire network state. The classical communication costs of using this knowledge have not been explored in existing literature. We show that quasi-local policies not only obtain improved performance over local policies, but also reduce classical communication costs considerably. Our policies also outperform the widely studied nested purification and doubling policy in practical parameter regimes. We identify parameter regimes where distillation is useful and address the question: "Should we distill before swapping, or vice versa?" Finally, we propose an implementation scheme for a multiplexed repeater chain, experimentally demonstrate the key element, a high-dimensional biphoton frequency comb, and evaluate its anticipated performance using our multiplexing-based policies.

SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In order to bring quantum networks into the real world, we would like to determine the requirements of quantum network protocols including the underlying quantum hardware. Because detailed architecture proposals are generally too complex for mathematical analysis, it is natural to employ numerical simulation. Here we introduce NetSquid, the NETwork Simulator for QUantum Information using Discrete events, a discrete-event based platform for simulating all aspects of quantum networks and modular quantum computing systems, ranging from the physical layer and its control plane up to the application level. We study several use cases to showcase NetSquid's power, including detailed physical layer simulations of repeater chains based on nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond as well as atomic ensembles. We also study the control plane of a quantum switch beyond its analytically known regime, and showcase NetSquid's ability to investigate large networks by simulating entanglement distribution over a chain of up to one thousand nodes.
   Implementing large-scale quantum networks is one of the challenges at the core of quantum communication. Here, the authors present NetSquid, a quantum network simulator that allows studying how such networks can be built, including physical hardware modelling, modularity, scalability, and examples.

The dynamics of the composite system is governed by the Schrodinger equation which generates positive operator-valued measure (POVM) for the system dynamics. We construct a quantum channel generating the non-commutative graph as a linear envelope of the POVM. The idea is based on applying a generalized version of a quantum channel using the apparatus of von Neumann algebras. The results are analyzes for a non-commutative graph generated by a qubit interacting with quantum oscillator. For this model the quantum anticlique which determines the error correcting subspace has an explicit expression.

TI A hybrid-qudit representation of digital RGB images
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum image processing is an emerging topic in the field of quantum information and technology. In this paper, we propose a new quantum image representation of RGB images with deterministic image retrieval, which is an improvement over all the similar existing representations in terms of using minimum resource. We use two entangled quantum registers constituting of total 7 qutrits to encode the color channels and their intensities. Additionally, we generalize the existing encoding methods by using both qubits and qutrits to encode the pixel positions of a rectangular image. This hybrid-qudit approach aligns well with the current progress of NISQ devices in incorporating higher dimensional quantum systems than qubits. We then describe the image encoding method using higher-order qubit-qutrit gates, and demonstrate the decomposition of these gates in terms of simpler elementary gates. We use the Google Cirq's quantum simulator to verify the image preparation in both the ideal noise-free scenario and in presence of realistic noise modelling. We show that the complexity of the image encoding process is linear in the number of pixels. Lastly, we discuss the image compression and some basic RGB image processing protocols using our representation.

TI Hybrid entanglement and bit-flip error correction in a scalable quantum
   network node
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Recent efforts have succeeded in producing quantum networks in which quantum information can be stored, transferred and processed across multiple nodes on a metropolitan scale. A key remaining challenge is to enhance the capabilities of individual nodes, providing precise and robust control over multiple qubits. Here we demonstrate coherent control in a hybrid quantum node based on a diamond colour centre. We entangle three types of qubit: an electron spin as an interface qubit, a nuclear spin with long memory time and a flying photonic qubit. These qubits' frequencies span three distinct regimes, from the optical to the radio-frequency domain. By incorporating two additional nuclear spins, we encode three memory qubits into a logical state using a repetition code and entangle this logical qubit with a photonic qubit. We repeatedly read out the error syndromes of memory qubits using the electron interface qubit, then apply real-time feedback operations to correct bit-flip errors. We perform our protocol for up to 12 rounds and demonstrate an improvement in the logical-photonic joint state population compared with its uncorrected counterpart. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of several key functionalities required for quantum repeaters to operate in full-fledged quantum networks.

TI A Distributed Architecture for Secure Delegated Quantum Computation
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we propose a distributed secure delegated quantum computation protocol, by which an almost classical client can delegate a (dk)-qubit quantum circuit to d quantum servers, where each server is equipped with a 2k-qubit register that is used to process only k qubits of the delegated quantum circuit. None of servers can learn any information about the input and output of the computation. The only requirement for the client is that he or she has ability to prepare four possible qubits in the state of (vertical bar 0 > + e(i theta )vertical bar 1 >) / root 2, where theta is an element of {0, pi/2, pi, 3 pi/2}. The only requirement for servers is that each pair of them share some entangled states (vertical bar 0 > vertical bar+> + vertical bar 1 > vertical bar->) / root 2 as ancillary qubits. Instead of assuming that all servers are interconnected directly by quantum channels, we introduce a third party in our protocol that is designed to distribute the entangled states between those servers. This would simplify the quantum network because the servers do not need to share a quantum channel. In the end, we show that our protocol can guarantee unconditional security of the computation under the situation where all servers, including the third party, are honest-but-curious and allowed to cooperate with each other.

TI Variational Quantum Circuits for Machine Learning. An Application for
   the Detection of Weak Signals
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application Quantum classifier to detect weak signals. Quantum computing is a new paradigm for a multitude of computing applications. This study presents the technologies that are currently available for the physical implementation of qubits and quantum gates, establishing their main advantages and disadvantages and the available frameworks for programming and implementing quantum circuits. One of the main applications for quantum computing is the development of new algorithms for machine learning. In this study, an implementation of a quantum circuit based on support vector machines (SVMs) is described for the resolution of classification problems. This circuit is specially designed for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers that are currently available. As an experiment, the circuit is tested on a real quantum computer based on superconducting qubits for an application to detect weak signals of the future. Weak signals are indicators of incipient changes that will have a future impact. Even for experts, the detection of these events is complicated since it is too early to predict this impact. The data obtained with the experiment shows promising results but also confirms that ongoing technological development is still required to take full advantage of quantum computing.

TI Security and Fairness in Multiparty Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a cryptographic protocol that leverages quantum mechanics to distribute a secret among multiple parties. With respect to the classical counterpart, in QSS, the secret is encoded into quantum states and shared by a dealer such that only an authorized subsets of participants, i.e., the players, can reconstruct it. Several state-of-the-art studies aim to transpose classical secret sharing into the quantum realm, while maintaining their reliance on traditional network topologies (e.g., star, ring, and fully connected), and require that all the n players calculate the secret. These studies exploit the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, which is a type of maximally entangled quantum state involving three or more qubits. However, none of these works account for redundancy, enhanced security/privacy features, or authentication mechanisms able to fingerprint players. To address these gaps, in this article, we introduce a new concept of QSS, which leans on a generic distributed quantum network, based on a threshold scheme, where all the players collaborate also to the routing of quantum information among them. The dealer, by exploiting a custom flexible weighting system, takes advantage of a newly defined quantum Dijkstra algorithm to select the most suitable subset of t players, out of the entire set on n players, to involve in the computation. To fingerprint and authenticate users, CRYSTAL-Kyber primitives are adopted, while also protecting each player's privacy by hiding their identities. We show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed protocol by testing it against the main classical and quantum attacks, thereby improving the state-of-the-art security measures.

TI Hardware-optimal quantum algorithms
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum hardware is inherently fragile and noisy. We find that the accuracy of traditional quantum error correction algorithms can be improved depending on the hardware. Given different hardware specifications, we automatically synthesize hardware-optimal algorithms for parity correction, qubit resetting, and GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) state preparation. Using stochastic techniques from computer science, our method presents a computational tool to compute exact accuracy guarantees and synthesize optimal algorithms that are often different from traditional ones. We also show that improvements can be gained with respect to the Qiskit transpiler as we compute the hardware-optimal qubit mapping for the GHZ state-preparation problem.

TI Fast pseudorandom quantum state generators via inflationary quantum
   gates
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a mechanism for reaching pseudorandom quantum states, computationally indistinguishable from Haar random, with shallow log-n depth quantum circuits, where n is the number of qudits. We argue that log n \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\log n$$\end{document} depth 2-qubit-gate-based generic random quantum circuits that are claimed to provide a lower bound on the speed of information scrambling, cannot produce computationally pseudorandom quantum states. This conclusion is connected with the presence of polynomial (in n) tails in the stay probability of short Pauli strings that survive evolution through such shallow circuits. We show, however, that stay-probability-tails can be eliminated and pseudorandom quantum states can be accomplished with shallow log n \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\log n$$\end{document} depth circuits built from a special universal family of "inflationary" quantum (IQ) gates. We prove that IQ-gates cannot be implemented with 2-qubit gates, but can be realized either as a subset of 2-qudit-gates in U(d 2) with d >= 3 and d prime, or as special 3-qubit gates.
